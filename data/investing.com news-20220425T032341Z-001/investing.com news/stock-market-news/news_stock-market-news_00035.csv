It will now conduct term operations totaling $365 billion, the New York Fed said on its website. The Dec. 16 operation is a 32-day offering with a maximum limit of $50 billion, while the other term actions range from 13 to 15 days with a maximum size of $35 billion, tenors it has used previously.
The central bank also plans to adjust the size of some of its overnight repo operations to provide additional liquidity for year-end. While the offering size will remain mostly unchanged at $120 billion, it plans to conduct a one-day forward settlement operation of $75 billion on Dec. 30 that settles on Dec. 31 and matures Jan. 2. The New York Fed will also increase the sizes of the overnight actions to $150 billion on Dec. 31 and Jan. 2.
The Fed has been conducting repo offerings and Treasury-bill purchases in a bid to keep control of short-term interest rates and bolster bank reserves. And while that has calmed markets since the September spike that took overnight repo rates as high as 10%, concerns about the year-end period remain and participants have been flocking to Fed term offerings that will carry them through to January.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday the central bank stands ready to adjust details of its repo operations as appropriate to keep the fed funds rate within the central bank’s target range.
The New York Fed also announced its plans for Treasury-bill buying that it’s conducting as part of its reserve management regime, keeping the pace of purchases unchanged at $60 billion per month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's next big move will be lower, which could lead to a significant fall in U.S. bond prices and a slew of downgrades, Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital said on Tuesday.
Gundlach, who oversees around $147 billion of assets under management, said in an investor webcast that he only sees a 35% chance of a U.S. recession in 2020, but believes that when a downturn does hit, the weaker dollar will drive foreign investors out of U.S. corporate debt. 
Low yields globally have pushed investors into riskier assets and led to the ballooning of BBB-rated credit, the lowest possible investment-grade rating. The decline in quality of U.S. credit poses the biggest risk to bond investors today, said Gundlach. 
Gundlach said he expects the Treasury yield curve to steepen in the coming year, with the two-year yield anchored by a pause in the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts. He does not expect further rate cuts in the first half of 2020. 
A 2020 electoral victory for U.S. President Donald Trump is DoubleLine's base case scenario, said Gundlach, in part because of the weakness of the Democratic party's candidates for office.

State and local government debt sales may surge to a record in 2020, extending this year’s boom, as borrowing costs hold near the lowest in over half a century, according to forecasts from some of the market’s biggest underwriters. That marks a welcome shift for banks that saw bond work dry up in 2018 after President Donald Trump signed legislation that blocked new tax-exempt debt sales for a major type of refinancing known as an advance refunding.
But with rates now so low, local governments can even refinance their debts by selling taxable bonds and still come out ahead, causing a surge in issuance that’s expected to continue. Every analyst surveyed by Bloomberg expects municipal-bond sales to rise next year even after the 24% jump so far in 2019.
Loop Capital and Hilltop Securities are the most optimistic underwriters in the $3.8 trillion municipal market, expecting sales to reach $450 billion. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., the biggest underwriter, anticipates about $430 billion of debt will be issued. That would exceed the record $425 billion sold in 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Nobody was really expecting all these taxable advance refundings -- and here they come, in large numbers,” Chris Mier, chief strategist at Loop Capital, said in an interview.
Along with the supply surge, most analysts surveyed by Bloomberg see muted returns in 2020, given the strong performance this year as the Fed cut interest rates and mutual funds received a record influx of cash. Overall, state and local debt returned 7.6% in 2019, the biggest gain in five years, while the riskiest securities delivered 11% gains.
Key Insights
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts led by Vikram Rai estimate that $95 billion of the new debt sales will be taxable securities, with a “meager” $345 billion of tax-exempt sales, well below the trend from 2015 to 2017Thomas McLoughlin, UBS’s head of municipal bonds, said voter approval of most of the largest bond issues on ballots in the November 2019 election bolsters his 2020 supply outlook. “Barring an abrupt increase in Treasury yields,” refinancing transactions can continue, he saidTom Kozlik, head of municipals at Hilltop Securities, anticipates a “record amount” of municipal debt in 2020, with $297 billion in new money sales for infrastructure improvements and $153 billion of refinancingsJeffrey Lipton, head of municipal research at Oppenheimer & Co., said his forecast of $420 billion to $440 billion in supply could be “tempered by issuer concerns over economic growth expectations and election-year rhetoric.” He maintains that munis should have a positive performance, forecasting “modest single digit returns” in the range of 3% to 5%Municipal Market Analytics doesn’t see annual issuance dropping below $400 billion in any of the next five years. Unless there’s an unexpected material rise in interest rates, “there is more upside than down to these numbers, particularly in the out years as more state and local issuers sell bonds for water and transportation projects and to address local economic vulnerabilities from climate change,” said Matt Fabian, a partner at the firm Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc analysts led by Mikhail Foux advised clients that “the best days are behind us, and municipal returns in 2020 will be much more subdued.” Investment-grade securities will return about 2% to 2.5% and high-yield bonds 3% to 3.5%, he wroteBloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Kazatsky estimates that the supply of new debt will be easily absorbed, projecting that it would take about $460 billion to meet current demand, given the amount of cash flowing into mutual funds and the approximately $371 billion of interest and principal payments that investors will receive"

“We are in an environment where the playbook to kick off the year reads like a rinse and repeat from past years,” CIBC Capital Markets’ energy team said in a note to clients. The team added that “it’s also one that doesn’t require anyone to be a hero or to take on more heartburn than is necessary.”
The energy sector is the worst-performing group this year, up a mere 3% versus the S&P 500 Index’s rise of over 25%. Canada’s energy gauge has advanced about 12% against Toronto’s stock market gain of about 18%. Crude oil has outpaced both indices during the same period.
A slightly positive tilt is creeping into analyst forecasts, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recently turning “more sanguine” on the exploration & production sector, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) sees a trade in oil service stocks having “legs” after persistent weakness. Still, analysts are favoring larger-cap firms before diving all in. One of Wall Street’s top strategists highlighted the potential for energy equities to rebound, as cyclical segments of the market could present an opportunity.
Capital discipline, the central mantra in which drillers are living by, remains a key focus point for investors. Shale pioneers see output growth slowing next year, which could be a positive for macro commodity prices. Merger and acquisition potential in the E&P sector exists, but higher oil prices will be needed to revive deals given a “clouded fundamental backdrop,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
Here are some analysts picks on various sub-sectors:
Citi’s top oilfield service picks for 2020 are Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co., Nextier Oilfield Solutions, Chart Industries, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Select Energy Services and Liberty Oilfield Services. The bank thinks the oilfield service space has started to “turn the corner.”Morgan Stanley’s top E&P and integrated oil picks include ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP),  Noble Energy  (NYSE:NBL) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX). “The 2020 backdrop continues to favor large-cap and globally diversified companies,” the bank said in a note.CIBC Capital Markets likes oil-sands firms including Suncor Energy, and pipeline stocks such as TC Energy. “Our top ideas for the coming year might seem somewhat mundane, but we view them as logical and the right place in which to allocate capital,” the bank wrote to clients in a note.BMO Capital Markets favors Canadian energy firms relative to their neighbors down south as the northern group “appears to have largely addressed the lower for longer price environment, by restoring profitability even at these depressed prices,” Brian Belski said in a note.See also:

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co said on Thursday it had reached a confidential compensation agreement with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co for a portion of a projected $830 million hit to operating income in 2019 arising from the grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft.
The airline, the world's largest 737 MAX operator, said it would share with its employees proceeds of about $125 million from Boeing.
Southwest said it continues to discuss with Boeing further compensation related to the MAX grounding, adding that the details of the talks and the settlement were confidential. Boeing declined to make an immediate comment.
Southwest, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and United Airlines Holdings Inc are scheduling flights without use of the aircraft until early March 2020, nearly a year since the plane was grounded after crashes killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Steve Dickson confirmed on Wednesday the agency will not unground the MAX before the end of 2019.
Speaking at a Wings Club event, Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said the March date was based on FAA approval in December and would likely need to be pushed back again.
American and United remain in discussions with Boeing about compensation. American has 24 MAX aircraft and had expected 40 by the end of 2019. American has said it expects to be compensated by Boeing.
""The missed deadlines and extended grounding have hurt our customers, our team members and our shareholders,"" American spokesman Ross Feinstein said. ""We are working to ensure that Boeing’s shareholders bear the cost of Boeing’s failures.""
United declined comment.
With its 34 MAX jets parked and 41 more expected in 2019 still pending delivery, Southwest has scaled back growth plans and canceled more than 100 daily flights.
Once the jets are flying again, Kelly said he has a clear route strategy with plans to boost service to Denver, Houston and Baltimore. The carrier launched flights to Hawaii this year.
In a statement about the settlement, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association said the agreement ""doesn't get anywhere close to compensating"" the losses its pilots and other employees have experienced. The union, which filed a lawsuit against Boeing alleging over $100 million in lost wages from the grounding, said it will continue to pursue legal action.
Federal officials told Reuters the FAA is not expected to authorize the plane to fly until January at the earliest, though some U.S. officials think Dickson will not give the green light until February at earliest.

""Hopefully we'll have a clean start in 2021,"" Kelly said.

The S&P 500 pushed higher as Trump met with trade advisers on a deal that could be announced as soon as today, according to people briefed on the plans. The relentless trade drama continued to dominate sentiment on American equity markets, whipsawing equities ahead of Sunday’s tariff deadline.
The trade tweets are the latest in what have been months of public proclamations by Trump’s administration that a deal with China is within striking distance even as the president has threatened to walk away from any pact. The negotiations via tweet come three days before his plan to escalate the trade war unless at least a partial deal is reached.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair's outgoing chief operations officer Peter Bellew considered himself a ""dead man walking"" after a March performance review and resigned after being ordered to work at the airline's Austrian business, he said on Thursday.
Bellew was speaking in court during a case brought by Ryanair (I:RYA) to delay him joining rival easyJet (L:EZJ) for 12 months until 2021. Ryanair has said Bellew possesses information of competitive value covered by a non-compete clause.
Former Malaysia Airlines boss Bellew denies he is subject to the clause and plans to start working with the British airline at the start of next year after working out a six-month notice period.
The court hearings, which have gone on for longer than the four days initially expected, have included assessments of Bellew's performance and an accusation, rejected by Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, that Bellew was bullied.
Bellew, who was being questioned by his own counsel and Ryanair's, said ""shouting and screaming"" by O'Leary during weekly management meetings indicated that O'Leary was not entirely happy with his performance.
But Bellew said he was ""absolutely shocked and devastated"" when O'Leary at a March 2019 annual performance review said that his position as Chief Operations Officer would be reviewed after 12 months unless his performance significantly improved.
Bellew told the court that he understood that to mean he was a ""dead man walking.""
""I know Michael O'Leary very well and I know when he writes something like that, that's what he means,"" Bellew told the court. O'Leary last week denied he was trying to force Bellew out, saying if he wanted him out he would have removed him.
Bellew told the court he did not make a final decision to leave the company for several months, assuming that what he described as dramatic improvements in operations due to changes he had undertaken in ground operations, pilot numbers and engineering would be noticed.
He finally decided to leave in July after he had been made an offer by easyJet.
The final straw was when O'Leary took Bellew into his office and told him he wanted him to spend six months addressing issues at Austrian subsidiary Lauadamotion in Vienna, where he has spent much of the past six months.
Bellew said he was devastated that he felt he had to leave as he had planned to stay at Ryanair until retirement.
Bellew told the court that he felt the 2018 share option scheme, which contains the non-compete clause Ryanair is trying to enforce, was obsolete as deterioration in company performance and share price meant it was unlikely to vest.
Most other senior executives were offered a replacement scheme in 2019, but Ryanair says the 2018 scheme is still operable.
Bellew said information he had regarding how Ryanair operates would be of limited use to easyJet as Ryanair operates in a ""unique way"" and discloses its costs publicly in its annual accounts."

Citing industry checks and a SemiAccurate report, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said Intel could face further delays of its 10nm Ice Lake Xeon Scalable Processor.
Intel has previously insisted that it will not miss its own pledge to deliver the Ice Lake chips by the holiday season of 2019. But the company recently conceded that challenges remained to increase output even as it had invested ""record levels"" of capital expenditure to drive up production of both its 14nm and 10nm chips.
""However, sustained market growth in 2019 has outpaced our efforts and exceeded third-party forecasts. Supply remains extremely tight in our PC business where we are operating with limited inventory buffers,"" GM of sales, marketing and communications, Michelle Johnston Holthaus said in last month.
The 10nm chip was intended to ship by 2016, but production was put on ice after the tech company ran into manufacturing problems that delayed production of its 14nm chips. 
The delay has seen Intel cede market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in the low-end mobile and desktop PC market.
The tech giant reported that third-quarter CPU revenue fell 7.1% year on year to $8.4 billion and its notebook and desktop platform volumes fell 10% and 11% respectively.
Intel, however, rose 0.6% benefitting from a broad-based rally in semiconductor stocks, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 2% after President Donald Trump said a deal with China was ""very close.""

As interest rates have fallen to record lows, many French households have binged on cheap credit to buy a home or refinance previous loans, driving up house prices and debt burdens to record levels.
Mortgage lending has grown at nearly 7% in a year, higher than almost any other euro zone country, according to data from the European Central Bank and the Bank of France.
The High Council for Financial Stability (HCFS) urged banks not to allow borrowers to take on debt that represented more than 33% of their revenue and to give out fixed-rate mortgage loans with a duration of no more than 25 years.
It said it could demand banks set aside more capital on new loans that failed to comply with the guidelines.
The council said in October that some French banks were loosening lending standards to win market share in the competitive mortgage market."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine markets had a tempered reaction on Thursday with bond prices up, risk spreads down and the peso stable after Economy Minister Martin Guzman laid out his vision for handling the debt crisis in Latin America's No. 3 economy.
The peso was flat at 59.82 per dollar while country risk fell 59 basis points to 2,082, according to JP Morgan's emerging Markets Bond Index Plus .
Over-the-counter bonds rose 1%, with dollar-denominated paper leading the way after a late Wednesday news conference in which Guzman promised a constructive stance in restructuring talks with bond holders under Argentina's new Peronist administration.
Guzman called Argentina's economy ""extremely fragile"" and said the country will have to grow its way out of its ""virtual default.""
He promoted a production-oriented agenda over more public spending cuts and said he planned to create an advisory commission to assess debt sustainability. His position aligned with that of new President Alberto Fernandez, who previously said he wanted to meet the country's debt obligations, but that the economy first needed to grow.
Guzman, a 37-year-old academic with close ties to American economist Joseph Stiglitz, must navigate restructuring talks with bondholders and the International Monetary Fund under its $57 billion standby loan agreement.
An IMF spokesman said on Thursday that it needs details about Argentina's economic plans before discussing any debt restructuring.
Some analysts indicated that Guzman's initial comments came as no surprise to investors, but that they were waiting for him to fill in the blanks on plans to generate cash flow and set repayment terms for bondholders.
Nikhil Sanghani, a London-based economist at Capital Economics, said he was encouraged by Guzman's amicable tone with creditors, but said the question of haircuts still lingered.
""There remains a lot of uncertainty over his approach to a debt restructuring and whether haircuts will be imposed on private creditors,"" Sanghani told Reuters.
""For our part, we continue to see little upside for bond prices as we think that a large debt write-down will be required to put Argentina’s public debt onto a sustainable path, and this approach is likely to be endorsed by the IMF."""

The S&P 500 remained higher but traded well off session highs as investors weighed whether Donald Trump and China will reach a partial deal to avoid tariffs due Sunday. A tweet from CNBC indicated that China may not agree to fixed farm purchases the U.S. is demanding in return for tariff relief. The index surged to a record earlier after the president tweeted that he’s “very close” to a deal. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked higher and the dollar rose.
The tweets are the latest in what’s been months of public proclamations by Trump’s administration that a deal with China is within striking distance. It comes three days before his plan to escalate the trade war unless at least a partial deal is reached. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held rates steady and signaled hikes remain unlikely, fueling bets that the economy will be strong enough to continue its solid expansion.
The gain in American stocks pushed the MSCI All-Country index to its first record since January 2018.
“People are finally recognizing that the U.S. is winning this trade war and corporate CEOs are going to begin to recognize that the U.S. economy is strong enough and is able to function well enough even with the current level of tariffs,” said Charlie Smith, founding partner and chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
In Europe, the central bank said it would maintain bond buying and keep rates low until it gets near its inflation goal. The euro rose and bonds in the region slipped. The Swiss franc nudged higher after the central bank left rates unchanged.
Earlier in the day, equities in Hong Kong and Seoul outperformed, while they slipped in Tokyo, Shanghai and Sydney. The Hong Kong dollar climbed into the stronger half of its trading band against the greenback for the first time since July. In the Middle East,  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) shares jumped for a second day, pushing the oil giant’s value beyond the $2 trillion mark.
Elsewhere, oil futures rose. The lira gained as the Turkish central bank delivered another interest-rate cut that exceeded forecasts.

A spokesman for Sweden's prosecution authority confirmed to Reuters that a preliminary investigation had been opened but had no further comment.
An Ericsson spokeswoman declined to comment.
Earlier this month, Ericsson agreed to pay more that $1 billion to resolve the investigations in the United States and admitted it had conspired with others to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from at least 2000 to 2016 by engaging in a scheme to pay bribes and to falsify its books.
Dagens Industri said the anti-corruption unit at Sweden's prosecution authority had assisted in the U.S. investigation and information had come to light that had prompted a preliminary investigation in Sweden.
""I can confirm that a preliminary investigation has been going on for a while at the national anti-corruption unit regarding suspected bribery,"" Martin Bresman, the deputy chief prosecutor wrote in a mail to Dagens Industri.
In the U.S. case, the Department of Justice said that Ericsson had engaged in bribery over many years in countries including China, Vietnam and Djibouti.
The total charges include a criminal penalty of more than $520 million, plus $540 million to be paid to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a related matter."
23,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>","Trade deal hopes, upbeat Lagarde lift euro zone bond yields","By Dhara Ranasinghe and Yoruk Bahceli
(Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields rose sharply on Thursday after the United States and China appeared close to a trade deal and the European Central Bank's new president Christine Lagarde said the bloc was headed for a slow and steady economic recovery next year. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said on the United States was ""very close"" to nailing down a trade deal with China. ""Getting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China,"" Trump posted on Twitter. ""They want it, and so do we.""
U.S. negotiators have offered to cut existing tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese goods by as much as 50%, and suspend tariffs due to go into effect on Dec. 15, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The trade news came in after ECB chief Lagarde said that risks to the economy had somewhat eased in her press conference leading the bank. 
Germany's 10-year bund yield was last up 6 basis points at -0.26%, its highest level in over a week (DE10YT=RR) after touching a one-week low at -0.34% when Lagarde initially said the outlook for inflation remained subdued. 
Italy's 10-year bond yield rose 2 bps - increasing for the first time in a week - after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte saying Italy would not agree a reform of the euro zone's bailout fund unless it was part of a broader package. Prior to the ECB meeting it had hit two-week lows around 1.27%.
The big rise in yields is linked to the tariff cuts, said Natixis strategist Jean-Christophe Machado. But he added that the market was showing a big reaction on a rumor, adding: ""we will wait for some real agreement before being too optimistic on our side.""
The trade news came in after Lagarde said that geopolitics, protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets had skewed risks to the downside, but those risks were less pronounced than before.
While this kicked off the rise in bond yields on Thursday, ""really there's not a great deal to be interpreted from what she said, with the latest economic forecasts little changed,"" said Chris Scicluna, Daiwa Capital Markets' head of economic research.
(GRAPHIC: Markets react to new ECB chief - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9890/9802/ecb121219.png) 
Lagarde said that the ECB expects to begin in January a strategic review of how it does business and to conclude it by the end of 2020.
She added that there was ""no pre-conceived landing zone"" for the review, which analysts say will set the tone for monetary policy in the years ahead. 
Analysts said that Lagarde stressed the need to find consensus on a board deeply split by the September decision to resume asset purchases. 
""I think the market is taking the fact that she's noncommittal on policy as a shift towards the hawks - at least the hawks won't be as suppressed under Lagarde as they were under (former chief Mario) Draghi,"" said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING. ""This explains the selloff we're getting in Bunds now.""

""So the reaction from the ECB could be understood a little bit more hawkish by the market,"" he added.

24,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 11:46AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco Set to Pay Banks Only $64 Million for Record IPO,"(Bloomberg) --  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) is poised to pay a combined $64 million to the banks that arranged the world’s largest initial public offering, a letdown for the Wall Street firms that pitched aggressively for a spot on the deal, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The state oil giant plans to pay the top local banks on the deal -- known as joint global coordinators -- 39 million riyals ($10.4 million) apiece, according to the people. The top foreign banks on the deal are set to each get 13 million riyals, or the equivalent of $3.5 million, the people said.
Aramco raised $25.6 billion in its share sale, which became a local affair after foreign fund managers shunned its premium valuation. The total fee amount, which represents 0.25% of the funds raised, pales in comparison to other large deals. Chinese internet giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., which raised $25 billion in its 2014 IPO, paid about $300 million to its underwriters.
IPO banks globally earned average fees equal to 4.1% of the deal size this year, up from 3.6% last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Saudi Arabia didn’t need the Wall Street firms’ international networks after it scrapped roadshows outside the Middle East, turning instead to local retail buyers and wealthy families to shore up the deal. The foreign underwriters on the deal will barely make enough to cover their costs, Bloomberg News has reported.
Aramco will pay local banks serving as bookrunners, a more junior role, about 5 million riyals each while foreign banks in that position will be paid about 2 million riyals apiece, the people said. The company declined to comment.

26,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 10:58AM ET</span>","Prince Gets His $2 Trillion Aramco, But Victory Comes at a Cost","(Bloomberg) -- Almost four years after Mohammed bin Salman first said Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant was worth $2 trillion, the crown prince finally proved his point on Thursday.
On the second day of trading on Riyadh’s stock exchange,  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) surged -- briefly -- past his target. The valuation had become a matter of pride for Prince Mohammed, and he’s likely to claim victory over skeptical international investors who said the fair value for the world’s largest company is far lower.
“I know he is proud,” his half-brother and oil minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said in a TV interview after the shares were successfully allocated last week. “He made us all proud because he took good decisions. These decisions, you have seen it now, have brought us a 4.6 times over-subscription.”
When the international sales effort was ditched back in November, the crown prince, advised by Prince Abdulaziz and Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan, decided to press on without the global fund management industry and use local capital to get as close to $2 trillion as possible.
Reaching that mark took a major effort. Even before the international part of the share sale was all but abandoned, Aramco promised bumper dividends, minority shareholders were guaranteed payments at the state’s expense, and the company’s tax rates had been cut three times. The measures aimed at enhancing Aramco’s appeal, but as crude fluctuates, they may also undermine the stability of the oil revenues buttressing the kingdom’s economy.
Banks were told to relax lending limits to maximize subscriptions, the richest Saudi families were pressed to make large commitments, retail investors got bonus shares, the governments of neighboring allies Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates were asked to help, and the Saudi state even committed more than $2 billion of its own money.
Potential Trouble
The strategy worked, but it stores up potential trouble. Loans backed by Aramco shares are vulnerable to a drop in the share price, and the heavy reliance on local investors means the offering sucked up capital that could have found its way to other parts of the Saudi economy.
It also makes an international listing, a big part of the original plan, more difficult. Global investors already had a chance to invest in Aramco shares at 32 riyals and balked. There’s no reason to think they would change their minds given another opportunity to invest at a still higher valuation on a different exchange.
Aramco shares also look overvalued compared with other securities. At a market capitalization of $2 trillion, the dividend yield on Aramco shares is just 3.75%, based on the $75 billion a year in dividends the company has promised investors. That’s the same as the yield on Aramco’s bonds due in 2049 -- which entail less capital risk for investors -- and below the yield on long-dated Saudi government bonds.
It’s also a long way below what other large oil companies pay:  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).’s dividend yield is currently 5.1%, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc pays 6.8%. Even some Saudi companies provide better yields. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s Kingdom Holding Co. yields 6.8%, and Saudi Basic Industries Corp., which Aramco is acquiring, pays 4.9%.
“For investors who have benefited so far, we would take profit here,” analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. including Neil Beveridge and Oswald Clint said in a note on Thursday. “For those who have not, we would wait until a better entry point, which will inevitably come.”"

Andrea Enria estimated that the net impact of the ECB’s new approach would give banks an average of 90 basis points on capital relief, in relation to their common equity tier 1 ratio (the ECB’s preferred measure of financial strength).
The new approach, detailed under the EU’s Capital Requirement Directive V, would let banks met a bigger proportion of their overall capital requirements with subordinated debt instruments, which could if necessary be converted to equity by the regulator if a bank gets into trouble.

The company has been growing rapidly in the United States, the world's No.2 auto market, roughly doubling the number of vehicles sold over the past 6 years, thanks in part to a ramp-up in local production capacity and a marketing strategy focused mainly on affluent and liberal-minded consumers featuring slogans such as love and inclusion.
Japan's smallest automaker said that ongoing U.S. demand for its Forester and Outback models would likely boost overall sales in the country to 720,000 to 730,000 units next year, up by as much as 4.3% from the around 700,000 vehicles it expects to sell by the end of this year.
""We expect the U.S. market to slow only slightly next year, so we're planning to see more growth in our sales. We think we can achieve this,"" CEO Tomomi Nakamura told reporters in Tokyo.
He added that he saw room for the automaker to expand its share of the SUV market, which stands at around 7% at the moment, given that Subaru's SUV models outsell its sedan models, which include the Legacy and the Imprezza.
""If competition in the U.S. SUV market continues, that segment will keep growing even as the overall market slows,"" he said.
U.S. sales account for around 65% of Subaru's total global sales of around 1 million units. By the end of November, sales of the Forester this year had climbed 6.4% from a year ago, while sales of the Outback, its best-selling model in the country, were up 0.9%.
However, the rapid growth in the country has coincided with a jump in global quality-related issues which has sapped profitability in the past year or so."

The euro held steady and bonds in the region climbed as European policy makers kept rates unchanged.

He has set a vision on selling premium products in fast growing categories such as pet food and coffee, while disposing businesses in the slower growth areas of lunch meat and chocolate.
The 54-year-old German-American has promised to replace as much as 10% of Nestle's existing portfolio with products of the moment by the end of 2020, under pressure from activist investor Dan Loeb, who through his investment firm Third Point took an about $3 billion stake in Nestle in 2017. (https://reut.rs/34b1H2z)
In October, Schneider indicated he would not stop at the 10% target, calling the portfolio review an ""ongoing process.""
On Wednesday, Nestle agreed to sell for $4 billion its U.S. ice-cream business, which includes Haagen-Daazs, to Froneri - its ice-cream joint venture with private equity firm PAI partners.
Below is a summary of the top deals under Schneider's tenure:
2019:
* February - The company put its Herta lunch meat business up for sale. The business pulled in nearly $700 million in sales during 2018 and is still seeking buyers.
* May - Nestle to sell its skin health unit that makes Cetaphil and Proactiv skin care brands to private equity firm EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.1 billion). The business accounted for about 3% of group sales.
2018:
* January - Plans to sell its U.S. confectionary business to Ferrero for $2.8 billion, handing over control of brands Butterfinger, Crunch and Baby Ruth to the Italian manufacturer. The deal marked Schneider's first big sale and was another step to focus on healthier products. (https://reut.rs/2snYMX2)
* May - Enters into $7.2 billion deal to license U.S. coffee chain Starbucks Corp's (O:SBUX) packaged coffee globally.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nokia (HE:NOKIA), German carmaker Daimler and several car parts suppliers have agreed to independent mediation to resolve their technology licensing dispute, the Finnish telecoms equipment maker said on Thursday.
The move, if it leads to a successful outcome, could stave off a possible EU antitrust investigation following complaints by Daimler, Bury Technologies, Continental,  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Thales-owned  Gemalto  (AS:GTO) to the European Commission.
The Finnish telecoms equipment maker and Daimler have been at loggerheads on who should apply and pay royalties on technologies key to navigation to systems, vehicle communications and self-driving cars. 
""We expect the mediation to take place soon and look forward to constructive dialogue with all parties with the aim of reaching an amicable and definitive resolution,"" Nokia said in a statement.
It made the mediation proposal last week and also offered to negotiate with car parts makers instead of Daimler, a move welcomed by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Nokia's usual practice is to license its technologies at the car level, whereas Daimler says component makers should also be able to apply for them.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) will increase investment at its chip factory in China by $8 billion to boost production of NAND flash memory chips, Chinese media reported on Tuesday.
The South Korean group's investment comes as the memory market is expected to rebound next year because of limited supplies and rising demand for fifth-generation devices and networks.
Samsung is the world's largest maker of NAND flash memory chips, which can hold data permanently and are found in mobile devices, memory cards, USB flash drives and solid-state drives.
In 2017, Samsung announced that it would invest $7 billion over three years in its Xi'an plant that produces NAND flash memory chips.
Those investment phases follow an earlier $10.8 billion investment into a testing and packaging plant in Xi'an.
Samsung declined to comment.
Samsung's rivals in NAND flash memory include Korea's SK Hynix (KS:000660), U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc (O:MU), and Toshiba Corp (T:6502)
Several Chinese companies have attempted to enter the memory sector, though none has been successful enough to compete with overseas rivals.
This past autumn, Yangtze Memory Technologies Company (YMTC) announced it would begin mass producing 64-layer 3D NAND chips, the benchmark for most leading industry players."

(Reuters) - A U.S. government watchdog is raising fresh concerns that health insurers are exaggerating how sick Medicare patients are, receiving billions of dollars in improper payments as a result.
Health insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans to seniors and the disabled received an estimated $6.7 billion in 2017 after adding diagnoses to patients' files that were not supported by their medical records, according to a report released on Thursday by the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Inspector General's Office. 
Inspectors found that Medicare Advantage insurers had added diagnoses for diabetes, heart disease and other conditions in 99.3% of chart reviews of patient information, even though they did not appear in records from doctors, hospitals or other medical providers. Insurers deleted incorrect diagnoses less than 1% of the time, they found.
The additional diagnoses boosted government payments to insurers by an estimated $6.9 billion, while the deleted information trimmed payouts by nearly $200 million, producing a net benefit of $6.7 billion for the companies.
""We could not see any services with the diagnosis and that raised a number of concerns,"" Linda Ragone, a regional inspector general in Philadelphia and co-author of the report, said in a phone interview. ""There is a vulnerability here that needs to be addressed.""
The report highlighted a group of 4,616 Medicare Advantage enrollees for whom insurers added a diagnosis that resulted in a higher payment, even though there was no record of the person receiving any medical services during the year under review.
Medicare Advantage plans are privately-run alternatives to traditional Medicare. They served 22 million people – or 1 in 3 of those eligible for the government healthcare program – at a cost of $210 billion in 2018. 
The report did not identify specific insurers. UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH),  Humana Inc  (N:HUM) and CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) through its ownership of Aetna (NYSE:AET), are among the biggest sellers of Medicare Advantage plans. Together, the three companies have 54% of the market, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), an industry trade group, said the rate of improper payments in the Medicare Advantage program has been decreasing.
""Everyone agrees that Medicare Advantage payments must be fair and accurate, and we continue to work with (Medicare) to improve payment accuracy,"" said AHIP spokeswoman Kristine Grow.
The U.S. government pays Medicare Advantage insurers based on a risk score for each enrollee. The formula pays more for sicker patients, creating a financial incentive for insurers to inflate risk scores.
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should be doing more to prevent insurers from exploiting this vulnerability, the inspector general said.
In a Nov. 1 letter to the inspector general's office cited in the report, CMS challenged the $6.7 billion estimate of payments linked to chart reviews as too high. The agency agreed with the report's recommendations for increased oversight and audits.
CMS in a statement said it is ""committed to ensuring that Medicare Advantage plans submit accurate information to CMS so that payments to plans are appropriate.""

Prior to these findings, Medicare estimated it had made $40 billion in overpayments to insurers from 2013 to 2016 due to diagnoses submitted by health plans not supported by medical records.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Delta predicts 2020 profit growth; CEO says more people turning to air travel,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) sees another annual rise in profit and revenue in 2020 driven by what Chief Executive Ed Bastian called a growing interest in air travel by consumers across the generational spectrum.
""People are more inspired to travel,"" Bastian told Reuters ahead of the carrier's investor day, citing the increased affordability of flying and advances in social media and technology, even as environmental and ""flight-shaming"" activists threaten air travel growth in Europe.
Atlanta-based Delta is forecasting 2020 profit of $6.75 to $7.75 per share, versus analysts' mean estimate of $7.06 according to IBES data from Refinitiv, on revenue growth of 4% to 6% and $4 billion of free cash flow.
Still, Bastian said Delta's investors and customers are also increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of air travel and cited airlines' ability to protect the environment as an existential threat to their growth.
For 2020, the chief risk to Delta's earnings forecast is any deterioration in U.S. consumer health, he said.
On Wednesday, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said overall airline profit is on course to fall faster than it initially expected in 2019 as trade wars hit global commerce and broader confidence, though it predicted a modest recovery next year.
Delta's 2020 revenue target already takes into account uncertainty on the timing of a return to service of the  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX, which has forced U.S. competitors Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV),  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) to cancel flights in a marginal benefit to Delta, which does not own the aircraft.
The 737 MAX was grounded after a fatal crash in Ethiopia in March, about five months after another fatal crash in Indonesia.
Delta also announced on Thursday a deal for its Delta Private Jets subsidiary to partner with Wheels Up, a private aviation company with 190 aircraft, to create one of the world's largest owned and managed fleets of private jets.
While private aviation has a larger environmental impact than commercial flying, Bastian said empty legs as jets are repositioned account for 40% to 50% of private flying. By making it more accessible and affordable, the jets can be better utilized.
""It's not something we'll ever market as sustainable but certainly as an improvement,"" Bastian said.
Delta will hold an equity stake in Wheels Up but did not disclose the size of the holding or any financial details.
As for the carrier's pursuit of a stake in Italy's struggling Alitalia, Bastian said he is still interested in investing but has not yet met with the airline's administrator appointed by the Italian government last week."

BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - China has raised ""important concerns"" with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) regarding design changes proposed to end the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX airliner, Beijing's aviation regulator said on Thursday, declining to say when it might fly in China again.
The remarks broke months of public silence from China, the first country to ground the 737 MAX in March following the second deadly crash involving the model in less than five months.
""Boeing is currently upgrading its software to the 737 MAX, and it is still a work in progress. The CAAC has raised our important concerns on areas such as system reliability and safety assessment,"" Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) spokesman Liu Lusong told reporters at a monthly briefing.
The 737 MAX would need to be re-certified and pilots given comprehensive and effective training before it could fly in China, he reiterated.
He said the causes of two crashes that killed 346 people needed to be investigated with effective measures put in place to prevent another one.
China in April said it had set up a task force to review design changes submitted by Boeing.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will not allow the 737 MAX to resume flying before the end of 2019, its chief, Steve Dickson, said on Wednesday.
""We continue to work with the FAA, CAAC and global regulators on addressing their concerns in order to safely return the MAX to service,"" Boeing said in a statement on Thursday.
FAA approval would allow the 737 MAX to resume flights in the United States, but individual national regulators could keep the planes grounded pending completion of their own reviews.
""Due to the trade war, the jury is still out on when China would reintroduce the aircraft,"" said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium. 
Chinese airlines had 97 737 MAX jets in operation before the model was grounded, the most of any country, according to Cirium Fleets Analyzer. 

Li Xiaojin, a Chinese aviation expert, said the country's airlines and passengers were taking a hit from the grounding alongside Boeing because it had crimped aviation growth.

SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) have dropped out of the U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of Chinese shared workspace provider Ucommune, baulking at its desired valuation, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Ucommune's latest filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission list Chinese banks Haitong International and China Renaissance as leading the planned IPO.
Earlier filings had named Citi and Credit Suisse, but both walked away over the past few days because they could not agree an achievable valuation with Ucommune, the people said, declining to be identified because the information was private.
Ucommune did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Citigroup and Credit Suisse declined to comment.
""There was a big gap between what the company had hoped to achieve and where the market is sitting now,"" one said, adding that pressure for a higher valuation also came from some investors who took stakes in recent private funding rounds.
Ucommune raised $200 million in November last year, giving the Beijing-based group a valuation of $2.6 billion.
At least one adviser warned Ucommune in recent weeks that it would likely get a lower valuation from its IPO - a so-called down round when the latest funding gives a company a lower valuation than the preceding one - one of the sources said.
Ucommune refused to accept the advice, the source added.
While Ucommune's preliminary filing did not provide any details of the size of the offering, sources have previously told Reuters it was aiming to raise about $200 million.
Reuters revealed Ucommune's IPO plans in October in the week that its larger U.S.-based rival WeWork was forced to accept a $10 billion bailout after investors, eying its mounting losses, baulked at the valuation it sought from its IPO.
Ucommune, which says it has shared workspaces in 200 locations across 44 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Los Angeles and New York, posted a net loss of 572.8 million yuan ($81 million) for the nine months to the end of September on revenue of 874.6 million yuan.
Its IPO push comes just as Ping An Insurance's OneConnect Financial Technology cut its planned U.S. IPO and lowered its target valuation to up to $3.64 billion, well below the $7.5 billion in its maiden funding round last year."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Haier, the world's biggest maker of household appliances, is planning a major restructuring that will see its main unit Haier Smart Home (SS:600690) list in Hong Kong to take another group company valued at $7.7 billion private, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Under the deal, Haier Smart Home, formerly known as  Qingdao Haier  and already listed in Shanghai, would offer minority shareholders in unit Haier Electronics Group (HK:1169) newly issued Hong Kong stock for their shares, they said.
Financial advisers have been hired to work on the deal, which would give Haier Smart Home access to cash at Haier Electronics, the sources said, declining to be identified as negotiations were private.
Haier Electronics, which makes and sells appliances such as washing machines, held about 20 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) in cash and short term investments as of end-June, according to Refinitiv.
One of the sources added the plan was also part of the Haier group's efforts to streamline its overseas operations.
Haier Smart Home currently owns 45% of Haier Electronics and unlisted parent Haier Group Corp holds 12%, while minority shareholders include Vanguard Group, Norges Bank Investment Management and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), according to Refinitiv data.
The plan is still preliminary and would be subject to regulatory approval, the sources said, adding that the aim was to complete the deal in the second half of next year.
A representative from Haier Smart Home's investors relations office said the team was not aware of the plan. Haier Group and Haier Electronics did not respond to requests for comment.
The Haier group was founded in 1984 by Chinese businessman Zhang Ruimin who built up a small loss-making factory into a major consumer brand. Major acquisitions have included New Zealand appliances brand Fisher & Paykel in 2012 for NZ$927 million and the $5.6 billion purchase of General Electrics' appliances business https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-divestiture-haier-elec-idUSKCN0UT0AG in 2016.
Haier Smart Home, which has a market value of some $15.4 billion, also listed in Germany last year - the first listing of a Chinese company under the D-share program aimed at increasing foreign investment in Chinese firms.

Hong Kong-listed companies have announced a record 24 take-private deals this year, often citing uncertain market conditions or undervalued shares as reasons for the deals.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 05:51AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco tops Crown Prince's $2 trillion goal on share surge,"By Marwa Rashad and Davide Barbuscia
RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) hit the $2 trillion target sought by Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday as its shares clocked up a second day of gains, defying some scepticism about the state-owned oil firm's long-term value.
The Saudi Crown Prince has made Aramco's initial public offering (IPO) the centerpiece of his vision of diversifying the Kingdom's economy away from its dependence on oil by using the $25.6 billion raised to develop other sectors.
But that is well below his plan in 2016 to raise as much as $100 billion via a blockbuster international and domestic IPO.
Riyadh scaled back its plans after overseas investors baulked at the proposed valuation and only 1.5% of Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Aramco) shares were listed on the Riyadh stock exchange on Wednesday, a tiny free float for such a large company.
While a 10% jump in the stock on its Wednesday market debut was hailed by the Saudi government as a vindication of it long-sought valuation, support was largely from loyal Saudi and Gulf investors, with some analysts saying it is worth less.
Aramco's listing was front page news for almost all Saudi Arabia's mainstream media on Thursday, with headlines such as ""Aramco at the top of the world"" and ""A dream come true"".
But Bernstein analysts put Aramco's value at around $1.36 trillion, which compares with U.S. energy giant Exxon Mobil's (N:XOM) market capitalization of less than $300 billion.
""Saudi Aramco is the largest, most profitable oil company in the world - but size is not everything,"" they wrote, flagging the risk of slow net income growth if oil prices stay flat.
An International Energy Agency (IEA) report on Thursday pointed to pressure on oil prices, predicting a sharp rise in global inventories despite an agreement by OPEC and its allies to deepen output cuts as well as lower expected production by the U.S. and other non-OPEC countries.
Bernstein said Aramco should trade at a discount rather than a premium to international oil majors, with corporate governance ""the key risk"" as the Saudi government owns more than 98% of it.
""For actively managed funds, one of the key considerations – aside from valuation – will be ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) criteria,"" said Tim Love, Investment Director for emerging markets equities at GAM.
""The main concerns here are lagging corporate governance standards as well as environmental issues since an investment in Aramco would obviously have a significant impact on a portfolio’s CO2 emissions,"" Love added.
Aramco, whose shares gained the maximum 10% allowed by the Riyadh exchange on their first day of trading, hit 38.7 riyals ($10.32) on Thursday, lifting its market value above $2 trillion. The shares were trading at 37.10 riyals at 1026 GMT, a rise of 5.5% from Wednesday's close.
Some 13.7 billion riyal worth of Aramco shares were traded by 1018 GMT, with around 370 million shares exchanging hands, Refinitiv data showed. This made up most of the total turnover of the whole Riyadh market which was 15.3 billion riyals.
""Initial price action has validated our thesis that Aramco discounted its IPO price to leave upside on the table and allow regional investors to benefit from the listing of its crown jewel,"" Zachary Cefaratti, CEO of Dubai-based Dalma Capital, which invested in the IPO, said in a note on Thursday.
""The average institutional investor received less than 1/6th of the shares they bid for in the IPO, and have had to buy shares on the open market,"" Cefaratti said of the Aramco deal, which became the world's largest, topping the $25 billion 2014 listing of China's  Alibaba  (N:BABA).
INDEX DEMAND
Because Aramco opted to sell a smaller proportion of shares and rely mainly on domestic and regional buyers, some analysts predict a lag before its price settles.
A trader in Riyadh, who asked not to be identified, said that most of the early trading was small scale, of 1,000-1,500 shares, ""signaling that some retail investors opted to make quick gains"" as they were ""happy with a 6 riyal per share gain"".
""We shouldn’t be reading too much into intraday dips. Let’s not forget that more than 93% of the market is still dominated by retail investors, and like in any IPO issuance flippers will exist,"" said Aarthi Chandrasekaran, portfolio manager at Abu Dhabi-based Shuaa Capital.
Aramco shares will also join the Tadawul index and global benchmarks such as MSCI and FTSE next week, which analysts said should fuel further demand, particularly from ""passive"" investors who track such indexes.
A Gulf analyst, who asked not to be identified, said trading by investors in the region could be driven by Saudi Arabia's own view of the value of Aramco.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 05:16AM ET</span>",Explainer: Just Eat caught up in 5 billion pound festive food fight,"AMSTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) - The battle for Britain's Just Eat, which pits investment giant Prosus against Dutch food ordering service Takeaway.com, is set to roll on through the Christmas holidays.
Both suitors are seeking to woo shareholders in the British company and secure a deal that will be pivotal for the future of the fast expanding food delivery industry. But if the contest is unresolved as of Dec. 27, as now seems likely, Britain's Takeover Panel is set to step in and organise a rare auction between the rival bidders.
BIDDING SO FAR
Prosus, a Dutch-listed business spun out of South Africa's Naspers, raised its cash bid on Monday to 740 pence per share, from 710 pence per share, valuing Just Eat at 5.05 billion pounds ($6.5 billion).
Takeaway's all-share offer is worth 690 pence per share as of trading prices and exchange rates on Thursday.
WHY SETTLE FOR LESS?
The European online food delivery industry is expected to generate $16.5 billion in revenue this year and could grow by more than 10% per year over the next decade, according to Statistica.
Just Eat's board and some shareholders back the Takeway deal because they believe the combination will be more successful in the long run, creating a powerhouse in Europe's most profitable markets.
Takeaway has argued that delivering meals for restaurants will struggle to be profitable and aims instead at becoming the dominant ordering platform in each market and taking a cut on each order. Those margins are better.
Prosus says that without being a dominant player in both delivery and ordering, competitors such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Deliveroo will overtake Just Eat.
It plans to invest millions in Just Eat's integrated delivery capabilities - including developing unbranded restaurant kitchens known as ""dark"" or ""cloud"" kitchens, where food is prepared on demand for delivery.
TANGLED WEB
There is a large overlap in Just Eat and Takeaway's shareholder bases, with seven investors appearing in both companies' top 20. They include Capital Research Global Investors, which is the second biggest in both, as well as Baillie Gifford & Co, MFS Investment Management and Cat Rock.
Cat Rock so far backs Takeaway's option, while the others have not said which they prefer.
Prosus is 74% owned by Naspers and has a 22% holding in Germany-based Delivery Hero, which in turn owns a stake in Takeaway.
MARKETS
Takeaway is a market leader in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Bulgaria and Israel, and operates in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal and Romania.
Just Eat is in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and in continental European markets including Denmark, France and Italy.
Prosus, which also owns a 38.8% stake in India's Swiggy, is partners with Just Eat in Brazil's largest food delivery company iFood: Prosus has a controlling stake.
TENDERS PLEASE
To date only a fraction of shareholders have tendered their shares, despite a deadline set for Wednesday, Dec. 11.
That's because neither Prosus nor Takeaway has said that their latest bid is their final offer. Just Eat shares are trading at 780p, suggesting the market believes higher bids are still in the offing.
As of Dec. 6, just 12,295 shareholders had accepted the Prosus bid, out of around 683 million.
On Dec. 12, Takeaway said it had received shares representing about 13.53% of Just Eat shares outstanding. Both companies have now extended their offers.
WHEN WILL IT END?
If the current standoff persists through Dec. 27, Britain's Takeover Panel will organise an auction.
The most recent precedent for this was September 2018, when Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) outbid Fox for control of British broadcaster Sky.
The process this time round has yet to be formally determined and the Christmas and new year holidays may disrupt the usual plan of action.
Still, under standard Takeover Panel procedures, an auction would run for up to five working days starting on Dec. 30, continuing until neither side is willing or able to increase their bid. That means a decision could be made by Jan. 6.
Once bids are declared final, Just Eat's board would be required to make a statement containing a final assessment of the rival bids, and shareholders will have a last chance to choose. (This story fixes typo in paragraph 3)"
49,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Dovish Fed, Dominant Tories Push Europe Markets Higher","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- European stocks found their feet again on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signalled that it’s likely to remain on hold throughout next year, seemingly convinced that historically low jobless rates won’t create enough inflationary pressure to warrant a rate hike.
By 5 AM ET (1000 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.3% at 407.50, while the FTSE MIB was up 0.7% and the FTSE 100 was up 0.6%. Airlines and semiconductor stocks were among the biggest winners.
The biggest gainer on the continent was, however, Russia's RTS, where the heavily-weighted commodities companies all profited from the dollar’s post-Fed decline. A weaker dollar generally supports prices for commodities from oil to base metals and gold.
The FTSE’s gain was all the more notable, given that it came against the backdrop of sterling strength – GBP/USD was steady at above $1.32 in morning trade in London.
Traders appeared to be anticipating a Conservative majority at the general election, where final opinion polls suggested the Tories led by some 10 points nationwide. Given the U.K.’s electoral system, that may translate into anything from a large majority to a ‘hung’ parliament with no overall majority, but bookmakers see a 60% chance of a Tory majority, with spread bettors making markets implying they'll win 341 of the 650 seats up for grabs.
Polls close at 2200 GMT (5 PM ET).
Consensus opinion suggests that utilities stocks have the most to gain from a Conservative victory, as the threat of a Labour nationalization is lifted.
Domestic-themed consumer stocks are set to be supported whatever the outcome, if either of the main parties is true to their promises of big increases in government spending. Homebuilders in particular, may benefit as the lifting of some political uncertainty allows the housing market to revive. 
However, given that even a big Conservative win won’t banish concerns over Brexit (the withdrawal from the EU will happen but huge questions over the U.K.’s trading relationship with the EU will remain), there is every chance that post-election euphoria will pass relatively soon.
Adjusted for currency effects, the U.K.’s FTSE 250 doesn’t have much underperformance vis-à-vis other European markets to make up. It’s risen some 20% this year in euro terms, compared to gains in the mid-20%s for most of Europe’s markets. The FTSE 100 has, however, lagged, due to the predominance of global commodity groups for whom the effects of the U.S.-China trade war have been more important."

HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Zhang Dayi tugs at the sleeve of her gray sweater and rubs the material as 2.3 million viewers watch her every move.
""This sweater is lined on the inside with fleece, so it's very warm, is that correct?"" she says, later pausing for a few seconds to look at the questions streaming in from viewers on her phone.
""I can show you the back: if you like it remember to add it to your basket!"" she says.
Zhang, a popular influencer in China, is the face of a new way of shopping in the country, sweeping retailers in a boom dubbed 'live commerce' - the convergence of e-commerce and livestreaming.
Telegenic and chatty personalities like Zhang speak to shoppers in real time, answering questions about size, color and even smell and using limited-time discounts to encourage quick orders. Sessions go on for hours, and are especially long during big shopping extravaganzas like Nov. 11's Singles Day, and ""Double 12"" in December.
While e-commerce growth has slowed in a stuttering economy, the world's second-biggest, the livestreaming model has given retailers a shot in the arm.  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) said over 50% of its Tmall merchants used livestreaming to sell nearly 20 billion yuan ($2.84 billion) of products on Singles Day last month.
Retail sales in China rose 7.2% year-on-year in October, matching the more than 16-year low hit in April. The government does not give a breakdown for e-commerce sales.
JD.com (O:JD) and  Pinduoduo  (N:PDD) also have livestreaming offerings while video sites like ByteDance's Douyin and Kuaishou give users the option to shop. Consultancy Deloitte estimated that 456 million people in China watched livestreams in 2018.
Brands are taking notice. During Singles Day, L'Oreal (PA:OREP) alone hosted over 600 hours of livestreaming between Oct. 21 to Nov. 11, Alibaba said.
""It was especially hard in the first half of 2018, we had to visit each company one by one,"" said Yang Zhao, head of Alibaba's Taobao Live Operations, recalling how hard it was back then to convince brands that Chinese consumers were keen to shop this way.
""Then it really exploded this year... They've started writing livestreaming into their annual strategy plans, how much they want to invest, make from it, and what content they want to create.""
SHRINKING DISTANCE
Zhang is among China's most popular online celebrities, with 11.6 million followers on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform.
The 32-year-old ventured into e-commerce in 2014 with her own shop on Taobao, and started experimenting with live-streaming two years later. Her firm is backed by Nasdaq-listed influencer incubator, Ruhnn Holding (O:RUHN), in which she also has a stake.
""There were some things that were difficult to achieve with photos and short videos - for example in short videos I cannot issue deal coupons, and I cannot communicate with my fans in real time,"" she told Reuters in an interview.
""Livestreaming pulls closer the distance between users and sellers and builds trust,"" she added.
Her company now employs models to livestream from around 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily, with Zhang making regular appearances. During the last Singles Day, sales throughout her online stores hit 340 million yuan compared with 7-8 million yuan in her debut 2014 year.
Since September, she has started livestreaming herself talking about products and deals from brands like Olay, Yves Saint Laurent and Yum China's (N:YUMC) KFC, joining a breed of popular influencers such as ""Lipstick Brother"" Li Jiaqi and Viya, who specialize in reviewing products.
Over the past year Western social media and e-commerce platforms have started similar channels, with Facebook's (O:FB) Instagram rolling out a feature allowing users to shop from the app, and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) launching its ""Amazon Live"" livestreaming site. Snapchat (N:SNAP) also has a shopping function.
""While foreigners also watch videos, also watch Instagram, there is no platform quite similar to Kuaishou or the Taobao livestreaming platform. Chinese consumers watch this as a kind of entertainment, they think it's fun,"" said Lu Zhenwang, A Shanghai-based independent e-commerce analyst.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 03:36AM ET</span>",Sandy Hook families to get day in court against gunmaker,"By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - Families of victims in the Sandy Hook school massacre that killed 20 children and six adults will get their day in court about nine years from the shooting.
A trial date in September 2021 has been set for the lawsuit brought by them against Remington Arms Co over its marketing of the assault-style rifle used in the shooting.
""After nearly five years of legal maneuvering by Remington, we will finally discover what went on behind closed doors that led to the company's reckless marketing of the Bushmaster AR-15,"" Josh Koskoff, a lawyer for the victims, said in a statement.
The lawsuit was filed in 2014 by the family members of nine people slain and one survivor of the 2012 massacre. Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis in Waterbury, Connecticut set the court date after about two hours of talks with lawyers for both sides.
""The families' faith in the legal system has never wavered and they look forward to presenting their case to a Connecticut jury"", Koskoff added.
Remington did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular working hours.
The plaintiffs have argued that the Bushmaster AR-15 gun - a semi-automatic civilian version of the U.S. military’s M-16 - had been illegally marketed by the company to civilians as a combat weapon for waging war and killing human beings.
The company has argued that it should be insulated from the lawsuit by a 2005 federal law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was aimed at blocking a wave of lawsuits damaging to the firearms industry.
Connecticut's highest court, in a 4-3 ruling, said in March that families of the schoolchildren gunned down in the massacre can sue Remington.
The company appealed that ruling to the United States Supreme Court, which last month declined to shield the gun maker from the lawsuit.
The Dec. 14, 2012 rampage was carried out by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who shot his way into the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut and fired on first-graders and adult staff before fatally shooting himself as police closed in."

Advertising group WPP (LON:WPP) said it had instructed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to buy back up to 300 million pounds worth of its stock.
That’s just less than 2.5% of the company’s outstanding shares and represents a quarter of what has been authorized by WPP (LON:WPP) shareholders.

Marks & Spencer's (LON:MKS) joint venture with Ocado (LON:OCDO) said it raised revenue by 10.8% in year-on-year terms in the 13 weeks to Dec.

The average order size was stable at 104.90 pounds ($136)
The company noted that its new customer fulfilment center at Erith outside London has ramped up to 70,000 orders per week, with better efficiency than its one in Hatfield. Further increases in capacity are planned.

   Rio Tinto    (LON:RIO) said it would consider its options after Australia’s Takeover Panel struck down its proposal to pay for the clean-up of a uranium mine site in the country’s Northern Territory.
Rio had proposed to underwrite an offer to raise A$476 million ($324 million) for the clean up, but the panel argued that the terms of the issue amounted to a highly dilutive deal aimed at making it easier for Rio to squeeze out minorities.
Under the terms of its license, Energy Resources of Australia is required to end mining and processing activities at the Ranger mine by January 2021 and complete final rehabilitation by January 2026.

Infrastructure group John Laing (LON:JLG)said full-year profit will be slightly below expectations, due to a 47 million pound hit from lower-than-expected power prices, tax changes and the broader weakness of the economy.
In addition, it said that sterling’s appreciation in the second half of the year would depress the asset value of its portfolio by some 50 million pounds.
Electricals retailer Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) reported a 60% drop in adjusted pretax profit in the six months to Oct. 26, to 24 million pounds, citing expected losses at its mobile phone business
The company repeated its previous full-year guidance and stressed that the current fiscal year would be the trough for the mobile business, which it expects to break even by 2022.
Engineering group   Balfour Beatty   (LON:BALF) said group operating profit is running ahead of expectations and predicted its order book will top 14 billion pounds by the end of the year, up 11% from 2018.
Revenue is expected to be up 5% from 7.8 billion pounds last year.
CEO Alex Baldock said that the market remains challenging but added that it had gained ""significant"" market share, including in online sales.

Property developer   Hammerson   (LON:HMSO) said it has completed the sale of its 75% stake in Italie Deux, a retail space in Paris, to AXA Investment Managers for 362 million pounds. "
53,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 02:53AM ET</span>",UK's winter election: What's in it for markets?,"By Julien Ponthus and Sruthi Shankar
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's election on Thursday is widely referred to as the most important in a generation given the impact it will have on the country leaving the European Union and choosing between starkly opposed economic paths. 
As such, its outcome is expected to have both a strong short-term impact on trading floors but also a long lasting structural influence on UK financial asset classes, be it sterling, government bonds or stocks.
Investors have so far been pricing in an outright majority for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party. 
The assumption that such an outcome would end Brexit uncertainty and rule out Labour's radical agenda has boosted the pound  to a seven-month high against the U.S. dollar and lifted London's mid-cap stocks (FTMC) to levels unseen for over a year during most of the campaign. 
A closely watched forecast released on Tuesday evening has however sent jitters across the markets, denting sterling and domestic stocks. It showed the race tightened and that Johnson was likely to win only a modest majority. 
""At the moment, I still think Conservative majority is the most likely option and despite the reduction in sterling, that does still seem to be the option that markets are still pricing in,"" said Rachel Winter, associate investment director at Killik & Co. 
""But having said that, I don't think anyone will be surprised to see a hung parliament."" 
Following are a number of scenarios for British stocks, sterling and bonds based on some of the possible electoral outcomes: 
BORIS JOHNSON GETS A LARGE ABSOLUTE MAJORITY
This scenario is considered to be the most market friendly. With a clear majority, Johnson would be expected to deliver the Brexit withdrawal deal he negotiated with the EU.
Although it is seen as a relatively hard form of Brexit by excluding UK-wide customs union membership, implementing it would avoid, on the short-term, a damaging 'no deal' Brexit and remove the uncertainty which has weighed on investments in the UK. 
A Tory victory would be expected to be an immediate win for UK-focused companies such as housebuilders like  Persimmon  (L:PSN), Barrett (L:BDEV), Gleeson (L:GLEG),  Bellway  (L:BWY) and  Galliford Try  (L:GFRD). 
Domestic banks Lloyds (L:LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) would also be expected to do well. 
The pound wouldn't be expected to regain all the ground lost since it traded above 1.50 dollars before the referendum, but a rise to $1.35 and above is seen probable. 
The rising pound would however weigh on the most internationalized dollar-earning UK blue chips, from consumer staples like  Diageo  (L:DGE) to big pharmaceutical groups such as GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) or miners like  Glencore  (L:GLEN). 
The pledge by Johnson's government to cut taxes and put an end to a decade of austerity via increased spending in education, police and health may also raise yields of corporate and government bonds.
HUNG PARLIAMENT
No majority for either of the two main parties is definitely seen as a negative as it would re-ignite Brexit uncertainty and prolong yet again one of the worst political crises Britain has seen since the Second World War.
But the exact results of an inconclusive vote would be key to who exactly forms the next government and would affect whether formal coalitions could be formed. There are many ways it could unfold and impact markets.
In any event, retailers and all businesses for which Christmas sales are key may be heavily impacted.
CONSERVATIVES-LED COALITION 
With no absolute majority, Johnson's campaign pledge to ""get Brexit done"" by January 31 2020 would require a divided opposition or securing allies from other parties' benches to get his EU exit deal through Parliament. 
The uncertainty would most certainly bring the pound and UK domestic shares back down to where they were before the election was decided on. 
A razor-thin absolute majority could also give a handful of Conservative eurosceptics the opportunity to rock Johnson's deal or complicate his bid to get a trade deal agreed with the EU in 2020.
CORBYN WINS AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY
Chances of Labour leader Corbyn securing an absolute majority are priced below 5%. A surprise victory would therefore result in a shockwave for the British stock market even if Labour's softer stance on Brexit could offset the impact further down the road.
On one level, sterling and Brexit-sensitive stocks may be buoyed by Labour's plan to secure a softer Brexit deal and a second referendum. 
But it's not uncommon even for pro-EU investors to argue that a managed Brexit would be less damaging to the economy than Corbyn's radical agenda to steer Britain's economy to the left through large-scale nationalizations notably. 
Consequently, even if a no-deal Brexit is ruled out and a second referendum on the cards, a surprise Corbyn victory would likely hit Britain's equity markets hard. Corporate earnings growth would be expected to fall due to tax increases. 
Labour's campaign pledge to nationalize water groups, gas and electricity firms, rail operators and  Royal Mail  (L:RMG) has fueled a so-called Corbyn Risk Premium on these sectors. 
Outsourcing companies such as Interserve [ISVJF.PK] or  Serco  (L:SRP) would be expected to get less business from a Labour government than a conservative administration seeking to further privatize the economy.
Corbyn's reluctance to engage in high military spending could also weigh on defense contractors such as BAE Systems (L:BAES), QinetiQ (L:QQ) and Babcock (L:BAB). 
UK-focused high-end retail groups such as  Pendragon  (L:PDG) could suffer as well as life insurers (FTNMX8570) should tax reform reduce the disposable income of higher earners.
Britain's financial sector as a whole may be hit with tighter regulation and taxes, but it would likely be easier for banks with an international footprint such as HSBC (L:HSBA) to weather the storm. 
REMAIN ALLIANCE? LABOUR/LIBERAL DEMOCRATS/SNP/GREENS
If the Conservatives fall well short of a majority and are unable to form a workable government, Labour, the anti-Brexit Liberal-Democrats and the SNP - and possibly other minor pro-Remain parties such as the Green Party - could try to form a coalition of their own.
After a moment of disappointment, sterling may warm to the outcome given the promise of a softer Brexit deal and a possible second referendum to keep Britain in the EU. 
Many also reckon the Lib-Dems would keep Labour's more radical program in check, limiting the hit to exposed market sectors and sentiment.
SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY THE KING-MAKER
With a constituency that overwhelmingly favors remaining in the European Union, the Scottish National Party is expected to do well in the election with its firmly anti-Brexit stance.

If in any subsequent coalition talks, the SNP sought assurances on another independence referendum for Scotland in 2020, that could pressure sterling and Scotland-based companies such as Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and  Standard Life  Aberdeen (L:SLA).

55,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 02:29AM ET</span>",Shipping industry sails into unknown with new pollution rules,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Faced with imminent new global marine pollution rules, shipping companies and insurers are puzzling over the risks.
To reduce emissions of toxic sulphur that cause premature deaths, shipowners who have long relied on the dirtiest residues of oil extraction will have to either switch to low-sulphur fuel or install exhaust gas cleaning systems from Jan. 1.
Neither option has been fully tested for long, and some problems have already been reported, both with the more expensive new fuels and with devices known as scrubbers which extract the sulphur on board.
Interviews with key players in the industry show varying levels of alarm at potential risks, which they say range from unexpected fires or collisions due to engine failure to liability for inadvertently flouting the rules.
The container shipping industry alone is having to invest $10 billion to adhere to the new rules, analysts say, and is concerned about extra costs were things to go wrong. 
If different types of the new, cleaner fuel are mixed, for example, they may produce a residue which could eventually clog up an engine and, in a worst-case scenario, damage or break it.
Several large ship owners said handling the new fuels correctly and making sure the scrubbers were properly deployed would minimize danger, but that if care was not taken, problems could arise.
""The big guys are going to be serviced by the right people … there is bigger risk for the smaller ships,"" Hugo De Stoop, chief executive of leading Belgian tanker operator  Euronav  (BR:EUAV), told Reuters.
Euronav has bought the equivalent of almost six months' supply of compliant fuel and is storing it in a megatanker off Malaysia. If a ship is too far away and has to buy fuel, it will try to buy a single type, or, if only a blend is available, ask to see the seller's lab tests.
""We don’t always believe that people have done the test, been diligent about it,"" he said.
Graphic: Global shipping density (https://graphics.reuters.com/SHIPPING-REGULATION-IMO/0100B4QJ2FL/SHIPPING-CO2.jpg)
FUTURE PROOFING
Khalid Hashim, managing director of one of Thailand’s largest dry cargo ship owners, Precious Shipping (BK:PSL), said it had not allowed co-mingling of marine fuel, also known as bunker fuel, for over five years and required all of it to be sample tested.
""Of course this costs us annually around $100,000, but we prefer that cost than to use untested bunker oil based solely on the Bunker Delivery Receipt and find that we have a massive problem on our ship,"" he said.
The company had taken measures to reduce its ships' fuel consumption to offset some of the extra costs and had installed extra compartments for the tanks on board to avoid mixing, he said.
""That way we would have future-proofed our ships for the IMO 2020 regime,"" Hashim said, referring the U.N. International Maritime Organization's rules, agreed by more than 90 countries in hopes of saving more than half a million lives by 2025 alone.
Around 172 ships have avoided the problem because they are powered by sulphur-free liquefied natural gas (LNG), data from Norwegian risk management and certification company DNV GL showed, but this in an expensive option.
Some ship owners have balked at paying for the new 0.5% sulphur fuel, which is quoted at more than twice the price of the 3.5% high-sulphur grade in northern Europe at the moment. <0#HFOFARAA:> <0#LFO05FARA:>
More than 3,000 ships - around 5% of the global fleet - will have scrubbers fitted by 2020 so they can clean the exhaust gas and so continue using existing fuel, the DNV GL data showed.
Some ports have banned one type of scrubber, the open-loop version which empties washwater residues into the sea, and insurers have reported cases of fires or corrosion with the devices.
Norwegian ship insurer Gard cited a few cases where sparks from welding or cutting fell into a scrubber through uncovered openings: in one case it spread to the engine room through glass reinforced epoxy piping.
If corrosion was legally deemed to be inevitable, underwriters might try to deny related claims, said Stephen Harris, senior vice president with insurance broker Marsh.
""Whether underwriters adopt this line or not could depend on how frequent and how big the problem becomes next year.""
Roger Strevens, VP of global sustainability with Norwegian shipping company Wallenius Wilhelmsen (OL:WALWIL), said its experience with scrubbers had shown risks could be minimized if done properly. ""If you buy cheap, you’ll pay twice,"" he said.
CREW SAFETY
Nautilus International, a union which represents over 20,000 workers in shipping, said the use of new fuel types would place extra strain on crews, who have reported incidents including power loss when changing fuels, filter problems and leaks.
""These are complex requirements,"" Nautilus professional and technical officer David Appleton said, calling for comprehensive training and protection in cases of inadvertent infringements.
An underlying problem is that oil refineries are not obliged to produce tailor-made shipping fuel, said Neil Roberts, head of marine underwriting at Lloyd’s Market Association, which represents the interests of all underwriting businesses in London’s Lloyd’s insurance market.
""The ship’s crew has to test it and filter it,"" he said.
The IMO said it does not have a remit to regulate the fuel industry but that international standards for the new fuel and information about compatibility between types had been issued as part of comprehensive preparations.
""IMO is ready, and we are confident IMO member states and the shipping sector are ready for January 1,"" an IMO spokesperson said.
Protection and Indemnity (P&I) clubs, through which groups of shipping companies cover injury and pollution claims, are in wait-and-see mode.
Alvin Forster, deputy director with North P&I club, cited possible engine failure in busy shipping lanes, while Precious Shipping's Hashim said members investing in expensive low-sulphur fuel should not have to share the loss on any scrubber claims.
Harris from Marsh, a broker active in marine insurance including hull and machinery, said assessing cover was still guesswork: for instance, who should pay a fine for a ship using high-sulphur fuel because no alternative was available?
""Is it non-compliance?"" he said. ""The question marks are bigger than the answers.""

The shares climbed by the daily limit to 38.7 riyals at the open in Riyadh.
Aramco raised $25.6 billion in the biggest-ever IPO, selling shares at 32 riyals each and overtaking  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). as the most valuable listed company. The oil producer’s market value surged to $1.88 trillion on its trading debut Wednesday.
The listing was a watershed moment for a business that’s bankrolled Saudi Arabia and its rulers for decades. First floated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2016 with an ambition to raise as much as $100 billion, the share sale was touted as part of a blueprint for life after oil.
Foreign investors largely spurned the offering in part because the stock was too expensive, and it only looks more pricey now relative to dividends and cash flow, said Salih Yilmaz, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.
Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. say it’s already time to cash out as the value gets too high. In a Bloomberg survey last month, global money managers put Aramco’s fair value at between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion.

If the stock keeps climbing on Thursday that gap to what analysts believe is fair will widen, making a potential international listing harder. Many foreign managers who refrained from buying the shares also cited corporate governance concerns and threats to the company’s facilities.
Still, the debut was cheered by Saudi and Gulf investors, who see the stock price supported by Aramco’s guaranteed dividends, buying by index-tracking funds and the fact that the region doesn’t have any other listed major oil companies.
Aramco’s “$2 trillion valuation is justified due to secured dividend streams,” Arqaam Capital analysts including Rita Guindy and Jaap Meijer wrote in a report on Wednesday in which they initiated coverage with a buy recommendation and price target of 39.20 riyals.
Arqaam expects a gradual increase of 2% annually in the dividend, potentially being topped up by a special payout of $20 billion in the next three years."

58,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 01:17AM ET</span>",Shareholders lash Australia's Westpac over money laundering bombshell,"By Scott Murdoch and Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp on Thursday became the biggest Australian company to have shareholders vote down its executive pay for a second year, at a marathon annual meeting dominated by investor outrage over a child exploitation payments scandal.
The ""second strike"" delivers a symbolic blow to the country's oldest bank and fifth-largest listed company as it seeks to reassure owners and customers it can find reasons and solutions for its deepest crisis in decades.
It also puts a cloud over the annual meetings next week of rivals Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), with investors expecting details of NAB's engagement with regulators as it has also flagged weakness in money-laundering controls.
""We are shattered by what has happened,"" Westpac Chairman Lindsay Maxsted told about 600 investors at an emotional six-hour meeting in Sydney.
""It's a total anathema to what we stand for,"" added Maxsted, who brought forward his retirement in light of the scandal.
Westpac was sued three weeks ago by Australian regulators who cited 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, in the country's biggest ever such scandal. Westpac has said it accepts most of the regulator's assertions - which included the facilitation of payments to child exploiters - and its chief executive and compliance head have quit.
The bombshell lawsuit, coming as the country was still digesting a damaging financial misconduct inquiry, has sent Westpac's shares down 9.3% in the three weeks since it was announced, wiping A$8.8 billion off its market value. The bank could pay a fine of more than A$1 billion ($678.60 million), analysts have said.
The stock closed down another 1.2% on Thursday, while the broader Australian market was down 0.7%.
""All of us are members and owners of a company that, even at the best, you could say accidentally allowed child abuse to go on for five years,"" said Chris Schott, a former Australian senator, at the meeting in his capacity as a shareholder.
""It's inconceivable someone didn't have the wit to think something was wrong,"" added Schott, who told the meeting he voted for the establishment of AUSTRAC while in office.
Several Westpac directors narrowly survived protest votes against their re-election but shareholders voted down the company's executive pay plans for a second year running. Under Australian law, a second vote against executive pay triggers a separate vote on whether to remove the whole board.
Just 9% of investors voted for the ""board spill"" motion, though, due to support from large institutional shareholders, sparing the company further humiliation and upheaval at the top.
""We acknowledge we should have implemented more robust transaction monitoring earlier than we did. This would have generated more suspicious matter reports to AUSTRAC,"" Maxsted said earlier in prepared remarks.
He said the company would withhold all or part of its executive bonuses for 2019, subject to an assessment of accountability for the transactions at the heart of the AUSTRAC lawsuit.
Asked at the meeting whether the board would indeed forego fees this year, Maxsted said ""we will act in the best interests of the company.""
That drew a barrage of ""just go"" responses from a number of shareholders, with another later shouting, ""You're asleep at the wheel, mate"".
Maxsted was also asked whether the board could guarantee the bank's interim dividend would not be reduced.
""I can say when we reset the dividend we felt that in relation to how much more difficult the environment is for banking then the payout ratio was too high,"" he said. ""We have been trying to preserve that ... but the decision was taken because of the impact on profitability.""
The biggest vote against a director was in relation to Peter Marriott, a former finance chief of ANZ who has been on the board since 2013 when the payments at the center of the scandal began. He was re-elected with just 58% of the vote, below the near-unanimous support large company directors typically receive.
""All of us continue to reel from the devastating events over the past few weeks. These events are unprecedented as are the headwinds facing the financial services sector in the past few years,"" Marriott said.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 01:11AM ET</span>",'Black Swan' index flashes yellow: Wall Street is not scared,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The options-based Black Swan index may be signaling surging demand from investors for protection against a stock market crash, but Wall Street analysts see little reason to panic.
The Cboe Skew Index (SKEWX) is near a 14-month high. It tracks the implied volatility of deep out-of-the-money options - that is, contracts that need a large move in the market before they come into play - on the S&P 500 (SPX).
On Monday, the Skew Index hit 136.56, its highest since October 2018. It last traded at 134.37.
The gauge is also known as the Black Swan index, a reference to the book ""Black Swan"" by former options trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb that looks at the potentially catastrophic effects of unpredictable events.
The index has at least once preceded a market sell-off. In September 2014, its peak reading came before a 7% drop in the S&P index. However, investors are skeptical about the index's usefulness as a tool that predicts a market crash.
""Yes, options markets are twitchily expecting the next big crack in U.S. stocks,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote in a note on Wednesday. ""But they have been doing that since 2014, and the S&P has almost doubled during that time.""
Over the last six years, a period marked by exceptionally low volatility in U.S. equities, the Skew Index's average reading was just shy of 130, 10 points higher than its average over the decade before that.
Analysts said the index has limited significance on its own.
""We monitor 60-something volatility strategies for various hedge funds, individuals, various emerging managers, and there is not one of those strategies that uses it as an indicator,"" Stuart Barton, managing partner at New York-based investment adviser Invest in Vol LLC, said.
For trading signals, investors tend to focus on contracts that are closer to where the market is trading, Barton said.
Analysts may shrug off the elevated level of the Skew Index, but that isn't to say there is no fear on Wall Street.
Potentially market-moving events on the horizon have prompted investors to seek downside protection, said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors in New York.
Uncertainties linked to central bank policy, the UK general election and the U.S.-China trade war have boosted demand for protection.
""I would interpret it as a healthy market that's buying some protection with the market up 25% year to date,"" Purves said of the climb in the Skew Index. ""Vol's cheap, and there's a lot of catalysts."""
60,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>","Wall Street, Fed prep to avoid year end disruption in repo markets","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - With memories of September's historic spike in short-term funding costs still raw, Wall Street and the Federal Reserve are gearing up for another potential cash crunch at year end.
Liquidity levels will be tested as early as Monday, when Wall Street firms have to shell over cash to the U.S. Treasury for this week's government bond sales and businesses draw down reserves to make quarterly tax payments - events that could drain more than $100 billion in liquidity from the banking system. Those factors were identified as two of the main culprits in the mid-September episode, when interest rates in the overnight repurchase agreement - or repo - market shot to as high as 10%, more than four times the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate.
And a new wild card may come into play this month. Some large banks may scale back lending in the repo market in an effort to shrink their balance sheets to avoid regulatory penalties, which would add to the funding stress.
""The market is still quite fragile,"" said Blake Gwinn, head of front-end rates strategies for NatWest Markets.
The Fed's recent efforts to boost liquidity in cash lending markets - which were not in place in September - could ease some of the pressure.
The U.S. central bank has been injecting tens of billions of dollars of cash into overnight lending markets through daily and longer-term operations in the repo market since mid-September. And in mid-October, it began purchasing $60 billion a month in Treasury bills to raise the level of reserves in the banking system.
""The Fed is now increasing the balance sheet,"" said Zachary Griffiths, a rate strategist for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities. ""That's a major differentiator between now and the middle of September.""
Last month, the Fed also began offering longer repo operations of up to 42 days - compared to the more typical term of about 14 days - to help firms shore up their cash levels through the end of the year.
Investors snapped them up, with bids for all three of the longer repo operations exceeding supply. The Fed upped the size of the second and third offerings by $10 billion each and officials have said they are willing to adjust the repo operations as needed to keep markets running smoothly. The central bank is scheduled to issue an update on the balance sheet program on Thursday.
The strong demand for repo could be a sign that dealers and other financial firms are being proactive about securing access to reserves to avoid a shortage at the end of the year. But there is no guarantee that the liquidity being provided by the Fed is going to reach the hedge funds and other firms in need of liquidity, said Gwinn. The dealers accessing the liquidity from the Fed could choose to hold onto that cash or to use it for other purposes beyond the repo market, he said.
Fed officials are still discussing the merits of a potential standing repo facility, which could reduce demand for reserves by making it easier for banks to trade their Treasury holdings for cash. However, that fix likely would not come until next year, since policymakers are still debating the details of how such a facility should be structured.
Money markets will be tested again on Dec. 31, when some large banks may reduce their repo lending to shrink their balance sheets and avoid higher capital surcharges, said Teresa Ho, U.S. short-term fixed income strategist for JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Some banks that are not subject to the same requirements may help to spread liquidity by lending in repo markets, Ho said, but it is difficult to know how heavily they will participate. ""That doesn't mean they're going to go all in,"" she said.
In perhaps the most extreme forecast, Zoltan Pozsar, a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst who has been watching the repo market closely for more than a year, warned this week that any potential disruption at year-end could be so severe it may force the Fed to launch another round of quantitative easing.
Some Fed watchers say the worries about year-end are overblown. Even if there is a spike, it may not have much of an effect on other markets if it is not as dramatic as the jump in September and if it is resolved quickly, said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""If it's just temporary spike I don't think it's a huge problem,"" Gagnon said.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday after the central bank's policy meeting that officials are dedicated to keeping money markets calm through year end. He also said policymakers are open to suggestions for adjusting supervisory and regulatory practices in a manner that does not affect the safety and soundness of the banking system.
""We think the pressures appear manageable and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range,"" he said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Thursday to the highest in a month after the Federal Reserve signalled rate settings were likely to remain accommodative, but the imminent UK election and a deadline for Sino-U.S. trade talks kept investors cautious.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged, as expected, at its policy meeting on Wednesday but indicated interest rates would remain on hold, which nudged Wall Street stocks higher.

62,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 12:00AM ET</span>","Nintendo Switch China Sales Could Reach 4 Million by March, Analyst Says","(Bloomberg) -- Only a few days after Nintendo Co (T:7974).’s Switch made its long-anticipated entry into China, one analyst is making a bullish case for Mario and Zelda’s prospects in the world’s biggest gaming arena.
Nintendo could sell as many as four million Switch units in China in the fiscal year ending March and 12 million units of software, London-based tech equity researcher Pelham Smithers wrote in a note to clients. That could add as much as 23 billion yen ($212 million) to the Kyoto-based company’s full-year operating profit, Smithers said.
Nintendo and its local partner Tencent Holdings Ltd. began selling the Switch console in China on Dec. 10, a move that has excited Nintendo investors hopeful of tapping a new market. But the optimism has been tampered by the historically lackluster performance of Sony Corp (T:6758).’s PlayStation and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s Xbox consoles, which have had several years to crack the market where smartphones are the dominant gaming platform. Video game giants are also hampered by Beijing’s insistence on vetting all games, which limits the library available to fans and slows new releases. At launch, the Switch only had one state-approved game to play.
“While the history of the game console in China is not a happy one, lack of success is not necessarily down to lack of interest on the part of the consumer,” Smithers wrote in the report. “After all: if China’s consumers didn’t play console video games, the authorities wouldn’t have bothered banning them in the first place.”
Key Insights:
Switch hardware sales in China may range between 2 million and 4 million units in fiscal 2019 and between 3 million and 6 million the following year. Software sales will range between 6 million and 12 million in the current period and 15 million and 30 million in the period ending March 2021.China could contribute between 11.6 billion yen and 23.1 billion yen to Nintendo’s operating profit this year and 27.8 billion to 55.6 billion yen in the next.Smithers forecasts a ratio of three game purchases for each hardware unit sold in both years.He also assumes Tencent takes a 30% share of software sales income, while all of the hardware revenue goes to Nintendo, and that the two companies split the marketing costs.Nintendo’s sales in China may be capped by the company’s unwillingness to significantly increase production volume of the console and risk building up unsold inventory.Nintendo’s signature device is selling for 2,099 yuan ($298), about the same as elsewhere around the world. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Mario Odyssey and Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe have been green-lit by the government. Nintendo is also preparing to introduce the Switch Lite -- a cheaper version of the console intended to boost the device’s mainstream appeal -- to China at a future date, development partner Tencent said in a social media post last week.
Sales of the Switch might have topped 50,000 units on launch day, according to market researcher Niko Partners, which gathers data from online retailers. Some 20,000 units were sold via JD.com and another 10,000 through TMall, it said in a report. Niko Partners forecasts the sales will reach 100,000 units by the end of the year, far below the 1 to 2 million estimated by Smithers.
This isn’t Nintendo’s first attempt to crack the market. Official console sales in China remain a fraction of the overall gaming arena, as region locks and delayed hardware releases push gamers toward imported options. Nintendo confronted similar challenges in attempts to enter China dating back to 2003. It tried to sell, via a joint venture, its Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 3DS and a peculiar China-only portable console called iQue Player. Rampant piracy and slow game launches made those products unappealing.
Elsewhere, Nintendo’s Switch retains its popularity three years after its launch, in an industry where consoles are often revamped every half-decade or so. The company has so far stuck with a conservative outlook for 18 million Switch units this fiscal year. Smithers thinks full-year sales outside of China could range between 20 and 21 million.

The company’s shares have climbed more than 50% this year on the anticipation of the Switch’s China debut, the release of a smartphone edition of the Mario Kart franchise and the launch of the cheaper Switch Lite. Nintendo is likely to revise upwards its full-year earnings forecasts when it reports results in January, which could tempt some investors to sell and lock in gains, Smithers wrote.
“Even if it doesn’t, this quarter’s figures should impress,” he said."
63,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 11:53PM ET</span>",Prosecution witness in Australian bank cartel case tells court there was no collusion,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - A prosecution witness in an Australian criminal cartel case against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) testified he had just 30 seconds notice about an underwriting conference call and that there was no collusion.
The testimony from former JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith appears to be at odds with the prosecution's case that the three banks and their client Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) agreed to withhold details about a A$2.5 billion ANZ share sale in 2015 to support the stock.
The case, in which JPMorgan has been given immunity in exchange for cooperating with the authorities, is being closely watched by investment banks around the world because it could influence how they are allowed to conduct capital raisings.
Prosecutors have argued the banks struck up an agreement to not tell investors that underwriters were buying some of the stock on two conference calls that took place in August 2015.
But Herbert-Smith, who was on the calls, told a Sydney court in a pre-trial hearing that the staff of the three banks decided to withhold information about the share sale independently and there was no agreement.
""I had 30 seconds' notice, and three seconds to make up my mind,"" Herbert-Smith said of one of the calls.
""I was flying blind on the phone call.""
Seven months later, in March 2016, when he was told the ACCC wanted to speak to him, Herbert-Smith said, ""I couldn't believe it, I was somewhat surprised"".
Herbert-Smith's lawyer, Philip Strickland, asked: ""You didn't consider that you were involved in cartel behavior, is that correct?""
""That's correct,"" Herbert-Smith responded.
According to his lawyer, Herbert-Smith told other bankers on the call that ""we are comfortable with our risk position (and) we are going to stand on it"".
""There was no prior agreement ... relating to those lines you've just recited,"" Herbert-Smith said.
Herbert-Smith said that when he met an ACCC investigator in March 2016, the investigator found it hard to believe three people on the same call made the same decision independently.
""I disagreed. Maybe it was familiarity with capital markets,"" he said.
Herbert-Smith met the ACCC about six times before signing a statement that would be used to prosecute the other banks, he said.
The banks and their staff and former staff have declined to comment on the case outside of what is said in court. All of the accused have said they will defend the case, which is yet to go to trial, but none has entered a formal plea.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia said on Thursday technology giants such as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Google (O:GOOGL) will have to agree to new rules to ensure they do not abuse their market power and damage competition, or the government will impose new controls on them.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will create a code of conduct to address complaints that the technology companies have a stronghold on advertising, the main income generator of local media operators.
The guidelines will ensure substantial market power is not used to lessen competition in media and advertising services markets.
""I want us to be the model jurisdiction in the world for how we are dealing with digital platforms, social media platforms,"" Morrison told reporters in Melbourne.
The move tightens the regulatory screws on the online platforms, which have governments from the United States to Europe scrambling to address concerns ranging from anti-trust issues to the spread of ""fake news"" and hate speech.
Australia's government said technology companies would need to agree to the new rules by November 2020 or it will impose them.
""The companies are on notice. The government is not messing around. We will not hesitate to act,"" Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters.
Google and Facebook both said they support greater competition and will work closely with the ACCC.
""We support a sustainable news ecosystem which is why we work with publishers to help them reach new audiences,"" Mia Garlick, director of policy, Australia and New Zealand at Facebook, said in an emailed statement.
Google and Facebook have opposed tighter regulation, while traditional media owners, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (O:NWSA), have backed reform.
""It's great the government is making a serious attempt to address the deep-rooted dominance of the online tech and streaming giants,"" said Paul Anderson, chief executive of Australia's Network 10.
Australia has for months signaled its intentions to get tough on the technology behemoths.
In July, Australia became the first in the world to establish a special branch within the ACCC, tasking it with scrutinizing how the companies used algorithms to match advertisements with viewers, giving them a stronghold on the main income generator of media operators.
In April, Australia passed new rules that could fine social media and web hosting companies up to 10 percent of their annual global turnover and imprison executives for up to three years if violent content is not removed ""expeditiously""."
66,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 10:57PM ET</span>","Saudi Aramco Investors Should Cash Out Now, Bernstein Says","(Bloomberg) --  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) investors should take profit now after shares in the world’s biggest company jumped 10% in their first day of trading Wednesday, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. recommended in a note to clients.
A low dividend yield, the political risk of the government still running the company, and a bleak outlook for oil prices all point to a fair valuation for Saudi Aramco that’s about 28% lower than the $1.88 billion it reached after its first day of trading in Riyadh, Bernstein analysts including Neil Beveridge and Oswald Clint said in the Thursday note.
There may still be some short term upside because of index inclusion and the difficulty of shorting stocks on the Saudi Tadawul Stock Exchange, and Bernstein said it would be surprised if in the short term the company didn’t achieve the $2 trillion valuation that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman set as a target more than three years ago. The current valuation only makes sense with oil at $100 a barrel, so the downside will eventually materialize.
“For investors who have benefited so far, we would take profit here,” Beveridge said in the note. “For those who have not, we would wait until a better entry point, which will inevitably come.”
Bernstein initiated coverage of Aramco with the equivalent of a sell rating and a target price of 25.50 riyals, below the 35.20 riyal settlement on its first day of trading."

DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said on Wednesday that rank-and-file members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have voted in favor of a new four-year labor contract with the automaker, helping the Italian-American firm avoid a strike as it works to merge with France's Groupe PSA.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen, in October announced a planned $50 billion merger to create the world's fourth-largest automaker.
FCA's 47,200 rank-and-file UAW members voted 71% in favor of the new contract. The deal follows contracts the UAW already concluded with larger rivals General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
“Every full-time production employee currently at FCA will be at top rate by the end of this four-year agreement,” Cindy Estrada, UAW vice president and director of the union's FCA department, said in a statement. She added that all temporary workers also have a path to full employment.
“We are pleased to have reached a new agreement that allows us to continue our record of adding good-paying UAW-represented jobs,” FCA North America Chief Operating Officer Mark Stewart said in a statement.
Ratification of the contract had not been viewed as a sure thing, as union members at FCA in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract. In addition, a federal corruption probe related to embezzlement at the union drew attention.
The federal corruption probe led GM to file a racketeering lawsuit against FCA, alleging its rival bribed union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars.
FCA has brushed off the lawsuit as groundless.
The contract with GM that was ratified by workers in October followed a 40-day strike in the United States that virtually shuttered GM's North American operations and cost the automaker $3 billion. 
The UAW has said the contract with FCA included a commitment by the automaker to invest $9 billion, creating 7,900 new jobs over the course of the contract. Of the $9 billion, $4.5 billion was announced earlier this year, to be invested in five plants and creating 6,500 jobs.
The investments include $2.8 billion at Warren Truck Assembly plant in Michigan to build a new a plug-in hybrid SUV in 2021 and a potential increase of 1,500 jobs.

FCA will also invest $160 million at its Toledo, Ohio, plant to build a new plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler next year, and $3 billion at its Jefferson Assembly plant in Detroit to a build a plug-in hybrid Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2021 among other new vehicles.

69,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 07:40PM ET</span>",Amazon on-time delivery slip reported after Cyber Monday sales surge,"By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - On-time delivery rates fell for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) van drivers in the latest week, consulting firm ShipMatrix said on Wednesday, but the online retailer said its performance was ""far better than what's being reported"" even as it dealt with record Cyber Monday orders and regional winter storms. 
Amazon van drivers delivered 93.7% of U.S. packages on time during the week ending Dec. 7, down from 98.2% during the prior week that included Thanksgiving, ShipMatrix said.
Amazon called the ShipMatrix data ""inaccurate"".
""Some deliveries were briefly impacted by weather but we worked quickly to re-balance capacity across our network,"" spokeswoman Rena Lunak said in a statement.
This holiday season is a crucial test for Amazon's in-house delivery operations. Retailers are racing to secure sales with speedier delivery and other promotions. Amazon.com rolled out one-day shipping in April. A few months later, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) canceled its air and home delivery agreement with the world's leading online retailer.
Amazon van drivers handle the lion's share of Amazon's own deliveries, which often originate from local hubs in primarily urban areas. They are expected to drop off roughly 275 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas, more than double last year's number, according to ShipMatrix.
SMALL MARGIN FOR ERROR
Analysts have warned that Amazon's decision to accelerate delivery speeds just months before the busiest time of the year would dial up pressure on the company.  
""The more you ratchet down (delivery) time frames, the less margin you have for error,"" said Evan Armstrong, president of supply chain consulting firm Armstrong & Associates.
Many Amazon shoppers pay $119 a year for ""free"" one- and two-day Prime shipping. 
""If you ordered on Amazon and it's late, Amazon's going to get the blame,"" said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. ""I don't think this year people are going to be as forgiving as in the past."" 
    
PRIME CUSTOMER DISAPPOINTED
Lacheal Wright waited eight days for the Vtech writing tablet, Nerf toys and hard-to-find Bumblebee Transformer figure she ordered from Amazon on Cyber Monday. Those Christmas gifts for her son were originally slated for delivery on Dec. 5 but arrived Dec. 10. 
Wright, 37, whose home in Cincinnati is 20 minutes from two Amazon warehouses, said she had been looking all over for the Bumblebee Transformer and said that was the only reason she did not cancel the entire order. Now that it has arrived, she plans to cancel Prime. 
""I pay for Prime. I expect it on time,"" Wright said. Her area, which is home to Amazon's air hub, had snow the weekend before Cyber Monday. A check of that week's weather showed precipitation of less than 1 inch. 
Amazon's logistics unit in just a few short years has built a U.S. network with hundreds of facilities, nearly 50 leased airplanes and some 30,000 delivery vans. 
""Since Amazon is a retailer, fulfillment company and delivery carrier (all-in-one) ... delays could be resulting from delays in the fulfillment of the order,"" ShipMatrix President Satish Jindel said. 
On-time delivery rates during Cyber Monday week were 92.7% for  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), 90.4% for FedEx Corp and 92.3% for the U.S. Postal Service. UPS said it experienced weather-related delays in multiple regions during the week. The company and other nationwide carriers move packages greater distances and are more exposed to disruptions than Amazon van drivers who handle short ""last-mile"" deliveries. 
UPS, USPS and other carriers are expected to deliver 180 million Amazon packages during the holiday season, according to ShipMatrix, which has been using proprietary software to track on-time deliveries since 2013. 

In 2013 an unexpected surge in Amazon packages swamped shippers, delayed gifts and prompted the Seattle company to take control of delivering merchandise to people's homes.

72,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 05:21PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things on Dec. 12,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1 ECB's Lagarde in Spotlight
The European Central Bank is under new leadership with Christine Lagarde at the helm, but there's little change expected on the monetary policy front.
With the ECB widely expected to keep rates unchanged, Lagarde's news conference will be closely monitored for commentary on policy for 2020. Her communication style will also draw attention as many are keen to see how it will differ from her predecessor, Mario Draghi.
The update on ECB staff projections will also be in the spotlight.
In September, the eurozone central bank forecast GDP growth at 1.1%, 1.2% and 1.4% in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. Headline inflation, meanwhile, was expected at 1.2%, 1.0% and 1.5% over the same period.
2. Pound on Watch Ahead of U.K. General Election 
U.K voters will go back to the polls on Thursday in an election widely seen as a proxy for a second referendum on the EU.
The ruling Conservative Party, led by Boris Johnson, has promised to deliver Brexit. Johnson is seeking a parliamentary majority to pass his Brexit deal. The main opposition, the Labour party led by Jeremy Corbyn, has promised to hold a Brexit referendum soon after winning a general election.
Moves in the GBP/USD will likely capture trader expectations of a potential Labour or Conservative victory. In the lead-up to the election, the pound has been rampant as polls show the Conservative party holding a lead, albeit slender, over Labour.
Gains in sterling on a Conservative victory will likely run out of steam in early 2020 as the market ""realises that Brexit hasn't gone away and is most certainly not done,"" said John Goldie, FX dealer at Argentex.
3. U.S. Wholesale Inflation Due
Wholesale inflation figures arrive Thursday, a day after U.S. consumer prices topped economists' forecasts.
The Labor Department will issue the producer price index (PPI) report at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the PPI rose 0.2% last month with the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% from 0.3% the prior month.
That would bring year- over-year PPI growth to 1.2% and core PPI growth up to 1.6%.
The PPI is considered a leading indicator, measuring the input prices for goods sold at a retail level.
On the heels of the wholesale inflation report, the Labor Department will release its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance.
Economists forecast that initial jobless claims came in at 213,000, down from 203,000 the previous week."
73,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>","Stocks - Apple, Chips Lead Nasdaq Higher as Fed Stands Pat","Investing.com – Technology stocks were the stars of the day Wednesday as the Federal Reserve held steady on interest rates and Chairman Jerome Powell pronounced the economy ""in a good place.""
The major averages saw small gains overall, but chip and chip-related stocks, including Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), had decent gains as traders appeared to be betting that the Trump Administration will hold off on imposing new tariffs on imports from China.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which manufactures most of its products in China, hit a new all-time high.
The S&P 500 was up 0.29%. The Dow Jones industrials climbed back from an early loss to end 0.11% higher. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.44% while the tech-dominated Nasdaq 100 index added 0.58%.
The market moves came as the Federal Reserve held its key federal funds rate at 1.5% to 1.75% and signaled it probably won't move rates lower or higher for some time to come, perhaps all of 2020. It would take a sustained period of inflationary pressures to get the Fed to move rates up, Chairman Jay Powell said in his news conference and the economy is able to cope with current rates.
The Fed sees a growing labor market, modestly growing wages, little inflation. The risks to the economy remain trade disputes and weak business investment.
There are, of course, risks from the ongoing U.S.-China trade fight and all the tariffs the Trump Administration has imposed so far and could impose over the weekend if President Donald Trump decides the negotiations are unnecessarily stalled.
Additional risks are slowing economies in Europe and elsewhere. Europe, especially, is wracked by the Brexit battle, which will climax Thursday when voters in the United Kingdom head to the polls for a snap parliamentary election. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives are expected to add seats.
The uncertainties of both may mean stocks tread water the rest of the week.
 
The Dow was held back in part by a decline in  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), which cut its guidance for fiscal 2020 same-store sales growth modestly. The shares were down 2%, which translated into more than 26 Dow points.
But remember only 14 Dow stocks were higher on the day.
 
For much of the day, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was lower, but finished up 0.60%. The decline came as Federal Aviation Administration Chairman Steve Dickson told CNBC the agency won't recertify the 737 Max plane before the end of the year.
“If you just do the math, it’s going to extend into 2020,” Dickson said.
The rebound may reflect the market's conviction that the plane will get recertfied. When is the question.
There are at least 10, maybe 11, milestones to complete. And Dickson did not want to seem to accelerate the recertification process. Documents released at a Congressional hearing Wednesday showed FAA staffers worried the 737 Max was potentially a more dangerous plane than anyone thought after its 2018 crash in Indonesia. It took a second crash in Ethiopia to force the FAA to ground the plane.
Crude oil  fell after several days of gains. Gold  was higher in New York. The 10-Year Treasury yield was lower.
It may surprise, but the U.S. stock market has gone nowhere so far in December.
The Dow is down 0.5% for the month. The S&P 500 is basically flat. The Nasdaq is down 0.13%, and the Nasdaq 100 is flat.
But 2019 has been a great rebound from the slump in the fall of 2018. The Dow is up 19.7% for the year. The S&P is up 25.3%. The Nasdaq is up 30.4%, while the Nasdaq is still up 32.7%.
Chip company Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), copper producer Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX), chip-equipment company Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and chip company Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) were among the top-performing S&P 500 companies. 
Food company   General Mills   (NYSE:GIS), fashion retailer L Brands (NYSE:LB), clothing retailer Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) were the S&P 500 laggards.

U.S. stocks rose with Treasuries and the dollar fell.

Thailand’s benchmark SET Index has slid 5.2% this quarter, the most among major global stock markets. At the same time, international funds have pulled $759 million in the period, adding to a $1.49 billion sell-off in the three months through September.
“The economy continues to struggle, and that’s leading to earnings downgrades for a lot of companies,” said Gordon Fraser, who helps manage about $45 billion as a global emerging-market equities fund manager at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). in Hong Kong. “It’s not a country we’re particularly compelled to add capital to right now.”
Fall out from the U.S.-China trade dispute and the strongest emerging-market currency this year after Russia’s ruble have hurt tourism and exports in Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy. Concern about companies’ earnings prospects will continue to keep most investors away from Thai equities, according to the nation’s $31 billion Government Pension Fund.
The Thai government forecasts 2019 economic growth will slow to 2.6%, the weakest in five years, while most of the 100 largest companies on the country’s exchange reported July-to-September earnings that were lower than analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the fourth straight quarter of worse-than-expected results, the data showed.
“It’s difficult to expect any large buying of Thai stocks any time soon with the poor earnings and the current state of domestic and global economies,” said Vitai Ratanakorn, head of the state-owned pension fund.
A historical pattern of foreign fund outflows in the fourth quarter will damp any “significant gains” in Thai stocks, according to SCB Asset Management Co., the nation’s biggest private money manager.
Foreign funds have net sold Thai equities in every October-to-December period since 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark stock measure’s 14-day relative strength index is below the 30 level that some analysts consider a signal that it’s oversold.
“Overseas investors are already in holiday mood and prefer to hold less exposure to Thai equities while they are away,” said Pornthep Jubandhu, the head of investment research at SCB Asset, which manages about $50 billion of assets. Still, local investors such as mutual and pension funds remain optimistic that government spending can trigger a revival in stock prices, and they may get tempted by attractive valuations, he said."

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes ended modestly higher on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and signaled that borrowing costs are likely to remain unchanged indefinitely.
The U.S. central bank said moderate economic growth and low unemployment are expected to continue through next year's presidential election.
After cutting rates three times earlier this year, the Fed left its benchmark rate at the target range of between 1.50% and 1.75%, a decision that was widely expected.
""You are looking at a cautiously optimistic Fed,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. ""The tone that you see through the statement and projections suggest that they believe that they have taken out enough insurance to prevent a downturn.""
The Fed's move to ease monetary policy this year has supported the rise in stocks to record highs; the S&P 500 has gained 25% so far in 2019. 
With the Fed expected to stand pat on rates this time, investors have been more focused on U.S.-China trade relations, including new tariffs on Chinese goods. President Donald Trump has said the new tariffs will go into effect on Dec. 15, but uncertainty remains over whether they will be implemented.
""There was really nothing to take away from the narrative which has taken the stock market higher, which is the Fed has lowered rates three times this year. So we are in a pretty good interest rate environment to hopefully help the growth rate,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. ""The focus will be back on trade here after today.""
Fed policymakers said they would continue monitoring ""global developments"" in deciding whether interest rates need to change. They also said they would keep an eye on ""muted inflation pressures,"" a reflection of concern that the pace of price increases has failed to hit the central bank's target.

(Reuters) - The chief executive of autonomous vehicle company Cruise signaled on Wednesday the General Motors Co (N:GM) subsidiary intends to offer shared rides ""at a radically lower cost"" as part of a bid to move eventually ""beyond the car.""
Dan Ammann, former president of the largest Detroit automaker and now the CEO of Cruise, wrote in a blog post that to “make order-of-magnitude — rather than incremental — improvements in transportation, we need to build alternatives that are superior to the status quo in every way.” The post was headlined ""We Need to Move Beyond the Car.""
Cruise’s mission, he said, is to “reduce congestion through making shared rides more compelling by providing an awesome experience at a radically lower cost.” Only then, “will we truly move beyond the car to the transportation system that we deserve.”
Ammann did not elaborate on Cruise’s plans in his post. 
Cruise on Wednesday said it would offer more details at an event in San Francisco on Jan. 21.
Cruise previously announced a partnership with Honda Motor Co (T:7267) to develop a purpose-built autonomous vehicle for use in ride-sharing. Honda is a minority investor in Cruise.
Cruise was valued at $19 billion in May after a $1.15 billion round of investment. GM's market capitalization stood at $50 billion on Wednesday. 
Earlier this year, Ammann scrapped a goal of launching a Cruise robotaxi service by the end of 2019.
GM rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and its development partner Argo AI are planning to launch self-driving vehicles in commercial ride-sharing and delivery services in the United States in late 2021.

Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo is already providing ride-sharing services in Arizona in partnership with  Lyft  (O:LYFT).

80,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 04:09PM ET</span>",Harvey Weinstein reaches tentative $25 million settlement with accusers: NY Times,"(Reuters) - Harvey Weinstein and the board of his bankrupt film studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement with dozens of women who accused the former Hollywood producer of sexual misconduct, The New York Times said https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/harvey-weinstein-settlement.html on Wednesday, citing lawyers involved in the negotiations.
The accord would end nearly all civil lawsuits by actresses and former Weinstein employees who accused him of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, the newspaper said.
Insurers for the former Weinstein Co studio would fund the payout, and Weinstein would not be required to admit wrongdoing or to pay anything, the newspaper said.
Representatives for Weinstein declined to comment.
Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct dating back decades by more than 70 women. He has denied the allegations, saying any sexual encounters were consensual.
According to the Times, accusers involved in the tentative accord would make their claims in bankruptcy court, and the $25 million payout would be part of a $47 million settlement to close out the studio's obligations.
The litigation is separate from criminal charges that Weinstein faces in New York, where prosecutors have accused him of sexually assaulting two women, one in 2006 and another in 2013.
A trial is scheduled for Jan. 6, 2020, and Weinstein could face life in prison if convicted on the top counts.
Weinstein, 67, used a walker to enter the courthouse for a bail hearing on Wednesday, and is scheduled to have back surgery on Thursday.
Through his namesake studio and his original Miramax studio, Weinstein became one of Hollywood's most powerful executives, powering a string of films to Oscar gold, including ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""The King's Speech.""
The accusations that surfaced against him in October 2017 helped spark the #MeToo movement, where hundreds of women have accused powerful men in entertainment, business, media, politics and other fields of sexual misconduct.
The reported settlement drew criticism from Doug Wigdor and Kevin Mintzer, lawyers for two of Weinstein's accusers.
In a joint statement, they said the accord would pay too much to lawyers and too little to victims, and might excuse the studio's insurers and board from liability to victims who choose not to participate.

""While we don't begrudge victims who want to settle, we plan to vigorously object to any provision that tries to bind victims who want to proceed with holding Harvey Weinstein accountable for his actions,"" they said.

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday it was investigating production issues at Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX factory, raised by an ex-manager who warned that schedule pressure and worker fatigue undermined quality and raised safety risks.
The manager, Ed Pierson, drew a link between faulty Angle of Attack sensors in two recent 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people and what he called a ""chaotic and alarming state"" inside Boeing's factory that undermined quality and safety. 
""It is alarming that these sensors failed on multiple flights mere months after the airplanes were manufactured in a factory experiencing frequent wiring problems and functional test issues,"" Pierson said at a hearing before U.S. lawmakers.
""I witnessed a factory in chaos,"" he said. 
At the hearing, U.S. FAA chief Steve Dickson confirmed the agency will not approve Boeing Co's grounded 737 MAX for flight before the end of 2019, citing a series of steps that still must be completed. 
Federal officials told Reuters this week that FAA approval is not likely until January at the earliest, though some U.S. officials think it may not be until at least February. 
Boeing has warned that a significant delay in 737 MAX approval could force it to cut or even halt production of the aircraft, a move that would have repercussions across its global supply chain. 
Lawmakers questioned Dickson about an internal FAA analysis produced after the first fatal crash on a Lion Air flight last year that suggested serious risks of crashes over the life of the airplane and questioned why that did not prompt more aggressive action.
The second crash of a 737 MAX, flown by Ethiopian Airlines, occurred five months later. 
""Despite its own calculations, the FAA rolled the dice on the safety of the traveling public and let the 737 MAX continue to fly until Boeing could overhaul its MCAS software,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
Boeing said its actions after the Lion Air crash - reinforcing standard flight procedures as it worked on a software fix - were ""fully consistent"" with the FAA’s analysis and established process, and its own internal safety assessment.
Once the FAA clears the plane to fly and approves training changes, it will still take U.S. airlines 30 days or more to resume flights. 
Dickson said at the hearing Boeing could still face fines for not disclosing problems with the 737 MAX earlier.
After Dickson testified, he spoke to some of the family members, who pressed him to make sure there is never a similar 737 MAX crash. As Dickson departed, the mother of one of the people killed in the flights called out: ""We're relying on you."" 
The three U.S. carriers that operate the 737 MAX - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and United Airlines Holdings Inc - are scheduling flights without use of the aircraft until early March 2020, nearly a year since the plane was grounded.
The head of the International Air Transport Association, Alexandre de Juniac, warned Wednesday that airlines face significant problems if the return to service of the 737 MAX drags on for months longer.

Froneri was created after Nestle merged its European ice cream business in 20 countries with R&R, a unit of French private equity firm PAI Partners.
With operations in regions including Latin America and Asia, it is one of the largest ice cream companies in the world with a turnover of around 2.9 billion Swiss francs ($2.91 billion) as of last year.
Wednesday's deal expands Froneri's reach to the United States and is expected to add $1.8 billion to annual sales.
""(We) are convinced that Froneri's successful business model can be extended to the U.S. market,"" Nestle's Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said.
Nestle owns the rights to Häagen-Dazs in the United States, while Yoplait maker  General Mills  (N:GIS) sells the premium brand in non-U.S. markets. 
Since taking over reins at Nestle in 2016, Schneider has embarked on a strategy that focuses on selling premium products in high growth categories such as baby food and coffee, while offloading underperforming businesses. 
Earlier this year, the Swiss company put its Herta cold cuts and meat-based products business on the block and sold its skin health business to a consortium led by EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs.
""(The Froneri deal) underlines the seismic change going on at Nestle in terms of portfolio transformation to focus on where it thinks it can add value, while rolling those businesses where it thinks others can do better into ventures that do so,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said.
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 following regulatory approvals, Nestle said. 
The maker of Nescafe coffee and KitKat chocolates will continue to run its remaining ice cream businesses in Canada, Latin America and Asia.

Wells Fargo cut its earnings and revenue estimates for the first and second quarters of Micron's 2019-20 fiscal year.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said it expects revenue from memory-chip sales will fall short.
Despite the call, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) shares rose 3.4% by 2:30 p.m. ET (19:30 GMT). The shares are up nearly 55% in 2019, slightly ahead of the 52% gain for the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index was up 2.2% on Wednesday.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) now sees Micron's fiscal-first-quarter earnings per share and revenue at $0.45 and $4.92 billion respectively, down from $0.50 and $5.17 billion.
The consensus estimate of analysts compiled by Investing.com is Micron (NASDAQ:MU) will earn 48 cents a share on revenue of $5.02 billion.
Micron will release fiscal-first quarter results after the close on Dec. 18.
But the bank stopped short of downgrading its rating on Micron, maintaining its outperform rating and a $60 price target on the stock, citing a positive risk-reward balance in the valuation.
The  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) target on Micron is ahead of the $54.93 consensus target of analysts followed by Investing.com.
In the previous quarter, semiconductor companies, including Micron, were hurt by weakness in the China market amid the ongoing U.S.-Sino trade war and softness in NAND flash memory pricing and sluggishness in demand for chips used in data centers.
Micron has recouped some of the losses following its post-earnings slump in September when the chipmaker reported a large earnings decline and warned of a disappointing holiday season ahead.
The chipmaker said it expects adjusted earnings of 39 cents to 53 cents a share on revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion for the first quarter of its new fiscal year, the holiday quarter."
87,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>",U.S. regulator homes in on climate risks to U.S. markets,"By Ann Saphir
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The first public report on climate-related risks to financial markets ever commissioned by a U.S. market regulator will be out in June, the head of the group charged with writing it said on Wednesday. 
The report, by a 35-member panel formed last month by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ""will address both the short-term financial risks that may be associated with the transition to a low carbon economy, as well as the current and future market and financial risks associated with the physical risks that will arise from a warming climate,"" Bob Litterman, a partner at hedge fund Kepos Capital and the panel's chair, said at a public meeting held at the CFTC's Washington headquarters.
It will include policy recommendations on oversight, including disclosures and stress testing against climate events, as well as ideas for new products for hedging against climate risk, he said, adding, ""Today the incentives around the world go in the wrong direction, and this has to change.""
Regulators in Europe have begun to weave climate risks into their supervision of markets and banks. But U.S. regulators have been slow to respond to the threats that a warming planet can pose to financial assets. These include frequent wildfires and destructive hurricanes which may jeopardize the value of assets that underlie the trillions of dollars bought and sold in the world's biggest financial markets and the farmers, banks and insurers that use those markets.
The Trump administration has sought to undercut a broad swath of U.S. and state regulations aimed at combating climate change and limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that cause it.
In June, Rostin Behnam, one of two Democrats on the five-member CFTC, signaled he wanted to change that, announcing he would form a subcommittee to examine how climate change threatens not only the derivatives markets his agency oversees but the stability of the broader financial system.
""No one else in the public sector is doing this,"" Behnam said in an interview this week. “I don't view this as a partisan issue. I view this as a matter of importance for our country.”
The panel's members are a broad group, including representatives from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  BP  (LON:BP) Plc, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Dairy Farmers of America.

Other U.S. financial regulators are watching. Last month, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said she and her fellow central bankers ""are particularly eager to learn from the work of our colleagues here and abroad,"" including the CFTC panel.

Shares of XP, Brazil’s answer to  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp., opened at $32.75 each in New York trading Wednesday after pricing at $27 Tuesday. The company had marketed the shares for $22 to $25.
The shares were up 26% to $33.96 at 12:31 p.m. in New York trading, giving the company a market value of about $18.7 billion. That makes XP more valuable than Banco BTG Pactual SA, Brazil’s biggest standalone investment bank, which is worth $15.9 billion.
The company and its existing shareholders sold 72.5 million shares Tuesday. XP also granted its underwriters the option of selling an additional 10.88 million so-called greenshoe shares, according to a statement.
XP is poised to fully exercise it, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because that information wasn’t public. That would bring the amount raised in the IPO to about $2.25 billion.
The listing is the fourth-biggest in the U.S. this year, after IPOs by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., Avantor Inc. and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT)., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s also the biggest offering by a Brazilian company since finance company Pagseguro Digital Ltd.’s $2.6 billion listing on the New York Stock Exchange in January 2018, the data show.
Selling Shareholders
XP is based in Sao Paulo and incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Its existing investors XP Controle, General Atlantic (XP) Bermuda and DYNA III Fundo de Investimento em Participacoes were among sellers, according to its filings.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, XP earned 699 million reais ($169 million) on revenue of 3.7 billion reais, according to its filings.
The offering was led by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), XP Investments and Itau BBA. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol XP.
Inspired by Charles Schwab, XP has been at the forefront of changing the way Brazilians invest by offering middle-class investors products that were once only available to the rich, while luring money away from the nation’s biggest banks at a breakneck pace.
1.5 Million Clients
The company has more than 1.5 million clients and 350 billion reais in assets under custody as of September, according to its filings. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Guilherme Benchimol said last year that he expects the company to have 1 trillion reais under custody by the end of 2020.
Itau Unibanco Holding SA isn’t divesting any of its 49.9% stake, according to the filings. The company will have dual-class share structure, giving the owners of Class B stock 10 votes a share and other holders one vote for each Class A share.
Expansion Plans
XP plans to use the proceeds to finance growth, make acquisitions and enter new businesses such as digital banking, payments and insurance. It took over the No. 1 spot for Brazil equity trading this year, surpassing UBS Group AG’s local broker-dealer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The broker received a banking license last year and plans to become a full-service lender.
Benchimol was 24 when he created XP in 2001 with Marcelo Maisonnave. Originally, they called the company XPTO, a generic placeholder in Portuguese, somewhat like XYZ in English.
After a year, Benchimol sold his car and borrowed 5,000 reais from his half-brother, XP board member Julio Capua, to keep things going, with the firm operating only as a stock brokerage.
The company was reinvented after the 2008 economic downturn, when Benchimol attended a Charles Schwab event in San Francisco, inspiring him to follow its model by creating “the first real one-stop investment shop” in Brazil, Benchimol said earlier this year."

The cancellations in part are seen as a reflection of a weakening global economy, but have cast doubt on the solidity of some disruptive businesses, while Asian deals have also suffered from the political protests in Hong Kong.
Following is a list of some of the most notable companies across the world to have pulled the plug on IPOs in 2019:
** The We Company, owner of office-sharing startup WeWork, scrapped its IPO in September, as concerns around the sustainability of its business model led to a lackluster response from investors.
** Endeavor Group Holdings, the U.S. entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood power-broker Ari Emanuel, abandoned its IPO in September following weak stock market investor demand.
** Waste management company GFL Environmental said in November that it would cancel its initial public offering, with no immediate plans to revisit the markets, after institutional investors pressed the Canadian firm to price its shares below the marketed range.
** Canadian mine financing company Triple Flag Precious Metals Corp this month withdrew a planned initial public offering, citing difficult market conditions.
** Home Credit, controlled by the Czech Republic's richest businessman Petr Kellner, dropped plans last month for a Hong Kong listing seen valued at around $1 billion after the consumer lender struggled to achieve its hoped-for valuation.
** Italian luxury yacht maker Ferretti decided to pull its initial stock offering in mid October, as it was not satisfied with the price offered by investors. The yachtmaker's chief executive officer later said it plans to bring on board a European private investor.
** Private equity giant KKR & Co (N:KKR) and its partners in October pulled a planned A$1 billion ($678.60 million) offering for lender Latitude Financial, which had been set to be Australia's biggest listing of the year.
** KKR and TPG Capital also canceled the IPO of Southeast Asia online realty company PropertyGuru, which had expected to raise up to A$380.2 million.
** Bitmain Technologies, the world's largest designer of products for mining cryptocurrencies, let its application for a Hong Kong IPO of at least $3 billion lapse in March, amid fears of price volatility as well as high-profile hacks and infrastructure failures.
** Household appliances maker JS Global Lifestyle has pulled its initial public offering of up to HK$3.62 billion ($462.63 million), two sources told Reuters in October.
** Alight, the Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group-backed HR consultant, elected to postpone its IPO indefinitely in March after declining to accept a discounted valuation."

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) on Wednesday said its North America chief executive, Jim Lentz, would retire on April 1, and tasked the unit's chief operating officer, Tetsuo ""Ted"" Ogawa, with navigating an industry shift to electrification and automation.
Ogawa has worked for Japan's biggest automaker and the United States' third-largest vehicle seller in a number of posts since 1984. He was appointed to his current role at Toyota Motor North America in November 2018.
In a statement, he said Lentz ""was instrumental in the restructuring and bringing our North American region together.""
Lentz, a 38-year-veteran of Toyota, said his long tenure including almost seven years at the helm was in part a function of the automaker's culture.
""We have a long-term view of things and try to keep our eyes on the horizon and not get sea sick with all the dips and twists and turns,"" Lentz, 64, said in an interview. ""The new normal in the world is a little more chaotic and so we have to do a better job of scenario planning.""
While the industry is facing a dramatically different future with the rise of electric, connected and autonomous vehicles as well as mobility as a service, Lentz said he saw the change as more evolutionary and revolutionary.
Lentz also noted automakers are still grappling with the continuing shift in U.S. consumer preference toward sport utility vehicles (SUVs).
Toyota is building a $1.6 billion joint venture assembly plant in Alabama with compatriot Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) that it expects to open in 2021. In July, Toyota said it would build SUVs at the plant rather than its Corolla line of cars.
Lentz said overall U.S. auto sales were around 400,000 vehicles higher than the firm forecast last year, and estimated the industry would sell about 17 million vehicles in 2019.
IMPROVED RELATIONS
Lentz guided Toyota in the United States through a number of challenges, most notably the 2010 unintended acceleration crisis that prompted the recall of millions of vehicles.
In 2014, Toyota agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department after it admitted to misleading consumers in relation to the matter.
More recently, Toyota under Lentz improved its relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump and helped stave off vehicle import tariffs. Lentz attended a White House event in July after presidential adviser Ivanka Trump toured Toyota's Kentucky operations in March."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporations with market capitalizations of less than $2 billion have been slower than larger companies to appoint more women to their boards of directors, according to an annual study from the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD).
The percentage of women on the boards of small companies with market capitalizations from $300 million to $2 billion rose to 17% in 2019 from 13% in 2017. The percentage of women on the boards of companies in the Russell 3000, accounting for most of the U.S. stock market, rose to 19% from 15% over the same time period, according to the report, prepared by NACD with data provider Main Data Group.
Small companies ""are bringing the overall average down,"" said Barton Edgerton, researcher at NACD.
Asset managers such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and proxy advisers, who make recommendations to smaller investors, have been pushing companies to add diversity to their boards by adding women. The largest companies, which are frequently in the spotlight, were the first to respond. Edgerton said bigger companies often have larger boards, making it easier for them to diversify.
""When we ask directors about the biggest barriers to growth and diversity, (what we have heard) consistently over the past several years is that there's no spots open and there's not enough turnover on the board,"" Edgerton said.
Companies with market capitalizations over $200 billion, of which there are few, have the largest percentage of female directors at roughly 27% this year, according to the study.
D'Anne Hurd, a director at companies including Eileen Fisher Inc, added that fewer women are on the boards of small corporations because they often grow out of venture capital and private equity firms, which are male dominated.
""Large firms have the budget to hire search firms,"" Hurd added by email. ""CEOs of small companies, to save money, talk to their friends."""
97,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 11:11AM ET</span>",How Uber drains carmaker profits in Latin America's biggest market,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Like many Uber (N:UBER) drivers in Sao Paulo, the ride-hailing app's busiest city in the world, Augusto Caio Pereira does not actually own or lease the car he nudges through the city's notorious traffic jams every day. 
Instead, he rents Brazil's best-selling car, the Chevrolet Onix hatchback, for 390 reais ($93) a week from Localiza Rent a Car (SA:RENT3), the country's largest rental company. 
""I like to say that every Monday and Tuesday, I drive to pay the cost of the car"" including gas, the 23-year-old Pereira said. ""And Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are for me.""
Pereira lost his job at a law firm a few months ago, joining Brazil's 12 million unemployed. But now, with no money down, he drives full-time. 
Like him, two thirds of Uber's 600,000 drivers in Brazil do not own their vehicles, an executive told rental car executives in October. That figure, previously unreported, is one of the highest proportions worldwide for Uber.
Cheap access to new cars is turbocharging the growth of Uber and rental car companies in Brazil, as well as lifting automakers' sales - up 7% this year. 
Yet the sales growth also obscures a deeper crisis for carmakers such as General Motors (N:GM): their margins are imploding as rental companies gobble up more and more cars at discounted prices.
Bulk orders, known as fleet sales, are at a record high and now account for 46% of all deals in Brazil, up from 25% in 2012, according to dealership association Fenabrave. But retail sales, commanding higher prices, have collapsed by nearly half in the same period, suggesting something of a race to the bottom. 
""What automakers see is that their clients, such as rental companies, are making a lot of money with their products, while they are not making any,"" said Ricardo Bacellar, automotive head at KPMG's consulting arm in Brazil. 
""This fleet sales model is unsustainable in the long term.""
Car bosses from Detroit to Wolfsburg are keenly aware of the corrosive impact of fleet sales. Since 2015, automakers with factories in Brazil, including GM, Volkwsagen Ag (DE:VOWG_p) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), have received over $50 billion in subsidies from headquarters, according to data from Brazil's central bank.
That is triple the amount received between 2010 and 2014. 
""The only reason we were able to keep operating in the last few years is because our headquarters offered us loans or injected capital,"" Luiz Carlos Moraes, president of Brazil's auto industry association Anfavea, said this year. 
Meanwhile, the top three rental companies had record profits in all but one year since 2015, financial statements show. 
SIGN OF THE TIMES
Latin America's largest domestic auto market offers a glimpse of a worst-case scenario for global automakers in coming years as ride-hailing apps and their partners eat away both carmakers' profits and consumer appetite to buy vehicles.
One recent survey presented by Anfavea showed that transportation alternatives like Uber were the second reason, after weak personal finances, dissuading Brazilians from buying cars. 
Uber is eager to exploit the tension between rent-a-cars and automakers to push prices down as it grows its driver ranks in Brazil - its second largest market - which is largely made up of those unable to afford car ownership. 
The ride-hailing app is recruiting smaller rental companies with the promise that an influx of drivers will help squeeze higher discounts from automakers. 
By contrast, GM, despite leading the market every year since 2015, has lost so much money in Brazil that it has considered shutting down factories. 
Carlos Zarlenga, its top regional executive, posted a warning on factory bulletin boards in January. 
""We are living a critical moment,"" he wrote. 
""GM in Brazil has posted significant losses between 2016 and 2018, a situation that CANNOT BE REPEATED,"" read the message, which was seen by Reuters.
GM declined to answer questions about fleet sales' impact, as did Volkswagen and Ford.
The scale of the wholesale discount to rental companies is a closely guarded secret. 
However, the average price of all cars Localiza bought this year – including SUVs, commercial vans and bulletproof luxury cars – was about $640 below the dealer price for the cheapest Onix, according to companies' figures.
In effect, Brazilian rental companies, bolstered by Uber's scale, have taken on the role of lessor usually fulfilled by dealerships in other markets. But unlike dealers, often small businesses tied to brands, the rent-a-car market is more concentrated and cost-sensitive, pushing down wholesale prices.
Fleet sales in Brazil crossed the 1 million mark for the first time in 2018, and are already at 1.1 million this year. 
Meanwhile, Localiza went from buying 2% of the country's new cars and light trucks in 2012 to 10% this year. Ride-hailing drivers are its fastest-growing segment.
(GRAPHIC: Brazil's carmakers struggle but rent-a-cars thrive - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/UBER-AUTOS/0H001QXP89VL/index.html)
""DESPERATE SALES""
With Brazil only recovering slowly from recession since 2017, automakers have had little choice but to follow demand into wholesale, said Guido Vildozo, of research firm IHS Markit. 
""These are desperate vehicle sales,"" he said. 
In 2013, the year before Uber came to Brazil, just 6% of new Chevrolet Onix units were fleet sales. This year it is over 40%. 
But selling more has not been a silver bullet.
Explaining why revenue was down in 2019 outside North America, GM told investors recently that a big reason was an ""unfavorable mix primarily due to increased sales of the Chevrolet Onix in Brazil.""
In October, Caleb Varner, Uber's head of vehicles for Latin America, pitched to dozens of small rental car company executives at a niche conference attended by Reuters. He assured them Uber would help bring new demand to rent-a-cars. 
""With that demand you guys can grow in scale ... buy more cars, and obtain higher discounts from automakers,"" Varner said, calling it a ""virtuous circle"" for Uber and rental companies. 
Uber declined to comment on Varner's remarks, though its Brazil CEO Claudia Woods told Reuters rent-a-cars are important partners.
Despite initial fears at Uber's arrival in 2014, rental companies including the biggest three - Localiza, Unidas (SA:LCAM3) and Movida (SA:MOVI3) - now have close relations. 
Movida opened a store dedicated solely to ride-hailing drivers last month and holds monthly meetings with Uber, its chief commercial officer Jamyl Jarrus said. 
Uber has gone to significant lengths to appeal to rental car companies, ensuring they get automatically paid before a driver pockets earnings, which also keeps them on the road longer.
With many car factories still underutilized because of weak recovery, automakers do not yet see a way out of the cycle other than sucking up losses until the economy prospers again or the unwanted solution of quitting Brazil.
Ford shut its oldest Brazilian factory this year, after losing billions of dollars in the region.
Some automakers, which have been offering rental cars directly in developed markets for years, are now experimenting with the same strategy in Brazil. 
Toyota, which has fewer fleet sales than GM, is ""investing heavily"" in a rental business in Brazil, it said. Brazil's CAOA - which makes cars for Chery and Hyundai - announced on Tuesday that it would set up its own rental business. 

With fleet sales in Brazil set to keep rising, according to a recent KPMG poll of auto executives, their conundrum looks likely to deepen. ""The model is here to stay,"" Localiza CEO Eugenio Mattar told Reuters.

Shares of the Pittsburgh-based company fell about 7%, having lost about 22% so far this year. 
Stiff competition in the retail space has forced U.S. apparel makers, slower in offering latest fashion, to spend heavily on promotions to compete with fashion-forward brands from  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and European players Zara (MC:ITX) and H&M (ST:HMb). 
Spain-based Zara said on Wednesday it expects like-for-like sales to rise 4% to 6% for the year, while Target last month posted a 10% growth in quarterly comparable sales in its apparel business.
""After back-to-school, we experienced softer demand in certain apparel categories, primarily in men's and women's tops, which led to higher markdowns,"" American Eagle Chief Executive Officer Jay Schottenstein said in a post-earnings call, adding that some of those pressures continue into the fourth quarter.
""The team is working harder to strengthen the areas of underperformance,"" Schottenstein said. 
Fewer days in the holiday shopping season this year will further hit American Eagle, along with other retailers, with the gap between Thanksgiving and Christmas being shorter by six days than last year. 
American Eagle expects to earn between 34 cents and 36 cents per share in the fourth quarter, well below analysts' expectation of 46 cents. It said the outlook assumed greater gross margin pressure than in the reported quarter.
Comparable sales are expected to be about flat, the company said, much lower than the 4.34% growth analysts had projected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The retailer in the third quarter had new discounts on its Aerie bralettes, AE tops and sweatshirts to entice shoppers, but that came at the cost of lower gross margins.
Gross margin took a hit, falling to 38.2% from 39.8% a year earlier, as a result of the higher markdowns.
For the quarter ended Nov 2., the retailer earned 48 cents per share, meeting market expectations. 
Net income fell nearly 6% to $80.76 million.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - MM Warburg, part-owned by one of Germany's oldest banking dynasties, offered on Wednesday to repay some gains from a share trading scheme at the center of the country's biggest post-war fraud case, a letter seen by Reuters showed.
The trial in Bonn is focused primarily on two investment bankers and is the first in a wider investigation aimed at recovering billions from banks which prosecutors say profited from so-called cum ex trades.
A court spokesman told Reuters by telephone that a judge had told the court last week that the trading was illegal and amounted to tax evasion.
That, in turn, prompted Warburg's lawyers to write to the lead judge in the case saying that the bank was willing to repay some of its gains, a message that was also delivered in court on Wednesday, a spokesman for the bank told Reuters.
Warburg's lawyers said in the letter it had not deliberately sought to defraud the state, adding that it had 'intensified' talks with the authorities to repay some of the money.
The letter did not say how much cash Warburg was willing to repay, but the spokesman said it was able to cope with any possible repayment and that some money had been set aside.
Warburg, set up in Hamburg by members of the Warburg family, is one of the banks named in the state prosecutor's charge sheet as a beneficiary of the multi-billion euro trading scheme.
Prosecutors allege that players in the scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit by trading shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds.
Germany estimates this cost it more than 5 billion euros in total, although experts believe it was at least twice that.
The trial is being closely followed in London and Frankfurt, where bankers say much of the trading was organized.
German state prosecutor Anne Brorhilker outlined criminal charges against two bankers at the launch of the case this year.
One of them, Martin Shields, has told the court that the trading thrived between 2005 and 2012, as investors from around the globe made multi-billion-euro trades on German companies.
Brorhilker has outlined more than 30 instances of double-tax reclaims totaling 447 million euros ($493 million). Of those, 166 million euros involve Warburg, the charge sheet shows.

101,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 09:39AM ET</span>",The Wall Street Bankers Who Burst Aramco’s $2 Trillion Bubble,"(Bloomberg) -- The chairman of the world’s biggest oil company was about to lose his temper.At a meeting in Riyadh on a sultry October evening, Achintya Mangla, one of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s most senior bankers, had told Yasir Al-Rumayyan there was no way international investors were going to value   Saudi Aramco   (SE:2222) -- just weeks away from an initial public offering -- at $2 trillion.Al-Rumayyan, who’d risen in just a few years from head of a mid-sized investment bank in Riyadh to one of the most powerful jobs in the global economy, erupted. He unleashed a torrent of expletives in Arabic and English that shocked the roomful of battle-hardened bankers. The chairman was probably worried about telling his boss, the crown prince who locked up many of the nation’s wealthiest people in a five-star hotel just two years ago.In the three and a half years since Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman first proposed an initial public offering of Aramco, the state oil company that pumps 10% of the world’s oil, the $2 trillion valuation had caused trouble.
The prince, who runs the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom, had long insisted on the stratospheric valuation, almost double any other business on the planet, and nobody had been able to convince him global investors didn’t agree. Anyone who argued with him got pushed aside, including Khalid Al-Falih, sacked as Aramco chairman and oil minister earlier this year.
This account is based on interviews with bankers, consultants, executives, government officials and members of the royal family, many of whom asked not to be identified discussing private meetings and conversations. Aramco, the banks and fund managers all declined to comment.
When bankers pitched for a role on the IPO this year, they told Al-Rumayyan what he needed to hear: that $2 trillion wasn’t out of the question. The range initially pitched by Wall Street was $1.7 trillion to $2.4 trillion, according to people involved in the process.But as the sale came closer, the valuation was becoming unsustainable. In September and early October, Aramco’s bankers toured the world informally pitching the deal to fund managers from Boston to London to Tokyo. Everywhere, foreign investors told the company the valuation was too high. In Switzerland, where trillions are managed for the world’s richest people, fund manager Pictet & Cie. had an initial valuation as low as $800 billion.The bankers took notes. A spreadsheet summarizing feedback, seen by Bloomberg News, is a who’s who of the global fund industry, from Capital Group, a large investor in natural resources, to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the biggest fund manager. The consensus from foreign investors was around a valuation of around $1.2 trillion. A few signaled they could go a bit higher. “Up to $1.5 trillion based on dividend,” was the feedback from Franklin Templeton, the emerging markets specialist and among the most generous.The problem for many investors was summarized in two words: dividend yield. At $2 trillion, Aramco would pay shareholders a dividend equivalent to a return of less than 4% on their money, well below what  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc,  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and other major oil companies pay.
Investors need a much higher yield, requiring a lower valuation. Wellington Asset Management, which controls $1 trillion in assets, told bankers the dividend yield needed to rise to 7% to 8% to make the company a worthwhile investment, implying a valuation of about $900 billion.The job of JPMorgan’s Mangla that evening in October was to break the news to the client. Speaking on behalf of the band of banks hired for the deal, he burst the $2 trillion bubble, according to two people who attended the meeting.
Mangla wasn’t the only one who tried to give Al-Rumayyan an unvarnished version of events. Jonathan Penkin, a senior equity capital markets banker at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., was told not to speak at any more meetings after he tried to talk about the valuation later in October, according to people familiar with the discussions. Motassim Al-Ma’Ashouq, the top Aramco executive in charge of the IPO preparations, and the person who had met foreign investors in preparatory talks, was also sidelined.
“Saudi Arabia has always had this problem: top-down decision making,” said Karen Young, a Middle East specialist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a specialist in the political economy of the Middle East. “There’s a culture of fear. Savvy and able technocrats don’t feel comfortable speaking up.”​
Saudi Arabia also drew a blank with strategic investors, which often agree to buy into an IPO earlier than others, becoming cornerstone shareholders on the deal. Aramco’s banks pitched from China to Singapore, Russia to Malaysia. Everywhere, they got a polite thanks, but no thanks.
Al-Rumayyan, 49, who had no experience of the oil and gas industry before becoming Aramco chairman, felt betrayed by the very same Wall Street bankers who had told him that securing a $2 trillion IPO was possible. Saudi Arabia had a tough choice -- go ahead, lose face and settle for a valuation below $1.5 trillion and attract foreign investors. Or delay the deal, perhaps forever.
Riyadh, keen to restore the kingdom’s standing after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, opted for a third way: ignore foreign investors, and sell the Aramco shares at home. The government would pressure wealthy local families, many of whom had members locked up in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton in 2017, and bring in a few friends in the Middle East region, including funds controlled by the governments of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Even then, it had to compromise on the valuation, settling for $1.7 trillion.
The new IPO is a shadow of the initial plan, but still allows the crown prince to claim victory. Last Thursday, Aramco announced it raised a record $25.6 billion, beating the $25 billion set by Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group. The valuation means the world’s most valuable company, until now Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., will trade in Riyadh not in the U.S.
For Wall Street, already stung by the collapse of WeWork’s IPO and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Technology Inc.’s chronic under-performance, Aramco is another embarrassment. After offering unrealistic valuations to win a place on the deal, the world’s most famous banks were unable to deliver, attracting scorn from their client and derision from investors. Now, many banks face the prospect of not getting paid for nearly four years of work.
The fact the IPO happened at all this year was a surprise.The deal has been in the works since early 2016, when Prince Mohammed told The Economist newspaper he thought privatization would aid his Vision 2030 campaign to modernize the oil-dependent Saudi economy. But the sale, initially scheduled for 2018, was delayed several times as the Saudi leadership grappled with where to list it and how much it was worth.
By the start of this year, then Aramco chairman and oil minister, Al-Falih, believed the IPO was in the deep freeze and he hoped the deal would go away for good. But the crown prince and Al-Rumayyan, who headed the sovereign wealth fund that would get the proceeds, were still keen. He sought advice.
Throughout the stop-start IPO, one banker played a key role, although he rarely sought the limelight. The boutique operation of Michael Klein, a veteran Wall Street dealmaker who’d gone out on his own when he wasn’t made CEO of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). during the financial crisis, advised Aramco directly, helping the company’s chairman to select the banks which would handle the IPO. Alongside Lazard Ltd. and Moelis & Co., Al-Rumayyan appointed his firm as an independent financial adviser.
If anyone could have warned Al-Rumayyan that Wall Street was inflating the Aramco valuation to win the IPO mandate, it was the ever-present Klein. He never did. According to several people, Klein thwarted attempts to have a discussion with the Saudi government about the valuation.
Another boutique bank, Evercore Inc., who worked on the IPO from 2016 to 2018, didn’t return. One of their top bankers, David Waring, warned the kingdom early in the process the $2 trillion was going to be very hard to achieve. Second time around, they ensured they weren’t on the deal by proposing a fee Aramco refused to pay.
While work on the IPO had slowed to a crawl, the crown prince was still insisting the sale take place by early 2021. But in the summer, Al-Rumayyan became anxious the U.S.-China trade war was going to cause an economic slowdown, sending crude prices tumbling and ruling out an IPO for several years.“The royal palace panicked thinking oil prices were about to crash,” said a person who has worked on the IPO for nearly four years. “They saw two options: rush the IPO immediately, or forget about it until much, much later”.First, Saudi Arabia tried to juice the oil market, cutting production to 9.6 million barrels a day, more than 700,000 barrels a day below its official OPEC quota. For the kingdom, it was an unprecedented move. Even so the price of oil briefly dropped to close to $55 a barrel in August, below the $60 to $70 a barrel range that was needed to support the IPO.Al-Rumayyan, convinced time was running out, decided the deal needed to be fast-tracked, persuading Prince Mohammed that if he wanted an IPO, he should put him in charge.
Paid the Price
Al-Falih, who mixed administrative ability with an abrasive style, paid the price for his opposition. He was removed as Aramco chairman on Sept. 3 and replaced by Al-Rumayyan. (He was replaced as oil minister a few weeks later.) The IPO’s champion now sat at the head of the company.With little time to organize the deal, Aramco ruled out an international listing. But Al-Rumayyan still wanted to bring billions in international money into Saudi Arabia. To ensure success – and positive coverage from analysts – he hired almost every bank on Wall Street including Goldman Sachs,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan.Al-Rumayyan and Amin Nasser, the Aramco CEO, thought the IPO would be fairly easy. Only a few months earlier, the company had sold its first -- massively oversubscribed -- international bond.
Perhaps blinded by that success, Aramco walked into the IPO under-prepared. Despite four years of work, executives still struggled to answer simple questions from foreign investors, its legal team couldn’t produce documents on time, and nobody at Aramco could convincingly explain why Aramco deserved its $2 trillion valuation.
Then in the early hours of Sept. 14, a fleet of drones attacked the very heart of the Saudi oil industry – the giant crude processing plant at Abqaiq in the kingdom’s eastern desert. Half of Aramco’s production was knocked out in minutes.
Blamed Iran
The kingdom blamed Iran for the attack, but said there would be no interruption in oil supplies to customers around the world. Oil traders, looking at photos of punctured tanks and mangled pipework, were skeptical. Many assumed the IPO would have to be delayed.Prince Mohammed told advisers a delay would be a victory for Iran. The new oil minister, the crown prince’s half-brother Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, and Aramco CEO Nasser promised the damage could be fixed in weeks. Bankers on the IPO were told to keep working.
Saudi Arabia did everything they could to boost the valuation: tax rates were cut further and investors were offered incentives to buy the shares. The intention to float was finally announced by Al-Rumayyan and Nasser on Nov. 4.
But the feedback from international investors didn’t improve. At a meeting in the early hours of Nov. 17, Saudi Arabia decided to scale back the size of the IPO and scrap plans to market the shares internationally. A roadshow in London and other financial capitals was scrapped. The Wall Street banks, who’d fought so hard to get a mandate, were dumped.
The deal became what Prince Abdulaziz, the oil minister, described as “our family and friends” IPO, relying on local retail investors, rich Saudis and regional governments. The Saudi government even spent more than $2 billion of its own cash buying shares. An unsuccessful attempt was even made to persuade Qatar – under economic blockade by Riyadh – to make a large investment.
The deal got done. Prince Mohammed might even get his wish. In a press conference at OPEC’s Vienna HQ Prince Abdulaziz scolded the international press for their coverage of the IPO and said the company would trade at more than $2 trillion in a few months. On the first day of trading, the price jumped 10%, giving a market value of $1.88 trillion.
“Those who have not subscribed in Aramco will be chewing their thumb to the point that I will be worried about them that they go and fix themselves in the hospital,” the oil minister said later in an interview."

104,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 09:02AM ET</span>",Amazon's Deliveroo deal put in jeopardy by UK regulator's 'serious concerns',"LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon's purchase of a stake in online food delivery group Deliveroo has been put in doubt by Britain's competition regulator which said it raised ""serious competition concerns"" for consumers and may require an in-depth investigation.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) led a $575 million fundraising in Deliveroo in May, making what the two parties called ""a minority investment"" and pitching it against Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, Just Eat and Takeaway.com in the global race to dominate the market for takeaway meal deliveries.
The deal would allow Amazon to participate in the management of Deliveroo, which has grown rapidly since being founded in 2013. It now has global sales of close to 500 million pounds ($642 million) and operates in over 100 towns and cities across Britain.
Neither company has disclosed a figure for Amazon's funding contribution.
After completing a ""Phase 1"" probe, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday it would proceed to an in-depth investigation if Amazon and Deliveroo failed to offer legally binding proposals that addressed its concerns.
The CMA's initial probe found that the investment, in its current form, could harm competition in two ways.
Firstly, the regulator is concerned it could damage competition in online restaurant food delivery by discouraging Amazon from re-entering a market it exited last year.
Secondly, the CMA is concerned the deal could damage competition in the emerging market for online convenience grocery delivery, where Amazon and Deliveroo have already established market-leading positions.
“If the deal were to proceed in its current form, there’s a real risk that it could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower quality services as these markets develop,"" CMA Executive Director Andrea Gomes da Silva said.
""This is because the significant competition which could otherwise exist between Amazon and Deliveroo would be reduced.”
""ADD TO COMPETITION""
Responding to the CMA, Deliveroo and Amazon both defended the deal.
""We are confident that we will persuade the CMA of the facts that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers,"" Deliveroo said in a statement.
Amazon said Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and supporters.
""Amazon believes that this investment funding will lead to more pro-consumer innovation,"" it added.
The CMA has given the two companies five working days to present their proposals. The regulator would then have five working days to consider whether to accept their offer instead of referring the case to an in-depth probe.
That timetable indicates a decision from the CMA in late December - around the time the takeover battle for Just Eat, involving Takeaway and Prosus, is expected to come to a head.
In June, the CMA served an initial enforcement order (IEO) on Amazon and Deliveroo, signaling possible concerns about the transaction. The order required the two companies to operate independently, effectively putting a brake on the deal.
The CMA then launched a formal ""Phase 1"" merger inquiry in October.
Since former lawmaker Andrew Tyrie became chairman of the CMA last year, it has increasingly bared its teeth.
In April it blocked supermarket group Sainsbury's 7.3 billion pound ($9.4 billion) agreed takeover of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) owned rival Asda.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday as the deadline approached for new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and investors awaited the outcome of major central bank policy meetings. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has only days to decide whether to impose tariffs on nearly $160 billion in Chinese goods, a move that would exacerbate the long-running trade war. 
The White House's top economic and trade advisers are expected to meet in coming days with Trump over the decision, a source told Reuters, though a final decision has not been made.
Amid the uncertainty over trade - the overriding focus for investors through the year - the Euro STOXX 600 fell, then recovered, and was last down 0.1%. 
The British pound, a high-flier of late, dropped from a seven-month peak after an opinion poll projected a narrower-than-expected victory for the Conservative party in the British election on Thursday. The election is set to decide how the UK will leave the European Union, if at all.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, eked out a small gain. Wall Street futures indicated U.S. stocks would open unchanged.
Investors said an initial trade deal was still likely, since it would benefit both Washington and Beijing. 
""We still believe that the phase-one deal is something that is convenient for both the presidents on the political and economic side,"" Alessia Berardi, senior economist at Amundi. ""If the tariffs will be implemented it will be a disaster in the short term."" 
In the Middle East,  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) shares surged 10% above their initial public offering price in their first day of trading. That gave the state-controlled oil company a market value of about $1.88 trillion, making it the world's most valuable listed company.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had earlier risen 0.5%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 led gains with 0.7% rises. 
Investors also focused on meetings by major central banks. 
At its policy meeting and outlook for the economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold rates steady, with investors watching for changes to its view on the economy and its 2% growth forecast for next year.
The Fed's statement is due at 1900 GMT. 
A surprise to the upside when U.S. inflation data are released at 1330 GMT would further reduce chances for rate cuts next year.
The European Central Bank will hold its first meeting and news conference with Christine Lagarde as president on Thursday. 
""Everything is positioned for the two major central banks to stay accommodative,"" Berardi said. 
STERLING RALLY STOPS
The pound fell as low as $1.3107 after a YouGov poll showed the ruling Conservatives heading towards a slimmer majority than was forecast a fortnight ago. YouGov's research director said the results showed a hung parliament was possible. 
Sterling later recovered some of its losses after dropping 1% from its high on Tuesday, when investors were more confident of a Conservative victory that they expect will end uncertainty over Britain's exit from the EU. It was last trading flat at $1.3151.
Elsewhere among currencies, Sweden's crown jumped to eight-month highs after strong inflation increased the likelihood it would end negative interest rates.

The dollar rose 0.1% against a basket of six major currencies to 97.515.
In commodities, Brent futures fell by 52 cents, or 0.8%, to $63.82 per barrel by late morning, after industry data showed an unexpected build-up in crude inventories in the United States.

108,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 07:14AM ET</span>",'Vindication' - Saudi Arabia hails 10% debut jump in Aramco shares,"By Marwa Rashad, Saeed Azhar and Stephen Kalin
RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) shares surged the maximum permitted 10% above their IPO price on their Riyadh stock market debut on Wednesday, in a move hailed by the government as a vindication of its towering $2 trillion valuation of the state oil company.
The shares leapt to 35.2 riyals ($9.39) each, up from the initial public offering (IPO) price of 32 riyals and at the daily limit of price moves allowed by the Tadawul exchange.
That gives Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Aramco) a market value of about $1.88 trillion, comfortably making it the world's most valuable listed company and closing in on the $2 trillion price tag long coveted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
""It's a great day for Saudi Arabia and the leadership of Saudi Arabia and for the people of Saudi Arabia. It's a D-Day for Aramco, it's a day of reckoning and vindication,"" Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Reuters in Madrid.
Aramco raised a record $25.6 billion in its IPO last week, the culmination of a years-long effort by the Crown Prince to open up the energy giant to outside investors and raise funds to help diversify the economy away from oil.
But the kingdom cut back original plans to sell a 5% stake and include a foreign listing after lukewarm interest from international investors worried about Aramco's governance, the environment and regional instability - particularly after drone attacks on major Aramco facilities in September.
The company sold just a 1.5% stake and relied on mainly domestic and regional buyers.
Prince Abdulaziz said last week that Aramco was worth well over its IPO valuation of $1.7 trillion and predicted investors who didn't buy into the offering would be ""chewing their thumbs"" after missing out.
The flotation propels the Riyadh bourse into the world's top 10 by value of listed companies.
The early share price gain values Aramco at more than six times U.S. oil major  Exxon Mobil  Corp (XOM); more than twice Saudi Arabia's annual gross domestic product; and far ahead of U.S. tech giant Apple's (O:AAPL) $1.2 trillion price tag.
""This is a successful IPO and the Aramco listing will add depth to the local market by providing exposure to a vital sector of Saudi Arabia's economy,"" said Bassel Khatoun, managing director, frontier and MENA at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity.
""We are hopeful that Saudi Aramco uses the Tadawul listing as a springboard to an eventual international listing.""
But investing in Aramco is a bet on the price of oil and growth in global demand for crude is expected to slow from 2025 as global steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions are rolled out and the use of electric vehicles increases.
'GROWTH POTENTIAL'
Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters the bulk of the IPO proceeds would be used on domestic projects, while the global buzz around the listing would help attract foreign capital into the Saudi economy.
""Productively deployed, we believe the assets could also help maintain growth potential through our three-year ratings horizon,"" credit ratings agency S&P said in a recent report.
Aramco's debut comes as oil prices are being supported by a Saudi-orchestrated move by OPEC and oil producing allies to commit to some of the industry's deepest output cuts in a decade to try to avert oversupply.
Aramco shares began trading half an hour after the market open as the bourse allowed extra time for investors to place bids in the ""opening auction"" in anticipation of high demand.
Aramco chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan and Tadawul's top executives rang the bell to start trading. Within the first hour, 766.8 million shares had changed hands, more than for any other Riyadh listed stock.
Aramco stock will become part of Tadawul index by next week and global benchmarks such as MSCI and FTSE later this month, which analysts said should fuel demand, particularly from investors who track such indexes.
The Saudi index (TASI) was up 1.1% at 1115 GMT.
Saudi retail investors who hold their Aramco shares for six months from the first day of trading can get up to 100 bonus shares, or one for every 10 held, which could limit supply of the stock, said Zachary Cefaratti, CEO of Dalma Capital.
Aramco will have the second biggest weighting on the Tadawul index of 9.7%, according to Al Rajhi Capital. Al Rajhi Bank (SE:1120) has the biggest weighting at 14.6% due to its larger free float.
If Aramco shares gain 10% on both Wednesday and Thursday, its valuation will surpass $2 trillion. The company is expected to be included in the MSCI emerging markets index on Dec. 17.
Aramco did not name its investors during the IPO process, but sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) bought shares."

Trafigura Group Ltd. posted record oil and metals trading results as it benefited from volatile energy prices, but a bevy of asset impairments and writedowns cut profit to the lowest in nine years.
Gross profit from oil trading surged to a record $1.7 billion in the year ended Sept. 30 as the Singapore-based trading house exploited price swings and a strong position in U.S. oil and LNG exports. While metals and minerals matched last year’s performance in what Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Weir called a “knockout year” for trading, net income fell 0.5% to $868 million.
“We did have impairments in our industrial assets business, which offset the general performance of the company,” Weir said on Wednesday.
Those writedowns -- at a troubled iron ore port in Brazil, its struggling fuel distribution business Puma Energy and its disastrous equity investment in zinc smelter Nyrstar -- took some of the sheen off the trading performance. Still, the No. 2 independent oil and metals trader showed its core business of buying, blending, storing and transporting commodities retains the ability to spit out cash.
The $315 million of writedowns and impairments were partly offset by a $201 million gain from the sale of shipping assets, including 29 newly-built oil tanker leases.
The owners of the 26 year-old company, a group of 700 traders and executives, saw the value of their share buybacks slashed by 36% to $337 million, the lowest in at least eight years. The buybacks are the principal way the firm returns capital to its shareholders and since 2010 Trafigura has paid out more than $5.8 billion.
The reduction in buybacks helped boost the company’s equity value by almost 9% to $6.8 billion. Total debt, a focus of criticism by short-seller Iceberg Research, fell 4% to $31 billion. Adjusted debt, which strips out inventories that can be easily sold as well as cash and securitized receivables, dropped 12% to $5.3 billion.
Weir said Trafigura expects 2020 to be another good trading year, with the global trade war ensuring price volatility and market uncertainty. He also expects the company to come under more pressure on environmental, sustainability and governance issues.

BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc plans to increase prices of imported Model 3 vehicles in China in January, sources familiar with the matter said.
Tesla plans to increase prices of imported Model 3 vehicles with longer range and those with performance function, which are currently priced at 439,900 yuan ($62,495.56) and 509,900 yuan, respectively.
The move comes as Tesla, which is building a car plant in Shanghai, aims to deliver China-made Model 3 sedans, which are priced at 355,800 yuan, to customers before Jan. 25 next year.
It was unclear by how much Tesla plans to increase the China prices. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to media. 
Tesla declined to comment.
The electric vehicle maker began production in the Shanghai factory in October on a trial basis and aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of this year.
The plant's mass production schedule is crucial for Tesla's hopes of raising its annual production rate to 500,000 vehicles by the end of this year.
The $2 billion factory, Tesla's first car manufacturing site outside the United States, is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars.

Duterte described the concession agreements with Manila Water Co Inc (PS:MWC) and Maynilad Water Services as ""onerous and disadvantageous"" to the public, prompting them to be revoked in a move that could turn off investors at a time the government is seeking foreign capital to modernize its infrastructure.
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, the country's regulator, told lawmakers it had revoked last week a decision extending the water concession deals with the two utilities until 2037, sending their shares tumbling more than 13%. The existing concessions will expire on 2022.
The firms, which are servicing a combined 16 million customers, secured 25-year concession agreements in 1997, which were extended in 2009 by a further 15 years.
Duterte acted after Manila Water and Maynilad won arbitration cases in Singapore against the government.
The arbitration court in Singapore ordered the Philippines government to pay the utilities a combined 10.8 billion pesos ($212.14 million) in compensation. The companies had said they would forfeit any damage claims to avoid angering the president.
""These companies not only have inefficiently delivered water to the households, but exacted unconscionable amounts from the taxpayers,"" Salvador Panelo, Duterte's spokesman, said in a statement.
The water utilities' woes display a violation of the sanctity of contracts, Guenter Taus, former president of the European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, told Reuters. ""It does not instill investor's confidence. You can't just go out and revoke contracts,"" Taus said. The embattled companies' shares continued their decline on Wednesday, with Manila Water slumping 14%. Maynilad stockholders Metro Pacific Investments Corp (PS:MPI) and DMCI Holdings Inc (PS:DMC) sank 13% and 13.4%, respectively. Manila Water president Jose Rene Almendras told lawmakers the company has yet to study the impact of the regulator's decision. ""There should be a clean process because we have commitments both in terms of capital expenditures, projects and loans,"" Maynilad chief operating officer Randolph Estrellado said.

116,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 05:22AM ET</span>","IATA cuts 2019 airline profit forecast, sees stability in 2020","By Laurence Frost
GENEVA (Reuters) - Airline profits are on course to fall faster than expected in 2019 as trade wars hit global commerce and broader confidence, the industry's main global body said on Wednesday, while predicting a modest recovery next year.
Cutting its full-year net profit forecast to $25.9 billion, a 5.1% decline from 2018, the International Air Transport Association said an improvement in 2020 was contingent on a ""truce"" in global trade disputes. In June it had forecast $28 billion in profit this year. 
""Trade wars produce no winners,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told an annual media briefing.
De Juniac also cited slower growth, Brexit and social unrest among factors that ""all came together to create a tougher than anticipated business environment for airlines"" in 2019.
IATA slashed its full-year global revenue forecast to $838 billion from the $899 billion predicted in June and said it expected an improvement to $872 billion for 2020.
""We've downgraded our forecasts for 2019 pretty much across the board,"" chief economist Brian Pearce said. ""It's pretty clear that this has been driven mostly by the impact of trade wars.""
Reflecting downward pressure on fares, net profit per passenger fell to $5.70 this year from $6.22, with the industry's net profit margin expected to decline to 3.1% this year from 3.4% in 2018.
But the sharpest deterioration is being felt in airlines' cargo businesses - where a 3.3% drop in freight demand marked the steepest decline since the 2009 financial crisis, with revenue down 8% year-on-year.
Growth in world trade has all but evaporated to an expected 0.9% this year, sharply down from the 2.5% forecast in June and the 4.1% expansion predicted a year ago, IATA said. 
Underpinning the partial recovery predicted next year, IATA forecast more robust trade growth of 3.3% as ""election-year pressures in the U.S. contribute to reduced trade tensions"".
The nine-month-old grounding of the Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX has had a significant impact on some airlines, though less than 0.5% of the global fleet is directly affected.
Pearce said the expected return of a backlog of hundreds of stranded MAX jets to the market in 2020 could produce a surge in capacity that would be ""hard to swallow"" for aircraft markets - offset partly by the retirement of older jets.
While a handful of carriers led by U.S. majors dominate the industry's overall profits, the past year has also seen a slew of airline failures mainly in Europe.

Pearce said he saw scope for further consolidation because of the high proportion of airlines that had failed to perform in an industry that remains highly fragmented because of regulations making cross-border tie-ups difficult to carry out.

117,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Aramco's Soaring Debut Should Fool No-One,"By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -   Saudi Aramco   (SE:2222), the world’s most valuable company, got off to a flying start on its debut Wednesday, rising 10% within minutes of opening, the maximum allowed by the Tadawul exchange in Riyadh.
Suspended at 35.20 riyals a share, the company had a market valuation of $1.88 trillion, over 30% more than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and less than 6% shy of the magical $2 trillion desired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler.
The news is hardly a surprise, though, given how tightly the offering has been stage-managed, and western institutional investors are unlikely to regret baulking at the $2 trillion price tag. Nor should retail investors outside the kingdom be too upset at being effectively denied the opportunity.
The fact is that a deal which initially aimed to bring in outside capital to enhance Aramco’s governance and finance the kingdom’s diversification away from oil has mutated into one where Saudi Arabia has moved money from one pocket to another, while institutions and individuals from around the region who already have a high direct or indirect exposure to oil have found another way to get more exposure to it.
According to the company’s own documents, Saudi government institutions have taken up 13.2% of the total offering – some $2 billion – while sovereign wealth funds from Abu Dhabi and Kuwait have reportedly stumped up $5 billion more, eager to avoid a PR disaster for the region’s markets and secure in the knowledge that they are doing the sellers a political favor that can be called in one day. This is not privatization in the classic sense of the word. 
Retail demand, also concentrated in Saudi Arabia, has been supported by cut-price loan offers from local banks. Debt-funded retail investments are not, in any other market, seen as the strongest sign of fundamental support for a company’s stock price, and nor should they be here. 
All IPOs involve a bit of smoke-and-mirrors as a company transitions to having its value assessed by the market, rather than a handful of key individuals. That’s not just true before the listing but also in the immediate aftermath, where bookrunners are expected to keep volatility within reasonable bounds.
But the “market-smoothing” involved with Aramco (SE:2222) is a horse of a very different color, including government pressure on state investment funds to push the price up, according to the Financial Times’s reporting this week. The FT provided some choice quotes from people close to the deal who for obvious reasons asked not to be named:
“All the focus now is how to reach $2 trillion” and “They’ve been told to keep some powder dry for buying in the secondary market.” (According to ‘people briefed on the matter’)
“They’ve been told it is their duty, and everyone understands what that means.” (According to an adviser to local wealthy families)
“This is another Ritz, through different means.” (another banker working on the deal, in a reference to how ‘MbS’ detained various wealthy Saudis for lengthy stays in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton on suspicion of corruption, as he consolidated his power).
All of the above need not blind investors to the reality that  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) is now the most egregious cash cow in the publicly-listed corporate universe, a company that produces an essential commodity for the world economy at around $10 a barrel and sells it for around $60. A company that made a profit of $68 billion in the first nine months of the year, despite falling crude prices, a worsening economic outlook and violent attacks on its physical infrastructure. A company that is, plainly, of incredible value.
However, when price formation is influenced to such a huge extent by political concerns and the arbitrary valuation target of an autocrat, it can only validate the governance discount that western investors were insisting on in the first place. "

119,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 04:48AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Funds Step Away From Exceptionally Dull FX Market,"(Bloomberg) -- The unprecedented level of calm pervading global currencies is pushing investors to rethink their approach to the $6.6 trillion-a-day market.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management has pared its foreign-exchange exposure, awaiting a clearer theme. Amid the trend-less torpor, Russell Investments Ltd. is focusing on value, and is forsaking major currencies in favor of those from developing economies. For  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global, that same approach leads to Scandinavia as the firm scours the Group-of-10 for opportunities.
Turbulence picked up a hair this month in the run-up to the Dec. 15 deadline for additional U.S. tariffs on China, as investors braced for the possibility of rocky times ahead. Events in the next few days could also jump-start market swings: The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will deliver policy decisions, and the U.K. holds a general election that could pave the way for Brexit. But for the time being, volatility remains near all-time lows across some major currency pairs.
That’s a boon for companies, which can hedge international revenue more cheaply than ever, if they so choose. But it’s a problem for traders who rely on swings and trends to squeeze out a profit from FX. While the S&P 500 is on pace to log its best annual performance since 2013, and Treasuries are headed for their biggest gain since 2011, currency-focused funds are suffering a fourth straight year of losses.
“It’s difficult to make money in these low-vol environments,” said Aaron Hurd, senior portfolio manager in the currency group at State Street Global. “Nothing’s firing on all cylinders, and that just breeds confusion and lack of conviction.”
Currency turbulence has been declining in part because market expectations for central banks and the relative strength of major economies have largely been met. A JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. measure of global FX volatility is close to a five-year low, while one-month implied volatility sank to all-time lows in the euro, Canadian dollar and New Zealand dollar late last month.
Low Conviction
Morgan Stanley Investment Management has decided to bide its time. The fund manager has reduced its currency exposure to 1% to 2%, from typical levels of 5% to 7%, according to portfolio manager Jim Caron. It’s difficult to create a compelling trading narrative with most major currencies locked in such tight ranges, he said.
“We’re not going to take just a punt on the currency,” he said. “It’s hard for me to have high conviction and want to expose myself very greatly to something I believe is going to just kind of drift, as opposed to trend.”
He anticipates that the catalyst to increase currency exposure back to normal levels would be if the U.S. and China were to agree to a phase-one trade deal. Chinese officials expect the U.S.’s planned Dec. 15 tariff increase to be postponed, giving more time to negotiate an interim pact, according to people familiar with the matter.
Emerging Focus
The currency exposure that MSIM still has on is mostly weighted to Latin American, South American and some Asian currencies, Caron said. That’s based on the view that growth in those emerging economies will draw capital. Most emerging-market currencies have weakened versus the dollar in 2019.
“EM can perform reasonably well next year, and we think that it’s going to to attract investment there,” Caron said. “That’s going to come at the expense of the dollar.”
The quest for value is a common theme among many investors facing an FX landscape devoid of lasting moves.
Russell, which manages about $5 billion in active currency -- meaning FX as an asset class -- has seen returns of about 5% since May in its emerging-market value strategy. There’s potential for more gains there, according to fixed-income and currency research head Van Luu.
Scandinavia Calls
For Amundi Asset Management’s Andreas Koenig, the volatility malaise makes value the dominant strategy in foreign exchange at the moment.
He’s optimistic about the Norwegian and Swedish currencies in 2020 should the global economic outlook rebound from the headwinds of the trade war. The two currencies have both slumped more than 5% against the dollar in 2019, making them the worst-performing G-10 currencies. For Norway’s krone, the tumble has come even as the Norges Bank hiked rates.
Barring a marked global slowdown, “currencies which were affected by these negative expectations of trade and growth and are undervalued should come back into interest,” said Koenig. He’s head of global currencies at Amundi, which oversees $1.7 trillion.
State Street Global’s Hurd is also looking to Scandinavia. He said the krone is one of his largest bullish positions.
Hedging Opportunity
For Brad Bechtel at Jefferies, staying long the dollar has been a profitable way to navigate the tranquility in FX, given the appeal of still-positive U.S. yields.
And because American short-term rates are higher than in most other developed markets, dollar-based investors can benefit by entering short positions against low-yielding currencies, he said.
However, he sees a risk that volatility may be poised to rebound amid trade negotiations, Brexit developments and discussions of fiscal stimulus in Germany. For him, buying three-month euro-yen volatility is the best way to position for that.
“Over a three-month kind of time horizon, we would anticipate that at least a couple of opportunities are going to arise,” he said. “Euro-yen vol is super cheap, so it’s not a bad way to hedge your exposure for the remainder of the quarter.”

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's listing will boost the kingdom's efforts to diversify from oil as the bulk of proceeds will be injected in domestic projects, while the global buzz surrounding the deal will help lure foreign capital, the finance minister said.
Aramco's (SE:2222) shares surged the maximum permitted 10% on their Riyadh stock market debut on Wednesday, following the state-controlled oil giant's record $25.6 billion initial public offering (IPO).
However, the listing has fallen short of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's initial hopes for a larger flotation on a international exchange.
Funds from the 1.5% stake sale, more than 80% of which was bought by Saudi buyers, will go to the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth fund tasked with delivering Prince Mohammed's ambitious economic transformation drive to wean the world's top oil exporter off crude revenues.
""The proceeds will be used largely, maybe not totally, in the local economy, in projects where the PIF will be the first mover which then basically pulls more private sector participation ... so the money will remain in the system mostly,"" Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters.
Riyadh scrapped a planned international roadshow after foreign investors questioned the valuation sought for Aramco and raised concerns about corporate transparency.
Instead, the government focused on marketing the listing to Saudi investors and wealthy Gulf Arab allies.
Jadaan said the fact that one third of the share sale was covered by individual Saudis was positive for ""wealth retention and savings"", and that key IPO buyers were Saudi investors who would normally keep money outside the kingdom.
The listing should in the long term help deepen Saudi capital markets and lure foreign investment, Jadaan said.
""An asset of this quality attracts a lot of attention, when you attract attention to this company you then attract attention to other assets in the country that would not have been otherwise attractive in their own to international investors.""
FISCAL REFORMS
Jadaan was speaking after the Saudi government released a 2020 budget forecasting slightly lower expenditure and a wider deficit as the kingdom tries to balance fiscal prudence with continued support for the economy.
Jadaan said the impact of the Aramco share sale on the Saudi fiscal position would take time.
""Whether the PIF receives $100 billion or $25 billion, they will need time to deploy that money,"" he said.
The minister said Riyadh planned to proceed with deeper cuts to energy subsidies between 2020 and 2025 but that the government would assess the impact on private sector growth before deciding on the size of cuts and timing.
""We're looking specifically at the industrial sector and how we’re going to ensure that any energy price reform does not cause them damage, so we're looking at it and considering it.""
The Saudi economy grew 0.4% this year, according to official estimates, as the kingdom cut its crude production under a global supply reduction agreement. The government expects growth of 2.3% next year, supported by non-oil sectors."

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) cut a key profitability target for this year and next as a drop in dealmaking, negative interest rates and uncertainty caused by global trade tensions dimmed the outlook.
Switzerland's second-largest lender said on Wednesday it expects to hit a return on tangible equity (RoTE) above 8% this year, below its previous target of 10-11%. The Zurich-based bank also cut its forecast for next year.
""If markets are constructive and support revenue growth, we would expect our year-end 2020 RoTE to be approximately 11%,"" the bank said in a statement ahead of an investor day in London.
""Conversely, should markets remain challenging in 2020, we have identified up to 50 basis points of additional cost measures in order to protect our RoTE ambition of approximately 10%.""
Credit Suisse previously aimed to achieve 11-12% RoTE in 2020.
The bank will present its first investor update since completing a three-year restructuring in 2018 which cut back its investment banking activities, boosted cooperation with wealth management, and whittled down costs.
While performance at its Global Markets trading division, the focus of previous criticism, has picked up in 2019, revenues have fallen in its investment banking and capital markets business due to floundering M&A activity. Credit Suisse now expects the division to make a loss this year.
The bank last month appointed new leadership to the division and aims to bolster its M&A activity by adding more bankers to advise deals in growth industries including technology and healthcare.
""Looking ahead to 2020, we are working on actions that will reinvigorate the division, building on a strongly improving pipeline, which we expect will put us in a more advantageous position compared to 2019,"" it said on Wednesday.
The Swiss lender said it expected to distribute at least 50% of net income to shareholders looking ahead to 2020 by growing its dividend at least 5% annually, and through a share buyback of 1-1.5 billion Swiss francs"
122,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 02:52AM ET</span>",Aramco Soars in Debut to Hit Market Value of $1.88 Trillion,"(Bloomberg) --   Saudi Aramco   (SE:2222) shares surged as the oil producer began trading after its initial public offering, vaulting Saudi Arabia’s stock market into the ranks of the world’s largest.
The stock jumped the daily 10% limit to 35.20 riyals at 10:31 a.m. in Riyadh. Trading kicked off after an opening auction from 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. local time.
Aramco raised $25.6 billion in the biggest-ever IPO, selling shares at 32 riyals each and valuing the company at $1.7 trillion, overtaking  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). as the most valuable listed company. Saudi officials have pulled out all the stops to ensure that the stock trades higher.
“It’s likely that we will see Aramco bid up to $2 trillion or higher in the first days of trading, and potentially to trade limit up on the first day,” said Zachary Cefaratti, chief executive officer at Dalma Capital Management Ltd., which bought shares in the IPO through three funds.
The start of trading in Riyadh marks the end of a near four-year saga that’s been intertwined with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s rise to global prominence and his Vision 2030 plan to reform the Saudi economy. First announced in an interview with Economist in January 2016, the IPO set records, but fell short of the $100 billion international offering with a valuation of $2 trillion that the prince once proposed.
Even before any first-day pop, Aramco is so big that it easily dwarfs the rest of the companies in the Saudi market, which have a combined value of about $500 billion. Adding in Aramco, the kingdom’s bourse becomes the world’s ninth-biggest stock market, overtaking India and closing in on Germany and Canada. Saudi Arabia, though, only sold 1.5% of the company’s capital, meaning that barely any of its shares will trade.
Foreign investors balked at the prince’s sought-for valuation, citing concerns including governance issues and possible security threats to stay away from the stock. Still, final orders surpassed $119 billion, with authorities allowing lenders to boost loans beyond usual to support the sale.
“There are a lot of transparency issues in the disclosures and based on the expected listing valuation, it doesn’t seem one is getting paid for that uncertainty or opacity,” said Adam Choppin, an investment officer at FIS Group in Philadelphia, who decided not to buy shares. “Reportedly, it seems that a good amount of local investors have been cajoled into participating, whereas no such leverage exists over foreign investors.”
Aramco’s IPO was said to have relied on some of the kingdom’s richest families, who had members detained in a hotel during a so-called crackdown on corruption in 2017, and also on cash from neighboring allies such as the sovereign wealth funds of Kuwait and Abu Dhabi. Gulf Cooperation Council investors are confident the stock price has plenty of room to increase, boosted by incentives that go from bonus shares to fast inclusion in emerging-market benchmarks.
A surge in early trading validates “our thesis that Aramco’s pricing fell short of $2 trillion to leave upside on the table for Saudi and GCC investors, allowing them to benefit from the listing of Saudi’s crown jewel,” said Dalma Capital’s Cefaratti.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., acting as share stabilizing manager, has the right to exercise an option to sell another 450 million shares. It could be executed in whole or in part up to 30 calendar days after trading begins. The previous largest IPO,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., rose 38% in its trading debut in 2014.
The Aramco IPO proceeds will be transferred to the Public Investment Fund, which has made a number of bold investments, including into SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund and a $3.5 billion stake in Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. Saudi authorities flagged this week that “a lot” of the money will be spent in the domestic economy.

Giant in the Room
The proceeds of the Aramco deal alone are equal to more than a decade of IPOs on Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange, which has already said that the company’s weighting in the main local benchmark will be capped at 15%. And even though Aramco’s free float is among the lowest globally, the deal opens up one of the world’s most secretive companies, one that bankrolled Saudi Arabia and its rulers for decades, but until this year had never published financial statements or borrowed in international debt markets.
Aramco has promised a bumper dividend payment of a minimum $75 billion a year until at least 2024. That could make yields competitive with the likes of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, but also threatens to stretch the world’s largest oil producer if prices fall."

Please refresh for updates.
Takeaway.com (AS:TKWY) hit back at its rival   Prosus   (AS:PRX) in the bidding war for   Just Eat   (LON:JE), accusing Prosus of making misleading claims and not having any direct experience of running a delivery service.
“Prosus has concocted a far-fetched valuation of the Combined Group by attempting to draw a spurious parallel to Grubhub and by focusing on Just Eat's depressed trading multiple,” Takeaway said.
Prosus earlier this week raised its cash offer to 740 pence a share. While that’s some way below the implicit value of Takeaway’s offer, Prosus has argued that the share price of the combined group would quickly come under pressure due to heavy investment needs. It cited the experience of U.S. group GrubHub to support its claims.
Takeaway argued that the GrubHub analogy is misleading. It said average order value in the U.K. – at the equivalent of $25 - isn’t high enough to justify the logistics-based model that Prosus is advocating.
Finally, it noted that Prosus’ offer represents a premium of only 16% to the undisturbed share price in July.

The bad news continues at   Global Ports   Holding (LON:GPH), which said it now expects full-year EBITDA to fall by around 5% after another weak quarter for its commercial ports.
The company, whose shares have lost two-thirds of their value in the last two years, said revenue from its commercial ports fell 22% on the year to $14.7 million, a drop that was only partly offset by a 17% rise in cruise revenue to $22.2 million.
It said the cruise business is performing well, having recently opened cruise port operations in the Bahamas and Antigua that will see cruise become the more important of the group’s divisions.

Heathrow Airport said it had had its busiest November ever, with passenger numbers rising 2.0% to 6.234 million despite flight movements dipping 0.1% to just under 38,000.
The airport said that the expansion of north American routes, which were particularly busy over the Thanksgiving weekend, was chiefly responsible.
The cargo business was weaker, with tonnage volumes falling 8.6% on the year to 134,328."

Apart from administrative cost cuts totaling 80 million euros ($88 million) over the next three years, the division, which could fetch up to 17 billion euros in a sale, also sees potential to improve production sites in North America and Europe.
The division targets an adjusted operating profit margin of 11.5-13.0% in the 2020/21 fiscal year, compared with 11.4% in 2018/19.
""The global market for elevators and escalators is highly attractive,"" Peter Walker, the head of the unit, said in a statement ahead of a capital markets day that will provide investors with a deeper look at the business.
""We have defined specific levers how to drive the profitability of our business. Now it's on us to execute on this plan,"" he said.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) is the world's fourth-largest maker of elevators behind United Technologies Corp's (N:UTX) Otis, Switzerland's Schindler (S:SCHP) and Finland's Kone (HE:KNEBV), which is bidding for the unit.
Thyssenkrupp, which needs the proceeds from a divestment to fix its balance sheet, confirmed that it plans both a listing and a sale of the division, adding a decision on whether it will be sold or floated would be made by March 31, 2020.

Stora Enso, one of the world's largest pulp and paper makers, announced the joint venture to develop the straw with Sulapac a year ago, after European Union lawmakers decided to ban widely-used, throw-away plastics such as straws and cotton buds by 2021.
Sulapac said it had raised 15 million euros ($16.5 million)in new funding from investors including luxury house Chanel and international media houses to scale up the production of its renewable straw material and to explore other uses for it.
""Our cooperation with Sulapac allows us to explore new types of innovative and scalable materials and widen our offering of renewable solutions"", Marcus Dehlin, Stora Enso's head of business alliances, said in a statement.

Pai, who is also chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India committees on primary markets and financial technology, said 10 to 15 internet and tech companies are looking to list in India over the next three years. These firms are likely to be valued at $300 million to $10 billion, he said in an interview.
One of the companies is Byju, creator of an education app, in which Pai’s Aarin Capital Partners owns a stake. Others he expects to list in local markets in the next few years include food delivery platforms Swiggy and Zomato, as well as PhonePe and Myntra, which are both units of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.-controlled Flipkart.
“There is appetite for IPOs,” from companies as well as investors, the former Infosys chief financial officer said. “The market is hungry for fast growth IT stocks.”
Byju, Swiggy, Zomato, PhonePe, Myntra did not immediately respond to Bloomberg queries on their plans.
Headlines on the swelling valuations for India’s homegrown tech firms have been increasing in number over the past couple of years:
Pai pointed toward interest from both global and local investors that drove the nation’s equity indexes to record highs last month. The strong performance of internet-related stocks including Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corp. and Info Edge India Ltd. this year has also helped, he said. The former gained about 170% since its listing in October and the latter advanced over 30 times since its IPO in 2006.
Foreign investors have pumped about $13 billion into Indian stocks this year, set for their biggest annual inflow since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was elected in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Domestic investment in stocks has also increased in recent years as investors have embraced mutual funds amid a lack of confidence in other assets.
Pai said that liquidity and valuations shouldn’t be concerns for companies seeking to list, as the market is “flush with money” and India investors have shown a willingness to pay up for growth stocks.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 12:22AM ET</span>",Huawei's CFO wins Canada court fight to see more documents on her arrest,"By David KIRTON and Moira Warburton
(Reuters) - Lawyers for Huawei’s chief financial officer have won a court battle after a judge asked Canada’s attorney general to hand over more evidence and documents relating to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, according to a court ruling released on Tuesday.
Meng’s legal team has contested her extradition in the Canadian courts on grounds that the United States is using it for economic and political gain, and that she was unlawfully held, searched and interrogated by Canadian authorities acting for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes in the Supreme Court of British Columbia agreed with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s appeal for Canada's attorney general to release more documents relating to the run-up to and events of the arrest.
Meng’s team believes the papers will support its claim of an abuse of process.
Holmes cautioned that her ruling was limited and does not address the merit of Huawei’s allegations that Canadian authorities improperly handled identifying information about Meng’s electronic devices.
The Department of Justice told Reuters Canada's attorney general was reviewing the decision to determine what fell within the scope of the disclosure order, in order to comply with it.
""Ms. Meng is being afforded a fair process before the British Columbia Supreme Court in accordance with extradition law and our treaty with the United States,"" a spokesman added. ""This will continue throughout these proceedings.""
Huawei declined to comment.
Meng, 47, was arrested at the Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018, at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading the bank HSBC (HSBA.L) about Huawei Technologies’ business in Iran. She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.
She was questioned by Canadian immigration authorities prior to her arrest, and her lawyers have asked the government to hand over more documents about her arrest.
In her ruling, Holmes wrote that she found the evidence tendered by the attorney general to have ""notable gaps,"" citing the example of why the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) ""made what is described as the simple error of turning over to the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), contrary to law, the passcodes CBSA officers had required Ms. Meng to produce.""
Holmes also said the attorney general did not provide adequate evidence to ""rebut inferences from other evidence that the RCMP improperly sent serial numbers and other identifiers of Ms. Meng’s devices to the FBI.""
Holmes said the gaps in evidence raised questions ""beyond the frivolous or speculative about the chain of events,"" and led her to conclude that Meng’s application ""crosses the air of reality threshold.""
The order does not require the disclosure of documents - the attorney general may assert a privilege, which Meng could contest in court.
No timeline was outlined in Holmes’ ruling.
Meng’s extradition hearing will begin on Jan. 20, 2020, in a federal court in Vancouver."

The company and its existing shareholders sold 72.5 million shares Tuesday for $27 each after offering them for $22 to $25, according to a statement. That gives XP a market value of about $14.9 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The company has granted its underwriters the option of selling an additional 10.88 million so-called greenshoe shares. If fully exercised, that would bring the amount raised in the IPO to about $2.25 billion.
The IPO is the fourth-biggest in the U.S. this year, after listings by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., Avantor Inc. and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT)., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s also the biggest IPO by a Brazilian company since finance company Pagseguro Digital Ltd.’s $2.6 billion listing on the New York Stock Exchange in January 2018, the data show.
Selling Shareholders
XP is based in Sao Paulo and incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Its existing investors XP Controle, General Atlantic (XP) Bermuda and DYNA III Fundo de Investimento em Participacoes were among sellers, according to its filings.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, XP earned 699 million reais ($169 million) on revenue of 3.7 billion reais, according to its filings.
The offering was led by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), XP Investments and Itau BBA. The shares are expected to begin trading Wednesday on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol XP.
Inspired by  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp., the biggest U.S. brokerage, XP has been in the forefront of changing the way Brazilians invest by offering middle-class investors products that were once only available to the rich, while luring money away from the nation’s biggest banks at a breakneck pace.
1.5 Million Clients
The company has more than 1.5 million clients and 350 billion reais in assets under custody as of September, according to its filings. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Guilherme Benchimol said last year that he expects the company to have 1 trillion reais under custody by the end of 2020.
Itau Unibanco Holding SA isn’t divesting any of its 49.9% stake, according to the filings. The company will have dual-class share structure, giving the owners of Class B stock 10 votes a share and other holders one vote for each Class A share.
Expansion Plans
XP plans to use the proceeds to finance growth, make acquisitions and enter new businesses such as digital banking, payments and insurance. It took over the No. 1 spot for Brazil equity trading this year, surpassing UBS Group AG’s local broker-dealer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The broker received a banking license last year and plans to become a full-service lender.
Benchimol was 24 when he created XP in 2001 with Marcelo Maisonnave. Originally, they called the company XPTO, a generic placeholder in Portuguese, somewhat like XYZ in English.
After a year, Benchimol sold his car and borrowed 5,000 reais from his half-brother, XP board member Julio Capua, to keep things going, with the firm operating only as a stock brokerage.
The company was reinvented after the 2008 economic downturn, when Benchimol attended a Charles Schwab event in San Francisco, inspiring him to follow its model by creating “the first real one-stop investment shop” in Brazil, Benchimol said earlier this year."

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) could expand the lineup of vehicles using its large truck and sport utility vehicle architecture and sees big opportunities in over-the-air software updates, President Mark Reuss told Reuters on Tuesday. 
GM, which controls about 70% of the large sport utility market in North America with six models, unveiled the redesigned Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the first of a new generation of large SUVs whose profits will help fund development of electric vehicles that the automaker promises for the future.
The 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe, revealed at the arena where the Detroit Red Wings hockey team plays in downtown Detroit, is 6.7 inches longer than the current Tahoe and can carry as much as 122.9 cubic feet of cargo. Passengers in the third row of seats get 10 inches more legroom and a better ride thanks to a more car-like independent rear suspension. 
The new Chevy Suburban will grow by 1.3 inches to 225.7 inches long - making it one of the longest passenger vehicles on the market. GM's big SUVs will be powered by eight cylinder gasoline engines or six cylinder diesel motors. 
The vehicles have a new digital electronic architecture that enables over-the-air software updates and new revenue opportunities, Reuss told Reuters.
""It's huge,"" Reuss said of the potential to sell customers new digital functions or avoid warranty repairs with a software update. Electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has used over-the-air upgrades as money makers and to fix problems at low cost.
As the industry moves toward electric vehicles, profits from large SUVs will help pay for investments, Reuss said. Those include GM's plans to build a new battery plant and offer an electric pick-up truck. 
The new SUVs are assembled at a complex in Arlington, Texas, a state where many of them will be sold. GM has invested $1.4 billion to expand the Arlington operation, and that gives the company the option to manufacture additional models, Reuss said.
""We don't want to invest that much..and not have agility,"" he said.
The Tahoe and Suburban unveilings cap a substantial investment by GM over the past five years in its largest pickup trucks and SUVs. GM's Detroit rivals,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), are also expanding their large SUV lineups, even as they promise more electrified cars for the future.
Detroit automakers are doubling down again on big SUVs for a simple reason: It pays. 
The Arlington, Texas factory is running 24 hours a day to meet demand, and profit margins on large SUVs can be as high as 30%, or more than $15,000 a vehicle, industry executives and analysts said.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) estimated large pickup trucks and SUVs accounted for 72% of GM's North American profit in 2018.
GM did not disclose pricing or fuel consumption data on the new SUVs, but the average Tahoe sold for $57,414 in November, according to data from ALG, a unit of TrueCar. 
U.S. fuel economy rules, instituted under President Barack Obama, encourage automakers to make sport utilities even bigger. Vehicles that have a larger ""footprint"" because they are long and wide have easier mileage and CO2 emissions targets to meet. 
President Donald Trump has said he wants to ease vehicle CO2 standards but has not released a final plan. GM has sided with Trump on fuel economy policy in a dispute with California, which has sued to maintain the stronger Obama era standards.
GM's sales of big utilities through the end of November were roughly steady year over year, according to sales figures from Automotive News. 

But GM faces tougher competition in the segment going forward. Ford has boosted sales of its competing Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator large utilities by 45% through Nov. 30. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV plans to launch a new Grand Wagoneer in 2021.

(Reuters) - The Swiss private banking unit of  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) will pay $192.4 million to resolve a U.S. probe of its role in helping wealthy Americans evade taxes by using undeclared Swiss bank accounts, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday.
The DoJ's deal with HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA is the latest in which numerous Swiss-based banks, including UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group, have paid billions of dollars in settlements and penalties for conspiring to help rich Americans dodge taxes. [https://tinyurl.com/vmeuabw]
The hard line taken by U.S. authorities over the last decade has helped pressure Switzerland to end banking secrecy that long allowed offshore clients to stash money in accounts in the republic. The Swiss government has deals with many countries to exchange information about accounts held by foreigners. [https://tinyurl.com/y445cx7p]
In this latest case, the DoJ filed a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States against HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) but agreed to drop it in three years if the bank abides by the deal's terms, court documents show.
The charge relates to HSBC Private Bank (Suisse)'s conduct between 2000 and 2010, when the DoJ said the Geneva-based bank assisted U.S. clients in hiding offshore assets and income. Its bankers traveled to cities, including Miami, to scout for clients, the department said. 
Even as the DoJ began investigating Swiss banks, including UBS, around 2008 for tax-dodging schemes, prosecutors said some HSBC Private Bank bankers continued the cross-border business with U.S. residents.
""Some HSBC Switzerland bankers assisted clients in closing their accounts in a manner that continued to conceal their offshore assets,"" U.S. prosecutors said in a statement.
UBS agreed to pay $780 million in fines, penalties, interest and restitution in 2009 for helping Americans hide their assets from U.S. tax authorities. In 2014, Credit Suisse paid $2.6 billion.
Many other Swiss banks have followed suit, including HSBC Private Bank, which said it cooperated with U.S. authorities, swapped out bankers and changed how it does business. 
""Today the Swiss subsidiary operates under new management,"" Chief Executive Alex Classen said in a statement. ""We have strengthened our compliance function, enhanced our control framework and put in place a comprehensive client tax transparency policy.""

In 2017, HSBC paid 300 million euros ($330.6 million)to settle a separate investigation on tax evasion by French citizens via its Swiss private bank after an ex-employee leaked client data that spawned investigations in several countries.

The second-largest U.S. oil company, which plans to hold its 2020 spending program flat at $20 billion, said it may sell shale gas properties and its stake in a Canadian liquefied natural gas project. San Ramon, California-based Chevron and other energy companies have pledged to restrain spending after the collapse in oil prices earlier this decade forced many to borrow to cover the costs of long-term projects.
Chevron said it expected writedowns this quarter related to a deepwater Gulf of Mexico project, which needs higher oil prices to churn a profit, and shale gas in Appalachia, which has suffered from low natural gas prices. It is considering selling its stake in Appalachian shale and the proposed Kitmat LNG project in Canada.
""With capital discipline and a conservative outlook comes the responsibility to make the tough choices necessary to deliver higher cash returns to our shareholders over the long term"", Chief Executive Michael Wirth said.
Wirth is preparing sweeping changes that would cut costs and streamline operations with expectations of lower-for-longer commodity prices.
Chevron's writedown of oil assets was unexpected, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.
Production for 2020 is expected to grow 1%, ""much slower than the 7% in 2018 and 4% in 2019,"" said Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James.
Chevron recently warned of massive cost overruns at a giant Tengiz oil project in Kazakhstan. It plans to spend about $3.75 billion there next year.
Chevron has been among the strongest performers among the big oil majors but reported a 36% drop in third-quarter profit, hit by lower oil and gas prices and refining margins.
It plans to spend $4 billion next year in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oil field in Texas and New Mexico, and another $1 billion on international shale projects. It had planned to spend around $5.2 billion this year.
It will spend $2.8 billion on its business that refines, transports and markets fuels and petrochemicals, up about $300 million from this year's budget.

Chevron shares closed at $117.89 on Tuesday, up a fraction before it released its 2020 plans. Its shares are up about 8.4% this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday rejected UBS Group AG's (S:UBSG) bid to dismiss a U.S. government lawsuit accusing Switzerland's largest bank of causing ""catastrophic"" investor losses in residential mortgage-backed securities sold before the 2008 financial crisis.
U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn, New York, said the Department of Justice sufficiently alleged that from 2005 to 2007, UBS intended to defraud or acted recklessly toward investors who bought securities backed by more than $41 billion of subprime and other risky loans in 40 offerings.
Many of the loans were made by now-defunct lenders including Countrywide Home Loans, American Home Mortgage, Fremont Investment & Loan, IndyMac and New Century.
The Justice Department said UBS securitized the loans despite internal communications acknowledging that the lenders' underwriting standards had been ""severely deteriorating.""
A lawyer for UBS declined to comment on the decision.
The government did not specify damages in its November 2018 lawsuit, but said investors ""lost many billions of dollars, with substantially more in losses projected during the remaining life of the deals.""
It said UBS' conduct violated a 1989 law allowing the government to seek civil penalties equal to the losses suffered by others resulting from a violation. Brodie did not decide the merits of the government's case.
The case is among the last targeting big banks over the packaging and sale of risky, poorly underwritten loans into securities, which was a major cause of the financial crisis.
Several major U.S. and European banks have settled similar claims.

The case is U.S. v. UBS Securities LLC, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 18-06369.

141,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 05:13PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. It's Fed Day!
The Federal Reserve will deliver its final interest rate decision for the year at 2:00 PM ET (19:00 GMT) Wednesday.
But there are unlikely to be any surprises as Fed members, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have shown little interest in cutting rates further following the October rate cut.
The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. The chances of no change are 98.5%, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. 
In its previous meeting, the Fed all but said that rates were unlikely to move higher, suggesting the path of future monetary policy is likely to remain steady or lower.
After the rate decision, attention will turn to Powell's news conference slated to start at 2:30 PM ET.
2. U.S. Inflation Data Due
Market participants look ahead to the release of consumer inflation data due Wednesday at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists forecast overall inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index in November rose 0.2% after a 0.4% rise in October. The gain for the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy price, is expected to remain unchanged at 0.2%.
That would bring year-over-year CPI growth to 2.0%, up from 1.8% previously, and core CPI unchanged at 2.3%.
2. EIA Report on Tap
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases its weekly petroleum report due Wednesday.
The EIA is expected to report crude stockpiles fell by 2.76 million barrels last week.
Late Tuesday, ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data, which while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels, that showed crude stockpiles rose by 1.41 million barrels last week.
West Texas intermediate crude rose 22 cents to settle at $59.24 a barrel on hopes that U.S.-China trade tensions will ease and boost global oil demand.
The uncertainty over whether the U.S. and China will strike a deal before the Dec. 15 deadline has dominated direction in oil prices and limited gains following the deal by OPEC to deepen production cuts in 2020."
142,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>","Stocks - Energy, Health, Tech Shares Lead as Wall Street Waits","Investing.com - Stocks overall pulled back modestly Tuesday, despite nibbling at energy, health care and tech stocks, as investors await trade news and a decision from the Federal Reserve.
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials were each down 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.07%, and the Nasdaq 100 index dipped 0.1%. The US SmallCap 2000 index ended essentially flat. 
 
The waiting was the story. The first question was whether the Trump Administration will impose new tariffs on a host of imports from China, including cell phones, notebook computers and even frozen fish. The tariffs are supposed to be imposed on Sunday.
The talk in Washington was the United States and China were working on a deal to delay the tariffs while negotiations on a trade deal continue. And a phase one deal might include rolling back tariffs imposed in September.
The second question is what the Federal Reserve will decide Wednesday afternoon on interest rates. The central bank is widely expected to leave its key federal funds rate at 1.5% to 1.75%. Chairman Jerome Powell has said further cuts are not needed in an economy that's growing steadily.
There was some certain news. The Trump Administration and Congress have agreed on a new treaty with Canada and Mexico to replace that North American Free Trade Agreement.
The market seemed to ignore the ongoing impeachment process. House Democrats said they would push two articles of impeachment against President Trump.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was among the day's winners on reports that sales in China are doing well. Also moving higher were Apache (NYSE:APA) and   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN) as oil prices moved up a little. Autoparts retailer AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) jumped 6.9% after a bullish earnings report late Monday.
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the top gainers among the 30 Dow stocks. Merck (NYSE:MRK) hit a 52-week high.
Retailing stocks generally had a good day with decent gains from   Dillards   (NYSE:DDS), Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Gap (NYSE:GPS)
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) were weak on worries about their business prospects.
Netflix fell 3.1%, the weakest performance among Nasdaq 100 components, after Needham analyst Laura Martin downgraded the stock to underperform, saying the company could lose up to 4 million subscribers to cheaper streaming plans. Peloton Interactive fell 5.7% after short-seller firm Citron Research said the stock was worth maybe $5. 
Gold  prices were higher. Interest rates also moved up, which weighed on housing stocks.
West Texas crude was up 22 cents to $59.24 a barrel. Brent the global benchmark rose 9 cents to $64.34. 
Auto parts retailers, AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and   Advance Auto Parts   (NYSE:AAP), cybersecurity company NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) (a possible takeover/buyout candidate) and gaming publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) were among the top S&P 500 performers on the day. 
Mutual-fund company Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), flooring manufacturer   Mohawk Industries   (NYSE:MHK), financial services company Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers."
143,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 04:46PM ET</span>",U.S. attorney general says Big Tech probes to be completed next year,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Tuesday that he hoped to have Justice Department investigations of the big tech platforms -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) - completed next year.
The four tech companies have been lightning rods for regulator probes this year. In addition to the Justice investigations, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and Congress are looking at one or more of the companies.
""We started in earnest in July. It's been moving very quickly,"" Barr told the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. ""We're talking very broadly with people and getting a lot of input from people in the industry and experts and so forth.""
""I'd like to have it completed some time next year. I think it's important to move quickly on things,"" Barr said. ""These things have a cost to the marketplace and businesses. I think at some point the government has to fish or cut bait.""
Barr said that the Justice Department review was not limited to antitrust, but that looking for anti-competitive behavior was ""front and center.""
""The question is that when you have the kind of market power that some companies have in their market, then some conduct that may have made sense when they were the insurgent company in a growing industry can become anti-competitive because it ends up fortifying the monopoly,"" he said.
The attorney general, however, also cited his previous work for  Verizon Communications  (N:VZ), in arguing that big companies provided some benefits to consumers, particularly in telecommunications.
""Big is not bad,"" he said. ""I think in certain network industries you can be too Balkanized and no one has the scale necessary for the kind of innovation that we're seeing."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes ended slightly lower on Tuesday, though not far from record highs, as investors awaited concrete news on whether a new round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would take effect on Dec. 15, a potential turning point in a trade dispute between the world's two largest economies that has convulsed markets.
Stock futures got a boost in premarket trade when the Wall Street Journal said U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators were laying the groundwork for a delay in the tariffs, but White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said later that no decision had been made.
A delay would be seen as helping to pave the way for an initial U.S.-China trade deal, optimism over which has helped fuel the market's recent run to records.
""I don’t think that the markets are going to be completely comfortable until there is a line drawn in the sand that says no new tariffs on the 15th,"" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 27.88 points, or 0.1%, to 27,881.72, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 3.44 points, or 0.11%, to 3,132.52 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 5.64 points, or 0.07%, to 8,616.18.
The S&P 500 has climbed about 25% so far in 2019, driven by three interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and some relief over corporate profits, along with improved investor sentiment on trade.
The Fed is due to give its latest policy decision on Wednesday; the market expects the U.S. central bank to hold rates steady. Investors also have their eyes on the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday and U.S. inflation data later in the week.
“I think the markets are just hanging tight until we get those announcements,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.
In another trade-related development, Canada, Mexico and the United States agreed to an overhaul of their quarter-century-old regional trade pact, but stocks largely shrugged off the news.
Most S&P 500 sectors ended lower on Tuesday, with real estate <.SPLRCR> and materials (SPLRCM) falling the most.
In company news, shares in  Autozone Inc  (N:AZO) jumped 6.9% after the auto parts retailer beat quarterly profit estimates.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) shares dipped 0.9% after the plane maker said it delivered fewer than half as many planes in the first 11 months of 2019 as in the same period a year earlier.
Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) shares fell 3.1% after a Needham analyst downgraded her rating on the stock and said competition could lead to the loss of 4 million premium U.S. subscribers next year.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 66 new lows.

About 6.3 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

145,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>",Here’s the Fed Surprise That Could Roil Bond Markets Wednesday,"(Bloomberg) -- While many expect the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday decision on rates to be a snooze for markets, strategists at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). are nonetheless mulling surprises that could stir up bond prices.
They see an outside chance that the Federal Open Market Committee’s updated dot plot will signal a 2020 rate increase, an outcome that would flatten the U.S. yield curve and boost the dollar, according to a report from BofA’s Mark Cabana, Michelle Meyer, Ben Randol and Joe Song. To be sure, that’s not what they view as most probable; they think the dot plot will show the Fed on hold next year.
Last week’s surprisingly strong U.S. job data eased worries that a recession will arrive soon, prompting traders to pull back from fully pricing in a quarter-point Fed rate cut in 2020. Before that report Friday, strategists and economists said the central bank might avoid signaling another rate hike for years as it keeps the fed funds rate target unchanged at 1.5% to 1.75%.
“We expect the broader U.S. rates market to have a limited response to the Fed meeting,” given that the median 2020 dot -- or where policy makers believe the appropriate level for rates will be next year -- is likely to be 1.625%, reflecting no move.
If that’s not the case and the median dot increases Wednesday as the Fed reassesses the balance of risks, that “would likely cause some of the easing priced in 2020 to be pared back and for the curve to flatten, in line with the three prior FOMC meetings,” the BofA team wrote. Regarding the U.S. currency, “we think the hurdle for a significant USD reaction on Wednesday is fairly high,” though the risks seem somewhat “skewed toward a hawkish market reaction.”"
146,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 03:31PM ET</span>","California Attorney General warns companies: 'If you're consolidating, we're looking'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, whose state is leading a fight to stop T-Mobile US (O:TMUS) from buying Sprint (N:S), warned on Tuesday his agency was concerned about corporate consolidation, particularly in cases where U.S. federal regulators do not take action.
He said in an interview with Reuters that if states can successfully block the Sprint deal it would send a message that ""antitrust enforcers will be back in the driver's seat. It will make industries, not just telecoms, but industries, recognize that there are antitrust laws that can be enforced.""
California, along with New York, is leading the effort in Manhattan federal court to show the proposed $26.5 billion deal between the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers is illegal because it would raise prices, particularly for users on prepaid plans.
Becerra wants to protect customers from anticompetitive mergers in every industry.
Last month, San Francisco-headquartered  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) agreed to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (O:AMTD) in a $26 billion deal to create a brokerage giant in a market that has been ravaged by price wars.
While analysts expect federal regulators will take a soft line on the deal, Becerra did not rule out a state probe by his office. ""We will look at anything that has an impact on the ability of consumers at the end of the day to get a good deal. And financial services are critically important,"" he said.
Becerra, whose state is home to Facebook (O:FB) and Google's parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL), said he was concerned about consolidation, and that the tech sector was ""growing and consolidating.""
""A lot of us are concerned about making sure that consolidation is for efficiency purposes"" rather than to push for higher prices, he said, noting California's successful effort in 2017 to prevent  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO) from buying the last independent petroleum distribution terminal.
Becerra expressed frustration with Wall Street's optimism about the benefits of mergers.
""On Wall Street, consolidation is almost a given in order for you to ensure greater quarterly returns. We want to put the brakes on those who want to consolidate for the sake of quarterly returns,"" he said. ""If you're consolidating, we're looking.""
Over the past two years, a more relaxed mood under Trump administration regulators has helped unleash big-ticket takeovers in the financial sector, after a lull following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis."
147,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",Deutsche Telekom CEO denies T-Mobile/Sprint deal will reduce competition,"By Sheila Dang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc and Sprint Corp did not pursue a merger in order to reduce price competition in the U.S. wireless market, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), T-Mobile's majority shareholder, testified on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan.
A group of state attorneys general, led by New York and California, are suing to stop the $26.5 billion merger between the wireless carriers, arguing it would lead to higher prices.
Timotheus Höttges, who is chairman of T-Mobile's board, testified that T-Mobile sought to merge with its smaller rival to increase scale and gain wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, but denied the goal was to reduce competition. His testimony came on the second day of a trial that is expected to run until Dec. 20.
Attorneys for the states presented evidence on Tuesday from a T-Mobile board presentation in 2010, when the company first explored a deal with Sprint, that said the merger would have ""potential to reduce price competition.""
Höttges downplayed the presentation, saying it had been prepared by advisers and was not an official Deutsche Telekom document.
T-Mobile and Sprint have already received approval for the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission, after the companies agreed to sell Sprint's prepaid phone business and some spectrum to satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp.
The companies argue that a stronger T-Mobile would result from the proposed takeover, making it better able to innovate and compete to reduce wireless prices. The case represents a break with the usual process of states coordinating with the federal government in reviewing mergers and generally coming to a joint conclusion.
The states have argued that Dish is not a viable competitor in the wireless market that could replace Sprint as the fourth-largest carrier. On Tuesday, Glenn Pomerantz, an attorney representing California in the lawsuit, asked Höttges whether he was aware that Dish had repeatedly failed to build a network using its vast holdings of wireless spectrum.
Höttges testified that Dish founder and Chairman Charlie Ergen was ""not easy to deal with,"" but said Ergen was known for being a great entrepreneur and would have all the ingredients needed to build a network once the merger closed."
148,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 03:00PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Peloton Backpedals Sharply as Short Seller Says Shares Worth $5,"Investing.com - Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) shares slumped on Tuesday after famed-short seller Citron Research warned that the exercise-equipment maker's shares could slide by more 80%.
Its current valuation has been running too hot at a time when the competition is starting to catch up, the firm said.
""Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) at $10 billion or even $5 billion makes zero sense,"" Citron Research said, estimating its value at about $1.3 billion, or $5 a share. Peoeton fell as much as 9%, prompting some bargain hunting that trimmed the loss to about 6% by 2:30 PM ET (19:30 GMT). 
In the good days, when the competition was low, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) used its first-mover advantage to scoop up the high-income, low-hanging fruit. But with competition heating up over recent years, and a lack of innovation from the company, its glory days of hardware sales are in the rearview mirror, Citron Research said. 
""While Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) has enjoyed a first-mover advantage, the lack of differentiation of its bike has finally caught up to it as the competition is not only making virtually identical exercise bikes but ones that are both more affordable and functional,"" the firm added.
In another blow to Peloton, its competitors have been able to expand their digitally integrated at home fitness hardware offerings to new segments like mirror, tonal, boxing and rowing.
Competitors include privately held Echelon Fitness and Flywheel Sports.
Peloton efforts to expand its offering have done little to inspire confidence; its treadmill product fell short of expectations. Importantly, the company has missed the mass movement to mirrored interactive home gyms and digital weights.
Citron sees a wave of red coming in the not-too-distant future and warned that the upcoming lockup expiration in March will see an additional 240 million shares become available for sale.
Peloton went public at $29 on Sept. 27 and moved to as high as $37.02 on Dec. 2. The decline since the peak is now 12%.
The issue for some investors has been that it continues to lose money despite rapid sales growth. It lost $50 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30 even as revenue more than doubled to $228 million. 
That makes the stock attractive to short sellers like Citron Research, who are betting they can borrow shares, sell them short and profit by buying them back at a lower price. "

150,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 02:34PM ET</span>",HSBC Agrees to Pay $192 Million to Resolve U.S. Tax Probe,"(Bloomberg) --  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) will pay $192 million to resolve a decade-long U.S. tax investigation and admitted that it helped American clients cheat the Internal Revenue Service, according to a U.S. judge.
Prosecutors filed a charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. against a unit of the bank, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA, but agreed to drop it in three years if it abides by a deal submitted Tuesday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
The charge relates to conduct from at least 2000 to 2010, U.S. District Judge Roy Altman said at a hearing.
The settlement follows years of Justice Department and IRS battles against Swiss banks, taxpayers and enablers over undeclared accounts, which led to settlements with dozen of banks.
It also caps a decade in which HSBC, an Asia-focused lender, entered into two other deferred-prosecution agreements with the U.S. and spent heavily on internal controls. For the past two years, the Bank of England has warned HSBC that it hasn’t done enough to tackle concerns about handling risks including financial crime and staff conduct.
In 2012, the bank paid $1.9 billion in penalties, admitting that it failed to prevent Latin American drug cartels from laundering money and violated U.S. sanctions against Iran. Within a year, its reform efforts met resistance from leaders of HSBC’s U.S. investment-banking unit -- some of whom mounted a campaign of bullying, foot-dragging and discrediting in-house watchdogs, according to a court-appointed monitor.
Soon after that deal expired, the bank agreed in early 2018 to pay about $100 million to resolve an investigation into rigging of currency rates. Later that year, the bank agreed to pay $765 million to settle allegations that it sold defective residential mortgage-backed securities.
HSBC has taken steps to fix its compliance problems. In recent years, it quintupled the number of employees assigned to spot suspicious activity to 5,000, upgraded its technology and, in 2016, hired Jennifer Calvery, the U.S. Treasury Department’s top anti-money-laundering official, to oversee its efforts.
Still, the tax case was left unresolved for at least eight years. In 2011, the IRS went to court to seek information about Americans with accounts at HSBC India from 2002 to 2010. Through 2010, about 9,000 U.S. residents had nonresident Indian accounts of $100,000 or more, and only 1,391 disclosed them to the U.S. in 2009, the IRS said in court filings. The clients had deposits of almost $400 million.
In 2013, a New Jersey businessman who cooperated with prosecutors avoided prison after admitting he conspired with five HSBC bankers to hide Indian bank accounts from the IRS. Several other HSBC clients were convicted of tax crimes.
Many banks have made similar admissions that they helped Americans cheat on their taxes. UBS admitted in 2009 that it helped thousands of clients cheat the IRS and paid $780 million, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) reached a $2.6 billion deal in 2014. Another 80 Swiss banks avoided prosecution by agreeing to pay $1.37 billion in penalties and voluntarily disclosing their wrongdoing as part of a Justice Department program."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Peloton Interactive (O:PTON) tumbled over 6% on Tuesday after noted short seller Andrew Left valued the seller of stationary exercise bicycles at about one seventh of its recent stock price.
Left's Citron Research warned that the Peloton's bikes, priced at over $2,200, and its streaming exercise video service face competition from aggressive, cheaper rivals. It predicted Peloton's stock would fall to $5. The stock dropped $2.32 to $32.45 following the report.
Peloton did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Citron Research report. 
Peloton, which went public in September at $29 a share and is losing money, has filed lawsuits against Echelon Fitness LLC, alleging it infringed its patents and sold “cheap, copycat” products. New York-based Peloton has also filed a lawsuit against Flywheel Sports Inc, which sells its own stationary bikes with built-in tablets. 
Left is one of Wall Street's most prominent short sellers, and his reports in the past have hurt shares of companies including Twitter (N:TWTR), GoPro (O:GPRO), Wayfair (N:W) and ecommerce website Jumia Technologies <4JMAy.F>. 
""While Peloton has enjoyed a first mover advantage, the lack of differentiation of its bike has finally caught up to it as the competition is not only making virtually identical exercise bikes but ones that are both more affordable and functional,"" Citron Research said in its report.
But Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, who recommends investors buy Peloton's stock, raised his price target to $38 from $29 on Tuesday, saying the company is likely to grow faster than its rivals and pointing to strong website traffic and improving customer satisfaction.
On the company's quarterly earnings conference call on Nov. 5, Chief Executive CEO John Paul Foley, in response to an analyst's question about competition, said: ""We have a seven-year head start. We created the category. I would say, at this point, we do not have what I call like-minded competition, which would be a very well-capitalized technology company. To our knowledge, that company doesn't exist yet, but it may at some point in the coming years.""
About 20 analysts cover Peloton, on average rating it ""buy.""
Citron Research said its $5 target price is based on a comparison with other subscription-based companies' market capitalizations per subscriber.
With Tuesday's decline, Peloton is down 12% from a week ago, when faced criticism for a Christmas ad some labeled as ""sexist,"" and before it cut subscription prices for its video streaming service.

The stock remains up 12% from its IPO in September.

The agency, founded in 1995 by brothers and advertising moguls Maurice and Charles Saatchi after they were ousted from Saatchi & Saatchi, also said non-executive directors Michael Peat and Lorna Tilbian had stepped down.
""We have accepted the decision of these directors to resign. We are determined to restore the operational performance and profitability of the business and are already implementing all of the recommendations set out in the PwC report,"" Chairman Jeremy Sinclair said in a statement, referring to an independent audit review.
Sinclair said the company had started a process to reconstruct its board with new independent directors, who ""will have a mandate to conduct a full review of all aspects of our governance"".

153,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 01:57PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court justices lean toward insurers on $12 billion Obamacare claims,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared sympathetic to claims made by health insurers seeking $12 billion from the federal government under a program set up by the Obamacare law aimed at encouraging them to offer medical coverage to previously uninsured Americans.
The justices considered a challenge by a group of insurers of a lower court's ruling that Congress had suspended the government's obligation to make such payments. The insurers have said that ruling constituted a ""bait-and-switch"" that would enable the government to withhold money the companies were promised.
The court's four liberal justices, in addition to Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, all asked questions indicating they are inclined to vote for the insurers.
""Why doesn't the government have to pay its contracts just like everybody else?"" said Justice Stephen Breyer.
Moda Health Plan Inc and other insurers sued in an effort to compel the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make the payments. The program in question was designed to help insurers recover from early losses they suffered after the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) under Democratic former President Barack Obama.
The law, dubbed Obamacare, has enabled millions of Americans who previously had no medical coverage to obtain insurance, including those with pre-existing medical conditions.
Unlike other court cases involving Obamacare, this dispute before the justices concerns only payments to insurers and does not directly challenge the law itself.
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito seemed most supportive of the government.
""Has there ever been a case where this court has, in effect, required Congress to appropriate ... billions of dollars for private businesses?"" he asked the insurers' lawyer, Paul Clement.
Other insurers involved in the case include Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, Maine Community Health Options and Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Company.
If the Supreme Court sides with the insurers, it could result in a significant one-time cash infusion for major companies such as  Humana Inc  (N:HUM), Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) and  Centene  Corp (N:CNC), according to a note by Evercore ISI. Shares of all three were up slightly on Tuesday.
Payments would have come through the law's risk corridor program designed to mitigate insurers' risks from 2014 to 2016, when they sold coverage to previously uninsured people through exchanges established under the ACA.
Under the program, insurers that paid out significantly less in claims on policies sold through the exchanges than they took in from premiums provided some of their gains to the government. Insurers that paid out more were entitled to government compensation for part of their losses.
Roberts questioned whether any of the insurers would have participated in the program if the payments were not available. 
""Its a good business opportunity for them because the government promised to pay,"" he said.
Republicans, who have opposed Obamacare from the outset and numerous times sought to repeal it in Congress, have called the risk corridor program a ""bailout"" for the insurance industry.
From 2015 through 2017, Congress each year passed appropriations bills that included language barring HHS from using general funds to pay the government's risk corridor obligations.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 2-1 in 2018 that Congress effectively repealed its obligation to pay the insurers.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>",Nightmare before Christmas? Traders dig in for long British election night,"By Elizabeth Howcroft, Lawrence White and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - It's the time of year when London's banker and traders wind down and prepare for holidays. Instead, many are cancelling leave and will work all night on Thursday as Britain votes in an unpredictable election that could convulse global markets.
Major banks including  Barclays  (L:BARC) and HSBC (L:HSBA) also plan to deploy extra staff through the night, not just in London but also on trading floors in New York, Hong Kong and Singapore, to make sure they're constantly on call for clients.
This may seem an oversized reaction in an age where trading is increasingly reliant on robots, but this is a financially pivotal event where investors could make or break fortunes. It is Britain's first December election in almost a century, and Brexit itself could be on the table.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ruling Conservative Party is running on a pledge to enact a swift split from the EU, while Jeremy Corbyn's main opposition Labour is promising another referendum on membership of the bloc.
""I just basically canceled all holidays for our trading team next Friday, because we had some people actually who tried to take leave, this has all been canceled, which gives you an idea about what I expect on that day,"" said Marco Pabst, chief investment officer at big Swiss private bank UBP.
""I think Brexit day is going to be a walk in the park compared to a Corbyn majority - and Brexit day was bad.""
The pound plunged more than 10% in the immediate aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, while $2 trillion was wiped off world markets.
While the prospect of a second Brexit referendum could be a positive for sterling, countering factors could be Corbyn's policies to nationalize parts of the economy, as well as further uncertainty as Brexit is delayed once more.
London is the world's biggest center for the global $6.6 trillion a day foreign exchange markets and the biggest hub for secondary bond market trading, meaning any Brexit-fueled volatility can have global implications.
'ADRENALINE KEEPS YOU GOING'
Of the many outcomes possible, market watchers fear an outright Labour Party win as the most damaging one for markets, even though markets assign it a very low probability.
British mid-cap stocks with high exposure to the domestic economy have rallied more than 8% since October while the pound has gained nearly 7% versus the euro to a 2-1/2 year high at 84 pence as markets have increasingly factored in a Johnson win.
Opinion polls have consistently shown the Conservatives holding a healthy lead, yet the pollsters failed to accurately call the last two British elections and dramatically dropped the ball on Brexit and Trump.
Exit polls on Thursday will begin at around 2200 GMT, after voting closes, with a Nomura analysis indicating that if they produce a surprise, sterling will react.
Then the official results will begin to trickle in.
Of particular interest will be results from Sunderland and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which will arrive from 2330 GMT. While all the six seats there are expected to stay Labour, any signs of Conservatives over or under-performing will be seized upon as signposts to a national result.
Jonathan Pryor, head of foreign exchange sales at Investec in London expects these early results will be when clients would first want some insights on the broader picture.
""Obviously it's not easy to stay up all night and the small hours are the hardest bit, but the adrenaline keeps you going.""
(GRAPHIC: GBP positions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9717/9629/GBP%20positions.png)
FIRST TO MOVE: STERLING
There will be no let-up in 24-hour global markets.
Sterling will be the first to react to the early results, according to market players, with the pound versus the dollar and euro the key crosses to watch.
The next potential movers will be the shares of major banks listed in Hong Kong, namely  Standard Chartered  (HK:2888) and HSBC (HK:0005). Next up could be the United Kingdom exchange traded fund (EWU), an instrument that allows investors to trade UK-focused stocks outside British hours.
Then financial eyes turn to miners listed in Australia.
The election is taking place at a time when investors have typically shut their trading books for the year which means any market volatility could be exacerbated. Risk managers are testing electronic trading systems to ensure there are no glitches in case market volatility jumps sharply.
Expected price swings for the pound over a one-week period as measured by derivative gauges is running at around 11%, more than double July's reading, and traders expect it to jump further as election results start coming in.
Some investors such as Kaspar Hense, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management in London who helps manage $60 billion in assets, said it might simply be best to steer clear.
""We have closed our long sterling position going into election night,"" said Hense. ""There is too much risk.""

Deliveries totaled 345 aircraft in the 11 months ended November, compared to 704 last year and were also less than half the number delivered by European rival Airbus in the same period. 
Customers typically pay over the bulk of the money for a new jetliner on delivery, making it a crucial metric for the world's big two jetliner producers.
The company did see a boost in orders around last month's Dubai airshow, bringing the number of orders net of cancellations or conversions this year to 56 at the end of November from 45 a month earlier. 
After an accounting adjustment, Boeing's net total for orders this year improved marginally to -84 airplanes from -95 a month earlier.
The orders included what Boeing called a ""conversion"" by China Aircraft Leasing Group of 8 MAX orders into two 787 Dreamliners. 
The company also said it had booked 30 orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, including an order for 10 Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes from Turkey's SunExpress (IS:THYAO) and another 20 MAX planes from another unidentified customer. Reuters had reported last month that an unnamed airline had signed a firm order for 10 Boeing 737 MAX 7 planes and 10 Boeing MAX 10s.

The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. Federal officials say the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is not expected to authorize the plane to fly until January at the earliest, citing a number of steps yet to be completed. 

Boeing is racing to complete a software upgrade and complementary training protocols required to return the 737 MAX to commercial service.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Bain Capital is close to finalizing a deal for a stake in IT services provider Engineering Ingegneria Informatica that would see the U.S. investor share ownership of one of Italy's biggest technology companies, sources told Reuters.
The deal values Engineering at more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.65 billion) and is in the final stages of negotiations, four sources familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
If successful, Bain will become the biggest investor in the Rome-based IT company in tandem with NB Renaissance Partners, an investment platform backed by New York-based Neuberger Berman.
NB Renaissance owns a joint 88% stake with Apax Partners.
The pair first invested in Engineering in 2016 and is now expected to part ways, with Apax selling its stake to Bain, the sources said.
Founder Michele Cinaglia still owns 12% of Engineering and will remain invested, one of the sources said.
NB Renaissance, Bain and Apax declined to comment.
Neuberger Berman is in the process of raising 1 billion euros for its third Italy-focused buyout fund, sources had said.
The fund, dubbed NB Renaissance Partners III, is seeking deals in the eurozone's third-largest economy in sectors that include industrials and technology.
Apax kicked off the sale earlier this year in a bid to take advantage of the company's positive performance and high growth rate following a series of bolt-on deals including the recent purchase of cybersecurity firm Cybertech.
Bain is finalizing the governance terms with NB Renaissance while also ironing out the financial details of the deal, two of the sources said.
Bain has emerged as the most motivated bidder for Engineering having trumped rival proposals from European private equity firms Cinven, PAI and Intermediate Capital Group (ICG) which initially expressed interest in a possible investment but subsequently walked away, several sources said.
PAI, Cinven and ICG declined to comment.
Engineering, founded in 1980 and led by Paolo Pandozy, is valued at roughly 10 times its estimated core earnings of 160 to 170 million euros in 2020, representing a final top-range price in excess of 1.6 billion euros, two of the sources said.
The company employs around 11,000 staff in 65 locations across Europe, the United States and South America. It reported a 20% rise in adjusted core earnings last year which hit 147.2 million euros while revenue was up 15% to 1.18 billion euros.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 12:06PM ET</span>",Labour's big state plans spook British business,"By Andrew MacAskill and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - In April, the man who will be Britain's finance minister in a Labour government sought to reassure the head of the country's biggest telecoms group BT that it would not feature in his sweeping nationalization plans.   
On the sidelines of a conference in London amid rumors about Labour's ambitions, John McDonnell told Chief Executive Philip Jansen: ""BT is not part of our plans,"" according to a person briefed on the talks.   
But without warning, McDonnell last month stunned the company and the business community by pledging to take over its broadband network and provide free internet for all if Labour wins power in this week's election. He has not met BT since.
McDonnell said he cannot remember what he discussed with BT but the account is probably accurate. The policy was developed a few months ago in response to anger among the public and business over slow broadband.
""This connectivity issue is absolutely critical to our economy,"" he told Reuters. ""We are trying to develop a fourth industrial revolution here and we can't be held back by anyone.""
The move confirmed the fears of many executives that McDonnell's promise of the most radical socialist government in British history will end the pro-business climate that has endured since the days of Margaret Thatcher.
Labour policies include plans to nationalize rail, mail, utility and water companies, give 10% of big companies' shares to staff, bring in a four-day working week, hike taxes on the wealthy, and ramp up borrowing and spending.
The party says social discontent behind Britain's shock 2016 vote to leave the European Union still runs deep, and voters who feel left behind by decades of unchecked capitalism and years of spending cuts will put Labour in power.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's opinion poll lead has narrowed recently, meaning Labour could lead a minority government in charge of the world's fifth-largest economy.
Polls also show more than half of the public support nationalization of rail and water companies, higher taxes on the rich and putting workers on boards. But the agenda has put Labour on a collision course with business.
ABSTEMIOUS
McDonnell, 68, has spent the last three years meeting executives from companies such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) to explain his vision, drinking only tea to protect his abstemious reputation.
Once recorded encouraging disgruntled workers to spit into their bosses' tea, he now presents himself as a soft-spoken, pragmatic and affable figure. The combination of reassurance and radicalism makes him one of the most intriguing figures in British politics.
Executives are impressed by his eagerness to meet them, describing him as hard-working and open to ideas, attentive to their needs when it comes to Brexit and willing to explain his party's radical plans.
But they worry about what they say is his habit of producing policy changes out of the blue, despite assurances that he has ""nothing up my sleeve"" and ""what you see is what you get"".
In November, McDonnell was asked whether he would impose a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and if so, how it would work. ""No and no,"" he replied. Days later the policy was included in the party's plans for a greener economy.
That followed Labour's announcement last year that it would force all large companies to hand over a tenth of their equity to the workforce. The British Chambers of Commerce said this was a ""massive new source of uncertainty"" that could hit investment.
John Caudwell, the billionaire founder of retailer Phones4u, told McDonnell in a radio program on Monday that while he welcomed efforts to narrow the gap between rich and poor he feared Labour would harden its policies once in government.
""I am not interested in manifestoes (policies) because you will change your mind when you get in power,"" he said.
McDonnell, who trained to be a priest, met top finance executives last month where he was challenged on plans to nationalize companies at a price set by parliament, potentially below market rates.
""If you sell private assets at under face value you'll never attract international investment again,"" said one executive who was there. ""I don't think he gets it. He's a lifelong Marxist who wants to get his hands on the wheel.""
McDonnell, who has previously described Marx, Lenin and Trotsky as political influences, declined to discuss private meetings. But he said most conversations with business leaders focused on the scale of investment Britain needed and the reaction was largely positive.
Once fired for being too radical from the hotbed of 1980s left-wing politics, the Greater London Council, McDonnell was installed as Labour's finance spokesman in 2015 when his friend Jeremy Corbyn became leader.
McDonnell believes Britain needs ""an irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favor of working people"".
""We're setting our sights higher than any opposition party has ever done before, and we're doing that because we have to,"" he said. ""Our agenda is radical because people are demanding change."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) published a consultation paper on Tuesday asking market participants if they wanted shorter trading hours to help improve staff diversity and the mental wellbeing of traders.
The consultation paper sought feedback on five options: four covering shorter hours, and a fifth on making no changes to the trading day that currently starts at 0800 local time (0700 GMT in summer) and ends at 1630.
Options include opening 30 minutes to an hour later, and closing up to an hour earlier. It also proposes cutting the number of ""auctions"" during the trading day from five to three.
""There is a general sentiment that a coordinated approach by European exchanges would be required in order for a change to be effective,"" the LSE said.
Regulatory approval would be needed for any change to go ahead, it added.
The Investment Association, which represents asset managers, said it was very pleased that the LSE had listened to traders' calls.

The potential benefits of shorter hours include concentrating liquidity, helping to encourage diversity of staff, and a positive impact on mental wellbeing of staff, the consultation paper said.
Traders say shorter hours would cut the overlap in trading hours with the United States and have far reaching benefits for traders, but could drive some business to exchanges outside Europe.

It is unclear if all main exchanges in Europe would back shorter hours.

164,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>","Kudlow Says No Decision on Brazil, Argentina Steel Tariffs","(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s top economic adviser said Tuesday the administration hasn’t made a decision about re-imposing steel tariffs on Brazil and Argentina, even though the president said last week the duties were “effective immediately.”
The director of the White House’s National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, said at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council in Washington that reinstating tariffs has been discussed but there’s no decision yet.
Trump said Dec. 2 that the U.S. would restore the duties to punish the two Latin American countries for “a massive devaluation of their currencies” that he said had hurt U.S. farmers.
His action amounts to retaliation against two nations that have become alternative suppliers of soybeans and other agricultural products to China, grabbing market share away from the U.S. Rural voters, including farmers, are a key constituency for Trump as he heads into the 2020 presidential elections.
While the steel tariffs could crimp trade, the Latin American countries gain much more shipping crops to Chinese buyers. In the first 10 months of the year, Brazil has shipped $25.5 billion in farm products including soybeans and pork to China. That’s more than 10 times the value of steel and iron products sold to the U.S.

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) needs “a second, lower priced, service to compete with Disney+, Apple+, Hulu, CBS All Access and Peacock,” analyst Laura Martin wrote.

(Reuters) - Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) Chief Financial Officer Simon Ayat is stepping down after nearly 12 years in the role and will be replaced by second-in-command Stephane Biguet, the top oilfield services provider said on Tuesday.
Reuters last year reported that Biguet, a 24-year veteran of the company and currently the vice president of finance, was slated to succeed Ayat as the company's finance chief.
The move comes shortly after former chief operating officer Olivier Le Peuch took over the top job in July, following years of declines in share price and a hit from cuts in spending by U.S. oil and gas producers.
""It's not uncommon for companies the size of Schlumberger that when a new CEO comes in to want his/her own CFO in place,"" Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co analyst Byron Pope said.
CEO Le Peuch has been making changes since taking over. He abandoned his predecessor's asset-heavy focus and took a related charge of $12.7 billion charge last quarter.
Le Peuch has also vowed to exit unprofitable businesses, focus on returns, accelerate digital investments and restructure Schlumberger Production Management (SPM), one of former CEO Paal Kibsgaard's major initiatives.
SPM, a business that took direct stakes in oil projects, faced criticism from many investors as it raised Schlumberger's exposure to volatility in oil prices and is often cited among the reasons for Kibsgaard's exit.
Pope, who called Biguet's appointment a net positive, also noted that investors associate Ayat with the SPM business owing to his long tenure in the role.
Ayat, who will step down as CFO in January 2020, will remain with the company as a senior strategic adviser to the CEO for two years, the company said.

Biguet's base salary has been set at $770,000, compared with the $1 million base salary Ayat earned last year. Ayat's total compensation for 2018 was $5.59 million.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said it would only consider money-laundering reforms after it completes a thorough assessment of the issue, dashing hopes the EU executive would act rapidly to crack down on dirty money flowing through the continent.
Last week, EU governments backed a plan to strengthen the bloc's powers to combat money laundering in the wake of a series of banking scandals. They said an EU body with an independent structure and direct powers over lenders should be considered, echoing similar calls from the European Parliament.
But the EU executive commission is not planning concrete proposals any time soon.
""We will follow up as appropriate after a thorough assessment,"" a spokeswoman for the EU finance commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said, stressing that at this stage it was difficult to preempt the outcome of this analysis.
Dombrovskis has said he wants quick progress, but he plans to issue merely an action plan on anti-money laundering at the end of March, the commission's draft long-term agenda shows.
This drew criticism from lawmakers who wanted the European Union to act urgently.
""When it comes to the fight against money laundering, we need less action plans and more legislative action,"" said Markus Ferber, a German center-right lawmaker who leads on financial matters the largest political grouping in the European Parliament.
He said governments and lawmakers had made it clear that reforms to combat dirty money were urgent. ""I would be disappointed if those clear messages only resulted in yet another action plan,"" he said in an emailed statement.
""We have already many impact assessments. We need to use them now. The Commission should speed up the working,"" Greens lawmaker Sven Giegold said.
The EU adopted an action plan on money laundering last year, after it emerged that 200 billion euros ($220 billion) in suspicious payments were made through Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) tiny Estonian branch, in the EU's largest money-laundering scandal.
As part of that plan, the Commission had already assessed the EU legal framework and concluded in July that supervisory tasks could be transferred to an EU body.
Despite criminal organizations frequently laundering the proceeds of their illegal activities abroad, the fight against financial crime in the EU is currently mostly handled by national authorities, which do not always cooperate fully.
In November, a confidential report from the European Central Bank showed Malta's largest lender, state-owned Bank of Valletta (MT:BOV), had for years failed to address dirty-money risks."
168,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 11:19AM ET</span>",McDonald's could sell over 250 million Beyond Meat burgers in U.S. annually: UBS,"(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp is selling only 20-30 plant-based Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) burgers per day in Canadian restaurant testing, although sales are reaching 100 burgers a day in more densely populated areas in the country, industry checks by UBS showed.
In its detailed checks on the tests, which are the first to be made public, the Swiss investment bank said the numbers implied the world's biggest fast-food chain could eventually sell more than 250 million P.L.T. burgers annually if it rolled out the product across its nearly 14,000 U.S. outlets.
That would add up to $325 million in sales annually for Beyond Meat from the partnership, UBS said, although it cautioned that McDonald's traditionally sources each of its burger patties from more than one supplier.
""We believe Beyond Meat has a first-mover advantage - for now - but it appears a door remains open for McDonald's to refine its P.L.T. offering before introducing a plant based patty in the United States,"" analyst Steven Strycula wrote.
""Further, we do not know whether MCD plans to single-source or multi-source a U.S. menu item.""
McDonald's in September became one of the last big fast-food chains to begin tryouts of a plant-based sandwich, launching tests at 28 restaurants in southwestern Ontario.
Analysts and industry consultants, however, have raised questions as to whether the popularity of the plant-based meat burgers is sustainable and whether sales will reach commercially viable levels needed to stay on the menu.
Some estimate a McDonald's franchise would need to sell 300-400 of the burgers a week for it to be viable. The company has given no indication of its attitude to a national launch or how the tests are going.
Separate checks by UBS with Burger King restaurant owners in 350 locations showed the rival chain is selling about 40 Impossible Whoppers, made by Beyond Meat rival Impossible Foods, daily, or about 107 million a year if replicated by its whole U.S. network.
UBS said the same Burger King restaurants were selling about 230 of the chain's signature beef Whopper burgers a day and that those sales had not fallen as a result of the introduction of the plant-based meat alternative.
For Impossible Foods, the Burger King tie-up could fetch about $135 million in annual sales, the bank calculated."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Watches of Switzerland (L:WOSG) is considering buying more stores in the United States and predicted on Tuesday that luxury watch demand will hold up in the U.S. and Britain, where it has just bought four shops from Fraser Hart.
Britain's biggest watch retailer, which distributes Rolex, Patek Philippe, Omega (S:UHR), Cartier (S:CFR), TAG Heuer (PA:LVMH) and Breitling, began expanding in the U.S. in 2017 by buying U.S. jeweler Mayors.
Watches of Switzerland, which reported a 10.3% increase in like-for-like sales in the half and said it expected 8-9% growth for the full year, sees opportunities to buy more stores in the U.S. where the market is ""very fragmented"", its CEO said.
""Today you need more scale to participate and do the marketing, also online, so some of the small retail operations will come up for sale,"" Brian Duffy told Reuters.
The retail landscape for Swiss watches has undergone major change in recent years as brands belatedly embraced e-commerce and, for their brick-and-mortar shops, preferred mono brand stores to outlets carrying several brands.
Small retailers going out of business have fueled consolidation, leading to the emergence of big champions like Watches of Switzerland, formerly Aurum Holdings, or Swiss group Bucherer that has also bought businesses in the U.S.
Duffy said successful retailers had to be actively exploiting all channels, including online sales and digital communication, but also events to reach younger customers.
He said the company was not planning to expand outside Britain and the U.S. for the time being, with the exception of travel retail locations at airports.
The group, which sells one in two Rolex watches in Britain, listed about a third of its shares in London in May.
It said it had paid for the 31.7 million pound Fraser Hart stores acquisition in cash from existing borrowing facilities."

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's central bank is ready for any liquidity squeeze from Saudi Aramco's initial public offering (IPO) and is closely monitoring local banks, its governor said, after heavy demand for loans to buy the stock.
Aramco's long-awaited listing on the Saudi Arabian stock exchange is due on Wednesday, completing the largest IPO on record and raising $25.6 billion from retail and institutional buyers who took on debt to back their orders.
""We don't rule out that there might be squeeze of liquidity later on, that's why I am ready and stand ready to intervene,"" Ahmed al-Kholifey told Reuters.
Saudis had clamored to own part of the ""crown jewel"" of the world's top oil exporter in the lead up to its IPO, with Aramco's institutional tranche 6.2 times oversubscribed, while more than 5 million individuals subscribed to a retail tranche.
The Aramco IPO is the centerpiece of the Saudi crown prince's plans to diversify the economy away from a reliance on oil, as the money will be reinvested by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) to promote growth in other sectors.
Saudi banks extended huge loans for clients wanting to maximize their participation in the IPO, with some expanding lending to four times the official limit, sources have previously told Reuters.
During the IPO process, the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) at some banks had exceeded a 90% ""soft guideline"" set by the regulator, but the ratio improved after the allocation process ended, Kholifey said in an interview.
""So far no bank has come to ask for liquidity from the central bank. We are ready to intervene in case there is a squeeze of liquidity but most of the indicators right now are not worrying,"" Kholifey added.
MONITORING TEAM
The central bank has set up a team specifically to closely monitor all indicators in the banking system during the IPO process, and it held meetings on a daily basis.
""I don't think in the near future they will settle, we have to keep monitoring the situation until we see things are normal, especially the LDR,"" he said.
Saudi corporates snapped up the biggest percentage of allocations to the Aramco IPO at 37.5% and Saudi government institutions were allocated 13.2% of the institutional tranche, the latest figures issued by the deal's lead bank showed.
Kholifey said that less than 2% of retail subscriptions were leveraged, and most of the bank financing went to high-net-worth individuals and institutional buyers.
He expects most of the IPO proceeds to be invested locally by the PIF, given that most of subscription were internal.
Riyadh scaled back its original IPO plans, scrapping an international roadshow to focus on marketing Aramco to Saudi investors and wealthy Gulf Arab allies. It has remained silent on when or where it might list Aramco stock abroad."

Analysts were broadly positive on the results, with a number of firms raising their share price targets. Wall Street was particularly optimistic about the company’s direct buy program, which is expected to add a tailwind to revenue growth. Telsey Advisory Group found “a lot to like” in the quarter, but singled out direct buy, which has shown “early signs of success in supporting revenue per customer growth.”
The stock gained about 12% before the bell, and the pre-market rally suggests that Stitch Fix will recover much of the ground it has lost over the past several months. Shares have dropped more than 20% between a peak in late June and its most recent close, although it has jumped about 40% since an October low.
Here’s what analysts are saying about the results:
Telsey Advisory Group, Dana Telsey
“There is a lot to like” in the results, including customer growth and “a continued acceleration” in revenue per customer.
Direct buy has shown “early signs of success in supporting revenue per customer growth, while the inventory optimization algorithm has led to better success rates and supported the gross margin improvement.”
Outperform rating, price target raised to $33 from $29.
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Youssef Squali
The results “show strong execution” while the guidance “imply sustainable positive trends” over the short and medium term.
Direct buy is “driving incremental demand and profits, and setting up SFIX for a 15%+ revenue CAGR for the next 5 years.”
Buy rating, price target raised to $38 from $36.
KeyBanc Capital Markets, Edward Yruma
Stitch Fix’s inventory optimization algorithm is “driving strong financial performance,” while direct buy “remains an important top-line driver.”
Overweight rating, $34 price target.
William Blair, Ralph Schackart
“Management is executing well on expanding the service offering,” and the better-than-expected profitability is encouraging.
“While the stock remains relatively inexpensive on traditional metrics,” the firm still sees risk surrounding active client growth.
Market perform rating.
Piper Jaffray, Erinn Murphy
Stitch Fix’s EBIT margins remain “well below the LT target of 10%-12%,” despite gross margins approaching long-term targets.
The direct buy program “still has some friction points,” and Piper “will be monitoring how scaling Direct Buy impacts the balance between new customer growth vs. spend per customer and how effectively it can engage lapsed customers.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) has been heavily criticized for mishandling a compensation scheme for victims of one of Britain's biggest banking scandals in a report published on Tuesday.
The fraud at Halifax Bank of Scotland's Reading branch led to six people being jailed in 2017 for a combined 47 years.
The scam involved small business customers being targeted and referred to a consultancy in return for bribes which the judge at the trial said included designer watches, sex with prostitutes and foreign holidays. 
The bank's compensation scheme for victims had 'serious shortcomings', retired judge Ross Cranston said in a review.
The bank likely failed to properly compensate some victims for financial losses arising from the fraud's impact on their business, and showed an 'unacceptable denial of responsibility' for victims' suffering, the review found.
The bank, which has paid 102 million pounds ($130.87 million) in compensation to 71 businesses and 191 directors over the fraud, said it would offer all victims the option to have their cases independently reviewed. 
Cranston also criticized Lloyds for excluding some victims from the scheme and said the bank should assess further cases.
Watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority said it would consider 'further action' against Lloyds over the failings, adding that they needed to be addressed quickly.
""We are disappointed that, after such a long period of time, the consequences of the HBOS Reading fraud for customers have not yet been properly remediated by LBG,"" the FCA added.
Nikki Turner, one of the victims of the HBOS fraud and outgoing director of campaign group SME Alliance, welcomed the report but urged Lloyds to act quickly. 
""It is nearly three years since the guilty verdicts were handed down, and a decade and a half since many of the frauds took place. 
""Victims are suffering real hardship, many lost their businesses, homes and – in some cases – families. They need fair restitution now,"" Turner said. 
Politicians and campaigners have criticized Lloyds for its handling of the fraud at HBOS, a business it bought in a state-engineered takeover in 2009.
Cranston was appointed by Lloyds to assess its compensation scheme for victims, after financial services minister John Glen called for an investigation in December last year.
Lloyds Chief Executive António Horta-Osório apologized to victims and said he was committed to implementing the recommendations of the report.

With consumer spending subdued and a Dec. 12 national election creating new uncertainties, retailers have been hoping for a boost from Black Friday discount events that were first brought over from the United States by Amazon (O:AMZN) in 2010.
The number of payment transactions in Britain as of 1000 GMT on Black Friday was up 12.5% from last year, initial data from Barclaycard showed, bringing some cheer to British retailers who have weathered Brexit concerns and weakness on the high street this year.

The British fashion retailer said on Dec. 10 that trading over November and the Black Friday period was below expectations, with lower than anticipated margins and sell through.
Ted Baker's troubles deepened on Tuesday with the sudden exit of its chief executive and chairman as it issued another profit warning and suspended its dividend.

Marks and Spencer Group Plc (LON:MKS) is no longer analysts’ least favorite British retailer.
RBC’s move to outperform on Tuesday -- the third broker upgrade in less than a week -- means that based on a score of consensus recommendations, M&S has pulled clear of  Sports Direct  (LON:SPD) International Plc, with whom it had shared the joint lowest-ranking in the FTSE 350 General Retailers index. The consensus -- a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold and sell ratings -- is now 2.58, the highest since July 2018.
RBC’s bullishness stems from M&S’s “price investment in high volume lines, less confusing promotional activity and stronger new innovation pipeline,” analyst Richard Chamberlain wrote in a note.
His move follows recent upgrades by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which cited improving customer opinions on the company’s womenswear range, and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Plenty remain skeptical, however, with a downgrade by Morningstar on Monday meaning the London-based clothing and food retailer still only has four buy ratings among 24 analysts.

Needham analyst Laura Martin, who downgraded the California-based tech giant to ""underperform"", believes Netflix will have to add a lower priced service to compete with competitors including Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) Apple TV+ service and Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Disney+.
The cut came a day after Netflix dominated nominations for January's Golden Globe awards, landing 17 in TV categories and 17 more for movies, including leading contenders ""Marriage Story"" and ""The Irishman"".
Netflix's video streaming push has seen subscriber numbers dwarf those of rival services at the cost of huge investment in both regional and international content on its platform.
The streaming service had 60.62 million paid subscribers in the United States as of its latest quarter ended Sept. 30, accounting for over a third of its global subscriber base.
The approach comes at the cost of a rising debt pile, which stood at $12.43 billion as of Sept. 30, sparking concerns among investors.
Martin argued that the video streaming pioneer's staunch refusal to allow advertising on its platform force it to stick with premium price points which will result in subscriber losses in its most profitable market.
""Netflix's premium price tier of $9 to 16 per month is unsustainable,"" Martin said, adding that the loss of popular TV shows such as ""Friends"" and 'The Office' to its competitors could hit the company's value over time.

181,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 06:53AM ET</span>","After Aramco’s Record IPO, Barely Any of Its Stock Will Trade","(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco will surpass Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). as the world’s biggest listed company when it debuts this week after a record-breaking initial public offering. Unlike the tech titan it displaces, barely any of its shares will trade.
The Gulf oil giant sold a 1.5% stake in the IPO, while the remainder stays in the hands of the Saudi state. That free float, or the proportion of stock owned by public investors that can change hands, is among the lowest globally. Many of the biggest companies, from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., have more than 80% of their equity owned by independent shareholders.
Among the top 1,000 listed companies by market value, only two companies have lower free floats than Aramco, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One is carmaker Audi AG, which has a float of 0.36% with the rest owned by manufacturing behemoth Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG. The other is state-controlled German utility EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG, which has 0.37% of its stock in public hands, the data show. Its two biggest investors each own 46.75%.
Low public ownership levels mean that the Saudi government can push through decisions that are good for the country, but not necessarily Aramco’s minority shareholders. The company, which starts trading Wednesday, will also be captive to OPEC. Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader, meaning Aramco may have to shoulder the burden of production cuts if others don’t meet their obligations.
That level of control could affect your retirement account. Thanks to the popularity of index-tracking funds, many investors will own Aramco shares whether they want to or not.
The company is so big that index compilers like MSCI Inc. and FTSE Russell can speed up its inclusion in global benchmarks. Aramco will likely be given a weighting of about 0.7% in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, triggering $2.4 billion of automatic buying from funds that follow the gauge, according to analyst estimates.
To be fair, even companies that float most of their shares on the public markets find ways to concentrate power at the top. Silicon Valley behemoths like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). have special stock classes giving founders outsized control over decision-making.
Fund managers have given Mark Zuckerberg the benefit of the doubt, thanks to strong returns he’s delivered. The question is whether they’ll do the same for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman."

The blue-chip Dow futures were down 105 points, or 0.4% by 06:48 AM ET (11:48 GMT), while futures on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 also fell.
The losses came after Wall Street's main indexes ended lower on Monday as hopes for at least an interim trade deal ebbed.
Investors are focusing on global trade development with just five days to go before Washington is due to impose a fresh tranche of tariffs on imports from China.
The two sides are negotiating a preliminary deal aimed at de-escalating their 17-month dispute, but there has been near-complete silence from both governments on the issue in recent days, and the void has been filled by reports of both Beijing and Washington taking administrative steps to squeeze each other's companies: China has ordered the removal of all U.S. computers and software from government agencies, while the U.S. is reportedly drafting a bill that would exclude transportation groups CRRC and BYD from federal contracts.
Analysts said markets are still hoping for a delay in the deadline, while expecting more positive gestures from both sides.
Traders were also looking ahead to the Fed meeting, starting later Tuesday. The central bank is expected to hold steady at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday after cutting rates three times this year to shield the U.S. economy from a global slowdown.
The economic calendar is light on Tuesday, with only nonfarm productivity data and unit labor costs due at 8:30 AM and the Redbook retail survey due 25 minutes later.
The NFIB small business optimism index, released earlier, rose to a four-month high of 104.7, beating expectations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From a denim plant in rural Georgia to a St. Paul, Minneapolis loudspeaker maker, nagging uncertainty over when President Donald Trump's trade wars might end, if ever, is confounding many U.S. manufacturers.
A strong consumer base is keeping the U.S. economy humming, but businesses are struggling to make crucial investment and hiring decisions given questions about relations with each of the top 10 U.S. trading partners.
This month alone, Trump announced higher tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-trump/trump-citing-u-s-farmers-whacks-metal-tariffs-on-brazil-argentina-idUSKBN1Y614O; threatened 100% tariffs on $2.4 billion of French cheese, Champagne and other goods https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-france/u-s-vows-100-tariffs-on-2-4-billion-of-french-products-over-digital-services-tax-idUSKBN1Y62HC; and vowed to further hike tariffs on other European Union products over aircraft subsidies https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wto-aircraft/us-may-increase-tariffs-after-wto-rejects-eu-claims-over-airbus-idUSKBN1Y60YJ.
Meanwhile, progress on talks to resolve the 17-month trade dispute with China remains illusive and a trade deal signed with Mexico and Canada is still awaiting ratification by the U.S. Congress.
""We are drowning in uncertainty. This guessing game is chilling investment, putting hiring plans on hold, and sowing sourcing chaos throughout our industry,"" said Steve Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, whose members have been hit especially hard by tariffs on Chinese imports.
Trump has said China would pay for the higher tariffs. But a study by the New York Federal Reserve found that Americans are feeling most of the pain. Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, a campaign grouping more than 150 trade groups that oppose tariffs, said U.S. consumers and businesses have paid an extra $42 billion due to the tariffs since the trade war began.
Just ask Win Cramer, president of privately held JLab Audio.
The San Diego-based maker of Bluetooth headphones has paid out millions of dollars in tariffs since September to keep consumers from bearing the cost, Cramer said. Now, Trump's recent threat to impose even higher tariffs https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/trump-threat-of-more-china-tariffs-could-hit-consumer-goods-before-christmas-idUSKBN1XN2TE ""scares the hell out of me.""
""The uncertainty makes it nearly impossible to make mid- to long-term business decisions,"" he said. ""We have to make really short-term decisions almost week by week by week, because that's how quickly it's changing.""
JLab, which builds 100% of its products in China, is now investing more in expanding its sales and marketing operations in Europe than in the United States because the climate there is more stable.
Cramer visited factories in Vietnam in October, but found the infrastructure and capacity insufficient to ensure production of the 65,000 pieces of equipment per day he needs.
""The scale we need doesn't exist,"" he said. It would take five to seven years to set up outside of China fabrication of the silicon chip sets needed for JLab's air buds and headsets, the second-best selling in the world behind Apple's Air pods.
UNCLEAR WHERE TARIFFS WILL HIT NEXT
Phil Marfuggi, president of Ambriola, a U.S.-based unit of Italian cheesemaker Auricchio SpA based in West Caldwell, New Jersey, said he has put off spending $1.5 million for two cheese-cutting and wrapping machines because it's unclear how long tariffs on Italian cheese will last and whether they could go higher.
""It's all speculative. You really can't invest in your future,"" he said. He had paid over $350,000 in tariffs on five recent Italian cheese shipments, money that he cannot easily recoup.
Marfuggi is also holding off adding imported Italian pasta to his lineup, since it may be zapped next under Trump's ""carousel"" approach to tariffs.
For now, he has slashed marketing and sponsorship outlays by 30% to 40% to offset higher tariffs that have cut revenues by 25% to 30%.
R&D SPENDING DOWN
MISCO President Dan Digre said his Minnesota-based company, an audio equipment maker with 100 employees, has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in tariffs on Chinese parts since September 2018, instead of using the money to launch a new line of higher-end speakers that would be built in the United States.
""It's probably set us back by two years,"" said Digre, who has retained U.S. production long after other rivals moved to Asia. The new line was expected to boost sales and generate 20 more jobs at the plant.
""It just seems wrong. We're not creating anything new. We're spending all this time and money trying to deal with a problem that's more or less self-inflicted,"" he said.
Business spending in the United States declined for the second straight quarter in the July through September period as the trade war eroded confidence. Factory activity contracted for a fourth consecutive month in November as new orders slid, and U.S. factory executives predict https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/about/MediaRoom/newsreleasedetail.cfm?ItemNumber=30638&SSO=1 capital expenditures will drop 2.1% in 2020 vs. 2019.
The labor market has remained resilient, however, in part due to companies' reluctance to let go of workers.
Digre, whose father started the company 70 years ago after serving in World War Two as a B-17 gunner, has tried to stave off any job cuts. ""That's the last resort, so you cut in other areas, like innovation and R&D.""
""STRAIGHT UP WASTE OF TIME""
On the East Coast, Jeff Greenstein, president of Boston-based Delta Cycle, a privately owned maker of bike racks, padded seats and other accessories, said he has cut his marketing budget by a quarter.
""Our sales are probably lower than they would have been, our margins are squeezed and we're definitely spending less on advertising,"" Greenstein said.
One of the biggest problems for Delta, which has annual revenues of $5 million to $10 million, is that tariffs keep changing, often with short notice.
The tariff increases have cascaded through the 35-year-old business, forcing time-consuming and complex changes to the pricing schedule and negotiations with customers and suppliers about how to split the extra costs.
""For a company of our size to have five or six pricing changes in a year is a straight up waste of time,"" he said.
FABRIC OF AMERICA
For Mount Vernon Mills, a South Carolina-based manufacturer of apparel fabrics, uncertainty about congressional passage of a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal has raised questions about investments in new automation equipment.
The private company, founded in 1847, produces 75 million yards of denim and other fabrics each year, much of it in the rural towns of Trion and Alto, Georgia. Most is shipped to Mexico to be sewn into jeans and other apparel, which is then shipped back for sale to American consumers.
There have been some signs of progress on the USMCA trade deal. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said this week the country's senators had accepted proposed changes to the pact, perhaps smoothing the way toward ratification by U.S. lawmakers. That's good news for the companies that make jeans, and the people who wear them.
Scott Deitz, vice president of Greensboro, North Carolina-based  Kontoor Brands  (N:KTB), one of MVM's biggest customers, said the price of the Wrangler and Lee jeans it produces in Mexico could rise by $10 to $15 if Trump makes good his threat to cancel the current North American Free Trade Agreement if Congress fails to pass the replacement accord.
MVM President David Hastings said the yearlong stalemate has stalled investment by his customers and could fuel interest in shifting production from Latin America to Asia and elsewhere, a move that would pose huge challenges for his firm.
""It's important for Congress to adopt this agreement so that these companies have the incentive to continue to invest in this hemisphere,"" he said. ""We're worried. We're the last major denim manufacturer in the United States."""
184,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 05:47AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank Vows to Avoid Capital Raise as ECB Cuts Burden,"(Bloomberg) --   Deutsche Bank   AG (DE:DBKGn) Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing vowed that the bank will execute one of the largest restructurings in its history without the need for extra shareholder funds as he seeks to build credibility with investors.
The lender’s common equity Tier 1 ratio -- a key metric of financial strength -- will be above 13% throughout the end of the year, while the lender’s main regulator reduced its capital burden on the bank for next year as Sewing begins to shrink and simplify Germany’s biggest lender. The bank has said that it wants to keep its CET1 level at 12.5% or higher through 2022.
Sewing is rolling back years of aggressive expansion, when Deutsche Bank sought to compete as a global securities firm, and bolstering controls to avoid a repeat of misconduct charges that eroded its financial strength and reputation alike. The CEO is funding the overhaul by running a lower capital buffer, prompting some analysts to say the margin for error is slim and that the lender could be forced to tap long-suffering shareholders for fresh cash.
The bank “can stick to our commitment to manage our transformation without asking our shareholders for more capital,” Sewing said in a message to staff accompanying the bank’s first investor update in four years on Tuesday. Under previous CEOs, the company raised about 30 billion euros ($33.2 billion) in four capital increases since the financial crisis.
  Citigroup   (NYSE:C) analysts said last month that they cannot rule out a “highly dilutive” capital increase until there is more clarity on how European regulators implement new banking standards. Deutsche Bank’s common equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 13.4% at the end of September. The key driver of Deutsche Bank’s lower capital bar is a decline in the ECB’s so-called Pillar 2 requirement, an assessment of the risk an individual lender poses.
That component will fall to 2.5% next year from 2.75% in 2019, the highest level among the euro area’s 10 biggest banks by assets While several other lenders had seen their ECB-set requirements decline in recent years, Deutsche Bank’s 2.75% bar hadn’t budged since 2017, company filings show.
Banks need capital to absorb losses rather than being forced to ask taxpayers for help if they run into trouble. The issue also matters to investors and staff because falling below the requirements triggers restrictions on dividends and bonuses.
Andrea Enria, who leads the ECB’s oversight arm, said last month that bank capital requirements are “levelling off” as repairs to Europe’s banking sector after the financial crisis come to an end."

Investing.com -- Shares in French pharma giant Sanofi (PA:SASY) soared on Tuesday after the company said it would stop plowing money into developing new diabetes and cardiovascular drugs and also hinted at selling its consumer healthcare business in the medium term.
The news, presented at a capital markets day for investors, is the first big strategic step taken by new chief executive Paul Hudson since he joined from  Novartis  in September.
Giving up on diabetes treatments is a big deal for Sanofi (PA:SASY), which dominated the space for most of the last two decades until its Lantus drug lost patent protection last year.
The trade-offs between in-house drug developments and M&A are a constant concern for big pharma companies, and Sanofi’s failure to replace its cash cow Lantus had weighed on its share price for months. Prior to the news, it had risen less than 10% this year, whereas its Swiss rivals  Roche Holding  (SIX:RO) and  Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) had risen more than 20% each.
“We recognize it is getting more difficult to get breakthrough innovation and that we have to be efficient and move our resources to areas of opportunity, as tough a choice as that is,” Reuters quoted Hudson as telling reporters.
Sanofi (PA:SASY) shares rose as much as 5.4% on the news to close to the two-year high that they hit in October, before retreating slighty to be up 5.1% by 5 AM ET (1100 GMT). They were still the stand-out performer on a morning when all of Europe’s bourses lurched lower on fears that there will be no deal to avert the next round of U.S. import tariffs on Chinese goods taking effect on Sunday.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.9% while the CAC 40 was down 0.7% and the trade-sensitive DAX was down 1.2%. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 1.0%, with less than two days to go before polling in the general election starts.
Sanofi (PA:SASY) had already given an inkling of what was in store on Monday, when it announced the acquisition of U.S. cancer drug specialist   Synthorx   (NASDAQ:THOR) for some $2.5 billion. Oncology will be one of three main units in future, alongside vaccines and general medicines.
The company hinted that it may be willing to part with its consumer healthcare business – which includes Tamiflu and erectile dysfunction drug Cialis – in order to finance future acquisitions. The unit will be run as a standalone business in future, Sanofi (PA:SASY) said.
In the meantime, it also plans to squeeze 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in cost savings out of its supply chain to support profits. Sanofi (PA:SASY) is aiming for a core operating margin of 30% by 2022, up from 25.8% last year."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's markets watchdog said on Tuesday it has recommended that Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) be fined about 2.4 billion yen ($22 million) over the underreporting of former chairman Carlos Ghosn's compensation.
The fine would cover the four financial years from April 2014 to March 2018, markets watchdog the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) said in a statement.
Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in November last year over allegations of financial misconduct, including understating his salary by around 9.1 billion yen over a period of nearly a decade and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to the books of Nissan. He has denied wrongdoing.
Due to the statute of limitations, Nissan is not liable for underreporting before the financial year starting April 2014, an SESC official told a press briefing. Japan's financial regulator the Financial Services Agency will make a final decision on the fine.
A 2.4 billion yen fine would be the second largest ever imposed in Japan for false reporting in a corporate financial statement, behind a 7.3 billion yen fine imposed on Toshiba Corp (T:6502) in 2015, according to the SESC. 
Nissan said in a statement that it was taking the SESC's recommendations seriously. ""We express deepest regret to stakeholders for any trouble caused. We will continue efforts to strengthen governance and compliance including ensuring accuracy of corporate information disclosure,"" it said.
The SESC acknowledged false reporting by Nissan based on its investigation, the official told reporters.
Nissan's new chief executive, Makoto Uchida, pledged on his first day in the role on Dec. 2 to repair profitability and said setting realistic targets would be key to that goal, as Nissan tries to make a clean break from Ghosn's leadership.
Reuters in June cited a source saying Nissan would be fined up to 4 billion yen and that it may receive a reduced fine of around 2.4 billion yen if the automaker filed documentation to the SESC before a formal investigation begins.

""We’re excited to bring UEFA Champions League football to our customers in Germany,"" Alex Green, managing director at Amazon's Prime Video Sport Europe division, said in a statement.
Amazon's move into broadcasting top sports events is seen as a way to boost its Prime subscription service rather than a bid to become a pay-TV operator, although its entry into the market is shaking up the multi-billion dollar battle for sports rights.
The company has had the audio rights for the German Bundesliga since 2017 and has just started showing the English Premier League after it won the rights to 20 matches a season including early December midweek games and Christmas games.
Amazon Prime membership costs 69 euros ($76.05) a year in Germany, its second largest market outside the United States.
Champions League rights in Germany are currently held by Comcast's Sky, which charges 39.99 euros a month for its sport package.
Amazon has also bought rights for tennis and the U.S. National Football League (NFL) to bolster its offering, along with entertainment content such as motoring show “The Grand Tour” and drama “The Man In The High Castle”.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is hopeful of reaching an out-of-court settlement with Goldman Sachs (N:GS) over the 1MDB scandal soon, but that compensation of ""one point something billion"" dollars offered by the bank was too small.
The Southeast Asian nation has charged Goldman and 17 current and former directors of its units for allegedly misleading investors over bond sales totaling $6.5 billion that the U.S. bank helped raise for sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).
Mahathir said they have demanded $7.5 billion from Goldman and negotiations were ongoing.
""We would like to avoid having to go to the courts, but if they come up with a reasonable sum I think we will agree,"" Mahathir, 94, said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.
""But at the moment their offer is too small. We're continuing to talk with them to explain why they should pay what we demand. Of course it's not the full amount, that they may be able to bring down, but we think that we can reach some agreement at a later stage.""
A spokesman for Goldman declined comment.
Mahathir said he hoped an agreement with Goldman would be reached ""soon"".
""Yes, I want to achieve a settlement. We are progressing, if we fail then we'll go to the courts,"" he said. ""We cannot preempt by going to the courts.""
Goldman said in October it was in discussions with authorities on a possible resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB.
The bank could separately end up paying less than $2 billion to U.S. authorities to resolve criminal and regulatory probes connected to the scandal, Bloomberg reported last week.
U.S. authorities say about $4.5 billion was siphoned from 1MDB, founded in 2009 by then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. The scandal helped Mahathir unexpectedly defeat Najib in a general election last year.
Mahathir said Malaysia would not agree to a settlement with fugitive financier Jho Low, accused of playing a central role in the scam. Low has consistently denied wrongdoing and says he does not expect a fair trial in Malaysia as long as Mahathir is in power.
""We think he is very guilty. We have proof of that,"" Mahathir said of Low. ""We want to settle it according to the law.
Mahathir said Malaysian authorities have no contact with Low or his representatives and did not know where he is.
The U.S. Justice Department said last month it struck a deal to recover $1 billion in funds allegedly looted from 1MDB from Low."

But this year is more fraught than usual, industry sources said, because executives are waiting until the last minute to allocate bonuses, worried that market volatility could hit earnings.
Those awards typically account for one-third of compensation for employees who receive them, so they are important. 
By now, division heads usually have a sense of what a bonus pool will look like and what portion their divisions will get. Although formal bonus communications can happen as late as March, executives and consultants start working on decisions after Labor Day and tend to give unofficial guidance to staff before year-end, sources said. (See related graphic at https://tmsnrt.rs/34XManX ) 
But because there is so much uncertainty about what might happen in overnight lending in late December, and the ripple effects it could have on other markets, many executives are taking the unusual step of waiting to divvy up bonus pools until the year is completely finished. (https://reut.rs/2Oyklf8) 
""There may be people working New Year's because they've got to finalize this January 10 or 15,"" said compensation consultant Alan Johnson. ""People are going to be particularly vigilant to make sure that they're going to be paying the right amount, figuring it out right up to the end of the year."" 
At one bank last year, trading heads were told in late-December that millions of dollars needed to be shifted from their bonus pool to other divisions, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on the condition that the bank and person not be named. The industry is trying to avoid situations like that again this year, Johnson said. 
Johnson's firm publishes a closely watched annual report forecasting where Wall Street bonuses are headed. It found that most employees will likely see a decline from last year, especially in equities trading where bonuses could fall 10-15%. Investment bankers can generally expect to see declines of 5-10%, Johnson Associates predicted. 
The expected declines reflect less-than-stellar results across the banking industry this year. Although the industry has recovered dramatically from the 2007-2009 financial crisis, a fresh round of interest-rate cuts from central banks combined with subdued loan demand, weak trading results and declines in some areas of investment banking have left revenue and profits treading water. 
During the first nine months of the year,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and the capital markets divisions of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) reported declines of 1-8% in revenue and 8-18% in profit.  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) was an outlier, reporting flat revenue and a 1% gain in year-to-date earnings. 
Even those who worked on big deals or in business areas or that did well — say, bankers who worked on Bristol-Myers Squibb's (N:BMY) $74 billion acquisition of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), or traders who generated a lot of revenue helping companies manage falling rates — are not assured of a rich bonus. 
GRIM, ANXIOUS
Their bonuses are tied to the performance of divisions and companies overall. That means if a trading division suffers from market chaos, it will get less of the bonus pool, and the overall pool could be smaller because of related losses. 
Sources at some of the banks described the atmosphere around bonuses as grim and anxious. 
Bonus declines would be coming on top of a weak 2018 bonus season for Wall Street, when the average bonus paid to a securities industry employee in New York fell 17% to $153,700, according to a report by the New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. (https://tmsnrt.rs/34XManX) 
Despite the anticipated declines, many bankers aren't too concerned because even without bonuses, their salaries average $398,600 compared to a broader state average for workers of $79,800, the comptroller found. 

""I don't live my life based on my bonus because its purely discretionary,"" a JPMorgan investment banker said, shrugging off the uncertainty.

195,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 03:44AM ET</span>",Stocks Slip While U.S. Futures Drift With Bonds: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks fell in Europe while U.S. equity-index futures fluctuated in the countdown to major central bank meetings and a deadline on fresh China tariffs. Treasuries and the dollar were steady.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index opened lower for a second day as almost every industry sector traded in the red. Contracts for the main American gauges struggled for direction as investors await news on whether Washington will go ahead with a planned Dec. 15 tariff hike on imports from China. The picture was mixed in Asia, where a regional gauge declined overall in below average volumes while shares in South Korea and China bucked the retreat. Japan’s 10-year bond yield briefly touched zero for the first time since March.
Investors appear to be holding back on aggressive trading before a slew of significant events in the next few days, from Federal Reserve and European Central Bank policy meetings to a general election in Britain. The biggest focus arguably remains on whether the U.S. and China can avert a new round of protectionist duties.
“The idea that we have a relatively calmer period of time in the U.S.-China trade tensions is obviously very important,” Ben Powell, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute’s chief Asia-Pacific strategist, said. However, “this is just a temporary period of relative calm,” he said. “The tensions between the U.S. and China are structural and persistent.”
Elsewhere, the Mexican peso strengthened on growing optimism that approval is close for USMCA, the trilateral trade accord to replace Nafta. Oil was little changed.
Here are some key events to watch this week:
The Federal Reserve decides on interest rates on Wednesday, followed by a press briefing from Chairman Jerome Powell.The next European Central Bank policy decision is on Thursday.The U.K. holds a general election Thursday.These are some of the main moves in markets:

Australia's second largest lender offered last month to refund people who bought new shares under the plan before the lawsuit. Some investors had said the offer was a move to fend off criticism about its transparency.
Australia's financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC filed a civil lawsuit in November accusing Westpac of 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, including payments between convicted child exploiters.
The company faces a showdown with investors at its annual meeting this week, seeking to hold back outrage over the money laundering scandal.
In a statement on Tuesday, Westpac said it had raised a total of A$770 million in the share sale, excluding the refunded sum. About 7% of the total eligible shareholders participated in the program, it said."

""China is the UAE's largest trading partner, it is an important economic relationship for us,"" he said.
Mubadala would want to participate in some ""shape, way or form"" in the growth of China, which could become the largest economy in the world, Muhairi said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian equity markets eased slightly on Tuesday, tracking Wall Street declines as investors fretted over a Dec. 15 deadline for the next round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports to take effect.
European equity futures pointed to similarly small moves. Pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 0.03% and German DAX futures were 0.14% lower in early trade, while FTSE futures added 0.1%. Market uncertainty ahead of the tariff deadline was reinforced by comments from U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Monday that while President Donald Trump did not want to implement tariffs, he did want to see ""movement"" from China.
The deadline looms over a series of other significant events this week, with markets also awaiting the UK election on Thursday, and U.S. and euro zone central bank meetings.
Investors have focused this year on the risks of the UK crashing out of the European Union without a deal and a sharp escalation in trade war tensions, said Frank Benzimra, head of equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""What you have seen since the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter was these two risks were receding ... And now this week you see those two concerns coming back on the market,"" he said, adding that he expected their impact to be ""short-term.""
With investors reluctant to make big bets, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.17% lower, with China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index off 0.08%.
Adding pressure in China was new data showing falling producer prices in November while consumer prices spiked, complicating efforts to boost demand as economic growth slows.
Australian shares were off 0.34%, while Japan's Nikkei was down 0.08%.
""The decision whether or not to raise tariffs on Dec. 15 rests with President Trump and he has continued his constructive ambiguity on the issue which is keeping markets guessing,"" said Tapas Strickland, a director of economics and markets at National Australia Bank.
Tepid trade followed weakness on Wall Street overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.38% to 27,909.6, the S&P 500 lost 0.32% to 3,135.96 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.4% to 8,621.83.
Investors were also keeping an eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to keep rates unchanged at its two-day policy meeting, which ends Wednesday.
With rates likely to stay put, analysts say investors will be closely watching policymakers' forecasts for future U.S. economic growth.
On Tuesday, the U.S. two-year yield, watched as a sign of market expectations of Fed fund rates, was at 1.6152%, down from its close of 1.627% on Monday.
The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.8138% from a U.S. close of 1.831% on Monday.
Following the Fed, investors are likely to scrutinize the first policy meeting led by new European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday for clues on where she will take the bank.
While expectations of a Conservative Party victory in Thursday's UK election have powered a rally in the pound, options markets indicate worries of a post-election retreat.
""Polls have been wrong before, so a surprise can't be ruled out - that's exactly what happened in the 2017 election,"" analysts at ANZ said in a morning note.
""But it's not just about Brexit. Fiscal expansion is also on the cards, with ending austerity a major theme of the election irrespective of who wins,"" they said.
Sterling, which hit its highest level against the dollar since April on Monday at $1.3180, added 0.08% to buy $1.3153.

The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.02% at 97.629.
Worries over trade continued to push oil prices lower. Data released on Sunday showed that Chinese exports declined for a fourth straight month, underscoring the impact of the trade war between the U.S. and China, which is in its 17th month.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 12:56AM ET</span>","Founder of South Korea's Daewoo, a symbol of its rise and fall, dies","By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - The founder of the defunct Daewoo Group, Kim Woo-choong, has died after watching the conglomerate he built into a symbol of South Korea's manufacturing prowess become one of its biggest corporate failures, crushed by debt.
Kim, who died on Monday at 83 after battling chronic illness, had led what was once the nation's second-largest conglomerate, symbolizing South Korea's meteoric rise from the ashes of the 1950-1953 Korean War.
""We have never forgotten his expansive vision that if we get out of this small land, there is hope in the world,"" said Huh Chang-soo, chairman of conglomerate GS Group and the head of a lobby group, the Federation of Korean Industries.
But Kim leaves a mixed legacy that underscores the activities of the conglomerates or chaebol dominating the economy, said Park Sang-in, a specialist in corporate governance at Seoul National University.
""The late Kim epitomizes the good and bad sides of South Korean chaebols,"" said Park.
The country's conglomerates grew through cozy relationships with authoritarian governments, focused on growth over profitability, and made excessive investments that resulted in the Asian financial crisis, he added.
Kim began as a fabric salesman who invested about $5,000 in a textiles company to start Daewoo in 1967.
Pouring in enormous energy and exploiting close ties to South Korea’s leaders, he parlayed it into a behemoth that employed more than 300,000 people in 110 countries at its peak, with interests ranging from automobiles to construction, shipbuilding, trading and securities.
In 1989, Kim published a book that galvanized a new generation of South Koreans with bright dreams for the future. Titled ""The World is Wide and There is a Lot to Do,"" its English version was called ""Every Street is Paved With Gold"".
But Kim's aggressive leveraged expansion, which swelled the group to 41 affiliate companies, helped push South Korea to the brink of national default during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s.
Once admired as a hero, Kim fled South Korea in 1999 when Daewoo collapsed with debts of more than $75 billion, forcing the government to step in and take control, leaving taxpayers holding the bag.
Daewoo Motor, part of Daewoo Group, was acquired by U.S. automaker General Motors (N:GM) in the early 2000s.
In 2005 Kim returned home from years in exile, only to be arrested and sentenced to 10 years in jail for embezzlement and fraud for covering up the debt.
But in 2007, an appeals court cut 1-1/2 years off the term, saying Kim had done South Korea a service by forming the group. That year he also received a presidential pardon.
Business groups regretted Kim's death.
""What he started bore fruit,"" said Huh of the business lobby group. ""We now stand as a nation with global trade that makes its way through oceans and continents."""
207,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 12:47AM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Fear Gauge Is Acting Up. That Could Signal Trouble,"(Bloomberg) -- At this point, most investors probably just want the year to be over to book their gains -- especially now that the Cboe Volatility Index is behaving in a way that’s preceded stock losses in the past.
The VIX, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” jumped 16% on Monday to 15.86, while the S&P 500 Index retreated just 0.3% and is still less than a percent away from its record high.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Inc. strategists William O’Donnell and Edward Acton saw the action as “very interesting,” noting that the VIX experienced a “bullish hammer reversal pattern against major horizontal support.” In other words, a technical indicator shows the gauge is likely to keep rising.
That happened just after the S&P 500 and VIX, which move in opposite directions about 80% of the time, rose in tandem for two straight weeks for the first time since early May. Back then, an almost 7% slump in the S&P 500 followed in the next month.
There are several events this week that may be spurring investors to hedge: rate decisions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, and the Dec. 15 date the Trump Administration is set to impose tariffs on another $160 billion of imports from China.
Investors looking for levels on the VIX might want to focus on the 18 area, which represents half of the closing high from last December and is about 50% above this year’s low, according to strategist Todd Salamone of Schaeffer’s Investment Research. The 20 strike is another one to watch as that’s where heavy call-option open interest begins for the Dec. 18 expiration, he said in a note Monday.
Salamone highlighted one more key level -- the 24-25 zone, which would be a test of the year-over-year breakeven, as the VIX ended 2018 at 25.42."

The long-awaited initial public offering of one of the biggest banks in the country, Banque du Caire, in particular could draw funds from outside the region, according to Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer in Dubai.
“In 2019, Egypt has continued to be a consensus favorite among foreign investors, but this has been reflected in the performance of its biggest stock, CIB, not the rest, which are much less liquid,” Malik said in an email. “An IPO of Banque du Caire, at the right price of course, could provide another listed stock with sufficient liquidity to attract fresh inflows from mainstream global emerging market funds.”
Nearly three years ago, Egypt unveiled a program to sell stakes in state-owned enterprises as part of broader efforts to revive the economy by devaluing the currency and raising interest rates to curb a dollar crunch that had battered business activity. The listing plan largely stalled after officials sold an additional stake in state tobacco monopoly Eastern Company in March, yet may restart soon.
Officials expect to start the roadshow for a 30%-40% stake offering in Banque du Caire in January, Mohamed Eletreby, chairman of state-run Banque Misr, which owns the lender, said Sunday. In addition, payments firm e-Finance is wrapping up preparations for an IPO in the first quarter of 2020, its managing director, Ibrahim Sarhan, told the Hapi Journal news website.
Egypt’s EGX 30 equities gauge has lagged behind peers in emerging markets this year, rising 3.1% while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 8.9%. The 30-day average value exchanged in Cairo’s bourse fell to 600 million Egyptian pounds ($37 million) on Sunday, 34% lower than a year ago.
The government had said it plans to raise 100 billion pounds from the sales in three years in sectors including banking, oil and finance, but have moved at a slower pace than expected. Banque du Caire and United Bank were intended to be sold this year, but both were put on pause amid a market downturn.
The decline in interest for stock trading in Cairo partly reflects the government’s measures to cool inflation that soared to over 30% in the wake of the 2016 currency float. Cuts in fuel and electricity subsidies have pressured business activity, which was already struggling amid weak consumer demand.
The impetus now, with the central bank easing rates, is on boosting private sector growth, which could lead to increased appetite for listed companies. But even that effort carries some risks.
“The focus right now is on SMEs,” said Allen Sandeep, director of research at Cairo-based Naeem Holding. “But large enterprises need to be supported as well in order for SMEs to thrive. They are intertwined,” he said, adding that further cuts to rates and adherence to the timeline for the privatization plan are important to help boost the market."
210,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 11:54PM ET</span>",Japan’s 10-Year Yield Climbs to Zero for First Time Since March,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s 10-year bond yield rose to zero for the first time in nine months amid waning global demand for debt.
The nation’s benchmark yields are rising for a fourth month after the Bank of Japan slashed debt purchases and refrained from adding any more easing measures. Bonds have also fallen as optimism that the U.S. and China may reach a partial trade deal sapped demand for haven assets.
Japan’s 10-year yield climbed 1.5 basis points to 0.0% on Tuesday, after being as low as minus 0.295% in September. Similar-maturity U.S. yields have bounced back about 40 basis points since hitting a three-year low of 1.43% that month.
“Investors aren’t confident there is ample demand for bonds in the markets,” said Souichi Takeyama, rates strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “If there is a risk of not being able to sell 10-year bonds in the market, the 10-year yield may not be confined to zero.”
Foreign demand and speculation that BOJ would deepen its negative rate have both been fading, contributing to the decline in yields, Takeyama said.
While the central bank stands pat on monetary policy, Japan’s government is stepping up its fiscal support.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week announced a stimulus package worth around 26 trillion yen ($239 billion) spread over the coming years, seeking to revive the economy grappling with an export slump, natural disasters and the fallout from a recent sales tax increase.
“Ten-year bonds yielding zero should lure demand from domestic investors, likely limiting further upside in yields,” said Shuichi Ohsaki, chief rates strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Tokyo."

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares of Postal Savings Bank of China (PSBC) <601658.SS> marked a subdued Shanghai debut on Tuesday after a $4-billion share sale, underlining worries about dwindling options for lenders in the country to replenish balance sheets in a slowing economy.
The shares of the bank, which has the largest network of branches in China, were up 1.27% at 5.57 yuan by 11:10 am (0310 GMT) versus the offering price of 5.50 yuan in what was the largest mainland share sale in four years. 
PSBC shares had opened at 5.6 yuan.
It is not unusual for Chinese firms to post double-digit gains and in some cases even triple the price on their first day of trade. The PSBC debut adds to the recent downbeat investor reaction to share offerings by the local banks.
Zheshang Bank Co Ltd (HK:2016) (SS:601916) rose less than 1% on its debut in Shanghai on Nov. 27 and dropped below its IPO price the following day.
PSBC said last week that investors had opted out of paying for 3% of shares on offer in the Shanghai listing in a rare development that underscored growing concerns over problems in China's banking system.
Worries about China's banking sector spiked this year after regulators in a rare move seized control of Inner Mongolia-based Baoshang Bank in May, citing serious credit risks.
Since then, regulators have resorted to a series of measures to ease liquidity stress in the banking sector, and repeatedly said risks at small financial institutions are manageable.
PSBC, which first listed in Hong Kong in 2016, is conducting the Shanghai float at the behest of the central bank which wants state-owned lenders to be more responsive to the rigours of capital markets. 
It raised at least 28.45 billion yuan ($4 billion) from the first part of its share sale. Total funds raised could increase to $4.7 billion if it chooses to exercise a greenshoe option of selling 15% more shares within 30 days of the start of trade.

The Hong Kong shares of PSBC (HK:1658) were up 0.2% on Tuesday in a flat broader market.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 09:55PM ET</span>",Explainer: South African Airways is in 'business rescue'. What does that mean?,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Plagued by debt and years of mismanagement, state-owned South African Airways (SAA) has been placed into business rescue - South Africa's bankruptcy protection process - in a last-ditch attempt to save the national carrier.
South Africa's business rescue process, which will shield SAA from the demands of its creditors while an independent advisor takes over, borrows from U.S., UK, Canadian and Australian law. 
But business rescue is uniquely South African in terms of its time tables, ranking of preference among stakeholders and the involvement of labor.
Here are the key aspects of the process:
NEXT STEPS
Under a voluntary business rescue, a restructuring expert known as a business rescue practitioner is appointed by the board to take over management of the distressed company. His job is to salvage the business or at least deliver a better return to creditors than a formal liquidation. 
The business rescue practitioner must quickly assess the company's operations and, within 10 business days, convene creditors and employees to give a view on whether there is a reasonable chance a rescue plan can succeed. 
If he deems there is hope, he is required to present a business rescue plan within 25 days of his appointment.
That could include restructuring the business, its property and its debts. Company assets might be sold. Or the business rescue practitioner could simply map out an orderly winding down of the company. 
The business rescue plan must be voted on and adopted by the affected parties, which include creditors but also employees. 
If the business rescue practitioner finds there is no reasonable chance a rescue plan can succeed, he files a petition for liquidation. 
LABOR
South Africa's strong labor laws extend to business rescue. Employees continue to work for the company on the same terms and conditions and must be consulted throughout the process.
Any changes to workers' employment, including layoffs or salary and benefit cuts, must be agreed between the company and employees in accordance with labor laws. 
Business rescue leaves workers in a better position than a liquidation under which contracts are suspended and claims for salaries and retirement benefits are capped.
THE PECKING ORDER
Company employees also sit near the top in the order of preference for the payment of claims. 
They rank just below the business rescue practitioner's own remuneration and the costs of the process. 
Then come lenders with secured claims dating from before the process began, followed by creditors who provided financing or services after the company was placed in business rescue. 

Last in line are legacy creditors whose unsecured claims pre-date the process.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 09:47PM ET</span>",Honda's Hachigo seizes the wheel as quality crisis hits profits,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Naomi Tajitsu
UTSUNOMIYA, Japan (Reuters) - At a two-day gathering for Honda's suppliers in March, Chief Executive Takahiro Hachigo sounded the alarm.
At the Hotel Higashinihon in Utsunomiya, Hachigo told them the Japanese automaker was facing a crisis after a string of costly recalls and other quality blunders and it needed to plot a new course, according to two people who attended the meeting.
Since then, Hachigo has been quietly working on reforms to centralize decision-making by bringing Honda's standalone research & development (R&D) division in-house and cutting some senior management roles, according to three Honda insiders.
Expected to be announced early next year, the reforms are meant to simplify the way Honda designs cars and put its engineering resources to more effective use at a time when it needs to develop cars for an electric age, the sources said.
""Decades ago, localization ... was the buzz word and our tech center independence was a key driver for innovation,"" said a former Honda executive who now is the head of one of its suppliers. ""Those days are over.""
The sources said Hachigo was poised to integrate Honda R&D Co Ltd into Honda Motor Co Ltd so its technicians work more closely with key departments such as purchasing, manufacturing, quality assurance, and sales and marketing. 
""Honda believes strengthening the automotive business and reforming it in preparation for the arrival of next-generation mobility technologies are our most critical management tasks. This is a priority,"" a Honda spokeswoman said in response to questions about the plans. 
In the 1980s and much of the 1990s, the name Honda struck terror into the hearts of executives at the big three U.S. carmakers in Detroit because they simply couldn't match its low-cost, efficient, well-built cars.
But after a slew of recalls since 2014 for problems with components such as airbags, sliding doors and engines, Honda's status as a benchmark for quality and efficiency has been seriously damaged - and the quality crisis is hitting profits.
According to five Honda insiders, quality blunders have helped squeeze the operating margin at its global automotive business to 2%-3% - giving it less room for maneuver just as bigger rivals are building partnerships and overhauling their operations to become stronger. 
That's in stark contrast to Honda's motorcycle business which has already brought its R&D division in-house and has a margin of 13.9%.
In J.D. Power's study of vehicle dependability in the United States, one of Honda's two main auto markets along with China, the Japanese brand fell to 18th place this year from 5th in 2015 and 4th in 2002, its highest ranking.
""These moves we're making today will decide our eventual fate: whether we're going to be in business as an independent player 10 to 15 years from now,"" a Honda source told Reuters.

'CRAZY COMPLEXITY' 
A senior engineer at a technical center north of Tokyo in Utsunomiya, where Honda does much of its development, said the root of the problem was the ""crazy complexity"" of its vehicle range and all the associated engineering processes.
""Quality is acting up,"" the engineer said. ""Honda has created too many regional models, in addition to an array of types, options and derivatives for its global models.""
""All that's eating up our profit.""
In the United States, for example, Honda's 2020 Accord sedan comes in 13 versions, including three hybrids. GM's rival Malibu has five, though it doesn't have hybrid models.
At the two-day meeting in Utsunomiya, Hachigo and his procurement managers told suppliers to help Honda slash its range of cars and dumb down model types and options.
They called on suppliers to use more common parts, from engines and transmissions to door handles, rear view mirrors and even knobs and switches, according to two people who attended the meeting and slides Honda used in presentations.
Honda's problems stem largely from an aggressive expansion before Hachigo took over in 2015. In addition to so-called global models such as the Civic, Accord and CR-V sports-utility vehicle (SUV), Honda developed a host of regional models which now account for 40% of its global car sales.
They include the Crider sedan in China, the Brio and the Mobilio in southeast Asia, the WR-V in Latin America, which is also now sold in India, the Pilot SUV in the United States and the N-series of micro-minis in Japan.
Its global models, which account for 60% of sales, come with an array of equipment options and vehicle trims that Hachigo, an engineer by training who has worked at Honda since 1982, has called unnecessary product derivatives.
The explosion in the number of regional models had an unintended consequence: the engineering became more complex and the elevated workload led to lapses in quality and costly recalls, two company sources said.
Even though the impact of the Takata airbag crisis had largely subsided by 2017, Honda still put aside 520 billion yen ($4.8 billion) in the 12 months through March 2017 for product warranties and over 450 billion in each of the past two years. 
In the four years before the Takata debacle, warranty provisions ranged from 171 billion to 274 billion yen, before surging to 727 billion in the year ending March 2016.
In 2018, for example, Honda recalled about 600,000 cars in China because sludge was collecting in the engines of six models when driven in cold weather while the sliding doors on its U.S. Odyssey minivans started opening while the vehicles were moving.
For an interactive graphic on Honda's car troubles: https://tmsnrt.rs/2KXziX6
'BACK TO THE MOTHERSHIP'
Hachigo flagged some of the issues at a news conference in May, saying he wanted to eliminate two-thirds of derivative products on global models by 2025 and wean Honda off its tendency to go overboard by creating colors, model types and options specific to different regions.
He said he was aiming to cut engineers' workloads by about a third to free up time and resources for Honda's technical divisions to research technologies for the cars of the future.
What Hachigo and senior Honda officials haven't discussed publicly are the planned structural reforms to help its quality and efficiency drive - and the main target is its R&D division, three company sources said.
Besides the quality issues and engineering workload linked to the proliferation of regional models, the advent of new technologies requires Honda's big-spending technical division to act less independently, two sources said.
""In many ways, Honda's tech companies behave much like university labs, and that was fine in years past,"" the former Honda executive and supplier said.
By putting decision-makers in Honda's Tokyo headquarters, the hope is that the R&D division will deploy capital and human resources more economically.
Honda's R&D and engineering units are expected to spend 860 billion yen this financial year, or 5.5% of expected revenue. Toyota, whose revenue is double, is expected to spend 1.1 trillion yen, or 3.7% of its global revenue, on technology.
Two company sources said Hachigo plans to eliminate the top management roles at Honda R&D and will probably turn some into divisional managers within Honda Motor.
One source said the aim was: ""to centralize the company's fragmented, localized decision-making power back at the mothership in Tokyo.""
According to the engineer, Honda has also introduced an internal quality target to cut global recalls by two-thirds in the next few years from a crisis level of 6 million in 2017.
It was clear at the two-day suppliers' powwow that Hachigo meant business.
Without naming names, Honda executives discussed exemplary product development projects - and bad ones - so lessons could be learned. It was fairly obvious within Honda's small community of suppliers who was being singled out and they weren't happy, said one supplier at the meeting. 
So much so that some skipped golf on day two.

Though for just one day, the delay raises the chance of pre-trial hearings running into next year, eroding hopes of a swift resolution to a case that is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world since it may change how they run capital raising.
The two investment banks and their former client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) (AX:ANZ), and several of their former executives are charged with withholding information from investors about a A$2.5 billion ($1.7 billion) share issue for ANZ in 2015.
Defence lawyers had planned on Tuesday to start cross-examining investigators from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the charges, about how they took witness statements from a third investment bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), which also worked on the stock issue but cooperated in exchange for immunity.
But the defense told the court on Tuesday they had been given what they deemed a crucial ACCC investigator's signed statement, running to about 100 pages with some information obscured, at 9.30 p.m. local time on Monday. That meant they could not proceed with questioning as planned, it said.
""It is particularly troubling that we are provided with these statements in this way at this time,"" Citigroup lawyer Dean Jordan told a pre-trial hearing in Sydney.
The defense had been trying to get information from the regulator about its case outside the courtroom ""for a year (but) it's fair to say the response has been less than helpful"", Jordan said.
""It is entirely regrettable that it's unfolding in this way.""
The magistrate overseeing the hearing, Jennifer Giles, said the delay may mean the cross examination would run into 2020, instead of ending on Dec. 13 as planned. But she held over the questioning until Thursday.
The ACCC has said the banks colluded on the share issue, at the expense of ordinary shareholders, during two conference calls during the stock issue to keep the stock price aloft.
None of the defendant banks or their former staff has entered a formal plea but all have said they plan to fight the charges which carry prison sentences. Their lawyers have previously told the court they plan to question whether the JPMorgan banker statements were ""contaminated"" by the involvement of ACCC investigators.
The regulator and banks have routinely declined to comment on the case outside the courtroom.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former  Boeing Co  (N:BA) employee who warned of problems with 737 production will testify on Wednesday at a U.S. House hearing on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) review of the grounded 737 MAX.
The aircraft has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. Federal officials say the FAA is not expected to authorize the plane to fly until January at the earliest.
Former Boeing employee Edward Pierson, who had worked as a senior operations manager in the flight test and evaluation unit, will testify before the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
Pierson's concerns were referenced at an Oct. 30 hearing - though he had not been named previously.
""All my internal warning bells are going off and for the first time in my life, I’m sorry to say that I’m hesitant about putting my family on a Boeing airplane,"" Pierson wrote to Boeing management before the first crash, according to an email obtained by the committee.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said on Monday that ""although Mr. Pierson did not provide specific information or detail about any particular defect or quality issue, Boeing took his concerns about 737 production disruption seriously.""
He added that after Pierson retired and raised the issue again ""those concerns received renewed scrutiny at the highest levels of the company."" 
Johndroe added ""the suggestion by Mr. Pierson of a link between his concerns and the recent MAX accidents is completely unfounded.""
Eric Havian, a lawyer for Pierson, said in a statement that Boeing refused to act on his client's warnings, which came four months before the first crash, and that Pierson was speaking out ""to ensure that Boeing can no longer place profits above safety."" 
He also said Pierson raised concerns with the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board and was met with ""indifference.""
In a Nov. 25 letter to Havian made public on Monday, the FAA said Pierson's concerns remain under review by the agency and have ""been handled across multiple channels in the FAA.""
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House panel, said Pierson was one of ""a number of current and former employees"" of the FAA and Boeing who have talked to the committee anonymously over the last eight months.
Representative Albio Sires, a Democrat, on Oct. 30, questioned Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg about concerns raised by a Boeing employee about 737 production and his recommendation that production be halted. Sires said the employee wrote directly to Muilenburg in December 2018 after retiring.
""He raised some good concerns. We went back and took a look at his concerns and in some cases we identified areas where we thought his issues had already been addressed,"" Muilenburg said.
Johndroe confirmed Monday Pierson was the employee referenced by Sires.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, FAA Aircraft Certification Service Executive Director Earl Lawrence and a member of the FAA's Technical Advisory Board, Matt Kiefer, as well as former FAA employee G. Michael Collins will also testify.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has declined to appear at a U.S. congressional hearing set for Tuesday on the safety of the company's Baby Powder and other talc-based cosmetics.
In an announcement, the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy said that its efforts to persuade Gorsky to testify included ""repeated attempts to accommodate the company"" over nearly a month.
Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the House panel investigating concerns about cancer-causing asbestos in cosmetic talc and powders, said he was disappointed Gorsky turned down the invitation.
""Mr. Gorsky refuses to speak to the Subcommittee under oath, yet he has not refrained from making multiple public comments on the topic,"" Krishnamoorthi said in a statement. 
J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee had rejected the company's offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&J executive in charge of consumer products. 
Gorsky ""is not, as we have repeatedly told the Subcommittee, an expert in the stated subject of the hearing,"" Knewitz said. ""We have respectfully declined the invitation for our CEO to testify.""
Knewitz said that the composition of the hearing, which includes two experts who have testified for plaintiffs against J&J, also factored into the company's decision.
Gorsky has played a lead role in J&J's efforts to reassure consumers and investors that its talc powders are safe and asbestos free. Last year, he issued a statement vouching for the safety of the products after a jury issued a $4.69 billion verdict in favor of 22 women who sued over allegations their ovarian cancers were caused by J&J powders.
Gorsky appeared on CNBC's ""Mad Money with Jim Cramer"" and in a video posted on J&J's website to rebut a December 2018 Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer that the company knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its talc and powders.
""Since tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J's Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,"" Gorsky said in the video. 
In October, Gorsky testified in a deposition https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-talc-ceo-insight/johnson-johnson-ceo-testified-baby-powder-was-safe-13-days-before-fda-bombshell-idUSKBN1X12GF in a lawsuit filed by an Indiana man, saying, ""We unequivocally believe that our talc and our baby powder does not contain asbestos."" J&J faces more than 16,000 similar lawsuits.
Concerns over asbestos in talc cosmetics have grown in recent months as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the carcinogen had been found in several products, including a bottle of Baby Powder.
J&J said it recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder ""out of an abundance of caution."" Later, J&J said labs it hired found no asbestos - other than some contamination it blamed on an air conditioner - in samples from the same Baby Powder bottle and its production lot.
The FDA has said it stands by its finding.
Chief executives of companies embroiled in controversies routinely comply with lawmakers' invitations to testify.
In recent months, the CEOs of Boeing (N:BA) and Facebook (O:FB) have appeared before congressional committees to answer questions about how their companies were safeguarding consumers.
Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said CEOs have a responsibility to go to Washington when Congress calls, just like other citizens.
But Elson said Gorsky's pass was understandable. He said the CEO and his advisers probably figured that the downside was greater to testifying than not.

""It's being invited in for a punch in the nose,"" Elson said. For Gorsky, ""nothing good will come out of it.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) confirmed on Monday it agreed to loan $40 million to an electric vehicle start-up to facilitate the acquisition of its shuttered Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio.
Lordstown Motors Corp, which is 10% owned by Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS), bought the plant and equipment for $20 million in November as part of its ambitious plan to begin building electric pickup trucks by the end of 2020.
The loan agreement, which was reported earlier Monday by the Business Journal in Youngstown, was filed in Trumbull County last week.
Lordstown Motors has been working on the engineering of the new truck, ""Endurance"", and hired Rich Schmidt, a former director of manufacturing at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, as chief production officer.
""We structured the sales agreement to help support Lordstown Motors’ launch plans for the Endurance pickup,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain said, who added it ""allows them to take possession of the plant and to cover some operating expenses while they undertake their capital raise.""
GM is not investing in the venture, but Cain said GM financing could rise to $50 million.
The fate of the sprawling northeastern Ohio plant became a political lightning rod after GM announced its planned closure in November 2018, drawing condemnation from U.S. President Donald Trump and many U.S. lawmakers.
Lordstown CEO Steve Burns told Reuters last month he hopes to have pre-production prototypes coming off the assembly line by April and to start production by November 2020 with an initial workforce of 400 hourly workers.
Burns said last month the company hopes to raise more than $300 million, the Business Journal reported. Burns told Reuters it retained Ohio investment bank Brown Gibbons Lang & Co in its capital fundraising effort.
GM and South Korea’s LG Chem (KS:051910) said Thursday they will invest $2.3 billion to build an electric vehicle battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio which will be one of the world’s largest battery facilities.
The plant, to be built near the Lordstown complex, will employ more than 1,100 people, the companies said.
As part of the Lordstown sale, GM has the option to lease land near the assembly plant that it could use for the battery plant."

Agilent Technologies' stock price jumped nearly 5% in after-hours trading after Ackman's investment was made public in a regulatory filing. Ackman's $7 billion fund earlier in the year bought Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc shares.
The filing did not say whether the Agilent investment will be active or passive, and Ackman's spokesman declined to comment. The filing showed that Pershing Square owned 2.9 million shares at the end of September and did not say how big the position is currently. At Monday's stock price, that stake would be worth $246 million.
Ackman, who cemented his reputation as one of the world's most widely followed activist investors with bets on Canadian Pacific and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), among others, told investors last month that he had a new position but declined to name it.
That hint sparked heavy speculation about the possible target with guesses ranging from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc to Yum Brands, but the name was successfully kept under wraps.
The new position was announced at the end of a banner year for Ackman when his publicly traded fund has gained 51%.
Agilent, which serves the life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, was created two decades ago when it was spun off from Hewlett-Packard.
In the last year, its stock price has climbed 15.63% while the Standard & Poors 500 index has gained 19%. The company's biggest investors include index funds Vanguard Group, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) as well as T.Rowe Price Associates and Wellington Management.
Ackman's firm has not yet made a so-called 13D filing which is required if an owner's stake exceeds 5%.
For roughly two years, Ackman has kept a lower profile and worked to recapture his reputation as a skillful investor after certain bets, including a 2015 investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:BHC), soured, leaving the firm with heavy losses that sparked investor exits.
He stopped jetting around the world to visit investors. Instead he concentrated on finding new ideas and promised to update investors at periodic dinners and on conference calls.
The Berkshire bet sparked questions about how active Ackman still is and what he is doing to prod management to perform better. He acknowledged that he has not spoken Berkshire's founder Warren Buffett following his recent investment.

222,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 05:33PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. Fed Meeting Kicks Off
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) gets its two-day meeting underway on Tuesday.
Ahead of the meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has suggested that monetary policy was in a good place, strengthening expectations that the Fed would likely keep rates steady at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday.
At its October meeting, the Fed held its benchmark rate at a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
""At this point in the long expansion, I see the glass as much more than half full. With the right policies, we can fill it further, building on the gains so far and spreading the benefits more broadly to all Americans,"" Powell said in a recent speech at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce annual dinner.
2. U.S. Small Business Confidence, Nonfarm Productivity Data Due
U.S. worker productivity and small business activity is also on the calendar for Tuesday.
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) at 6:00 AM ET (11:00 GMT) releases its survey on small-business owners' confidence in the U.S. economy for November.
The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index is forecast to show a November reading of 103.1, up 0.7 points from the prior month.
The Labor Department, meanwhile, releases third-quarter measure of nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Nonfarm productivity is expected to have declined 0.1% in the third quarter, compared with a 2.3% increase in the prior quarter.
3. Oil Supplies in Focus

225,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>","Bayou hedge fund's Samuel Israel, who ran big Ponzi scheme, fails to win freedom","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The ailing former Bayou hedge fund manager Samuel Israel has lost his bid for an early end to his 22-year prison sentence for running a $450 million fraud, as a U.S. judge found it would make a ""mockery"" of federal sentencing laws to set him free.
Chief Judge Colleen McMahon of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan said she had no doubt the 60-year-old Israel, who has spent 11 years in prison, suffers from severe, progressive and incurable medical problems, and was ""certainly not a well person.""
But she called Israel's fraud from 1996 to 2005 ""extremely serious,"" one of the largest Ponzi schemes uncovered before Bernard Madoff's, and said he did not deserve ""compassionate release"" though he could get better medical care outside prison.
""It would make a mockery of the sentencing statute if this financial fraudster, who ruined the lives and finances of hundreds of people while living the high life of an ostensibly successful hedge fund manager, were to have his sentence reduced,"" McMahon wrote.
The judge blacked out Israel's medical problems from her 29-page decision. McMahon had in August 2014 rejected Israel's prior request for a shorter sentence because of ill health. Bayou went bankrupt in May 2006.
A lawyer for Israel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan, who opposed Israel's release, declined to comment.
Israel pleaded guilty in September 2005 to defrauding Bayou investors, and was originally sentenced by McMahon to 20 years in prison.
But rather than surrender as scheduled in June 2008, Israel faked his own suicide by leaving his GMC Envoy on the Bear Mountain Bridge north of New York City, with the words ""suicide is painless"" scrawled in dust on the hood.
He surrendered the following month, and another judge tacked on two years in prison for bail-jumping.
Israel had sought leniency under the First Step Act, a bipartisan law signed by President Donald Trump last December that lets some older prisoners obtain freedom sooner.
McMahon, however, said it would not promote respect for the law to go easy on white-collar criminals who have privileged backgrounds and can afford top-flight lawyers.
""It simply reinforces the belief that there is one law for the white-collar criminal and another law altogether for the ghetto dweller or the drug dealer,"" she wrote.
Israel is eligible for release on Oct. 5, 2027. He and Madoff live in the same Butner, North Carolina, prison complex.
The case is U.S. v. Israel, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 05-cr-01039."
226,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 05:09PM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Drops Ahead of Fed, Tariff Deadline","Investing.com - Stocks moved lower on Monday ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting this week and on worries about U.S.-China trade talks.
The S&P 500 dropped 0.32%. The Dow Jones industrials slid 0.38%, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.40%.
The pullback was probably to be expected after Friday's big rally triggered by the bullish November jobs report.
The declines, including 105 points on the Dow, were enough to push the major indexes into the red for December. Still, the stock market is enjoying its best year since 2013. 
 
The Fed will hold its last meeting of the year starting Tuesday. The two-day affair will end Wednesday afternoon with the announcement. Investors tracked by Investing.com are overwhelmingly betting on the Fed standing pat on the key fed rate of 1.5% to 1.75%.
The meeting will begin two days after the Sunday death of former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker at age 92. 
The trade issue at hand is what happens if the United States and China can't come to a phase one agreement by Sunday night and if President Donald Trump will impose a new round of tariffs on goods imported from China, including cellphones and other electronics.
Larry Kudlow, Trump's economic advisor, said the Sunday deadline was not arbitrary, and there's some betting in Washington that the new tariffs won't be imposed, but tariffs imposed in the fall will be left in place.
What's not clear is how long can either side hold until it says ""no mas."" A reason for Monday's decline was an overnight report that Chinese exports in November were down 1.1% from October. Investors were expecting a small gain.
A last concern is the outcome of Thursday's general election in the United Kingdom and what it might mean for Brexit.
The China concerns weighed on tech and tech-related shares. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) were the weakest Dow stocks, with   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) and   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) the leaders.
The 11 S&P 500 sectors fell back with only consumer staples, consumer discretionary and real estate stocks higher. 
The weakest sectors were healthcare and utilities. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the health-insurance giant, fell nearly 1%. Humana (NYSE:HUM) was off 1.7%. 
After hours, luxury home builder   Toll Brothers   (NYSE:TOL) shares were rising after the company's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat estimates. And the company guided higher.
Also higher was apparel company   Stitch Fix   (NASDAQ:SFIX) after a revenue-and-earnings beat.
Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX), retailers Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and oil-and-gas producer Apache (NYSE:APA) were among the top-performing S&P 500 stocks on Monday. 
International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF), Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) were among the weakest S&P 500 stocks.
 
Crude Oil WTI Futures were off modestly on the day, as was gold. The United States 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 1.833% from Friday's 1.843%. "

GENEVA (Reuters) - A Swiss court convicted a Belgian lawyer on Monday of money-laundering and forgery for taking shares now worth more than 60 million Swiss francs ($60 million) from Belgium's richest family and stashing them in accounts and offshore companies.
The unidentified defendant, who denied the charges, was sentenced to 30 months, half of it suspended, minus time served in preventive detention, which means that she will not be jailed in Switzerland. The Geneva prosecutor had sought four years at her trial last week.
The three-judge tribunal also ordered confiscation of tens of millions found in accounts.
""It was almost a perfect crime. But when you put together a financial scheme, you have to remember what you have already done. You end up making big mistakes,"" plaintiff lawyer Vincent Jeanneret said in the pleadings.
Court papers showed hasty transfers to Singapore, Dubai and Monaco, Jeanneret said, describing a ""Catch Me If You Can"" scenario in an allusion to the Hollywood heist film.
The 57-year-old defendant, who is not being named in line with Swiss practice for defendants not in the public eye, was previously convicted in 2016 in Luxembourg of attempted fraud involving the 2005 testament of the Anheuser Busch InBev (BR:ABI) heiress Amicie de Spoelberch, widow of Luka Bailo. She was sentenced to 24 months, with 15 months suspended.
Prosecutor Niki Casanato said on Monday that the Swiss federal justice office had received a request from Luxembourg for her extradition to serve the remaining time.
Some 915,000 bearer shares in the world's largest brewer were removed from a Luxembourg safe deposit box in 2004 when Bailo died. His sons Patrice and Alexis brought the case against the defendant, leading to her re-arrest in 2017.
""We are satisfied with the ruling ... which demolishes the lies proffered for many years,"" Pierre de Preux, lead lawyer for the Bailo brothers, told Reuters.
Swiss banks became suspicious in 2008 when a whistleblower leaked details of thousands of clients of HSBC private bank, including the lawyer's account with $40 million.
""Three banks made declarations about possible money-laundering - Mirabaud, HSBC, and Rothschild. That set off the investigation,"" Dominique LeCoq, a Bailo lawyer, told the court. It took years to trace funds as the brothers were ""addicts"" who kept no records, although Patrice was now ""clean"", he said."

Tributes to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker poured in Monday as the news spread that the legendary -- and legendarily tall -- inflation fighter died on Sunday in New York at the age of 92.
Former presidents, Treasury secretaries and prominent investors who knew him were quick to praise his sense of public duty and resolute purpose. Here’s what they remembered or tweeted:
Former President Barack Obama
“Paul Volcker believed not just in the power of markets, but in the corresponding power of the government’s duty to make sure that those markets work for everyone,” said Obama. “I’ll remember Paul for his consummate wisdom, untethered honesty, and a level of dignity that matched his towering stature. To me, he was the very definition of integrity, and I’m proud to have called him not just an adviser, but a friend.”
Former President Jimmy Carter
“Paul was as stubborn as he was tall, and although some of his policies as Fed chairman were politically costly, they were the right thing to do. His strong and intelligent guidance helped to curb petroleum-driven inflation, easing a strain on all Americans’ budgets. We are grateful for his service to our country.” (Carter appointed Volcker Fed chair in 1979.)
Jerome Powell
“I am deeply saddened by the passing of Paul Volcker. He believed there was no higher calling than public service. His life exemplified the highest ideals -- integrity, courage, and a commitment to do what was best for all Americans. His contributions to the nation left a lasting legacy,” said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. “My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve mourn this loss and send our condolences to his family.”
Alan Greenspan
“Paul Volcker was the most effective chairman in the history of the Federal Reserve,” said Alan Greenspan, who succeeded him as Fed chairman in 1987.
Richard Clarida
“Paul Volcker was and always will be a personal hero of mine. An autographed photo of him hangs in my Fed office,” said Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida. “He was a role model for anyone aspiring to service and set the highest standard for integrity, courage and leadership as a central banker. He was truly one the giants of modern economic policy.”
Mark Carney
""Paul Volcker was a towering figure among the central bankers of his generation. The integrity and independence he showed in his battle against inflation helped lead the United States -- and with it, the world -- through some of the most testing times of the modern era,” said Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney.
Lawrence Summers
“Paul Volcker was a role model for every financial official who followed him. No one else had a defining impact on American financial policy over 5 decades in the way Paul Volcker did,” said former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
Bill Gross
“Volcker was the Central Banker of the 20th century -- a monetary mensch with cigar to match,” said longtime investor Bill Gross. “He was the figurative and literal Churchill of his time and investors and the economy could not have been more fortunate to have had him.”
Ray Dalio
“I watched him break the back of inflation which was the most profound, important shift in changing the direction of the world economy and required incredible courage,” said Ray Dalio, founder of investment management firm Bridgewater Associates. “In this era, can we have a hero? We’re in an era in which there are no heroes. And he is a great hero.”
Barney Frank
“It’s a terrible loss. He lived a great life. He performed a very valuable service well after most people’s useful life,” said Barney Frank, the former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, who worked with Volcker on post-crisis reforms.
“He looked so forbidding with his height and what not, but he was a very funny, a great companion. He had a great outlook on life and an ability to laugh at things. For all his prestige, he was a very low key guy.”
Jon Corzine
“He was about as imposing and powerful a figure -- and I’ve met presidents and everyone else -- that I’ve ever been in the presence of. He could be funny, but he could be tough. And we needed that as a nation. And he delivered,” said Jon Corzine, the former U.S. senator from New Jersey, who worked most closely with Volcker in the late 1980s while working at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

The Wall Street bank has already raised a significant portion of its target, the report added.
JPMorgan declined to comment.
Mezzanine debt, a hybrid of debt and equity financing, gives the lender the right to convert to an equity interest in the company in case of default, after other senior lenders are paid. Often unsecured, it typically demands a much higher yield than senior debt."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) faces a showdown with investors at its annual meeting this week, seeking to hold back an avalanche of outrage over a money laundering scandal that includes accusations of enabling child exploitation payments.
The chairman, CEO and compliance chief of Australia's oldest and second-largest bank have quit since the bombshell disclosure three weeks ago.
Investors will likely call for more scalps at Thursday's AGM as the company braces for a fine most analysts expect will top A$1 billion ($680 million).
The company also faces a possible vote against its executive pay for a second year under Australia's ""two strike"" rule.
If more than a quarter of shareholders vote against a company's executive pay twice, they can vote to remove the entire board.
AUSTRAC, the financial crime watchdog, has accused Westpac of 23 million money laundering breaches, including payments to suspected child exploiters in the Philippines.
That has taken off 8% from the company's shareprice, or A$8 billion of market value.
Many in Australia were already hostile to the finance sector after a public inquiry during the past year revealed widespread misconduct.
""There's a lot of anger from, particularly, retail shareholders, and I think the angry retail shareholders will deliver out to the board with a strike,"" said fund manager Geoff Wilson, whose company, Wilson Asset Management, holds Westpac shares.
Wilson added his company had not finalised voting plans for the AGM but he would not support removing the whole board.
Though shareholders can call a ""board spill"" vote if more than 25% vote against executive pay for two years running, the vote to remove the board requires 50%, so grassroots campaigns routinely achieve a second strike but no spill.
Amid the negative headlines of 2018, Westpac was one of four financial giants to get more than a quarter vote against its executive pay that year, alongside wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ).
AMP avoided a second strike in 2019. ANZ and NAB have AGMs on Dec. 17 and 18.
Some pension funds and proxy advisers said they would oppose the re-election of Peter Marriott, a former ANZ chief financial officer who has been on the Westpac board since 2013.
""He should be held to account for what's occurred in the time that he's been a director,"" said Bill Watson, CEO of First Super, which holds Westpac shares.
A Westpac spokesman declined was not immediately available for comment.

Volkswagen was charged with 60 counts of breaching the Canadian Environmental Protection Act by importing vehicles that did not conform to prescribed emission standards, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) said.
The charges included two counts of providing misleading information. The court hearing is scheduled for Dec. 13 in the Ontario Court of Justice.
A Volkswagen spokesman said the company has cooperated fully with the investigation by the ECCC. 
""At the hearing, the parties will submit for the Court's consideration a proposed plea resolution and seek its approval,"" he added.In 2015, the agency launched an investigation into the importing of certain vehicle models allegedly equipped with a prohibited ""defeat device"".
In this case, the device was software that reduces the effectiveness of the emission control system during normal vehicle use, according to the agency.

News in 2015 that Volkswagen had used such devices to cheat emissions tests has so far cost the company about 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines, vehicle refits and legal costs, and also triggered a global backlash against diesel vehicles.

232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 03:39PM ET</span>","Taiwan Stocks Will Soar to Record in 2020, Analysts Say","(Bloomberg) -- This year’s unexpected 20% rally in Taiwan stocks is poised to close a final chapter in the history of its financial markets.
The Taiex index is within 7% of its all-time high from 1990, a milestone that analysts say will likely be topped next year. That year marked the bursting of the bubble in Taiwan stocks, which had rallied even more than shares in Tokyo. Taiwan’s recovery contrasts with Japan’s Nikkei 225, which peaked around the same time and remains 40% below its record.
Analysts say a humming economy will keep adding momentum to Taiwan’s financial markets, and next month’s presidential election won’t get in the way. The Taiex has risen 50% since Tsai Ing-wen was elected in January 2016 despite Taiwan’s relations with China worsening after she refused to endorse Beijing’s bottom line that both sides belong to “one China.” Tsai is widely expected to win re-election.
For export-dependent Taiwan, things ultimately circle back to trade. Increased U.S. orders and some Taiwanese companies moving manufacturing back to the island from China amid government incentives have helped make Taiwan a surprise trade-war winner.
“The relations of the U.S., China and Taiwan are like a triangle,” said Quincy Liu, chairman of Shin Kong Investment Trust Co. “Many Taiwan industries and companies are in fact benefiting from the U.S.-China trade war, so it reduces the impact of worsening cross-strait relations.“
Investor focus this year has been on technology, which makes up the bulk of Taiwan’s stock market. Some thanks go to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., whose iPhone sales have improved and powered its shares to record highs. Many component suppliers are based in Taiwan.
“There has been strong inflow into the technology sector, driven by optimism” about the iPhone, said UBS Securities Ltd. analyst William Dong. The just-starting wireless transition to 5G has also been attracting investors to Taiwan stocks, he added, with the liquidity likely to continue supporting the market in 2020.
Taiwan stocks, 40%-owned by foreign investors versus 30% a decade ago according to Taiwan’s market regulator, are in a much different place than 30 years ago.
The Taiex doubled in both 1987 and 1988, nearly did so in 1989 and jumped 30% in the opening six weeks of 1990, a several-year surge which occurred as the Taiwan dollar strengthened on foreign inflows after dropping its peg to the U.S. currency. After the Taiex’s bubble burst, the index plunged 80% in eight months.
“There were only retail investors back then,” said Andrew Tsai, chairman of Capital Investment Management Corp.
Factors attracting foreign capital to Taiwan has been steady economic growth during Tsai’s term, which started amid a mild recession in the wake of China’s 2015 stock-market slump.
The government recently raised economic forecasts for this year and next, and growth has been quickest of the so-called Asian tigers --which include recession-hit Hong Kong. Exports rose from a year earlier in November, the latest data point showing Taiwan’s economic strength. The outperformance has helped reverse 2018’s net equities selling by foreigners.
Taiwan stocks have also historically been income producers, with Taiex components having a roughly 4% dividend yield in recent years. That’s among the world’s highest, and an increasingly attractive metric for foreign investors as trillions of dollars of government debt sports negative yields. That’s not seen changing as this year’s policy easing by central banks is poised to continue in 2020.
“If global interest rates are still low next year, the Taiex with a 4% dividend yield is key to investors,” said Agnes Lin, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management Taiwan Ltd. But a concern of hers is Taiwan stocks aren’t cheap despite projections of double-digit earnings growth next year.
The Taiex has traded of late at the highest price-to-earnings levels in five years versus both the Shanghai Composite Index and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index."

Attorneys for the 13 states and the District of Columbia, led by New York and California, are seeking to prove in Manhattan federal court that a plan to combine the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers would push up prices, particularly for users of prepaid plans. The state officials, all Democrats, asked Judge Victor Marrero to order the companies to abandon the deal. 
Sprint chief marketing officer Roger Sole took the stand Monday morning. He testified about the company's strategy for enticing customers from competitors, which included slashing prices and touting its efforts to move to next-generation 5G technology.
The states presented evidence on Monday that T-Mobile's prepaid brand MetroPCS lowered the price on its phone plans in 2016 in the same week that Sprint introduced an aggressive promotion to offer phone plans comparable to Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile, but at half the price.
The evidence is central to the states’ argument that Sprint and T-Mobile as standalone companies force competition between the carriers and provide the best deal for consumers.
Sole testified that the promotion’s ""early success faded away pretty soon,"" due to negative perceptions of Sprint’s network quality. The companies argue that the stronger T-Mobile that would result from the proposed $26.5 billion takeover would be better able to innovate and compete to push down wireless prices. 
The case represents a break with the usual process of states coordinating with the federal government in reviewing mergers, and generally coming to a joint conclusion. 
This deal had been contemplated in 2014 during the Democratic Obama administration but enforcers at the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission urged the companies to drop the idea, which they did. 
Fast forward to 2019, and the Republican Trump administration signed off on the planned merger after the companies agreed to sell Sprint's prepaid businesses popular with people with poor credit to satellite television company Dish Network Corp.
Setting up satellite company DISH as a wireless carrier is ""patently insufficient to mitigate the merger's competitive harm,"" the states argued in a court filing. 
T-Mobile CEO John Legere, who steps down in April, last month acknowledged talks with Sprint to extend the merger agreement and did not rule out lowering the $26.5 billion price that was originally agreed upon. 
In a pretrial filing by the companies, they said the stronger, merged firm will be better positioned to compete with AT&T and Verizon as the world moves to the next generation of wireless, or 5G. 

""Prices will go down, not up, as a result of the merger,"" the companies argued in their filing, saying the deal would create $40 billion in efficiencies.

Most of the employees impacted by the job cuts, which hit businesses across the bank, have been informed. Spared from the job cuts are financial advisers in Morgan Stanley wealth management.
The bulk of the terminations will be in technology and operations units, CNBC reported earlier on Monday.
The Wall Street investment bank and wealth firm has been trying to keep compensation expenses down because it expects revenue next year to be under pressure from market volatility, ongoing trade tensions and a global economic slowdown, according to the source.

Morgan Stanley issued a $22 per share price target for Virgin Galactic, estimating that shares of the company could more than double from current levels. Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) was up more than 19% on the day.
""A viable space tourism business is what you pay for today … but a chance to disrupt the multi-trillion-dollar airline [total addressable market] is what is really likely to drive the upside,”Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note.
Morgan Stanley gave Virgin Galactic’s space tourism business - phases one and two of its plan – a $10-a-share valuation, but hypersonic point-to-point air travel – phase three of the plan – at $12 a share.
The $10-a-share valuation is based on the more than 600 people who have put down $80 million in deposits for the right to fly up to 300,000 feet for a few minutes. Actual trips will projected to cost $250,000. 
Virgin Galactica went public on Oct. 28 at $12.34, but the price fell to $7.26 by Friday.
Phase three of the plan remains in the embryonic stage as the company explores how to leverage its space tourism technologies to hypersonic travel. 
Underscoring the threat posed by hypersonic travel, Boeing's (NYSE:BA) venture business Boeing HorizonX recently invested $20 million into Virgin Galactic to explore hypersonics.
Virgin Galactic, backed by Sir Richard Branson, surged on its trading debut earlier this year. It took an unconventional path to Wall Street, ditching the traditional IPO route and going public with a direct listing after raising funds through a merger with  Social Capital Hedosophia .
The company said it has 15 trips in the pipeline for next year and expects to make 270 trips to space by 2023, generating more than $600 million a year in revenue and $270 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization."

(Reuters) - ViacomCBS is planning to sell the CBS headquarters in New York, known as Black Rock, as it seeks to cut costs from the combined company, Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish told reporters Monday.
CBS and Viacom - both owned by the Redstone family - began trading as a combined company on Dec. 5.
Executives had projected that the merged company would result in $500 million worth of cost savings.
Bakish, who led Viacom before taking the helm of ViacomCBS, also said the company would begin $2.5 billion in stock buybacks as part of an existing CBS buyback program that transitioned over as part of the merger.
Neither CBS nor Viacom has been buying back stock recently. 
Black Rock, on the corner of W. 52nd Street and 6th Avenue, has served as CBS headquarters since the 1960s."
238,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 01:51PM ET</span>","Even as pound rallies, traders wary of post-election downside, options show","By Tommy Wilkes and Richard Pace
LONDON (Reuters) - Expectations of a Conservative Party victory in Thursday's UK election have sent the pound rocketing - but some investors are hedging themselves against a surprise outcome that could deal the currency a mighty blow.
Since early November, sterling has rallied 2% against the dollar, hitting a seven-month high of $1.3180 , while against the euro it reached a 2-1/2-year high of 83.94 pence (EURGBP=D3), up 2.7% in the past month.
Opinion polls put the ruling Conservatives on course for a parliamentary majority, enabling Brexit to go ahead by the end of January, 3-1/2 years after the referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union.
But options show there's clearly some nervousness running through the market. On Monday, one-week sterling risk reversals, a measure of sentiment and positioning in option markets, traded at their most bearish since June 2017.
What that means is that the implied volatility premium for sterling ""puts"" over ""calls"" for the period straddling the election has risen sharply.
It's unusual for the option premium to protect against a currency setback to rise at the same time as the currency rallies in the spot market. But that may have something to do with opinion polls' patchy track record of predicting the outcomes of recent UK elections.
While sterling puts were in demand before the 2017 election, the currency's spot market gains were nowhere as remarkable as in the run-up to this vote.
The recent moves have taken the premium for one-week puts over calls - essentially options giving holders the right to sell or buy the pound respectively - from around 0% to more than 3% implied volatility, highs not seen since before the 2017 election.
Risk reversals out to two-month maturities also show the cost of protecting against sterling weakness has risen to levels last seen in April.
""It shows investors are buying spot but also low-delta sterling puts just on the off-chance that if we get a surprise they are protected. In other words you are seeing people hedge for a downside scenario,"" Peter Kinsella, head of global FX at UBP said, adding it was no longer cheap to hedge downside risks.
A low-delta put refers to an option to sell at a ""strike"" price far below current levels.
With one-week implied volatility doubling since Friday and implied volatility on sterling puts above 3%, the premium on a $1.29 strike option has shot up to around 1.7%.
Some option sellers had jacked up prices ""because they don't want to be short downside strikes going into the election,"" Kinsella added.
Some recent sterling gains are down to investors slashing short pound positions - from $7.8 billion in August to $2.4 billion this month.
But some opinion polls still suggest it's too close to call a parliamentary majority for the Conservatives, with vast numbers of undecided voters and calls for tactical voting.
A Labour government, even one formed with support from smaller parties, may send sterling to the low $1.20s, traders reckon.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) forecasts sterling at $1.34 by year-end but says ""the story is not over"".
""There are a lot of scenarios and even a no-deal Brexit is not completely out of the picture,"" JPMorgan strategist Luis Oganes said, adding that this entailed maintaining ""some degree of cautiousness, and we're certainly not going all out on the currency."""

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell in afternoon trading on Monday, with investors keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade relations as planned tariffs on Chinese imports kick in on Dec. 15.
Beijing and Washington are negotiating a first phase trade deal aimed at de-escalating tariff disputes but they continue to wrangle over key details.
Analysts said markets are still hoping for a delay in the deadline, while expecting more positive gestures from both sides, but a lack of fresh update on trade talks sapped risk appetite.
""There is optimism about the potential of a roll back or some positive news on trade that is keeping stocks where they are,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
""But as always it ultimately depends on what we get from President Donald Trump or China on what might be going on with the trade deal.""

 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), the most bullish so far, sees the 10-year note’s yield falling to 1.20% from from its current level of around 1.82%, while BMO Capital Markets,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and TD Securities also project declines. Among major banks that have released 2020 outlooks,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). has the highest yield prediction, but even that is for the benchmark to rise only to 2.25%, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. is the next most bearish with a call of 2.05%.
Expectations for growth, inflation and monetary policy largely explain the differences between the forecasters. Goldman Sachs predicts no action by the Federal Reserve, while SocGen is looking for a full percentage point of central-bank easing. But calls also take into account the U.S.-China trade war, Brexit and the U.S. presidential election.
The 10-year yield has been below 2% since Aug. 1, when escalation of U.S.-China trade hostilities sparked a surge in volatility across financial markets and a temporary sell-off in U.S. stocks.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Walmart in Chile on Monday pulled requests it filed earlier with Chilean courts demanding police protection for its supermarkets, but said looting of its stores continued and that the situation following weeks of unrest remained ""complex.""
The Chilean subsidiary of the U.S.-based retailer (N:WMT) in November told judges in six cities that the attacks on its stores had ""gravely"" affected its ability to operate in the country.
The judicial request for beefed up security - in the cities of Arica, Puerto Montt, Concepcion, Chillan, Temuco and Valdivia - followed a month of violent riots across the country that started over a hike in public transport fares and broadened to address simmering grievances over inequality.
""Given the circumstances in the country, the looting and re-looting of our company's stores persists,"" Walmart Chile said in the statement.
The local subsidiary of the world's largest company said in the statement that 128 of its approximately 400 stores had been looted. It said 35 supermarkets had been set on fire, and 18 of those destroyed.
The company said in a statement on Monday that it did not blame the state or security forces for the damages, nor had it sought special treatment.
""On the contrary, [these requests] were aimed at asking for security in every case that the specific risk or danger made it necessary,"" the company said.

250,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 11:00AM ET</span>","Paul Volcker, Inflation Tamer Who Set Bank Risk Rule, Dies at 92","(Bloomberg) -- Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who broke the back of U.S. inflation in the 1980s and three decades later led President Barack Obama’s bid to rein in the investment risk-taking of commercial banks, has died. He was 92.
He died Sunday in New York, according to the New York Times, which cited his daughter, Janice Zima.
In a career that spanned more than half a century, Volcker became a one-man economic cleanup crew, called on to devise a successor to the gold standard, a cure for runaway inflation and, in 2008, a response to the housing-market collapse that exposed Americans as perilously leveraged and their banks as highly prone to risk. That last effort led to the Volcker Rule, widely loathed by bankers and subsequently a top priority for overhaul by the Trump administration.
The grandson of German immigrants, Volcker held strong beliefs about the dangers of inflation and the virtues of frugality. He flew coach, grumbled about restaurant prices and took his first wife on a honeymoon to a fishing cabin in Maine rather than to Bermuda, as she’d hoped. He scorned financial industry innovations such as credit-default swaps and quipped that the best new financial product in recent decades was the automated teller machine.
Obama’s Call
Volcker worked at the Treasury Department, the Fed, or as an economic adviser under six presidents. At 81, two decades removed from his Fed days, he was recalled to government duty in November 2008 by Obama, the president-elect, who named him to head a new Economic Recovery Advisory Board as the nation was struggling to pull out of a recession and recover from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Within months, the 6-foot-7-inch (2 meters) Volcker was standing out as the White House insider pushing for the most radical regulatory reforms. He wanted to bar traditional deposit-taking banks from making speculative investments on their own account, the practice known as proprietary trading, and from investing in hedge funds and private-equity funds. Obama formally proposed the idea in January 2010, calling it “a simple and common-sense reform, which we’re calling the Volcker Rule -- after this tall guy behind me.”
Volcker’s rule was incorporated in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law -- though not before being weakened, which led Volcker to express doubt about the Obama economic team’s commitment to it. “They say they’re for it, but their hearts are not in it,” he told Ron Suskind, author of the 2011 book “The Confidence Men.”
When Volcker left his White House post, in February 2011, regulators were sifting through a flood of public comments on the implementation of Dodd-Frank. Banks continued to argue that Volcker’s proposal would excessively restrict their business.
Wall Street Critics
“Paul Volcker, by his own admission, has said he doesn’t understand capital markets,” Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., said on Fox Business News in February 2012. “Honestly, he has proven that to me.”
The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and three other agencies completed the final rule in December 2013. It ran close to 100 pages, with hundreds more in supporting material, and sought to distinguish proprietary trading from still-permitted market making and hedging to mitigate risks. Volcker quipped that in the end, “I was gratified to see that the rule itself is shorter than my own home insurance policy.”
The rule took effect in July 2015. President Donald Trump, in 2017, ordered regulators to rewrite the rule and soften its effect. In an Aug. 20, 2019, letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Volcker complained that regulators had used “simplification” as an excuse to weaken the rule in a way that would amplify risks to the financial system.
Paul Adolph Volcker Jr. was born on Sept. 5, 1927, in Cape May, New Jersey, to Paul Sr., the coastal town’s manager, and his wife, the former Alma Klippel. The family moved to Teaneck, in northern New Jersey across the Hudson River from New York City, in 1930 when the elder Volcker, a civil engineer, became that town’s manager.
Known as Buddy to distinguish him from his father, Volcker had to repeat kindergarten because teachers interpreted his silent manner as a sign of immaturity, his mother told Newsweek for its 1986 profile.
Princeton, Harvard
He received a bachelor’s degree in 1949 from Princeton University and a master’s degree in political economy and government from Harvard University in 1951. In 1951-1952, as a student at the London School of Economics, he toured Europe at the expense of his planned Ph.D. thesis, which never got done, Joseph B. Treaster wrote in “Paul Volcker: The Making of a Financial Legend,” his 2011 book.
Volcker’s career as an economist began in 1952, when he took a job at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He left five years later for Chase Manhattan Bank, where he worked closely with David Rockefeller, then the vice chairman. In 1962, Volcker took his first job in Washington, as director of the Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Analysis during the administration of President John F. Kennedy. He served as deputy undersecretary of monetary affairs under Lyndon Johnson, where he witnessed the president’s attempt to prevent then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin from raising interest rates. In 1965 Volcker returned to Chase.
He left Chase for Washington for a second time in 1969, this time to be Treasury’s undersecretary for monetary affairs in the Nixon administration. In that role, he helped craft a new international monetary framework to replace the fixed exchange rates and gold standard of the Bretton Woods system, which had been in place from 1944 until Nixon ended it in 1971.
Inflation Warrior
As president of the New York Fed from 1975 to 1979, Volcker became the loudest voice on the Federal Open Market Committee advocating monetary restraint and high interest rates -- a full-fledged inflation warrior. “Sometimes we still hear the argument that in time we can learn to live with inflation,” he said in a 1978 speech. “But experience suggests the contrary -- that this powerful economy of ours will simply not work smoothly or at anything like maximum efficiency or output when there is pervasive uncertainty about the price level.”
President Jimmy Carter appointed Volcker as Fed chief in 1979, succeeding G. William Miller, who became Treasury secretary. Miller had been criticized for being insufficiently focused on fighting inflation. During his 17 months as Fed chairman, inflation had risen to 11.8% from 6.6%.
“The challenge was very clear when I was there: you’ve got an inflation problem and it was getting out of hand,” Volcker said in a 2006 interview. “And the country knew that something was the matter. There was unhappiness with the economy. That is a situation in which you can act.”
Volcker announced what became known as his “Saturday Night Special” on Oct. 6, 1979: a series of measures intended to squeeze inflation. The moves began with a 1 percentage point increase in the rate Fed banks charge financial institutions, to 12%. But the most dramatic was the Fed’s shift to focusing on limiting money supply growth--even if it meant large jumps in interest rates. Which in the end it did, as interest rates climbed as high as 20%.
‘Internal Discipline’
In his 2018 memoir, “Keeping At It,” Volcker said that targeting the money supply provided the Fed with two advantages: A simple message to convey to the American public, and “an internal discipline that had been lacking.”
“We were ‘lashed to the mast’ in pursuit of price stability,” he wrote. “Did I realize at the time how high interest rates might go before we could claim success? No.”
Volcker’s policies came at a high price and the fallout contributed to Ronald Reagan’s landslide victory over Carter in the 1980 presidential election. The U.S. economy went into recession twice during his tenure, the jobless rate climbed to 10.8% in November 1982, and bad loans and bankruptcies soared. Homebuilders and farmers protested. Congressional leaders including Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia and Republican Representative Jack Kemp of New York introduced legislation aimed at requiring the Fed to lower interest rates. The bills were not adopted.
A bodyguard was assigned to Volcker after a man entered the Fed building in Washington with a sawed-off shotgun, revolver and knife, according to William Greider’s 1987 book “Secrets of the Temple.”
Congressional Hearings
Volcker struck some as aloof during televised congressional hearings, puffing on a cigar and shaking his head while being questioned by angry lawmakers. Toward the end of his tenure at the central bank, he was challenged by Reagan appointees to the Fed who favored lower rates.
Though he was vilified in some quarters for the impact on business, his determined--and successful--assault on inflation won him admirers in both U.S. political parties and among a generation of central bankers from New Zealand to South Africa.
Volcker “deserves primary credit for the signal macroeconomic achievement of the past 30 years -- slaying the inflation monster that was engulfing the American economy at the end of the 1970s,” Charles R. Morris wrote in “The Sages,” his 2009 book about Volcker, Warren Buffett and George Soros. “The stable global economic growth of the 1980s and 1990s was grounded on Volcker’s conquest of inflation.”
Volcker stepped down in 1987, saying he didn’t want a third term. His departure and Reagan’s nomination of Alan Greenspan prompted stocks, bonds and the dollar to slide. By that time, the Fed’s benchmark rate was at 6.75%, inflation had slowed to about 4%, and the economy was in the fifth year of an economic expansion.
Volcker became chairman of James D. Wolfensohn & Co., a mergers-and-acquisitions firm that became Wolfensohn & Co. He left after the firm was sold to Bankers Trust in 1996.
Global Assignments
His reputation for rigor and fairness led to his appointment in 1996 to supervise the payment of claims by Swiss banks to Holocaust victims, and in 2004-2005 to lead an independent investigation of the United Nation’s oil-for-food program in Iraq. In 2002 he led an unsuccessful effort to salvage part of Arthur Andersen LLP, the accounting firm that collapsed following its conviction of obstructing justice in the investigation of Enron Corp., its client -- a ruling that would be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005.
Volcker became a critic of the Fed’s response to the financial crisis after the central bank orchestrated the sale of Bear Stearns Cos. to JPMorgan Chase in March 2008 by taking some of Bear Stearns’s riskiest assets on to the Fed’s own balance sheet. The central bank was operating at “the very edge” of its legal authority, he said in an April 2008 speech to the Economic Club of New York.
He also challenged the easy-money policies under Greenspan, without attacking his successor by name. In an October 2008 interview with Charlie Rose, he said, “We bent over backwards to ease money for reasons I didn’t understand.”
In 2013 he formed the New York-based Volcker Alliance, an organization aimed at rebuilding public trust in government and enhancing the effectiveness of public administration.
Volcker had two children, Janice and James, with the former Barbara Bahnson, whom he married in 1954. Her severe arthritis and diabetes kept her in New York during her husband’s tenure as Fed chairman, and he would commute home from Washington on weekends. She died in 1998. In 2010, Volcker married his longtime assistant, Anke Dening."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - World No. 1 shipbuilding group Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co Ltd's (KS:267250) $1.8 billion merger with rival shipbuilder Daewoo (KS:042660) will face a full-scale investigation in Europe due to serious EU antitrust concerns, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
Hyundai in January announced the deal to create the world's biggest shipbuilder with a 21 percent market share, in part a response to over-capacity in the industry. 
The European Commission will launch an investigation into the deal next week following a preliminary review which ends on Dec. 17, the people said.
A full-scale investigation can take up to five months and in most cases ends with companies forced to sell off assets or transfer technology or contracts to rivals to address competition concerns.
The EU competition enforcer declined to comment. The deal also requires regulatory clearance in South Korea, Singapore, China and Japan. Kazakhstan has already given the green light. Hyundai last week said it was working with Singapore's regulators to allay their concerns.
""We will do our best to get approval without any problems,"" a Hyundai Heavy Industries spokesman said on Monday. State-funded Korea Development Bank (KDB)  owns 55.7 percent of  Daewoo Shipbuilding  and Marine Engineering Co Ltd, which has previously declined to comment beyond saying that Hyundai was leading the regulatory process. 
Hyundai is seeking to convince EU regulators to take into account the competitive threat from the merged China Shipbuilding Industry Corp (CSIC) and China State Shipbuilding Corp Ltd, other sources said previously, an entity with sales more than three times its own.

The two Korean shipyards have said they will compete independently after merging, with each company able to negotiate their own contracts with customers and suppliers.

254,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 09:13AM ET</span>",Flying cars could lure investors away from ground-based services: survey,"By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - Electric air taxis — known colloquially, if somewhat misleadingly, as ""flying cars"" — could draw millions of investor dollars away from ground-based transportation start-up firms in 2020, according to a study released on Monday.
The still-young electric air taxi business “has the potential to significantly disrupt the landscape of urban mobility,” but still faces significant roadblocks to commercialization and profitability, according to the 2020 Emerging Technology Outlook from investor website PitchBook.
The research firm predicted that air taxi start-ups such as Joby Aviation, based in Silicon Valley, and Germany's Lilium Aviation, could draw a record level of venture investment in 2020, despite a lull in funding in 2019.
PitchBook values Joby at $450 million and Lilium at $576 million. To date, Joby has raised more than $128 million from investors, including the corporate venture arms of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), JetBlue Airways and Toyota Motor. Lilium has raised more than $100 million, with China's Tencent Holdings a major investor.
German automaker Daimler and China's Geely Automobile are investors in a third air taxi startup, Stuttgart-based Volocopter, which has raised nearly $100 million and is valued at $250 million.
Electric air taxis come in several shapes and sizes, and many look quite different from conventional fixed-wing aircraft. Electric motors replace jet engines, and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, designed to avoid the need for long runways, have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.
Only a few companies, such as Geely-owned Terrafugia, make vehicles that actually look like cars with wings.
Electric air taxis are likely to fly low-level routes, especially from city to city, thus relieving traffic congestion on roads. But they will potentially add to air traffic congestion as they become more popular.
The PitchBook survey notes that the nascent industry, while posing a long-term threat to ground-based transportation providers, still faces regulatory and technological hurdles that will require more time and serious capital to resolve.
The potential for electric air taxis to lower operating and maintenance costs dramatically is expected to attract millions more in funding to help offset massive cash burn rates and a lack of revenue.
Lilium is said to be seeking $500 million from investors — more than the total invested in the entire sector since 2009, according to PitchBook.
""We need to be in the front row of these opportunities"" to invest in electric air taxi start-ups, said Jim Adler, head of Toyota AI Ventures, which provided funding for Joby.
""If flying cars happen, Toyota will be there."""
255,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>","As petrol prices rise, more Egyptians convert to dual-fuel vehicles","By Mahmoud Mourad
CAIRO (Reuters) - The number of Egyptians switching to dual-fuel vehicles is accelerating as the government pushes motorists to use cheaper, cleaner and plentiful natural gas.
About 300,000 vehicles, mostly taxis and minibuses, have been converted to dual-fuel systems since the 1990s -- a small fraction of the 11 million vehicles licensed in the country.
But authorities are encouraging more drivers to switch by subsidizing vehicle conversions, keeping compressed natural gas (CNG) prices low, and building CNG fuelling stations and conversion plants.
Nearly 32,000 vehicles were converted during the financial year from July 2018 to June 2019, two petroleum ministry officials said. The target for this financial year is 50,000 vehicles. That compares with just 6,000 conversions in 2015/16. 
Officials say the number of private cars converting is rising. They hope this will soften the blow of petrol price hikes after recent subsidy removals, as well as reducing pollution and cutting the import bill for liquid fuels. 
Egyptians have seen steep increases to fuel prices since 2014, with most energy prices brought up to international levels under a three-year, IMF-backed reform plan completed this year.
But gas has remained cheap compared with liquid fuels. 
One cubic meter of CNG costs 3.5 Egyptian pounds, roughly the equivalent of one liter of diesel at 6.75 pounds or one liter of 80-octane petrol at 6.5 pounds. 
""The ministry of petroleum has maintained an appropriate price so that natural gas always stays at 50% of the 80-octane petrol (price), which encouraged drivers to turn to conversion,"" said Abdelfattah Moustafa Farahat, head of Egyptian International Gas Technology GASTEC.
Private cars now make up 30% of conversions, Farahat said.
GAS BOOM
Officials say a boom in natural gas production and exploration since the discovery of the giant offshore Zohr gas field in 2015 spurred them to act. Egypt became self-sufficient in natural gas in late 2018.
""The discovery of Zohr field and achieving self-sufficiency in natural gas have encouraged the state to think: why don't we use this gas as a domestic fuel and work to expand its use,"" said ‭‭‭‭Ayman Shalaby, assistant vice chairman at the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS).
GASTEC is one of two state-run companies, along with the Natural Gas Vehicles Company (Car Gas), that dominate the sector. Private and foreign companies have also entered the market the past few years.
GASTEC plans to set up 54 new dual-fuel stations with CNG over the next three years, in partnership with Italy's Eni (MI:ENI), as well as building more fuelling stations for public buses, Farahat said. Currently, Egypt has 187 CNG fuelling stations and 72 conversion centers.
The government also has a plan for minibuses, a common form of cheap transport across Egypt. Under the scheme, 142,000 minibuses would be converted and another 88,000 old diesel minibuses replaced with biofuel equivalents over the next three years, while more than 350 fuelling stations would be built. 
Motorists gave the dual-fuel system mixed reviews. Some praised cost savings on fuel, but complained of reduced power or luggage space. 
Officials say conversions are preceded by technical checks and the cylinder size and shape can be adapted to the vehicle.
The government is subsidizing and providing low-interest installment plans for conversion systems, which cost 5,000-7,500 pounds ($310-$465), as well as encouraging assembly plants and importers to provide vehicles with built-in systems.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's biggest automaker Avtovaz said on Monday it would buy out General Motors (N:GM) from their joint venture producing vehicles in Russia under the Chevrolet brand, effectively ending GM's presence in car assembling in the country.
Russia's car market was among Europe's top performers before the imposition of western sanctions in 2014 which, coupled with falling oil prices, sharply weakened the rouble, increased the cost of buying a car and curbed Russians' ability to buy new vehicles. 
As a result, foreign carmakers started to rethink their strategies of doing business in Russia. 
On Monday, Avtovaz signed an agreement to buy GM's 50% stake in the venture, which sees the two companies produce the Chevrolet Niva car from a factory in Togliatti, a city on the Volga river. 
Avtovaz did not disclose financial details of the deal which would end GM's presence in the car assembling business in Russia. 
According to the agreement, the factory will continue producing and selling cars under the Chevrolet brand for ""a certain period of time"" before switching to Russia's Lada brand. 
Built in 2001, the Togliatti factory has the capacity to make up to 100,000 cars a year and produces the Chevrolet Niva, whose design was based on the Soviet-era Niva by Avtovaz engineers and developed further with GM's input. 
Russia's automobile market has struggled in 2019, with sales of new cars in November falling by 6.4% year-on-year, the Association of European Businesses (AEB) said last Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in  Tesco  (L:TSCO) rose more than 5% on Monday after Britain's biggest retailer said it might sell its Asian businesses, in Thailand and Malaysia, which analysts valued at up to $9 billion.
Tesco said on Sunday it had begun a review of its Asian operations after receiving approaches for the businesses.
It said the review was at an early stage and gave no details of the interest received in the businesses, which generate about 8% of the supermarket group's total annual revenue and 10% of its profit.
Pulling out of Asia would mark a further retreat toward Tesco's core domestic market and a shift in strategy as the group had identified Thailand, where it is the market leader, as a key growth area at its Capital Markets Day in June.
""Hence, to us, for any approach to be accepted by the Tesco board for Thailand then it needs to be highly attractive if not a knock-out price,"" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.
Shares in Tesco were up 5.5% at 1122 GMT, valuing the retailer at 24 billion pounds ($31 billion), as analysts said rival retailers and private equity investors could be interested.
If Tesco does exit Asia the decision could be made by its new CEO, Ken Murphy, rather than incumbent Dave Lewis who is stepping down next year.
Analysts at Bernstein valued the Asian business at 6.5 billion pounds to 7.2 billion pounds ($8.3 billion to $9.2 billion).
Tesco trades from 1,967 stores in Thailand and 74 in Malaysia. In the six months to Aug. 24 the businesses generated sales of 2.56 billion pounds, up 1% at constant exchange rates from a year earlier, and operating profit of 171 million pounds, up 42.3%.
Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said Tesco's Thai operation was a ""high quality business"", with 50% of its earnings coming from a mall-rental business and 50% from a food retail market that is much less competitive than the UK. He said the Thai business still had significant growth opportunities.
In 2016 France's Casino sold its majority stake in Thai hypermarket operator Big C Supercenter, Tesco's main competitor in Thailand, to TCC Group for 3.1 billion euros. Rival  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) quit Thailand in 2010.
Monteyne noted the Big C deal was at 16 times enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), while Tesco itself trades at 6.8 times.
""That leaves the Thai business hugely undervalued as part of the group. That in itself provides ample justification to consider a disposal, especially if there is unsolicited interest,"" he said.
GROWTH AVENUE
While selling Thailand could mean a material distribution to Tesco's shareholders it would remove a growth avenue from the group, which said in June that it saw an opportunity for 750 new convenience stores in Thailand over the ""medium term"".
Celebrating its 100th anniversary, Tesco is five years into a UK-focused recovery plan launched by Lewis after an accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading. In October Lewis declared Tesco's turnaround complete and said he would step down next summer. Murphy, a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA), has not yet confirmed his start date.
In 2015 Tesco sold its South Korean arm to a group led by private equity firm MBK Partners for $6.1 billion. A year later it sold its Kipa business in Turkey to Migros, the country's largest supermarket chain.
Under its previous management Tesco made costly exits from Japan, the United States and China, starting a retreat from its once lofty global ambitions.
If Tesco does quit Thailand and Malaysia, it will inevitably raise questions over the future of its remaining overseas operations - its central European division, consisting of stores in Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia."

260,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 07:27AM ET</span>",Stocks whacked as China export decline highlights trade war damage,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Global equity markets were in a somber mood on Monday, holding well off recent two-year highs after Chinese export data highlighted the damage from the 17-month long trade war and re-focused attention on a crucial Dec. 15 tariff deadline.
Markets had closed last week in an upbeat mood as forecast-beating U.S. jobs data reassured investors about the U.S. economy and sent MSCI's index of global stocks 0.8% higher (MIWD00000PUS) but those gains stalled as worries about a Chinese economic slowdown returned. 
Wall Street, which closed just 1% off record highs on Friday, was set for a slightly weaker open, futures showed. 
Several big events loom for the week -- the Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday and new European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde holds her first policy meeting on Thursday, the same day as Britain's parliamentary election. 
But at the forefront of investors' minds is the Dec. 15 deadline for the United States to impose a new round of tariffs on China.
Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday that the deadline was still in place but he also said President Donald Trump likes where trade talks with China are going. 
""If we see Donald Trump decide not to delay tariffs, that would lead to a risk-off reaction in markets,"" said Nomura currency strategist Jordan Rochester.
""We don't expect tariffs to go into effect as the talks are ongoing but the trade talks are the main driver this week,"" he said, adding he did not expect any ""fireworks"" from the central bank meetings.
A pan-European equity index (STOXX) inched down 0.1%, having jumped 1% on Friday, as did the German DAX (GDAXI). France's CAC 40 (FCHI) -- hit last week by fears of U.S. tariffs on its luxury exports such as wine and handbags -- shed 0.3 percent.
Europe's energy sector was the biggest loser of the day, falling almost 1% as shares in  Tullow Oil  slumped 60% to 19-year lows (L:TLW) due to issues at its main producing assets in Ghana and the resignation of its chief executive.
Asia, however, managed to notch up small gains, with Japan's Nikkei (N225) adding 0.33 percent and MSCI's Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) up 0.15 percent.
Futures for the U.S. S&P500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indexes were all down a marginal 0.1% (ESc1)  (NQc1)
CHINESE SHIVERS
Markets have been largely working on the assumption that the Dec. 15 tariffs, covering consumer goods such as cellphones and toys, will be dropped or postponed, given Trump will be unwilling to risk a year-end equity selloff.
Concerns about damage being done to the global economy by the trade war, were renewed after China released data showing its exports shrank for the fourth consecutive month in November.
Chinese shares closed 0.2% lower, their losses checked by a rise in imports that was interpreted as a sign that Beijing's stimulus steps are helping to stoke demand.
The U.S. dollar, which bounced on Friday after data showed U.S. job growth increased in November by the most in 10 months, was down marginally against a basket of currencies (DXY) and the euro, at $1.107 (EUR=EBS).
The strong labor market data in the United States allayed fears about a slowdown in the world's largest economy which had been fanned by a series of weak figures on business and consumer activity.
""The clouds of recession still remain well offshore despite troubled economies elsewhere in the world and a trade war,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. 
The biggest currency mover was the British pound which rose to a new 7-month high of $1.3180  as investors raised their bets on a Conservative Party victory - and a majority in parliament - in the general election. 
Yields on government bonds inched lower, in keeping with market jitters as investors awaited the central bank meetings. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were down 2 basis points at 1.8242% 

Oil prices weakened after the disappointing Chinese trade data, with Brent futures (LCOc1) down more than 1% at $63.73 per barrel after gaining about 3 percent last week on the news that OPEC and its allies would deepen output cuts.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 07:14AM ET</span>",Just Eat takeover battle hots up with fresh $6.5 bln Prosus bid,"By Toby Sterling and Paul Sandle
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -  Prosus  (AS:PRX) raised its unsolicited cash offer for British food delivery service  Just Eat  (L:JE) to $6.5 billion on Monday, ratcheting up the pressure on rival bidder Takeaway (AS:TKWY) in their bitter takeover battle.
The Dutch-based technology group's new cash offer of 740 pence per share, up from 710 pence, is about 5% higher than Takeaway's all-share bid, which has the backing of Just Eat.
""Unlike the Takeaway.com offer, which relies on (its) shares remaining at an above-sector multiple, our cash offer provides certainty of value to Just Eat shareholders,"" CEO Bob van Dijk said in a statement.
Prosus also lowered its acceptance threshold to 50% plus one share, down from 75%, and extended its offer period to Dec. 27. It said the new offer is about 25% above the level where Just Eat shares were trading before its first bid in October.
Just Eat said its board was reviewing the latest Prosus offer. ""Shareholders are advised to take no action with regards to the increased offer at this time,"" it said.
Just Eat shares were trading at 781 pence at 1122 GMT, signaling market expectations of a higher bid.
Takeaway's CEO, Jitse Groen, described the new Prosus offer as ""derisory"", noting that it was 9% lower than Just Eat's share price as recently as Aug. 13. 
He urged Just Eat shareholders to accept his offer, which he said would ""combine our two great companies to create the largest global platform in online food delivery outside China"".
'DERISORY'
""A slightly higher derisory cash bid remains a derisory cash bid,"" Groen said. 
""This opportunistic offer significantly undervalues Just Eat and the value that the Just Eat-Takeaway.com combination will deliver to shareholders.""
Investor Cat Rock, which Refinitiv data shows owns 5.9% of Takeaway and 2.6% of Just Eat, said Prosus should pay at least 925 pence per share for Just Eat to compensate investors for the upside they might miss in a Takeaway tie-up, which it supports.
""This revised Prosus offer is wholly inadequate and shows Just Eat shareholders that Prosus cannot muster a credible bid,"" the investor said.
Cat Rock has argued that Just Eat would thrive under Groen's leadership and that shares of the new entity could reach as high as 12 pounds.
Both sides are due to report on how many shares their offers have won by Dec. 12. If neither has emerged as winner, Britain's Takeover Panel will start an auction process from Dec. 27.
Citi analysts said they believe that an auction is the preferred outcome for Prosus, which has the cash to win, adding that Prosus is unlikely to reach the required acceptance level with its bid at 740p per share.
Prosus has given itself capacity to increase its offer during an auction process, Citi said in a note, highlighting that the latest approach was not declared as its ""best and final"" offer.
Citi estimated that 830p per share ""would be a level at which we believe would fairly reward Just Eat shareholders"".

262,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 07:08AM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Futures Edge Lower in Subdued Trade,"Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly lower open on Wall Street on Monday amid concerns that the Sino-U.S. trade war could escalate further as the deadline for fresh U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports looms.
The blue-chip Dow futures were down 28 points, or 0.1% by 7:06 AM ET (12:06 GMT), while futures on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 were also a touch lower.
Wall Street ended solidly higher on Friday, with all three major U.S. stock indexes hovering within 1% of last week’s record highs following a jobs report that blew past analysts’ expectations.
The U.S. economy added 266,000 jobs in November, the largest increase in 10 months, according to the Labor Department.
Investors remained cautious ahead of the deadline for Washington's next round of tariffs against Chinese goods to kick in on Dec. 15.
The two sides are negotiating a preliminary deal aimed at de-escalating their 17-month trade dispute, but it is unclear whether such an agreement can be reached with less than a week to go until the deadline.
China said on Monday that it hoped to make a trade deal with the United States that satisfies both sides as soon as possible.
Sentiment was also subdued ahead of the Federal Reserve’s final meeting of the year later in the week. The Fed is expected to hold steady after cutting rates three times this year to shield the U.S. economy from a global slowdown.
No major economic data is due for release on Monday and on the earnings front, online pet food retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) is due to report after the close along with   Stitch Fix   (NASDAQ:SFIX) and Versum Materials (NYSE:VSM).
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index against a basket of currencies edged down to 97.55, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury was last trading at 1.82%.
In commodities, gold futures were up $2.85 at $1,467.95 a troy ounce, while crude oil was off 0.9% at $58.66 a barrel.

263,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 07:03AM ET</span>",Beijing Pushes for Removal of Foreign Tech in More State Offices,"(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese government is taking further steps to remove foreign technology from state agencies and other organizations, a clear sign of determination for more independence amid escalating tensions with the U.S.
Beijing will likely replace as many as 20 million computers at government agencies with domestic products over the next three years, according to research from China Securities. More than 100 trial projects for domestic products were completed in July, the brokerage firm said. The Financial Times newspaper said the Communist Party’s Central Office earlier this year ordered state offices and public institutions to shift away from foreign hardware and software.
The government under President Xi Jinping has been trying for years to replace technologies from abroad, and particularly from the U.S. Bloomberg News reported in 2014 that Beijing was aiming to purge most foreign technology from its banks, the military, government agencies and state-owned enterprises by 2020. The country’s Made in China 2025 plan also set out specific goals for technology independence, although the policy has been de-emphasized after contributing to trade war tensions.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive policies against China and its leading companies have given the effort renewed urgency. His administration banned U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei Technologies Co. this year and blacklisted other Chinese firms.
“The trade war has exposed various areas of Chinese economic weakness, which Beijing seems determined to rectify,” said Brock Silvers, managing director of Adamas Asset Management. “If the decision pushes Trump to finally come down hard with a more forceful ban of Chinese tech, however, China may one day regret having gone so public with its policy so soon.”
While the current push is narrow in scope, it is designed as part of the broad, long-standing effort to decrease China’s reliance on foreign technologies and boost its domestic industry. The goal is to substitute 30% of hardware in state agencies next year, 50% in 2021 and 20% in 2022, China Securities estimated, based on government requests and clients’ budgets.
The research, from September, detailed Beijing’s goals. The FT reported the number of computers to be replaced could reach 30 million, attributing the figures to China Securities. The newspaper said the goal is to use “secure and controllable” technology as part of the country’s Cyber Security Law passed in 2017.
Starting next year, key industries such as finance, energy and telecom will test more domestic products in trials that may last years, the firm said. Chinese banks are supposed to shift from International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp. and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). to more diversified X86 architecture suppliers and then eventually to fully made-in-China hardware. China has decided to adopt ARM architecture for its domestic hardware, China Securities said.
“The China-U.S. trade war could also help to breed a new market for home-made products,” China Securities analyst Shi Zerui wrote.
Still, Beijing’s push has proven difficult because its domestic industry hasn’t yet shown itself capable of matching foreign technologies in certain sectors. Particularly hard to replace, for example, are semiconductors from suppliers like  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). and Nvidia Corp., as well as software from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
“While large suppliers such as Microsoft and  IBM  are undoubtedly worried, many high-end components, like chipsets, can’t be easily replaced,” Silvers said."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators will review two-decade old rules that determine if companies have the market power to throttle rivals or control prices to take into account globalization and digitalization, Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Her announcement came amidst criticism by lawyers and academics that the European Union's antitrust laws have failed to keep up with the times as regulators examine mergers and anti-competitive practices involving global online companies.
How regulators define markets can help them measure a company's pricing power in a merger or its power to shut out rivals in an antitrust case and the concessions they extract from these companies. The current rules date back to 1997.
""Changes like globalization and digitization mean that many markets work rather differently from the way they did, 22 years ago,"" Vestager told a Chillin Competition conference.
""So the time has come to review the Market Definition Notice. We want to be sure that the guidance it gives is accurate and up to date, and sets out a clear and consistent approach to both antitrust and merger cases across different industries, in a way that's easily accessible,"" she said, calling for feedback from interested parties.
The review will look into the geographic scope of markets. Siemens and  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), whose deal was blocked by Vestager in February, had argued that regulators should have taken more into account Chinese rivals and the global market.
Regulators will also examine how markets are defined in terms of products and whether consumers can easily switch from one product to another, in particular as digitalization means some products are free while some tech giants are also active in different areas.
""So there may be times when we also need to look at the way that these ecosystems can leave consumers locked in,"" Vestager said."

Kocher, who has been in the job since 2016, has come under pressure amid reports of a strategy split within the group and disagreements between board members on whether to pursue a sell-off of some gas assets.
The French state, which holds a 24% stake in the company, is not in favor of renewing her mandate, although it does not plan to force her exit, Les Echos reported, without saying where it got the information.
Kocher's job could be up for discussion at a Dec. 17 board meeting, BFM Business reported last week. The company will publish its shareholder meeting resolutions, which would include nomination proposals, early next year.
France's economy and finance ministry and Engie declined to comment.
Kocher became the first woman to head up a blue-chip French company when she took on the chief executive role in May 2016 to replace Gerard Mestrallet who became board chairman.
She campaigned in 2018 to take on the chairman's role when Mestrallet retired, but lost out after the government backed Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, then head of Belgian chemical group  Solvay  (BR:SOLB), for the job.
Under Kocher, Engie embarked on a major divestment plan to switch the company away from fossil fuels and focus on power grids, renewable energy and energy services.
But she has opposed selling off some of the firm's gas assets, including storage unit Storengy, which would help streamline Engie's structure.
""Our group obviously needs to evolve, we obviously have to accelerate our transformation,"" she told Le Figaro last week. ""But we mustn't dismantle and sell off Engie by bits. I believe that vehemently."""

PARIS (Reuters) - France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) on Monday agreed to buy California-headquartered biotechnology firm  Synthorx  (O:THOR) in a cash deal worth about $2.5 billion as it steps up a push in the lucrative field of cancer drugs under its new chief executive.
Sanofi has offered to buy all the outstanding shares of Synthorx common stock for $68 per share in cash, or a 172% premium to Synthorx's closing price on Dec. 6, 2019.
""This acquisition fits perfectly with our strategy to build a portfolio of high-quality assets and to lead with innovation, as you will hear at our Capital Markets Day tomorrow, December 10,"" Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson said in a statement.
""Additionally it is aligned with our goal to build our oncology franchise with potentially practice-changing medicines and novel combinations.""
Synthorx, which posted a 2018 net loss of $56.6 million, is a clinical-stage biotech company focused on therapies for people with cancer and auto-immune disorders, according to the company's website.
HIGH PRICE?
Sanofi expects to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2020. 
By 0946 GMT, Sanofi shares were down 0.7% at 82.94 euros.
""The acquisition price is full at a 172% premium to Synthorx Dec. 6 close price and is a lot to pay for an early stage pipeline (lead drug THOR-707 is in phase 1 trial,"" Liberum analysts said in a note.
Sanofi is conducting a broad strategy review under Hudson, who took over as CEO on Sept. 1. He will give initial pointers on which businesses he wants to focus on at the investor day in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Dec. 10. 
Hudson has indicated significant changes were underway.
""I am bringing a little sense of urgency and prioritization. I have set a tone already that we can move a little bit faster,"" Hudson told reporters in October.
""I think we have the right level of resources although perhaps not always in the right place.""
Sources have told Reuters Sanofi was contemplating a joint venture or an outright sale among options for its consumer healthcare unit.
In an early sign of the new strategy, Sanofi last week agreed to sell its Seprafilm unit to medical supply company Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) for $350 million in cash.

Sanofi also told staff its most senior strategy boss, Muzammil Mansuri, would leave, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

At a meeting on Tuesday, the board is expected to reject an offer from Canada’s Erwin Singh Braich and Hong Kong-based SPGP Holdings to contribute $1.2 billion toward the fund raising, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
After initially dropping on the news, Yes Bank shares reversed the losses to trade 1.9% higher. They are down 17% since it announced the names of the investors for its proposed preferential issue at the end of last month.
Doubts over key foreign bidders have triggered concerns that the Reserve Bank of India might not allow them to take ownership stakes in the lender. Braich has battled members of his family and creditors in numerous lawsuits, according to Canadian court records.
The bank would prefer to have institutions rather than individual investors involved in its fund raising, said the person, who declined to name the companies in discussions with the bank.
“This is purely speculative and Yes Bank does not, as a matter of policy, comment on market speculation,” Yes Bank said in an emailed response to a request for comment.
Yes Bank needs new investors in order to replenish its capital, which has fallen close to the regulatory minimum following hefty provisions against bad loans. Getting strong investors is important for the capital-starved lender, which has also been hurt by the country’s deepening shadow banking crisis.

  Tullow Oil   Plc (LON:TLW) Chief Executive Officer Paul McDade resigned following poor production performance at the company’s flagship assets in Ghana.
Exploration Director Angus McCoss also quit, the London-based oil producer said Monday as it suspended the dividend. The departures come after a year of disappointments at Tullow, where technical difficulties have hampered output in Ghana, projects in Uganda and Kenya have faced delays, and results from wells in Guyana missed expectations.
“Whilst financial performance has been solid, production performance has been significantly below expectations from the group’s main producing assets, the TEN and Jubilee fields in Ghana,” Tullow said in a statement. The group’s total output next year is now forecast at 70,000 to 80,000 barrels a day, and production for the following three years will average about 70,000 a day.
Dorothy Thompson has been appointed executive chair on a temporary basis and Mark MacFarlane, executive vice president of East Africa and non-operated, has been appointed chief operating officer in a non-board role.

270,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 05:31AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Tesco Soars to 7-Week High on Asian Windfall Prospect,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com --   Tesco   (LON:TSCO) has mission creep in reverse.
Barely two months after Dave Lewis, the pilot of its turnaround, announced his intention to step down as CEO after declaring “mission accomplished”, the mission is shrinking again.
The U.K.’s biggest supermarket chain looks to be returning to its roots after confirming that it’s considering a sale of its Thailand and Malaysia businesses after receiving interest from a third party. A deal could free up billions for reinvestment and for juicing up relatively lackluster shareholder returns.
 Tesco  (LON:TSCO) shares were up 6.8% after early trading in London Monday at their highest in seven weeks. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.1%, and the FTSE 250 down 0.6% as traders pulled in their horns ahead of Thursday’s general election. The broader Stoxx 600 benchmark was effectively unchanged at 407.46 as of 5:25 AM ET (1025 GMT).
The move is consistent with its withdrawal from Japan and South Korea in the last decade, and raises the question of whether it will also retreat from its businesses in central Europe. Like the Asian businesses, the operations are profitable but require investment to stay competitive as a slowing global economy increases competition.
The profitability of both the Thai and Malaysian businesses, which boast operating margins twice that of the U.K. business at 6%, means that  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) will be able to bag an attractive price for them. The price of $9 billion mooted by analysts in the Sunday Times at the weekend would be around 20 times their operating earnings this year, extrapolating from the first half’s figures.
That may seem expensive but, given that the buyers are rumored to be local tycoons, who may not attach the same kind of country risk to the investment that U.K.-based analysts would, and who don't face meaningful checks on their spending from minority shareholders, it’s not entirely unreasonable either.
The same price tag would imply that the two businesses account for over a quarter of Tesco’s value, despite only representing less than 10% of sales. That should make it an easy decision for the outgoing Lewis, and should also leave incoming CEO Ken Murphy in an enviable position, with all the financial resources he needs to set his own course when he takes over in the summer."

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) has named Georges Elhedery and Greg Guyett as co-heads of the global banking and markets division, which contains the lender's troubled investment banking business, as part of a reshuffle under interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn.
Quinn, who replaced John Flint in August, is expected to announce the lender's new strategy at or before its annual results report on Feb. 18.
The new co-heads replace Samir Assaf, who has run global banking and markets since 2011 and who will stay with the business as chairman of corporate and institutional banking.
Guyett, who is currently head of banking, and Elhedery, who leads the markets business, will be tasked with turning around a part of the bank's global business that has underperformed in recent years, with revenues growing only 1% in 2018 compared with 8% and 12% for the retail and commercial banking divisions respectively.
HSBC said in October it would miss a profit target for 2020 and incur hefty restructuring charges as it battles low global interest rates and a revenue-sapping Sino-US trade war.
The bank said on Monday Pam Kaur will become chief risk officer, replacing Mark Moses, while Andy Maguire, chief operating officer, will also leave, replaced by John Hinshaw who joins from Hewlett Packard (N:HPE).

276,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2019 05:06AM ET</span>",Swelling U.S. IPO backlog points to crowded 2020 field,"By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - More and more companies are putting plans for U.S. initial public offerings (IPO) on ice this year because of investor pushback against their valuations, creating a backlog that could make stock market debuts more challenging in 2020.
While 2019 had promised to be a bumper year for IPOs, investor sentiment quickly soured. Shares of high-profile startups such as  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) languished in the months following their listings, culminating in office-sharing startup WeWork cancelling its IPO in September.
This has led to companies' postponing listing plans. Some 44 companies withdrew their IPO registration in 2019 as of Dec. 3, up almost 50% on 2018 and the highest level since 2016, according to IPO research firm Renaissance Capital.
Proceeds from new U.S. listings in 2019 through to November are down 7% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv data. Last month was the third-slowest November for U.S. IPOs in the last 10 years.
Online mattress retailer Casper, clothing company Madewell, cybersecurity firm McAfee and Reynolds Consumer Products are among a growing number of companies putting plans for a U.S. stock market debut on hold, according to people familiar with the matter.
Casper, McAfee, Reynolds and J. Crew Group Inc, which owns Madewell, declined to comment.
Companies eyeing a 2020 listing will have to grapple not just with a busy runway but with potential market volatility fueled by the heated political rhetoric of the U.S. presidential election.
""Everybody is assuming a lot of unpredictability because of the elections next year, so there is likely to be a much bigger chilling effect than anything that has happened with companies until this point with valuations or performance,"" said Kenneth Guernsey, a capital markets partner at law firm Cooley LLP.
A stock market rally that has pushed corporate valuations to historic highs should have supported many of these IPOs this year. However, the shares of many newly listed companies, which in many cases have yet to turn a profit, traded poorly, causing investors to fret that they overpaid in their IPOs.
""It's very hard for normal investors to determine the actual value of these companies, because most of them don’t go public with profits,"" said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management.
To be sure, some companies have indicated a willingness to press on with IPO plans, despite the challenging conditions, with the likes of payments platform Bill.com Holdings and XP Inc, Brazil's largest digital broker, slated to complete public listings in New York next week.
But in the absence of easy access to public markets, some companies are debating whether to go back to private market investors for fresh funding, given that many venture capital and private equity investors are searching for deals.
""The private market is currently flushed with trillions of dollars of dry powder to continue funding private companies,"" said Rashaun Williams (NYSE:WMB), general partner of the All-Star Fund at Manhattan Venture Partners."

Helo Meigas will leave the bank along with head of Baltic Banking Charlotte Elsnitz, the bank said in a statement on Monday. Gunilla Hallros and Jon Lidefelt will take over, respectively, in an interim capacity. The search for permanent replacements has already started, the bank said.
The departures are part of an organizational revamp aimed at boosting confidence in the Swedish lender and simplifying its structure, said chief executive Jens Henriksson.
""Today I introduce a new executive team to develop Swedbank and strengthen trust. Consequently, some executives leave the bank,"" he said. ""I also initiate an assessment of the corporate culture in Swedbank"".
The bank also said it would merge several business units, including its IT and digital banking divisions, while Swedbank Pay and payment infrastructure functions will be integrated within the Large Corporates & Institutions department.
It said responsibility for the ongoing internal and external investigations into ``historical shortcomings in anti-money laundering work'' would be moved to a new Special Task Force unit, reporting directly to Henriksson.
As a result of the merger of the bank’s product units, the head of Group Lending & Payments Leif Karlsson will leave the bank in early 2020, it added.
Swedbank said there would be 14 people in group management following the changes, down from 17 previously."

A Federal Court had adjourned proceedings on the case, brought about by regulator AUSTRAC, to be further listed for a hearing in late February or early March next year, the lender said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.
AUSTRAC commenced proceedings against the lender on Nov. 20 for breaches of anti-money laundering laws, saying the banking giant ignored red flags and for years enabled payments from convicted child sex offenders and ""high risk"" countries.
""Westpac has made a number of changes to its transaction monitoring and is continuing to review its processes and report to AUSTRAC suspicious matters that are identified,"" it said.

Treasuries nudged higher along with European bonds.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fluctuated before drifting lower, with declines in technology shares offsetting gains in retailers. Contracts on the main U.S. equity gauges struggled for traction as traders awaited news on whether Washington will go ahead with a planned Dec. 15 tariff hike on Chinese imports. Stock indexes posted modest increases in Tokyo and Seoul, while gains mostly fizzled in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The pound strengthened as polls showed the U.K. Conservative Party on course to win a majority in Thursday’s election, which would likely mean Britain leaving the European Union by Jan. 31.
With the U.S. and China heading into the final stretch of negotiations to ward off an escalation in tariffs, markets will be watching closely for any signs of progress. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday the two sides are haggling over the amount of U.S. farm products Beijing is willing to purchase. Data showed China’s exports fell 1.1% in November, with those to the U.S. tumbling 23%, underscoring why the nation may want to resolve the dispute.
“There’s no upside risks on the horizon,” Katrina Ell, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, said on Bloomberg TV. “It is weighted to the downside and that big downside risk is coming from the trade war.”
Also in focus for investors this week will be central banks, with policy meetings at the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank that may offer clues on whether more monetary easing is in store in 2020.
Elsewhere, oil trimmed a rally spurred by Saudi Arabia promising significant additional production cuts beyond what was agreed with fellow OPEC+ members.

The company has been facing problems at its operations in Ghana because of mechanical issues at the Jubilee field and a delay in completing a well at the TEN offshore field, which led Tullow to cut its estimates for 2019 oil output last month.
Tullow is expected to produce 87,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) this year, while targets lower production in 2020 of between 70,000 and 80,000 (bopd), as it undertook a review of its production performance issues.

   Tesco   (LON:TSCO) confirmed that it has begun a strategic review of its businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, with an eye to potentially selling them.
The two-sentence release follows a report in the Sunday Times at the weekend that said Tesco’s remaining Asian businesses could fetch up to $9 billion, or nearly one-third of Tesco’s current market value.

  Prosus   (AS:PRX), the Internet holding company spun off by   Naspers Ltd   (JO:NPNJn) earlier in the year, has raised its cash offer for   Just Eat   (LON:JE) by 4.2% to 740 pence per share from 710p.

That’s a premium of 25.6% to the undisturbed share price on Oct. 21.
Prosus has had to respond because the value of Takeaway.com's (AS:TKWY) rival, all-share bid has risen dramatically in recent days. It’s worth an implicit 723.7p per share as of Friday's closing price.
Prosus also cut the minimum acceptances needed to make the deal unconditional to a simple majority.

Prosus argues that its cash offer “is the only one that delivers certainty in the face of undeniable industry change,"" and has claimed repeatedly that Takeaway’s shares will eventually be hit by future investment needs. 


Independent oil and gas company   Tullow Oil   (LON:TLW) said chief executive Paul McDade and exploration director Angus McCoss have both resigned with immediate effect, after some damaging failures with the drill bit in recent months and amid ongoing problems with its TEN and Jubilee fields in Ghana. 
The problems led Tullow to scrap its dividend and cut its forecast for free cash flow next year to $150 million pounds.
That's because the group also cut its guidance for production from TEN and Jubilee to between 70,000-80,000 barrels a day next year, and to 70,000 b/d thereafter.
Tullow said it will carry out a “thorough reassessment” of its cost base and future investment plans. It plans to spend $350 million in capital expenditure next year.
 

Loan guarantor   Amigo   Holdings (LON:AMGO) said both chairman Stephen Wilcke and chief executive Hamish Paton will leave the company, in response to the decision of controlling shareholder James Benamor’s decision to appoint two non-executive directors.
Wilcke will step down immediately, while Paton is bound by a 12-month contractual notice period.
The news comes after Wilcke and chief analytics assets Nanesh Patel both sold large blocks of stock last week.
Amigo announced recently that Abu Dhabi wealth fund Mubadala had raised its stake in the company to 4% from 3%, prompting speculation that a bid may be on the way.

The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) approved applications by IOOF and one of its units to hold controlling stakes in OnePath and Oasis Fund Management.
ANZ had cut the asking price for OnePath by 13% to A$825 million ($559.85 million) in October, citing changing market conditions as the financial sector faces intense regulatory scrutiny for past misdeeds.
IOOF was among the worst affected by a Royal Commission inquiry into the financial sector last year.
""APRA's decision recognizes IOOF's progress in strengthening governance structures and management of conflicts within its existing RSE (registrable superannuation entity) licensees,"" the regulator said in a statement.
IOOF won a high-profile case in September against the banking watchdog, after a court ruled it had not proved its case alleging that the wealth manager had breached pension laws.
""APRA will maintain close supervisory attention on IOOF to encourage a culture of ongoing improvement in its governance and business operations, consistent with APRA’s industry-wide focus on improving outcomes for superannuation members,"" the statement added."

The article pointed out that Aramco promised to pay at least $75 billion of ordinary dividends in 2020, and that dividend will not fall until after 2024. That sustainability will provide support to the company’s stocks, Bloomberg said.

Retail investors and equity long/short hedge funds are expected to drive demand for equities in 2020, JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said. They foresee improvement in equity demand versus supply of about $410 billion, when calculated by adding up the projected demand-flow changes and subtracting the supply change compared with 2019.
That’s around half the improvement this year relative to 2018, which is estimated at $850 billion -- the best since 2010 -- according to JPMorgan’s estimates.
Institutional investors, such as balanced mutual funds and commodity trading advisors, will limit the 2020 improvement, after they already boosted equities exposure in wake of the late 2018 stock slide, the strategists wrote.

Britain’s biggest supermarket chain,  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) Plc, is considering the sale of its operations in Thailand and Malaysia as it refocuses on its domestic business amid mounting challenges in the core U.K. market.
The company is carrying out a strategic review of the businesses after receiving what it called inbound interest, according to a statement on Sunday. The deal could value the operations at as much as $9 billion, Dow Jones reported earlier, citing people familiar with the plan. Tesco spokesman Simon Rew declined to comment on the valuation.
“The evaluation of strategic options is at an early stage, no decisions concerning the future of Tesco Thailand or Malaysia have been taken,” the statement said, adding that the process could end without a transaction being concluded.
While a sale would mean losing the fastest-growing part of its operations, Tesco would get an infusion of cash to continue the restructuring of its core U.K. operations that has seen thousands of job cuts and a shift to new formats like checkout-free stores. It would also allow the British retailer to exit from a competitive Asian region that’s already stymied the likes of European peers like  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA.
Tesco Thailand is currently the biggest hypermarket chain in the country with 1,967 stores, while the Malaysian business has 74 stores. The Thai business alone could be valued at nearly $7 billion because it includes real estate assets, Dow Jones reported. In the first half of fiscal-year 2020, the retailer’s entire Asia business produced 2.6 billion pounds ($3.4 billion) of revenue, accounting for about 8% of total sales.
While still dominant in Thailand, Tesco is grappling with challenges like chronically weak consumption trends, an increasingly stringent regulatory environment, and “formidable, well-connected competition,” said Maria Lapiz, Bangkok-based head of research at Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Thailand) Pcl.
“There is no longer term growth here, and Tesco may want to rationalize its business and raise funding in the process as well,” she said.
Under outgoing Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis, Tesco streamlined its domestic operations with mass job cuts, and pulled back from some international markets. Ken Murphy, who will replace Lewis, will have to wrestle with a growing U.K. retail crisis exacerbated by Brexit, the shift to online shopping and competition from discounters Lidl and Aldi.
Tesco is likely to see acquisition interest from regional conglomerates who’ve been successful in combining local operation know-how with the cache of international brands. In Malaysia, Japanese retail giant Aeon Co. acquired Carrefour’s operations in 2012 for $276 million.
Thai conglomerates like Central Group and the Singha Corp. are potential buyers who’ll be drawn to Tesco’s large retail network in the country, said Lapiz."

Exports in China declined for the fourth consecutive month, customs data showed. Overseas shipments dropped 1.1% year-on-year in November, compared with the expected 1.0% expansion. Imports rose 0.3% during the month, exceeding projections for a 1.8% decline.
The data came as Beijing and Washington aim to reach a “phase one” trade deal that has so far remained elusive ahead of a Dec. 15 deadline, when additional tariffs will be imposed on Chinese goods.
In an interview with Bloomberg, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said U.S. President Trump “likes what he sees so far in the trade deal with China.” 
Both sides are “still close” to agreeing on a phase-one trade deal, he added. 
Chinese equities traded slightly lower following the release of the data but recovered soon after. The Shanghai Composite inched up 0.1% by 10:30 PM (02:30 GMT), while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.3%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL),  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and other ""Big Tech"" companies could be forced to share data on financial services customers with banks and financial technology firms to prevent unfair competition.
As Facebook's plan for its Libra ""stablecoin"" faces scrutiny, a global body of regulators from the world's main financial centers said that Big Tech's growing tentacles raised questions for financial stability, competition and data privacy.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) called in a report released on Sunday for ""vigilant monitoring"" of Big Tech's shift into financial services, which it said could crimp the ability of banks to generate capital through retained profits.
While still only ""nascent"" in most countries, Big Tech in countries like China has brought financial services within reach of underserved communities, the FSB, which is chaired by Federal Reserve Governor Randal Quarles, said in the report.
The FSB said players including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tencent, have massive databases, while some offer asset management, payments and lending.
Many Big Tech firms like Amazon, Facebook, eBay, Alipay and Google have acquired payments-related licenses in European Union countries including Luxembourg, Ireland and Lithuania, although most have not yet built up any big volumes.
Banks in Europe and elsewhere are already required to share customer data with third party ""fintech"" companies that want to offer rival payments services, and this may need to be the case with Big Tech too, the FSB said.
""Big Tech firms' ability to leverage customer data raises the question of whether – and the degree to which – authorities could consider the potential to promote the mobility of data between the various actors that are involved in the provision of financial services,"" the FSB said.
""Doing so may help encourage competition and help ensure a level playing field amongst market participants.""

Regulators may also need to replicate their approach to insurers and asset managers by focusing on ""activities that have implications for financial stability"" rather than a focus solely on the size of the firm, the FSB said.

(Reuters) - Business payments processing firm AvidXchange Inc, whose investors include Mastercard Inc (N:MA) and Peter Thiel, the co-founder of  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL), has launched a new private fundraising round that could value it at around $2 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
AvidXchange and some of its peers, including Stripe Inc, have benefited from strong corporate demand for the automation of payments and invoices, which can save businesses money. Stripe reached a $35 billion valuation in a fundraising round in September.
AvidXchange's latest fundraising could bring in at least $300 million from investors, according to two of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is confidential.
AvidXchange is being advised on the fundraising by investment bank Financial Technology Partners LP, the sources added.
A spokesman for AvidXchange declined to comment.
Charlotte, North Carolina-based AvidXchange provides software that automates payments, invoicing and accounting for small and mid-sized businesses. Founded in 2000, it processed more than $120 billion of invoices and payments in 2018, and has 1,300 employees spread across offices in seven U.S. states, according to its website.
AvidXchange previously raised $300 million in 2017 at a $1.4 billion valuation.
The business payments sector is expected to grow by around 5.6% in revenue each year until 2028, according to a September report from Boston Consulting Group.

LONDON (Reuters) - Turnover on some of the world's biggest currency-trading venues has dropped as falling market volatility prompts some global banks to route more volumes onto their internal platforms, the Bank for International Settlements said in a quarterly report.
Electronic trading between banks on the world's biggest platforms -- owned by Refinitiv, partly owned by Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI) and EBS, part of the CME Group, (O:CME) among others -- has fallen by 7% to $368 billion per day in 2019 from a similar survey three years ago.
This decline in trading has been driven by the growing trend of ""internationalization"", where dealers temporarily warehouse risk arising from client trades on their books until it is offset against opposing client flow, reducing the need to use the broader market platforms.
The BIS, known as the central bankers’ bank, noted these electronic inter-dealer brokerage systems, which are central to FX trading, now constitute only for a small portion of the turnover in the market even though they remain essential in price discovery.
BIS data showed banks reporting in the United Kingdom and the United States registered some of the largest declines in electronic trading on anonymous inter-dealer venues and also posted some of the highest internalization ratios for cash trading.
London and New York hold the first and second spots in market share in global FX trading.
This trend has also been helped by a drop in currency market volatility to record lows. For example, trading ranges in the euro/dollar (EUR=) last week, the world's most actively traded currency pair, was the narrowest in two decades.
The ability of the top banks to internalize client flows has also been helped by their ability to attract trading flows from customers via direct price streams and a pickup in automated trading. For example, Algorithmic trading on EBS, a major platform, has topped 75% in 2019 compared with nearly zero in 2004.
This trend of banks keeping a greater share of their trading flow on their internal systems has fueled concentration of market share among a few very large banks, the BIS said.
""The falling share of inter-dealer trading has gone hand-in-hand with a handful of banks coming to dominate FX volumes,"" the BIS said.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2019 12:11PM ET</span>",U.S. banks' reluctance to lend cash may have caused repo shock: BIS,"By Olga Cotaga
LONDON (Reuters) - The unwillingness of the top four U.S. banks to lend cash combined with a burst of demand from hedge funds for secured funding could explain a recent spike in U.S. money market rates, the Bank for International Settlements said.
Cash available to banks for short-term funding all but dried up in late September, and interest rates deep in the plumbing of U.S. financial markets climbed into double digits.
That forced the Fed to make an emergency injection of billions of dollars for the first time since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.
While the exact cause of the squeeze is unclear - with explanations ranging from large withdrawals for quarterly tax payments to a big settlement of a trade in U.S. Treasuries - BIS analysts said the growing reliance on the biggest U.S. banks to keep the repo market functioning may have been a big factor.
The big four banks, which BIS did not name in its report, have become net providers of funds to repo markets as they account for more than half of all Treasuries held by banks in the United States at the Federal Reserve.
The repo market underpins much of the U.S. financial system, helping ensure banks have liquidity to meet their daily operational needs.
In a repo trade, Wall Street firms and banks offer U.S. Treasuries and other high-quality securities as collateral to raise cash, often just overnight, to finance their trading and lending. The next day, borrowers repay the loans plus what is typically a nominal rate of interest and get their bonds back. In other words they repurchase, or repo, the bonds.
The system typically hums along with the interest rate charged on repo deals hovering close to the Fed's benchmark overnight rate, which it cut on Wednesday to 1.75%-2.00% from 2.00%-2.25%.
But in late September, interest rates shot up to as high as 10% for some overnight loans, more than four times the Fed's policy rate, raising concerns about the fragility of U.S. dollar funding markets.
(Graphic: U.S. banks - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9650/9562/US%20BANKS.png)
ATROPHY
After the U.S. Federal Reserve began to run down its $4 trillion plus balance sheet from October 2017, banks' cash reserves at the Fed also contracted, while their holdings of U.S. Treasuries grew rapidly, the BIS said.
That reduction in cash holdings at the Fed sped up after the U.S. debt ceiling was suspended in early August.
The Treasury drained more than $120 billion of reserves from Aug. 14 to Sept. 17, reducing the cash buffers of the big four banks and hence their willingness to lend in the repo market, the BIS found.
The repo rate rose to an intraday high of about 700 basis points, with some trades reportedly occurring at up to 10%.
""The dislocations suggest that central banks’ post-crisis unconventional operations have left a profound imprint on market functioning,"" said Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic department at BIS.
""Banks get used to a protracted period of abundant excess reserves, withdrawing them may result in unpredictable and sudden market adjustments. It is as if a muscle had atrophied,"" he said.
That rush for short-dated secured funding was exacerbated by hedge funds who had ramped up their Treasury repos to fund arbitrage trades between cash bonds and derivatives.
The BIS also noted that the spike in the repo rate spilled over into the currency derivatives market, on which banks rely increasingly for short-term funding.
In the past three years, FX swap volumes have grown to make up as much as 49% of the overall foreign exchange market due to the growing participation of lower-tier banks which depend on swaps for funding as they lack direct access to U.S. dollar markets.
""Repo markets, alongside the.. .FX swap market for U.S. dollar funding, may again find themselves in the eye of the storm should financial stress arise at some point,"" Borio said.
""The surge in FX short-dated swap trading. ..underlines this risk."""

Celebrating its 100th anniversary, Tesco is five years into a UK-focused recovery plan launched by Chief Executive Dave Lewis after an accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading. 
In October Lewis declared Tesco's turnaround complete and said he would step down next summer.
""Tesco confirms that, following inbound interest, it has commenced a review of the strategic options for its businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, including an evaluation of a possible sale of these businesses,"" it said in a statement on Sunday.
The company said the review was at an early stage and gave no details of the approaches received.
""No decisions concerning the future of Tesco Thailand or Malaysia have been taken and there can be no assurance that any transaction will be concluded,"" it added.
Tesco trades from 1,967 stores in Thailand and 74 in Malaysia. In the six months to Aug. 24 the businesses together generated sales of 2.6 billion pounds ($3.3 billion), up 1% at constant exchange rates, and operating profit of 171 million pounds, up 42.3%.
At a capital markets day in June, Tesco had said it was well placed to grow in Asia, particularly in Thailand, citing an opportunity for 750 new convenience stores over the ""medium term"".
But under Lewis the focus of investment has been the UK, spending nearly 4 billion pounds on the acquisition of wholesaler Booker last year. 
In 2015 Tesco sold its South Korean arm to a group led by private equity firm MBK Partners for $6.1 billion. A year later it sold its Kipa business in Turkey to Migros, the country's largest supermarket chain.
Under its previous management Tesco made costly exits from Japan, the United States and China.
If Tesco does quit Thailand and Malaysia, its only overseas operations, apart from Ireland, will be its loss-making central European division, consisting of stores in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.
Lewis will be succeeded by Ken Murphy, a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA), at a date yet to be confirmed.

Shares in Tesco closed at 232.2 pence on Friday, valuing the business at 22.8 billion pounds.

The airline, part-owned by cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, said on Wednesday it had a cash injection plan enabling it to pay outstanding salaries to staff the next day. 
Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) said in a statement on Saturday the cash injection plans were satisfactory, adding that it would continue to closely monitor the firm's operations.

(Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services said on Friday it recommends shareholders vote against a plan by the chairman of Hudson's Bay Co to take the Saks Fifth Avenue owner private after the bid was topped by an offer from Catalyst Capital Group Inc. 
In October, Hudson's Bay agreed to a C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion) offer worth C$10.30 per share from shareholders led by Chairman Richard Baker.
The group, which collectively owns 57% of Hudson's Bay, includes private equity firm Rhone Capital LLC and office-space sharing start-up WeWork's property arm. 
Private equity firm Catalyst Capital Group Inc, which owns 17.5% of Hudson's Bay and was unhappy with the bid by the Baker-led consortium, offered C$11 per share in November.
Hudson's Bay shares closed at C$9.13 on Friday, in a sign that investors do not expect either bid to succeed. 
ISS, a shareholder advisory firm, said in a note there was ""no legitimate rationale from a governance perspective for recommending shareholders accept a lower offer.""
Catalyst's Managing Partner Gabriel de Alba welcomed ISS's decision. He said Catalyst has been working to protect the interests of the minority shareholders, including offering all shareholders a superior proposal to the Baker group.
""We will continue to push the HBC independent directors to finally step up and do their duty to protect shareholders,"" de Alba said in a statement on Saturday. [nPn8pJPXQa] 
""We are concerned about existing questions that remain unanswered and what additional actions and agreements remain undisclosed,"" de Alba added.
David Leith, chairman of Hudson's Bay's special board committee that negotiated the sale to Baker's group, said this week that the Catalyst offer was not an option available to Hudson's Bay shareholders. 
They could either accept the Baker-led offer or Hudson's Bay would continue as a public company, he said. [nL8N28E6CJ}
Catalyst has urged Hudson's Bay shareholders to shoot down the deal with Baker in a vote scheduled for Dec. 17. Baker's consortium will be excluded from the vote on the deal.
Hudson's Bay did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Baker's take-private offer comes seven years after he took Hudson's Bay public, and values the company at just a third of its 2015 worth, reflecting the challenges brick-and-mortar retailers face as they compete with online shopping.

By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - Elon Musk's daring has left its mark on electric cars and rockets, and now experts say the entrepreneur may have reshaped U.S. defamation law with his willingness to defend at a high-stakes trial a lawsuit over an off-the-cuff tweet.
The victory by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's outspoken chief executive over a Twitter message describing a British cave explorer as ""pedo guy"" has raised the bar for what amounts to libel online, according to some legal experts.
Musk defended his comments as trivial taunts made on a social media platform that he argued everyone views as a world of unfiltered opinion, which is protected as free speech, rather than statements of fact.
""I think this verdict reflects that there is a feeling that internet tweets and chats are more like casual conversation whether you call it opinion or rhetoric or hyperbole and should not be punished in a lawsuit,"" said Chip Babcock, a lawyer who defends against defamation lawsuits.
Several other attorneys who specialize in defamation cases privately expressed surprise at the outcome of what they viewed as a strong case for the cave explorer, Vernon Unsworth. They attributed it to Musk's fame and the perceived youthfulness of the jury.
But they also agreed it would shift the legal landscape, undercutting the cases that would have seemed viable before the trial while defendants would use it to try to reduce possible settlement values.
Musk's court papers cast his comments as part of the rough-and-tumble world of Twitter, which rewards and encourages emotional outbursts and sucks in readers worldwide but that no one takes seriously.
Mark Sableman, a lawyer who defends defamation cases, said the freewheeling nature of social media has inevitably changed the understanding of language and what amounts to defamatory factual statements, versus opinion.
""I think defendants in modern defamation cases are likely to point to the vitriolic no-holds-barred nature of modern social media, cable TV, and political discourse, in contending that many words and accusations formerly considered defamatory are now understood only as mere opinions, not factual assertions,"" he said.
In general, to prove libel, the written form of defamation, someone must show the existence of a false statement, which defendants often try to present as opinion. The plaintiff also must show it was published to a third party, it was negligent and it caused harm. 
""While there is more leeway and more hyperbole online and in social media in general, courts never really accepted that argument that social media is a libel free-zone,"" said Lyrissa Lidsky, a professor who specializes in defamation at the University of Missouri School of Law.
Several attorneys said Unsworth appeared to have a strong case, and noted that Musk failed to convince the judge to dismiss it at an early stage. But they cautioned that anything can happen in a courtroom where factors such as the credibility of witnesses and likeability of parties can become important factors.
""Based on the court's pre-trial rulings on motions, Mr. Unsworth's case going in had the potential to underpin a substantial verdict in his favor,"" said John Walsh, who represents people bringing defamation cases.
Unsworth helped rescue a boys soccer team from a flooded cave in Thailand and during a TV interview criticized Musk's ""PR stunt"" of showing up at site with a mini-submersible, which was never used. Musk responded with several tweets to his almost 30 million followers and a damaging email to a news outlet, and the lawsuit followed.
In recent years, judges have been wrestling with social media comments and whether to consider them factual statements or protected opinions.
U.S. President Donald Trump, singer and actress Courtney Love and actor James Woods have all been embroiled in multiple libel lawsuits over tweets, with mixed results. 
Trump has had success casting Twitter as a place where combatants trade demeaning messages that users understand are not defamatory statements of fact.
Judge James Otero in Los Angeles dismissed a case against the president for a tweet blasting as a ""total con job"" a claim by adult film actress Stormy Daniels that she was threatened for speaking about an alleged affair with Trump. Otero described the message as ""rhetorical hyperbole,"" fired off with an incredulous tone that no reasonable person would take as factual statement about Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.
Unsworth's attorney, Lin Wood, warned social media is ""tearing at the fabric of society"" and the Musk verdict would worsen that trend.

""It is now said by this jury that insults are completely open season,"" he said. ""Everyone should be concerned about their reputations.""

303,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 10:20PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Tariff deadline keeps focus on trade as 2019 draws to close,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The stock market looks set to end 2019 the way it began the year -- highly sensitive to headlines from President Donald Trump's global trade war.
Stocks pulled back from record highs to start December, undermined by comments from Trump and others in his administration suggesting any deal to resolve the trade dispute between the United States and China would not come soon. But the market rebounded at the end of the week on Friday's strong U.S. jobs and a change in tone from Trump.
Wall Street could see more volatility ahead of Dec. 15, when the next tranche of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports is set to take effect.
At the start of the week, investors said equity prices were factoring in that those tariffs would be delayed if not canceled as Beijing and Washington work on a ""phase one"" trade deal. But subsequent tough talk from Trump officials has shaken those expectations somewhat.
""Until we get some finality on this, the day-to-day is going to move on headlines that suggest progress or lack thereof,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
While the dispute between the world's two largest economies commands the spotlight, other trade issues also have drawn investor attention. They include a recent delay in ratification of the North American Trade pact, potential U.S. tariffs on imported autos and Trump's issuing surprise levies on steel imports from Brazil and Argentina.
Optimism over a U.S.-China truce has helped push the major Wall Street indexes to all-times highs recently, with the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) logging a gain of more than 20% so far in 2019. But as the latest swings show, lack of a resolution to a trade dispute that has lasted nearly two years continues to weigh on the market.
“The problem is the uncertainty that the trade war process has on business decisions,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. ""Without some sort of short-term truce, company spending gets frozen and that’s where it affects the economy and the market.""
(GRAPHIC: U.S.-China trade war timeline - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/0100B33L2BV/china-trade-timeline.png )
The tariffs on $156 billion in Chinese imports that could take effect Dec. 15 are largely on consumer goods, including cellphones, laptop and desktop computers, toys and clothing.
UBS economists estimate those tariffs would drag on U.S. gross domestic product by either 0.1% or 0.2% in each of the four quarters next year. UBS projects overall GDP growth to average 1.1% in 2020, with tariffs generally weighing heavily in the first half of the year.
Aside from the fallout from the tariffs themselves, ""the next read from them going into effect is that trade discussions are not going well,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in South Carolina.
Political tensions over U.S. support for protesters in Hong Kong and over Beijing's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority have also raised concerns about the prospects for an initial trade deal.
“Without a phase one plan on getting something signed early in the new year, I think the market is susceptible for a pullback,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC.
The focus will remain on trade into next week, even as the Federal Reserve holds its last meeting of 2019, with the U.S. central bank expected to keep interest rates steady after three cuts earlier in the year.
""The Fed chairman pretty much outlined that the bar is very high to raise rates,"" SunTrust's Lerner said.
However, he added, if some of the tariffs result in a sharp slowdown, ""the Fed would have to act eventually"" by cutting rates.
Investors will also be looking for signs of strength in the holiday shopping season, given that consumer spending is seen as a key pillar holding up overall economic growth.
There is a strong incentive to push off the tariffs ""as long as people are at the negotiating table,"" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at Abbot Downing in Minneapolis.
""President Trump definitely doesn’t want a downbeat consumer going into the election cycle,” she said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it seeks to impose a $3.9 million fine on Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, alleging it failed to prevent the installation of defective parts on about 130 737 NG airplanes.
The FAA alleged that Boeing ""failed to adequately oversee its suppliers to ensure they complied with the company’s quality assurance system ... Boeing knowingly submitted aircraft for final FAA airworthiness certification after determining that the parts could not be used due to a failed strength test.""
In a statement on Friday, Boeing did not admit liability but said they were aware of the FAA's concerns.
""We are working closely with our customers to take the appropriate corrective actions,"" spokesman Charles Bickers said. 
The company has 30 days to respond either by paying the fine or challenging it; Boeing said it would review the penalty.
The FAA disclosed in June that 300 NG and 737 MAX airplanes could contain improperly manufactured parts and said it would require these parts to be quickly replaced. The fine announced on Friday only relates to NG airplane components, the FAA said, but it is continuing to review the issue as it relates to the MAX.
The parts at issue are tracks on the leading edge of the wings used to guide the movement of slats that provide additional lift during takeoff and landing, the FAA said. The issue could result in a slat striking an airplane, potentially resulting in injury to passengers or preventing a safe landing.
The FAA said Boeing's oversight failure ""resulted in the installation of slat tracks that were weakened by a condition known as hydrogen embrittlement that occurred during cadmium-titanium plating.""
Boeing reiterated on Friday it had not been informed of any in-service issues related to the batch of slat tracks in question. It added that ""all affected 737 NGs have been inspected and all slat track installations determined to be required have been completed on the NGs.""
The NG is the third-generation 737 that the company began building in 1997.

Boeing's safety record has come under criticism from some in Congress, as has the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX, which has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. Boeing said it will ensure ""all inspections and any necessary part replacements are performed on all 737 MAXs before they return to service.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund White Elm Capital is returning money to outside clients at the end of the year, ending a 12-year run of picking stocks for pensions, endowments and wealthy families, its founder, Matthew Iorio, wrote in a letter on Friday.
Iorio, whose fund is having one of its best years ever with a nearly 30% gain after fees, said now was the right time to end. He called the decision ""very difficult"" but said he was ""happy to be returning capital when we are performing at the top of our game.""
Reuters saw a copy of the letter. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment beyond the letter.
White Elm is the latest in a growing number of hedge funds to shut down as raising and retaining capital and running a hedge fund is becoming ever more difficult.
Last month Louis Bacon, one of the industry's best known managers, said he would stop investing outside money in his Moore Capital Management after 30 years in the business.
White Elm's outside investors will get most of their money back by the end of January, 2020, the letter said, adding that all current clients have earned money with White Elm.
The firm, which traces its roots to Tiger Management, one of the industry's most successful funds ever, was launched in 2007, managed more than $1 billion in assets at its peak and has seen returns go up and down. At the end of 2018, the firm oversaw $328 million in assets, according to a regulatory filing.
Returns have been strong recently with gains averaging 15% a year as bets on financial and business services companies and technology firms paid off.
White Elm's most recent regulatory filing shows that the firm owned stakes in TransDigm Group (N:TDG), Visa (N:V), Mastercard (N:MA) and Autodesk (O:ADSK) at the end of September.
This year, the fund has gained 28.73% through the end of November beating the average hedge fund's 8.6% return, according to Hedge Fund Research data.
Iorio wrote that he wanted to deliver long-term returns that beat the broader market and ""we have achieved what we set out to do.""
Before opening his own firm, Iorio, 49, worked at Lone Pine Capital, a hedge fund founded by Stephen Mandel who got his start at Julian Robertson's Tiger Management. White Elm is often called a Tiger Grand Cub."

The verdict was delivered on the fourth day of the trial a short time after the case was handed to the jury of five women and three men. The plaintiff, Vernon Unsworth, was seeking $190 million damages against Musk, who during the trial estimated his net worth at $20 billion."
307,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:37PM ET</span>",Tesla boss Elon Musk wins defamation trial sparked by 'pedo guy' tweet,"By Nichola Groom and Rachel Parsons
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) boss Elon Musk gained a stunning legal victory on Friday as a federal court jury swiftly rejected the $190 million defamation claim brought by a British cave explorer who Musk had branded a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter.
The unanimous verdict by a jury of five women and three men was returned after about 45 minutes of deliberation on the fourth day of Musk's trial, which was closely watched by legal experts because it is believed to be the first major defamation lawsuit by a private individual to go to trial over tweets. 
Musk, 48, who had testified during the first two days of the trial in his own defense and returned to court on Friday to hear closing arguments from the two sides, exited the courtroom after the verdict and said: ""My faith in humanity is restored."" 
Outside the courthouse, cave explorer Vernon Unsworth told a throng of reporters he was resigned to his defeat. ""I accept the jury's verdict, take it on the chin and get on with my life.""
The case stems from a public quarrel between Musk and Unsworth, who gained fame for his leading role in coordinating the successful rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand in July 2018.
Unsworth, 64 had chided Musk in a CNN interview for delivering a mini-submarine, which was never used, to the site of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system. Unsworth called Musk's intervention a ""P.R."" stunt and said the high-tech entrepreneur should ""stick his submarine where it hurts.""
Musk responded two days later on Twitter with three posts that became the basis of the defamation case. The first questioned Unsworth's role in the rescue, while the second said, ""Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it,"" using a slang term of pedophile. 
The third tweet, in reply to a follower who asked Musk about the second tweet, said, ""Bet ya a signed dollar it's true.""
In closing arguments on Friday, Unsworth's lead attorney, L. Lin Wood, summed up his case by castigating Musk as a ""billionaire bully"" who had ""dropped a nuclear bomb"" on Unsworth in his Twitter blast.
Wood said Musk's ""pedo guy"" remark was a slur that would overshadow Unsworth's relationships and job prospects for years to come and urged jurors to teach the Tesla chief executive and SpaceX founder a lesson by awarding Unsworth $190 million, including $150 million in punitive damages.
Two days earlier, under questioning on the witness stand, Musk had estimated his net worth at $20 billion.
But the jury was apparently swayed by the arguments put forth by Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, who said the tweets in question arose from an argument between two men and amounted to an off-hand insult that no one could be expected to take seriously.
""In arguments you insult people,"" he said. ""There is no bomb. No bomb went off.""

Spiro also said Unsworth failed to demonstrate that he suffered any harm from Musk's comments, which the South African-born businessman apologized for in court earlier in the week.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:19PM ET</span>","Your Money: On #GivingTuesday, companies turbocharge holiday giving efforts","By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four years ago, PayPal set out to break the Guinness World Record for the most money raised online for charity in 24 hours. 
Donors gave more than $45.8 million to charities via the payment platform during #GivingTuesday, the annual charitable campaign on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. This year the company may best its 2018 total for raising $98 million on its platform. And PayPal (O:PYPL) is just one of many platforms that processes charitable donations. 
While much is made of big corporations and multi-billionaires giving large sums of money in highly publicized gifts, there is also great power to the collective giving of millions of individuals around the globe. That power can often be multiplied when all entities work together to spur each other on. 
The philanthropic movement that coalesced around #GivingTuesday started in 2012, spurring donations so far of more than $1 billion in the United States alone. What started within the 92nd Street Y in New York is now an independent organization that coordinates the efforts of over 200 communities in the United States and 61 countries to increase generosity. 
Asha Curran co-founded the original movement and is now CEO of the new organization called GivingTuesday. Curran spoke with Reuters about how corporations, communities and individuals come together to fuel charitable giving. 
Q: Much of the corporate effort for #GivingTuesday centers on offering matching gifts. How do you tabulate that if those funds come in after the official day is over? 
A: Matching is one of the best possible tactics, because it’s such an easy lift. There is not months of planning. And matches are almost always met. 
It is very hard to measure what happens in a 24-hour period, so we have deliberately not counted matching gifts. Until this year - actually, we’re going to do that for the first time.
We know a bunch of them that were announced. There are a lot of smaller matches of the six-figure variety. 
Q: What other efforts do you see besides matching from companies? 
A: What I like to see is collaboration. I love to see competitors coming together to present a united front for common good. It can take all sorts of forms. 
It works just as well for a Main Street small business as a multi-national company. Some of the best stories we’ve seen have been like a local pizza parlor that donates half of the proceeds from every slice to a local animal shelter on #GivingTuesday. 
It doesn’t have to be huge. It’s often those small activations that show a community's solidarity. Anything that creates stronger bonds is something to be valued. 
Q: How do you advise companies to develop what works for them? 
A: We don't do much one-on-one coaching anymore, but we advise them to ask what ideally would you like to get out of this? Better employee retention? Bigger brand awareness? Bigger value awareness?
Start with what you want, then start thinking about activation. With some companies, it’s just employee-facing. It's a good opportunity to say to employees that we care what you believe.
Q: How does it work for companies when their focus is more on customers and audience? 
A: We have gone from a time when companies were just making a cursory impact to now where people are demanding that businesses they shop from be closely aligned with their values. 
There's public pressure, so the way corporations respond manifests in many ways. From a #GivingTuesday perspective, what we’d advise is to tap into the full spectrum of generosity. 
The more personalized, the better. What are the values that company holds dearly? What will feel genuine and authentic? 
Q: At the end of this year's #GivingTuesday, you will come up with a number of what was donated that day. What about all the giving that does not show up on your ticker? 
A: Most of what #GivingTuesday accomplishes is immeasurable. That doesn’t make it one bit less important. You take all the stories about the strengthening of community bonds - you can’t put that on a ticker. 

We honor the importance of data - we founded a data collaborative, after all - but we also we honor the importance of things that can’t be counted.

310,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:19PM ET</span>",Top U.S. stockpickers keep low profile,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The co-managers of the best stock mutual fund of this decade work out of a small office in Los Angeles, rarely talk with the financial media and have never appeared as guests on CNBC looking to raise their profile. 
Instead, portfolio managers Todd Beiley, 47, and Jon Christensen, 55, lead a team of five analysts who evaluate all companies in the Russell 2000 small cap index each year for signs of a competitive advantage. 
The time-consuming process has helped the $5.2 billion Virtus KAR Small-Cap Growth fund outperform every other actively managed mutual fund during the 10 years that closely corresponded with longest bull market in history, according to Morningstar data. 
With less than a month left in the decade, which opened nine months after the equity market bottomed during the financial crisis, the fund has posted a total return of 441% through November, including reinvested dividends. 
That performance is 20 percentage points greater than any other actively managed U.S. equity mutual fund, the Morningstar data showed. The Russell 2000 gained approximately 190%, while the S&P 500 returned 281% during this decade. 
""We're not necessarily looking for the fastest-growing companies or those positioned in the right sectors for a macro trend, but businesses that can maintain a competitive position for a long period of time,"" Beiley said. He noted that many of the companies the fund holds have few if any analyst coverage on Wall Street. 
Despite the fund's success, its greatest challenge now is staying relevant. Over the last decade, the proliferation of low-cost index-based investing and exchange-traded funds has made stockpickers a relic of a time before the 2008 financial crisis, when investors were willing to shell out high fees for active management.
Lower-cost passive management now accounts for 45 percent of all assets in U.S.-based stock funds, nearly double the 25 percent invested in passive funds a decade ago, according to the Investment Company Institute. Many active managers are struggling to draw new clients.
""Increasingly investors are looking at the fee a fund charges and making that a higher priority than the performance record,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at independent research firm CFRA. ""There are more and cheaper options than ever before."" 
Beiley and Christensen's fund began concentrating its portfolio several years ago in fewer companies to differentiate it from its benchmark index. That also increased its risk and potential rewards. 
Over half of its assets are invested in 10 stocks, a group that ranges from auto parts maker Fox Factory Holdings Corp to trucking company Old Dominion Freight Lines Inc to electronic signature service DocuSign Inc, which had its initial public offering in 2018.
The fund adds an average of two to three new stocks a year to its holdings of roughly 30 companies, and Beiley and Christensen are happy to invest in seemingly ""boring"" industries like trucking and used car sales. 
Yet their performance is anything but dull: shares of Paycomm Software Inc, an online payroll provider, are up 126 percent since the start of the year, while shares of auto-salvage auction company Copart Inc are up nearly 85 percent. 
""Our objective is to buy small and let the investment appreciate over time,"" Beiley said. The fund typically makes an initial purchase in a company when it has a market value between $1 billion and $4 billion. 
Beiley and Christensen did not know of their industry-topping performance until they were informed of it by Reuters, but said they have no plans to capitalize on it. The fund is closed to new investors and there are no plans to open a new one. 
Both managers work on other small and mid-cap core funds at Virtus, which also have returns in the top 10 percentiles of their peers, according to Morningstar. 
They will likely continue on the same path of looking for fundamental strengths at a time when the broad market is increasingly made up of passive investors, a trend they expect will have a greater impact on small-cap shares in the next decade. 
""We're well aware of the passive trend, and frankly I can't argue with it,"" Beiley said. ""If you're charging a high fee and not providing a higher service, then it's hard to justify.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The private banking business of  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) PLC is aggressively pursuing double-digit growth in client assets and revenue, riffing off a surge in Asian wealth, the unit's chief executive told Reuters.
Antonio Simoes also said the London-headquartered bank aims to increase its onshore presence in China, home to an eighth of all billionaires' wealth worldwide and where it is one of the few global banks to operate a private banking business.
""The strategy to achieve double-digit asset and revenue growth is working,"" said Simoes, who assumed his role in January. ""And as part of that, Asia is by far the region that is growing the most.""
With higher economic growth, rapidly rising wages and a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem producing rich clients at a pace faster than the West, Asia has emerged as the main battleground for global wealth managers.
Assets managed by HSBC's private banking unit rose 9.4% in the first nine months of 2019 to $338 billion, while revenue rose 4.6% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.4 billion. The unit is the smallest contributor to group revenue at 3%.
Asia accounts for 42% of HSBC's total private banking assets, making it the single largest market. The region also accounts for the biggest share of the bank's overall revenue.
But six months of often violent pro-democracy protests that have convulsed Hong Kong - one of Asia's two main wealth management hubs along with Singapore - have triggered concern about rich clients looking for alternative centres.
Simoes, however, said his business in the Chinese territory had not been impacted.
""Our third-quarter results showed very resilient performance for Hong Kong against the backdrop of what's happening,"" he said. ""From a private banking perspective, we continue to have targets for Hong Kong that are very ambitious.""
Simoes said the private banking business was sticking to its target announced last year of adding 700 people to its Asia unit by 2022 from a headcount of 1,100 at the end of 2017. Three hundred bankers have already been hired so far, he said.
HSBC's private banking growth plans come as interim CEO Noel Quinn reviews the lender's worldwide businesses as part of an audition for the full-time role under Chairman Mark Tucker.
Global wealth managers looking to grow in China - where HSBC's unit is present onshore in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou - continue to consider an offshore business as the preferred route due to regulatory restrictions on investment products and a lack of sizeable physical branch networks.
""Going forward, we want to be bigger in onshore China and we are looking at how to do that as regulations change,"" Simoes said.

""If you take a 10-year view, we will need to be bigger in onshore China.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Rivulet Capital, a large investor in Instructure Inc, on Thursday said it will resist the U.S. educational software company's plan to sell itself to private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $2 billion, calling the deal too cheap and too hurried.
Rivulet Capital, which owns 5.23% of Instructure, said in a regulatory filing it plans to vote against the transaction.
We ""strongly oppose the proposed going-private transaction"" where Thoma Bravo would pay $47.60 a share for the company, the filing said, adding that it ""significantly undervalues the Company.
Moreover it was wrong to run a ""rushed, 3-week strategic alternatives process over the Thanksgiving holiday"" and have a proposed 35-day go shop period that would include more holidays, Christmas and New Year's, the hedge fund wrote in the filing.
Rivulet is the first large investment firm to speak out publicly on Instructure's plans after other investors had privately and publicly pushed the Salt Lake City-headquartered company to consider selling part or all of itself.
On October 31, Reuters reported that activist hedge fund Sachem Head Capital Management has built a stake in the company and was pushing for a full sale process. Instructure's stock price jumped as much as 6% on the news of Sachem Head's stake, ending the session at $46.73, a touch below Thoma Bravo's offer. 
Days later Praesidium Investment Management, which has owned the stock for some time, joined the public push for the company to consider a sale. The stock price climbed to $53 a share by late November but tumbled on news of what Thoma Bravo was planning to pay. On Thursday afternoon it was trading at $48.55 a share.
Now neither Sachem Head nor Praesidium are saying how they feel about the proposed deal. Rivulet declined to comment beyond what it said in the filing. Instructure and Thoma Bravo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
While Rivulet says the process to sell Instructure has been conducted hastily, the parties appear to have been speaking for a few months. According to the Agreement and Plan of Merger filed with regulators on December 4, Thoma Bravo signed a confidentiality agreement on June 18, 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators said on Tuesday that lenders must have robust compliance tools in place to ensure ""responsible use"" of non-traditional sources of financial data to help determine whether a potential customer is credit worthy.
In a joint statement, the country's five chief regulators acknowledged that using consumer information originating outside of traditional sources could expand the access and affordability of credit for certain borrowers.
At the same time, the agencies warned that banks and other lenders need to ensure they have tools and policies in place to make sure the new tactics do not violate consumer protection and fair lending laws.
""The use of alternative data and analytical methods...raises questions regarding how to effectively leverage new technological developments that are consistent with applicable consumer protection laws,"" the regulators said. ""To the extent firms are using or contemplating using alternative data, the agencies encourage responsible use of such data.""
Lenders and regulators are looking at how data beyond a basic credit score could be used to improve underwriting practices, for example by analyzing bank accounts, utility bills, level of education and employer information.
Looking at such data might provide a different picture of a consumer with little-to-no traditional credit history or raise flags about a borrower that would otherwise be missed, lenders say.
Without a history of using such outside information, however, past attempts at incorporating alternative data have been complicated by the risk of inadvertently discriminating against borrowers or other missteps.
The regulators said in their statement new data sources could allow lenders to extend credit more quickly and offer worthy borrowers better terms, and that some alternative data sources may be no riskier than traditional ones.
For example, some firms are using cash flow data to assess a borrower's ability to repay loans, they said. Such information typically comes from reliable sources like bank accounts, and consumers can easily grant permission to use it, they said.
The regulators also said alternative data could prove useful for ""second look"" programs that reassess borrowers who were originally denied credit under traditional methods.

By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart Inc for the first time on Wednesday revealed the breadth of customer information it collects as it came out in favor of consumers having ""reasonable controls"" with regard to collection, use and sharing of personal data. 
The world's largest retailer said shoppers should have an opportunity to ""reasonably access, correct or delete their data while limiting the sale of their data to third parties and its use in digital advertising,"" as it testified at a hearing by the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
The hearing, which was also attended by companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), was convened to examine various legislative proposals to protect consumer data privacy. 
More than a dozen privacy bills have been introduced in Congress and concerns have mounted over how information is being collected and used especially by big tech companies.
Walmart said in its testimony it supports a comprehensive federal privacy law and is ready to comply with strict new privacy rules California plans to instate on Jan. 1. 
Nuala O'Connor, senior vice president and chief counsel of digital citizenship at Walmart, said privacy legislation focused on a particular industry - referring to the U.S. tech sector - must be carefully crafted to avoid unintended effects on retail.
Walmart said it collects myriad different forms of customer data including personal information provided directly by consumers, personal information provided by third parties, purchase history, healthcare data, browsing information, device information and location data.
The company said it shares individually identifiable customer data with third parties for business activities including fulfilling customer orders and processing payments. Also, some of Walmart's recent acquisitions share customer information with other companies, it said.
Earlier this week, a draft consumer privacy bill from Republican U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the Commerce Committee, proposed nationwide rules for handling of personal information online and elsewhere that would override state laws. 
That followed a privacy bill introduced by the top Democrat on the committee, Maria Cantwell.
A U.S. online privacy bill is not likely to come before Congress this year, Reuters reported in September, as lawmakers disagree over several issues. 

Democrats like Cantwell are determined not to sign a privacy bill that would pre-empt state laws, while Republicans appear equally determined to avoid a patchwork of state measures. The two parties also disagree over whether individuals would have the right to sue for violation of privacy under the law.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:18PM ET</span>","Facebook sues ILikeAd, alleges ad fraud","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday sued a Hong Kong company that it said baited people into clicking on celebrities' photos and bogus advertising links, so it could install malware and run ads for counterfeit goods, diet pills and male enhancement supplements.
The social media company accused ILikeAd Media International Co software developer Chen Xiao Cong and marketer Huang Tao of using improper ""celeb bait"" and ""cloaking"" practices since at least 2016.
Facebook said this enabled the defendants to hijack users' ad accounts, known as ""account take over fraud,"" violating its terms of service and advertising policies.
None of the defendants could immediately be reached for comment. The complaint filed in the federal court in San Francisco seeks unspecified damages and a Facebook ban.
Facebook said this kind of lawsuit is rare, and that it has since April notified hundreds of thousands of users that their accounts may have been compromised.
The Menlo Park, California-based company said it has also issued more than $4 million in refunds to customers whose accounts were used by ILikeAd to run unauthorized ads.
""Cloaking"" involves disguising the content of a link by displaying one version of that content to Facebook and another version to users.
""Creating real world consequences for those who deceive users and engage in cloaking schemes is important in maintaining the integrity,"" Jessica Romero, Facebook's director of platform enforcement and litigation, said in a statement.
According to the complaint, ILikeAd promoted itself as a ""one-stop comprehensive solution to advertisers"" hoping to market their wares on Facebook.

The case is Facebook Inc v ILikeAd International Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-07971.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:14PM ET</span>",Trade war goes digital: countries eye tariffs on Internet economy,"By Emma Farge
GENEVA (Reuters) - A 20-year global moratorium on imposing tariffs on digital trade could end next week if India or South Africa makes good on threats, according to trade officials and documents, potentially forcing people to pay duties on software and movie downloads.
Since 1998, World Trade Organization (WTO) members have renewed a ban on import duties on so-called ""electronic
transmissions"", worth up to $255 billion a year by one estimate.
Some think this favors rich countries, given it received strong backing from Washington at the outset and most of the lost customs revenues are thought to be born by developing countries.
Pressure is now growing to lift the ban as more books and movies become digital, potentially reducing revenues further.
India and South Africa circulated an internal WTO document, reviewed by Reuters this week, saying that rising digitalization compelled ""a rethink of the role of the temporary moratorium"" last year, citing the potential of 3D printing to manufacture products. It will be decided on next week and renewal requires full consensus.
Asked about its position, South Africa's WTO Ambassador Xolelwa Mlumbi-Peter said in an emailed response this week that it was ""still consulting on this important decision."" 
India did not respond to a request for comment.
""At the moment there are a number of countries that feel confident they can stand aside from the global consensus,"" said the International Chamber of Commerce's (ICC) Secretary General John Denton. ""It could break the Internet.""
A proposal backed by 21 countries including China and Canada seeks to extend the ban for at least six months when it expires at year end. Deal-broker Switzerland said ""a large part of the WTO has signaled its support for the Moratorium"". 
Such duties could be difficult to apply and it is not clear how it would be determined where the digital product originate from and whether it is an import.
""How do you put a tariff on a byte? How would you capture millions of data flows from multiple sources flowing across countries’ borders every minute of every day,"" asked Denton.
However, the first possible answers are emerging. Indonesia created tariff codes for digital goods in 2018, fixing the level at 0 percent for now. 
LOST REVENUES?
Should the moratorium end, it does not mean that tariffs will immediately follow, and Mlumbi-Peter stressed that. But this is seen as more likely in a new culture of permissiveness
following the expected paralysis of the WTO's top ruling body after Dec. 10.
""If someone tries to experiment putting customs duties on even a limited set of products or services, then there is a risk of immediate retaliation absent of the dispute settlement
function,"" said the ICC's Andrew Wilson.
Estimates of the ban's effect vary. At the top of the scale, a recent U.N. report said potential annual tariff revenue losses could be up to $10.4 billion a year, with more than $10 billion lost by WTO developing countries.
""More and more production is going to be digitized in future so developing countries will lose tariff revenues,"" Rashmi Banga, the report's author, said. 

However, an OECD study questioned these assumptions, arguing that the revenue gains from lifting the ban would be relatively small and tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers among other costs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee urged Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc to take action after the company disclosed on Thursday it received over 3,000 reports of sexual assault related to its 1.3 billion rides in the United States last year.
Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, on Friday praised Uber for releasing the information, but said Uber and other companies must do more ""to establish formal policies, training and reporting structures.""
""As a country, we must ensure safety is a priority, and make it clear that sexual assault and harassment will not be tolerated anywhere, no matter where it occurs,"" he said.
DeFazio in November introduced legislation to help track and prevent incidents from occurring in different modes of transportation, including ridesharing companies. It was approved by the committee and now awaits action by the full U.S. House.
Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The sexual assault figure represents a 16% fall in the rate of incidents from the previous year in the five most serious categories of sexual assault reported, Uber said on Thursday in its first biennial U.S. Safety Report https://www.uber-assets.com/image/upload/v1575580686/Documents/Safety/UberUSSafetyReport_201718_FullReport.pdf.
The company also said reports of assaults on passengers overlooked risks for drivers, as riders accounted for roughly half of the accused.
Uber, which operates in 70 countries, said the report showed its commitment to transparency to improve accountability and safety industry-wide. It said it would use what it learned producing the report for its ""next steps"" in other places.
In the report, Uber said 99.9% of its 2.3 billion U.S. trips in 2017 and 2018 ended without safety incidents.
In October, Uber and rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) declined to appear in front of DeFazio's committee at a hearing related to the ride-hailing industry.
""Their failure to appear at this hearing is a telling sign that they would rather suffer a public lashing than answer questions on the record about their operations,"" DeFazio said at the October hearing, adding the companies ""don't make information about their process for deactivating dangerous drivers public. They don't share data on the prevalence of assaults on their platforms.""

Lyft on Thursday said it was committed to releasing its own safety report and sharing information on unsafe drivers. It did not state a release date for its report.

While a settlement could be announced as soon as next month, the terms could change before a deal is finalized, according to the report. 
The Justice Department and other federal agencies have weighed seeking penalties between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, which is less than what some analysts have signaled Goldman might have to pay, Bloomberg reported. 
Malaysia has charged Goldman and 17 current and former directors of its units for allegedly misleading investors over bond sales totaling $6.5 billion that the U.S. bank helped raise for sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).
Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Maeve DuVally said the bank continues to cooperate with the regulators' investigations, but declined to comment further. The Department of Justice also declined to comment.

For the year, the S&P 500 is up about 26%. The Dow has added 20%, and the Nasdaq has risen about 30%. There are 17 days of trading left jn the year.
Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by energy shares, up 2% in response to the rising oil prices as OPEC members agreed to cut output. 
The sector saw big gains for exploration and production companies such as Apache (NYSE:APA) and   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN), and services companies such as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). Seven of the top 10 S&P performers were in the energy industry.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended solidly higher on Friday as a strong jobs report and optimism about U.S.-China trade negotiations ahead of an upcoming deadline helped stoke investor risk appetite.
All three major U.S. stock indexes gained ground, hovering within 1% of record highs set last week. 
But as a tumultuous week of contradictory trade news and mixed economic data drew to a close, only the S&P 500 posted a weekly gain. The Dow and the Nasdaq ended the session down from last Friday's close.
The U.S. economy added 266,000 jobs in November, the largest increase in 10 months, according to the Labor Department, blowing past analyst estimates. The unemployment rate edged down to 3.5%.
""This type of report shows underlying economic strength, and it gives corporate management confidence in the strength of the economy,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Primarily because of (trade negotiations), there's been a lot of uncertainty with management."" 
Regarding trade, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said that while the Dec. 15 remains the date when the next round of tariffs on Chinese goods will take effect, ""the reality is constructive talks, almost daily talks; we are, in fact, close.""
""You have two very tough negotiators and a lot of tough issues to be agreed on,"" Ghriskey added. ""But, based on what we're hearing from serious sources, it certainly appears we will be seeing some kind of trade deal.""

Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but utilities (SPLRCU) closed in positive territory, with energy (SPNY), financials (SPSY) and trade-sensitive industrials (SPLRCI) enjoying the largest percentage gains.
Energy stocks were buoyed by a 1.1% rise in crude prices (CLc1) following an agreement between OPEC and its allies to extend output cuts through 2020.

The S&P 500 Index extended its advance into a third day after reports showed payrolls jumped 266,000 -- the most since January -- as wages topped estimates while consumer sentiment increased. Energy, financial and industrial shares led gains in the equity measure, which was poised for its biggest rally in five weeks. The dollar rose, and Treasury 10-year yields climbed above 1.8%. Oil surged.
Investors pushed up the value of risk assets on the assumption that the American economy isn’t close to signaling a recession -- a fear that’s been lurking amid a trade war. While negotiators are near phase one of a broader accord and “progress has been made,” they haven’t yet put anything in writing, said White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. Strong economic reports may reduce the urgency for a deal, given that escalating levies have failed to significantly dent growth. They also validate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s view that rates can stay on hold after three cuts.
“For the equity market, it provides some encouragement that the U.S. is certainly not heading for a hard landing,” said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “As we head into next year, the prospect for earnings still remains pretty healthy based on a still well-supported consumer backdrop.”

President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports if an accord isn’t reached by Dec. 15, which Kudlow said could still happen.

After a consortium of potential rescuers backtracked, the appointment of Giuseppe Leogrande allows Rome to unlock a further loan of 400 million euros ($441 million) needed to keep the loss-making carrier in business and potentially increase the chances of a future tie-up with German rival Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).
Sources had told Reuters last month that Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli would ask the current administrators - Daniele Discepolo, Enrico Laghi and Stefano Paleari - to quit to make room for a single administrator with more powers.
A consortium of potential investors - comprising Italian railways group Ferrovie dello Stato, infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) and U.S. carrier Delta (N:DAL) - decided not to present a binding offer for Alitalia last month after months of negotiations.
Lufthansa has repeatedly said it would be interested in investing in Alitalia once it went through a complete restructuring.
The Italian airline, which went through two previous rescues in 2008 and 2014, has a workforce of 11,600 people.

But some on Wall Street see potential headwinds on the horizon for the cosmetic retailer.
Late Thursday, Ulta Beauty reported earnings of $2.23 a share, topping estimates of $2.13 a share and up from $2.18 in the year-ago quarter. But revenue of $1.68 billion fell just short of $1.69 billion, although up 7.7% from a year ago.
Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) rose 13% and was the day's top performer in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices. The shares are up 14% this month and 9% on the year.
Sales of higher-priced celebrity-led beauty brands boosted margins and underpinned profit growth.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points to 37.1% compared to 36.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
But while some on Wall Street have increased their price target on Ulta, they also sounded a caution note on the backdrop for cosmetics. 
Nomura raised its price target on Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) to $230 from $215, but maintained a reduce rating on the stock, on fears that sales of color cosmetics, a key driver of growth for the retailer will likely remain weak at least into mid-2020.
Weakness in Ulta's color comestics may force the retailer to cut its earnings forecast in the future, the bank added.
 Wells Fargo echoed fears of weaker cosmetic sales.
""Slowing cosmetic trends and shifting industry dynamics will meaningfully pressure the business, even as they generate robust comps for the broader retail space,” Wells Fargo said.
The worries about future earnings is not without merit as the cosmetic retailer trimmed its outlook on full-year earnings.
For fiscal 2019, earnings-per-share guidance was narrowed to a range of $11.93 to $12.03, compared with $11.86 to $12.06 previously. Ulta Beauty earned $10.94 in the 2018-19 fiscal year."

(Reuters) -  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) is laying off employees at its Bakersfield plant in California in its latest round of job cuts this year, as the U.S. oilfield services firm struggles with falling profits amid slowing oil and gas activity.
The layoffs are expected to impact about 70 employees at the plant, the company said in a filing with California authorities.
Halliburton said the move was in addition to job cuts at other plants.
The company reported a drop in third-quarter profit earlier in October and vowed more cost cuts to help realize $300 million in annualized cost savings.
It recently closed a plant in El Reno, Oklahoma that impacted about 800 employees. Earlier in October, the company cut 650 jobs across Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and North Dakota.
Halliburton - the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services in the United States - and other oilfield services firms have been struggling as producers cut spending due to weak oil prices.

The company is currently working with an adviser to run an auction process for the business, Bloomberg reported, adding that the business is likely to draw interest from private equity firms.
A 3M spokeswoman said the company does not comment on rumors and speculations.
Shares of the company rose about 4% to $171.01 in morning trading.
3M's drug delivery business, which manufacturers inhalers and skin patches, accounted for about 1.4% of the company's 2018 revenue of $32.77 billion. Sales from the business were flat on an organic local currency basis in the recently reported third quarter.
The company, known for its Scotch tapes and Post-it notes, reported third-quarter revenue well below analysts' estimates and cut its full-year profit forecast in October, signaling that American corporations are suffering from the protracted trade war with China."

332,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 11:58AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank staffers cleared but bank fined in money laundering case,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Frankfurt prosecutors have dropped an investigation into two  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) employees accused of aiding tax evasion through a former Virgin Islands unit, although they have fined the lender for compliance lapses.
In a two-day raid a year ago, 170 police officers searched Deutsche Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt, hitting its share price just as management was battling with losses and a string of other financial and regulatory scandals.
Sources close to the investigation said as recently as July that prosecutors were set to escalate the investigation, planning raids on wealthy former clients after searching the homes of eight people in May.
Deutsche Bank said on Friday, however, that the Frankfurt prosecutor's office had now closed the case due to a lack of suspicion. It was hit with 15 million euros ($16.5 million) in fines and forfeits to make amends for the shortcomings in its compliance setup.
“With the closure of these proceedings it is clear that the prosecutors have not found any instances of criminal misconduct on the part of Deutsche Bank employees following the raid of our Frankfurt office in November 2018,"" Deutsche Bank spokesman Joerg Eigendorf said in a statement.
""The investigation that has now been closed due to lack of sufficient suspicion had a heavy impact on Deutsche Bank last year,” he added. “It is true that the bank had weaknesses in its control environment in the past. We identified these weaknesses and we have addressed them in a disciplined manner.”
The proceedings were linked to German client interactions with offshore entities set up by the bank's Virgin Islands subsidiary Regula Ltd. The subsidiary was sold by Deutsche Bank in March 2018.
In a separate statement, the prosecutor's office said the fines were imposed over the failure to promptly report suspected money laundering related to Regula; inadequate high-level oversight and understaffing of the bank's anti-money-laundering team from 2015 until early 2018.
Even though it dropped its investigation into the two Deutsche Bank staffers, the prosecutor's office said it would continue to investigate German customers of Regula that it suspects of tax evasion."

Halkbank said it requests the right to defend its position that the U.S. court lacks jurisdiction over claims made against the bank as Halkbank does not have any branch or physical operation in the United States.
The bank has so far declined to make a formal appearance in the case. Prosecutors have called the bank a ""fugitive"" and said they may seek sanctions against it if it does not appear.
""Our bank aims to solve this unfair case from the very beginning by challenging the court's jurisdiction,"" Halkbank said in a statemend.
It said it had requested a ""special appearance"" to challenge the U.S. judge hearing the case, saying his statements in and out of the courtroom called into question the court's impartiality.
On Thursday, the judge ruled that Halkbank must enter a formal plea to charges that it helped Iran evade sanctions before it can challenge a U.S. court's ability to hear the case.

Prosecutors have alleged in an indictment that Halkbank and its executives worked between 2012 and 2016 to help Iran spend revenue from oil and gas sales abroad using sham food and gold transactions, in violation of U.S. sanctions. Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab and Turkish officials also aided in the effort, prosecutors said.

The company, which is facing 42,700 U.S. plaintiffs, is widely expected to eventually buy itself out of the litigation, with analysts currently estimating the size of a future settlement at $8-$12 billion.
Bayer agreed with the plaintiff to delay for about six months a case in the California Superior Court for Lake County scheduled for Jan. 15, a company spokesman said in a written statement.
A second case due to begin on Jan. 21 in the California Superior Court for Alameda County would also be postponed until a date yet to be determined.
Bayer said the postponements would provide more time for it and representatives of the plaintiffs to ""engage constructively in the mediation process"". 
The company, which acquired the weed killer brands last year as part of a $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), has ruled out pulling the products from the U.S. market, citing regulators and extensive research which have found glyphosate to be safe.
It will early next year appeal to reverse the first three U.S. court rulings that awarded tens of millions of dollars to each plaintiff.

Other trials initially scheduled for this year have already been postponed.

With the three-month trial, H&M follows others in the fashion industry, such as Banana Republic of Gap Inc. (N:GPS) and Bloomingdale's (N:M), that are lending out their clothing for a monthly rental rate as consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental impacts of fast fashion.
H&M last week launched its first-ever in-house rental service of a limited range of festive gowns, with a fee per item, alongside the opening of a revamped central Stockholm store in Sweden. 
H&M has in recent years launched a number of independent brands such as COS and Arket, although its core budget H&M chain still accounts for the bulk of revenues. 
It said in a statement that the higher-end COS brand's trial with YCloset would allow it to explore customer demand, the business model, potential to scale and sustainability factors. 
""Subscription rental has been on our radar for some time and we feel this is a very relevant model for us to explore,"" it said. 
""It is important for us to try new approaches - testing and collaborating to achieve the best outcome for our customer and community - as well as the future of our business,"" COS managing director Marie Honda said in the statement. 

H&M said YCloset is China's largest fashion rental platform with 15 million registered users. Users pay a monthly subscription rather than a per item fee and are able to buy the clothing after they have rented it.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:22AM ET</span>",'Moving right along'? Shares nudge up after Trump trade talk,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares ticked up on Friday, buoyed by comments from U.S. President Donald Trump that talks aimed at dialing down the damaging trade war with China were ""moving right along"".
Trump's relatively upbeat tone in comments on Thursday was enough to encourage riskier bets by investors, despite a lack of agreement over whether existing tariffs should be dropped as part of an initial deal to ease the long standoff.
European shares, including the broader Euro STOXX 600, gained 0.4% by late morning, with indexes in Frankfurt and Paris up by similar amounts. Banks, technology firms and retail companies led the gains.
Wall Street futures were set to open in positive territory, too, with gains projected between 0.3%-0.4%.
The cautiously buoyant mood mirrored an appetite for riskier bets in Asia, where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.6%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, added 0.2% to 555.07 points, not far off a record high of 550.63 hit last January but still on track for a weekly fall. 
Investors were hoping the two sides can reach a compromise to at least avoid their worst fear: that the United States goes ahead with its final batch of tariffs on about $156 billion of Chinese exports, due to take effect on Dec. 15.
Trump's remarks came after Chinese officials reiterated demands that some U.S. tariffs be rolled back if the sides are to reach a so-called phase one deal. 
Markets had expected the sides to seal the initial deal in November. Instead, investors are nervously watching the approaching deadline for the new U.S. levies.
""The difficulty with this is it's very difficult to time and to trade,"" said Jeremy Gatto, a multi-asset investment manager at Unigestion. ""We are relatively favorable towards riskier assets in general - but with hedges."" 
Gatto said those hedges include currencies such as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Australian dollar, as well as options.
Investors have already taken precautions against a possible slide in stocks by buying put options, with demand for put options to hedge exposure to the S&P500 index climbing in recent days.
In one sign of detente, China said it would waive import tariffs imposed last year on some U.S. soybean and pork shipments. Beijing is rushing to source more meat to fill a gap in protein supplies.
China stocks posted their biggest weekly advance in nearly two months, with the blue-chips up 0.6%.
Investors were looking out for U.S. jobs data, due out at 1330 GMT. The non-farm payrolls report is expected to show 180,000 new jobs were created in November, up from 128,000 a month earlier. 
Signs of buoyancy in the labor market would soothe anxiety over the impact of the trade war.
""Markets are in consolidation phase,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier. ""It's wait and watch for first, how does the non-farm payrolls look and, more importantly, the Dec. 15 tariff deadline."" 
In other economic data, German industrial output fell unexpectedly in October, pointing to persistent weakness in the backbone of the economy. Berlin said, however, that new orders and business expectations suggest output may stabilize.
While markets have largely priced in the view that the world economy has dodged the bullet of recession, there are still signs of fragility in many major economies.
OIL SKIDS
Oil prices steadied and were set for weekly gains ahead of a meeting of OPEC and its allies later in the day, where the grouping is expected to formally agree to more output cuts in early 2020.
Sources told Reuters that OPEC+ agreed to a 500,000 barrel per day cut, with the group due to next meet in March.
Brent crude futures were down 0.3%, or 18 cents, at $63.21 a barrel, a retreat from earlier gains.
The agreement coincided with the initial public offering of state oil firm Saudi Aramco, which was priced at the top of its range and raised $25.6 billion in the world's biggest IPO.
In currencies, the British pound lost 0.3% but was still set for its best week since October. It has gained 1.5% against the dollar this week.
Sterling had spiked to a seven-month high of $1.3166 on Thursday on bets that next week's election will give the Conservative party the majority it needs to deliver Brexit, ending near-term uncertainty.
The pound last stood at $1.328. It hit 2-1/2-year highs versus the euro.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar has dropped every day this week, falling to a one-month low of 97.356 on Thursday. The index was up a smidgeon at 97.460, and has lost nearly 1% this week.

343,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:17AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Drift Higher on China News Ahead of Payrolls,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures drifted higher early Friday in New York, consolidating overnight gains made after China said it would waive import tariffs on U.S. pork and soybeans. 
Beijing had applied tariffs of 25% on both products in response to similar measures by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in the year. The move is, however, easy to over-interpret, given that China has suffered from acute inflation in pork prices this year as an epidemic of African swine flu has wiped out much of its pig population. There was no sign of China giving ground over other central U.S. demands in the trade talks. 
By 7:17 AM ET (1217 GMT), Dow Futures were up 64 points or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures were up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 Futures were up 0.3%. 
Much of the early action in individual stocks was set to be in smaller companies, with   Sage Therapeutic   (NASDAQ:SAGE) set to bounce at least a little after falling 60% on Thursday due to its key depression drug failing in tests. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) thinks the stock has overshot, putting out a new target price of $105, according to various reports. That compares to a closing price of $60.18 on Thursday. It's up 4.9% in premarket trade.
Also in the spotlight is Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), whose better-than-expected earnings and revenue failed to compensate for an outlook that didn't live up to Wall Street's hopes. It fell 8.9% in after-hours trading, giving up almost all of its gains since IPOing in the spring.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) was marked down 1.5% in early premarket deals after publishing a review into safety standards that showed 515 attempted rapes by its U.S. drivers last year, and nearly 6,000 incidents of sexual abuse overall. 
Elsewhere, Crude Oil futures fell 0.5% after the so-called OPEC+ grouping signed off on what analysts said was a largely symbolic additional cut of 500,000 barrels a day of production through March 2021. That brings the production ceiling largely into line with the actual level of current output, given that Saudi Arabia is producing below its agreed quota. 
The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six advanced economy currencies, was up less than 0.1% at 97.415, while Gold Futures were own 0.2% at $1,480.55 a troy ounce."
344,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:07AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Dongfeng plans partial sale of PSA stake - sources,"By Kane Wu and Gilles Guillaume
HONG KONG/PARIS (Reuters) - China's Dongfeng Motor will likely trim its stake in  Peugeot  owner PSA (PA:PEUP) after hiring banks to study options, people close to the matter said, in a move that could ease the French carmaker's planned merger with  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) (MI:FCHA). 
Dongfeng (HK:0489) has a 12.2% equity stake in the French carmaker, and would have about half of that in the combined entity formed by FCA and PSA, which announced in October a tie-up to create the world's fourth-biggest automaker. 
A smaller Dongfeng holding would likely help get the deal past U.S. regulators amid trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, an issue which has raised questions about the Chinese firm's next move since the PSA-FCA merger was announced. 
Dongfeng, a long-standing partner of PSA, had sent banks a request for proposals to explore options for the stake several weeks ago, according to the sources. The company is now aiming to present its board of directors a share sale plan in the coming days, one of them added. 
PSA declined to comment while Dongfeng did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Dongfeng is looking to reduce its holding in the merged entity of PSA and FCA to a level that would be acceptable to The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), three people close to the situation said.
CFIUS reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks and has tightened its oversight of deals involving Chinese entities as Beijing and Washington remain locked in a heated trade and technology dispute. 
Having a stake of over 5% in the merged FCA-PSA company could entitle Dongfeng to a seat on the board of the new firm, one of the sources familiar with the matter added. 
PSA and Fiat Chrysler hope to sign a binding agreement in December to create the $50 billion group, seeking scale to cope with costly new technologies and slowing global demand through a 50-50 share merger.    
Under the terms of the preliminary deal reached between the companies, PSA's Carlos Tavares would take the helm as chief executive and FCA's John Elkann would become chairman. 
Dongfeng came to PSA's rescue in 2014 by buying a stake in the automaker which was struggling financially but has since undergone a turnaround under Tavares. It still has a 19.5% voting stake in PSA. 
Dongfeng and PSA also have a joint venture in China, which the firms are trying to reboot by slashing costs amid mounting losses as the market there loses steam. 

The joint venture sold just over 100,000 units in the first ten months this year, down 55% from a year earlier.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:07AM ET</span>","As United Airlines seals CEO succession plan, eyes turn to American","By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - With United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) unveiling on Thursday plans for industry veteran Scott Kirby to take the helm as chief executive officer next year, investors are turning to succession plans at another carrier:  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL).
American, the world's largest airline, has been struggling with dismal stock and revenue performance and strained labor relations, putting pressure on top management to turn things around.
Ironically, Kirby landed at United from American in 2016 after the board passed over him as a potential leader in what was described as succession planning for the longer-term.
But given diverging performance at the two airlines since Kirby's departure - with United's shares doubling and American's losing about 25% - industry insiders and analysts have questioned the leadership of American Chief Executive Doug Parker and heir apparent Robert Isom, and had speculated about Kirby's possible return.
""American is now without a future pilot,"" said Eric Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants.
When American ousted Kirby, it mentioned the ""marketability"" of its executives and elevated Isom, then chief operating officer, to the role of president.
""When American picked Isom his strength was on the operational side. With the airline lagging not only in profitability but also in operations, you can understand why people question whether that succession plan still makes sense,"" aviation analyst Seth Kaplan said.
American said in an e-mailed statement it has an ongoing succession planning process, which the company's board of directors discusses regularly.
A person familiar with the board's thinking said the succession plan with Isom remains in place.
Parker and Isom have blamed lengthy flight delays and cancellations this year on the Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX grounding and an ""illegal work slowdown"" by mechanics. The mechanics union has denied the allegations and is in contract talks with the airline, which is aiming for a deal within months.
American's operational results improved for the third consecutive month in November, when the airline also set a record with seven days without flight cancellations, according to a Dec. 4 letter to employees by David Seymour, senior vice president of operations.
""They are a more reliable airline this quarter than last, but there's a lag time in perception, and in a way they're in a vicious cycle, without the finances to think long-term,"" Kaplan said.
Glen Hauenstein of Delta (N:DAL) and Richard Anderson of Amtrak have surfaced as possible contenders at American. However, Hauenstein is believed to have signed a non-compete agreement with a view to eventually replacing Delta's Ed Bastian as CEO, and some question whether Anderson wants to return to the airline industry after tenures as CEO of Delta and Northwest Airlines.
""American needs a great leader and there aren't many options, which is a concern for shareholders,"" Schiffer said.
At Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), insider Tom Nealon is widely seen as the likely successor to CEO Gary Kelly.
Meanwhile, Kirby - who worked alongside American's Parker for two decades before his departure - will replace Oscar Munoz as CEO of United in May with a pledge to continue the airline's growth."
346,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 06:52AM ET</span>",India’s Sensex Snaps Longest Weekly Winning Run in Eight Months,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s equity benchmark broke its best stretch of weekly gains since April, as investors assessed the outlook after the central bank yesterday cut its economic forecast and unexpectedly kept interest rates unchanged.
The S&P BSE Sensex Index declined 0.8% to 40,445.15 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The gauge fell 0.9% for the week, ending a five-week winning streak. The NSE Nifty 50 Index also fell 0.8% today.
Foreign investors have pumped $13.2 billion in India stocks so this year, exceeding the highest annual inflow since 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Sensex is retreating from a record high close on Nov. 28.
Strategist Views
“RBI’s decision to pause on rate cuts is accentuating investors’ concern about economic growth, and therefore we are seeing some selling pressure,” said Chokkalingam G, managing director and founder at Equinomics Research & Advisory in Mumbai. “Selling may continue for some time in highly valued large stocks, he added.
“Lower lending rates are unlikely to lift growth unless demand and sentiment also improve, perhaps from fiscal measures in the Feb Budget as the RBI appears to suggest,” Jefferies Financial Group Inc. strategists including Somshankar Sinha wrote in a note on Thursday. “India’s extended valuations may already be pricing some of this in, though, leaving us defensive,” the note added.
“The recent decline shows disappointment among the participants post the RBI policy outcome as the majority were hoping for a rate cut,” said Ajit Mishra, vice president of research at Religare Broking Ltd. “Since the Nifty has breached its immediate support at 11,900, we may see further profit taking ahead.”
The Numbers

Eighteen of 19 sector sub-indexes compiled by BSE Ltd. rose, led by a gauge of auto stocks.
Interest rate sensitive stocks including State Bank Of India (NS:SBI) and   Tata Motors Ltd   (NS:TAMO) were among the top losers on the benchmark.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 06:46AM ET</span>",Santander Brasil revamps investment banking with new hires,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) -  Banco Santander  Brasil (SA:SANB11) is making new hires as part of a revamp of its investment banking business in an effort to gain market share.
Gustavo Miranda, the new head of investment banking at the bank, has hired Renato Boranga, who was formerly at  Moelis & Co  (N:MC), as head of mergers and acquisitions.
Miranda, who became head of investment banking in October, has also appointed Pedro Leite da Costa, previously at Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and advisory firm One Partners, as head of equity capital markets (ECM).
Capital markets activity has reached the highest levels in a decade in Brazil this year and is expected to reach record levels next year.
""We intend to finish 2020 in leading positions at the equity league tables,"" said Miranda. Santander Brasil, part of Banco Santander (MC:SAN), currently ranks 8th in Refinitiv's Brazil equities league table.
Miranda expects more initial public offerings among mid-sized Brazilian companies as well as share offerings by state-controlled companies.
Brazilian investors are migrating from fixed income to equities because of record low interest rates. Miranda said new asset management firms had set up and were seeking to invest in local small cap companies.
Miranda has also appointed Giovanni Bosco as head of energy banking, including M&A and ECM. He was previously at the bank's project finance unit.
The 2020 outlook for mergers and acquisitions is also positive, Miranda said, saying he expects higher volumes next year.
""Proceeds from share offerings will probably be used in acquisitions,"" he said, adding that privatizations should also generate large deal volumes.
Santander Brasil is ranked 4th in Refinitiv's Brazil M&A league table this year, after advising state-controlled oil company Petrobras (SA:PETR4) on some of the largest deals of the year, such as the $8.6 billion sale of pipeline network company TAG and the $880 mln divestiture of LPG distribution unit Liquigas.
Santander Brasil's main focus has been on retail banking for the past few years. Under Chief Executive Officer Sergio Rial, the bank gained market share with its consumer loan book growing faster than competitors."
348,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 06:44AM ET</span>",Time to Get Tactical on European Rates as Returns Set to Dwindle,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors may have to get more tactical in 2020 given the impressive returns from European government bonds this year could become much harder to achieve.
Ten-year German yields may well remain in a broad range. Euro-area cyclical indicators have risen off recent lows and if the U.S. and China reach an initial trade deal then yields will likely reprice higher ahead of economic data improving. However, a strong recovery and higher inflation remains elusive, narrowing the room for yields to increase above 0%.
The space for yields to fall will be limited in the case of a stagnating economy. The bar is high for substantial additional ECB easing given divisions within the Governing Council as arguments grow against negative rates. New record-low yields would likely require a significant economic downturn.

Net, trading bunds may be more tactical in nature within a broad range, and conditional option structures make sense. Upside yield risk comes from a possible U.S.-China trade deal and capex rebound vs downside risk of escalation. Bunds are looking to end this year not far from fair value (currently 10bps cheap) when modeled against macro fundamentals.
Carry is scarce but historically low rates and volatility implies investors will continue to seek value to meet yield goals. Potential of limited returns from capital appreciation and low levels of core yields leaves carry in focus.
Peripheral spreads’ strong 2019 performance restricts the room for further tightening and may well depend on lower core yields, but the high carry on offer in a low-return world may be too enticing for investors. Any bouts of widening on profit-taking and seasonally high supply at the start of the year may be bought if political volatility remains contained and with supportive ECB QE vs lack of net supply.
The argument against persistently negative yields and the reversal rate debate may gain traction next year. This can be hedged through expressions such as: paying ECB-dated OIS, selling weighted payer spreads or buying Schatz puts. The swaptions market prices only a small probability of the ECB cutting rates further.
Re-anchoring of inflation expectations looks out-of-sight, and there is some risk of a policy mistake given diverging views within the ECB Governing Council and new leadership.
A situation where inflation remains stuck, the economy is stagnating and ECB stays on hold will support carry trades. The highest roll-down in EUR forward swaps is in the belly between 5y and 10y tenors, although not historically high. Receiving on shorter-tenors may be favored to avoid the risk of bear-steepening, and with the short-end having nearly priced out ECB cuts.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 06:21AM ET</span>",China-built Tesla cars secure new energy vehicle subsidies,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) said on Friday its Chinese-built Model 3 cars would receive state subsidies, a move that will help the U.S. electric vehicle maker's push into the world's biggest auto market.
China's industry ministry had earlier said Tesla's Model 3 cars, being built at its $2 billion factory in Shanghai, were on a list recommended for subsidies for new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells.
Tesla said in a statement the subsidies had been secured.
Two variants of Tesla Model 3 vehicles are on the list for the generous NEV subsidy program, according to the website of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
The California-based electric vehicle maker aims to make more than 1,000 vehicles a week by the end of 2019 for it Shanghai plant and deliver the China-made vehicles before the Chinese new year on Jan. 25.
The annual capacity at the factory in its first phase is expected to reach 250,000 vehicles, equivalent to about 4,800 a week. This will include 150,000 Model 3 cars.
It was not immediately clear how much of a subsidy the vehicles would receive. The starting price for China-made Model 3 cars is 355,800 yuan ($50,550), according to Tesla's website.
China hopes sales of NEVs which constituted around 4.6% of overall market in 2018, can reach a quarter of car sales in 2025.
Tesla, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is planning a broad after-sales network in China."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will fine flag carrier PT Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA) for violating aviation rules after its chief executive was accused of smuggling a Harley Davidson motorcycle onboard a new plane, state news agency Antara cited the transport minister as saying. 
A day earlier, State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir said CEO Ari Askhara would be dismissed over the allegations.
""We have sent a letter to fine Garuda because it carried items without including them in the cargo list,"" Transportation Minister Budi Karya was quoted as saying on Friday.
He did not say how much the airline would be fined, but said that although the incident was not on a commercial flight, cargo must be listed, Antara reported.
Askhara is accused of trying to evade tax on a Harley Davidson motorcycle worth 800 million rupiah ($57,000) that was found on the plane. Two expensive bicycles were also discovered.
Askhara did not respond to multiple emails, text messages and phone calls seeking comment. 
Thohir said on Thursday that an initial investigation found a Garuda employee in Amsterdam helped pay for the motorbike and assisted in the delivery.
He said the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry would continue to investigate.
Chief financial officer Fuad Rizal will take over as acting chief executive of Garuda, the company said in a statement on Friday, until a shareholders' meeting to appoint a new chief is held ""in the near future"".
The statement added that Garuda will continue to evaluate its business processes, conduct good corporate governance and comply with regulations.
Even in a country used to frequent graft cases, the story of the smuggled bikes has stirred intense public interest.
Flower arrangements supporting the actions of the SOE Ministry have even been sent to its offices in Jakarta. 
""We support the SOE Minister in the firing of Garuda Indonesia's chief executive,"" a tag on one of the arrangements read.
The airline's cabin crew union IKAGI welcomed the decision to remove the CEO.
Garuda's next chief would be its fourth in the last five years. 

The airline has been struggling to improve its profitability. In June, Indonesia's financial regulator ordered Garuda to ""fix and restate"" its 2018 financial results over accounting errors.

352,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 05:22AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Oil Majors Struggle as COP, ECB Overshadow OPEC","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- It’s been a tough week for the oil and gas sector.
The price of its main commodity has risen by over $2 - nearly 4% - as the cartel that produces over 40% of the world’s output has moved toward a significant tightening of its policy, but the share prices of Europe’s big names are mostly down on the week, reflecting a growing number of longer-term concerns. The big four European majors are all down on the week, by between 0.6% and 2.6%.
For one thing, there’s the worry about whether the action agreed by OPEC and allies led by Russia will actually be enough to stop a fresh glut on world markets next year. The ‘OPEC+’ grouping has reportedly agreed to take another 500,000 barrels a day of oil off the market through the end of 2020, but whether that will be enough to offset rising production in Brazil, Norway and – the big wild card – U.S. shale is far from clear - especially if the U.S.'s attritional trade war with China continues to depress world oil demand.
London-listed   BP   (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) can at least argue that some of their weakness is due to exchange rate effects: the pound has rallied strongly this week, reducing the value of their dollar-based income streams. But that doesn’t explain away Total’s and Eni’s limp performance.
The truth is – the OPEC meeting in Vienna is not the only game in town. Across the continent in Madrid, the UN-sponsored COP 25 talks on climate change have sharpened the focus on the growing hostility to the very notion of oil and gas, even though there is currently no way of maintaining living standards in a world without the two sources that meet the overwhelming majority of the world’s primary energy needs.
The sector has been under siege from the growing might of the sustainable investing lobby for years, and now the authorities appear to be taking the ESG side too: incoming European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has pledged to make the continent carbon-neutral by 2050, and Christine Lagarde is likely to throw the European Central Bank's considerable influence behind that push when she launches her strategic review of ECB policy, probably at her first governing council meeting next week.
The ECB's action could include, for example, banning the sector’s bonds from its asset purchase programs. It could also, as bank supervisor, apply higher capital charges on loans to the sector (ironically so, given that the majors in particular have rock-solid credit ratings). The central bank could also pull its own pension money from the sector’s bonds and stocks. All three measures would raise the majors’ cost of capital, the first two especially.
The majors' stock prices have always been supported by the assumption that they are indispensable to the modern economy. That assumption is going to be tested with growing severity every year in future."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Weeks after his billion-dollar bailout of WeWork, SoftBank Group Corp's founder and CEO Masayoshi Son reiterated his belief in an instinct-led investing style, in a discussion with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Inc's co-founder Jack Ma.
SoftBank owns 26% of China's Alibaba, with its origin in a $20 million investment in 2000, and the stake is now worth more than the Japanese firm's market capitalization.
Son on Friday said the decision to invest in Alibaba was driven by a gut feeling.
Other entrepreneurs Son met at that time ""did not have true belief in their heart. I can feel,"" Son said. ""We are the same animal. We are both a little crazy,"" he said of long-time ally Ma.
Ma said Son initially tried to invest $50 million in the e-commerce firm, but that he declined saying it was too large a sum - part of a pattern of offering big cheques to company founders that continued with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann.
Son's comments come weeks after he was forced to bail out office-sharing startup WeWork when Neumann's level of control over his firm and hard-partying ways chilled investor appetite and crashed plans for an initial public offering (IPO).
Son last month said he misjudged Neumann's character, after WeWork - formally The We Company - and other sputtering bets saw his $100 billion Vision Fund report an $8.9 billion second-quarter operating loss. 
The conversation at Tokyo University between two of Asia's most prominent tech entrepreneurs comes at a point of divergence in their careers, with 55-year-old Ma retiring as Alibaba's executive chairman in September and Son pledging to spend his sixth decade at the helm of his investment juggernaut.
Domestically, SoftBank hopes to drive commercialization of the emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI), announcing on Friday it will spend 20 billion yen ($184 million) over 10 years funding an AI research institute with Tokyo University. 
Son ""probably has the biggest guts in the world on doing investment,"" Ma told attendees to the conference.
""Too much guts, sometimes I lose a lot of money,"" Son responded.
With the highly leveraged SoftBank trying to raise funds for a second mega fund in which it is currently the only investor, its stake in Alibaba is one possible source of funds.
""In my view I have not achieved anything yet,"" Son said. ""I'm still a challenger and everyday I'm still fighting.""
That approach contrasts with Ma, who stepped back from running Alibaba to focus on philanthropy.

(Reuters) - Four people died in a shootout following the theft of a  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) truck and an attempted jewelry store robbery in a Miami suburb, the FBI and police said late on Thursday.
Police said the two thieves and two by-standers were killed.
The incident began with an attempted robbery of a jewelry store in the Miami suburb of Coral Gables, in the city's famed ""Miracle Mile"" shopping district about 4:15 p.m.
The shop owner confronted the robbers with a gun. At one point, a female employee of the store was slightly wounded by a ricocheted bullet, police said.
At least one bullet hit Coral Gables city hall, breaking a window and the building was put on lock-down, police said.
After the failed robbery the thieves stole a UPS truck, taking the driver hostage at gunpoint, and led police on a chase which ended in gunfire about 20 miles north of Miami in Miramar, police said.
The shootout started after the truck became stuck in traffic on the Interstate 75 highway. The two thieves were shot and killed, FBI agent George Piro told the media.
Two civilians were also killed, the UPS truck driver and a bystander, said Coral Gables Police Chief Ed Hudak.
It was unclear if the hostage and bystander were shot by the robbers or in police crossfire, Hudak said.
UPS said in a statement to Reuters that it was saddened by the incident, which the company described as a ""senseless act of violence"".

LONDON (Reuters) - The Saudi Aramco IPO was supposed to be a cornerstone of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious plan to open the gates to foreign investment in the kingdom. But there's no sign of a stampede.
The state oil giant confirmed on Thursday that its initial public offering would be the biggest in history, raising $25.6 billion. The offering will surpass Alibaba's 2014 New York flotation and value Aramco at $1.7 trillion - still short of the prince's $2 trillion goal.
However many global investors focused on emerging markets are set to stay away when Aramco debuts on the Riyadh bourse, expected next week, according to information provided to Reuters by 26 major asset managers outside the Gulf region who collectively manage more than $7 trillion.
Most of the active fund managers said they would likely steer clear of the IPO, citing persistent concerns about risks around governance, the environment and regional geopolitics.
All of the passive managers, who track certain indexes rather than making specific investment calls, also said they would not buy shares in the offering. But the bulk of them are likely to routinely become investors when the stock is admitted into the indexes of benchmark providers MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&P, a development due as early as late-December.
While the responses give an indication of institutional demand, they provide just a small window into global appetite as they largely concern investments made by funds open to the public. Much larger sums of money are often invested on a private basis on behalf of major players like pension schemes and sovereign wealth funds.
Saudi Aramco declined to comment on the investor responses.
Few industry experts anticipated lukewarm global interest when the crown prince sent the energy and finance worlds into high excitement in 2016 as he announced plans to list the world's most profitable company, including a marquee international debut, staging the biggest IPO in history.
""When this was announced, the Saudis and the crown prince in particular were looking for something that was going to put Aramco on the international investor map and that clearly hasn't happened,"" said Charles Hollis, a former UK-Saudi diplomat and director at intelligence consultancy Falanx Assynt.
Institutional investors bid $106 billion to take part in the IPO, which was more than 4.6 times oversubscribed, but how much of that demand came from overseas investors was not disclosed. The last bid process update to do so was published last Friday, and showed foreign institutional demand at 10.5% of the total $38.4 billion tabled. 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY
Reuters contacted 66 non-Gulf asset managers who all either had exposure to Saudi stocks amounting to at least 5% of their portfolios, or of above 1% to the MSCI's Emerging Markets Index, according to an analysis of data from Morningstar, a U.S.-based financial research group.
Ten other leading non-Gulf investors who were not on that list were also interviewed. 
Of the total of 18 active asset managers who provided information, 12 - or two-thirds - said they did not plan to participate in the Aramco IPO. Five said they had not decided, while one said it would invest in the offering.
Seven of the eight passive investors that spoke to Reuters said they would likely buy Aramco shares as and when they were included in their respective benchmark indexes, but would not take part in the IPO. One said it did not plan to invest at all.
The range of concerns by active investors are broad; some simply won't invest in oil companies while others are wary about state interference in the running of the company, Saudi Arabia's human rights record or geopolitical risk, which came to the fore with an attack on Aramco's oil facilities in September. 
""Considering its core business and the impact of its contribution to global emissions, and following our responsible investment policy, we have no interest or plan to invest in Saudi Aramco,"" said a spokeswoman for Canadian investor Financiere des professionals, which has a 2.15% stake in Saudi stocks through its FDP Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio A fund.
Rohan Murphy, energy equities analyst at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, said his view on the company had not changed and his firm would be unlikely to invest, citing issues including governance, minority shareholder rights and geopolitical risk.
The counter argument, say some fund managers, is that Aramco has a sector-leading low-cost base, less carbon-intensive operations and an attractive dividend yield, but despite that, its eventual price tag could be key.
Dominic Bokor-Ingram, portfolio manager at Fiera Capital, which has around $80 million invested in Saudi stocks across four funds in the Morningstar data, said he had yet to make a decision on taking part in the IPO.
""It's obviously a great oil company because it produces a lot of oil, has a lot of reserves, and has one of the lowest costs of production in the world, but the question always is what do you pay for that? That's what we're working on at the moment.""

INTERNATIONAL ROADSHOWS CANNED
The precise amount of passive demand for Aramco shares - following its inclusion in the benchmark indexes like MSCI - would depend on its valuation, a subject of contention with bankers after hopes for a $2 trillion valuation fell to range between $1.6-$1.7 trillion. 
Two banking sources close to the deal estimated that passive investment in the first few weeks after inclusion in the indexes would range from $3 billion to $5 billion, depending on how the free-float was calculated by different indexes.
Aramco appeared to see the writing on the wall last month when it canceled international road shows for the IPO. The decision came after bankers said few foreign investors were willing to invest at the valuation they wanted. 
In its 658-page IPO prospectus, Aramco sought to address some potential investor concerns by announcing plans to bolster its renewable energy spend and reduce its energy consumption. 
It also raised other potential risks such as terrorist attacks, antitrust complaints, as well as the government's right to decide maximum crude output and direct Aramco to undertake projects outside its core business.
""They're trying their best to make it a palatable proposition and that'll be fine for some types of investors, but not necessarily for one like us,"" said Rob Marshall-Lee, investment leader of the emerging market equities team at London-based Newton Investment Management.

357,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 03:01AM ET</span>",Phoenix to buy Swiss Re's ReAssure unit for $4.1 billion,"By Michael Shields, Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Insurance group  Phoenix Group Holdings  (L:PHNX) said it had agreed to buy the British unit of  Swiss Re  AG (S:SRENH) for 3.2 billion pounds ($4.1 billion) in cash and shares, its biggest deal to date.
The deal is the latest in a rapidly consolidating sector as many insurance companies, hit by tougher capital rules since the financial crisis, seek to sell old books of business to free up capital to invest in high-growth areas. 
By consolidating lots of books together, Phoenix aims to run the business more efficiently. Its strong growth helped propel it into Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) this year. 
""The deal confirms Phoenix's position as Europe's largest life and pensions consolidator,"" outgoing Phoenix Chief Executive Clive Bannister said in a statement, adding that it took its total assets to 329 billion pounds.
It would also give the company an ""enhanced platform to pursue further growth opportunities"", he said, including in the active market for insuring defined benefit, or final salary, pension schemes, so-called 'bulk annuities'.
 Aviva  (L:AV) and M&G (L:MNG) are among a group of large insurers with substantial legacy books of insurance business that analysts have speculated could hit the market. The pipeline for large bulk deals is also strong.
Phoenix Group, Europe's largest owner of life assurance funds closed to new customers, said acquiring ReAssure was expected to bring in additional cash flows of about 7 billion pounds over time.
Swiss Re said it would get a cash payment of 1.2 billion pounds and a stake in Phoenix of 13% to 17%. ReAssure's minority shareholder, MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc (T:8725), will receive shares in Phoenix representing an 11% to 15% stake.
The landmark deal is the biggest since Phoenix completed a 2.9 billion pounds deal for  Standard Life  Assurance in 2016, which saw Standard Life Aberdeen (L:SLA) also retain a stake in the combined group. 
Swiss Re Group CEO Christian Mumenthaler said the deal secured ""a strong buyer"" for the business.
""The strategic rationale for the combination of the businesses is compelling, and we look forward to working together with Phoenix and to sharing the financial benefits of the combination,"" he said in a statement.
Swiss Re estimated the transaction, expected to close in mid-2020, would have a positive impact on its Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio and economic profit and a negative impact on its US GAAP results in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The company said it would take an estimated pretax charge of about $300 million in the fourth quarter, mainly to reflect the higher consolidated book value of ReAssure, driven by historically low interest rates.
The Zurich-based company in July shelved its plans for a $4.1 billion flotation of ReAssure, citing weak demand from institutional investors.
Swiss Re, the world's second-largest reinsurer, had wanted to spin off ReAssure to put the business under a more favorable regulatory regime and give it easier access to capital to fund expansion.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A prosecution witness in an Australian criminal cartel case against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) said on Friday that the banks never colluded, but that he helped a regulator build its case to get immunity.
The testimony from former JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith in court is a blow to the prosecution, which is relying on JPMorgan to support a case that the three global investment banks engaged in criminal cartel behaviour in a A$2.5 billion share issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) in 2015.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the charges, accuses Citi and Deutsche and their client, Australia's fourth-largest bank, of withholding details of the sale to support the stock's price. JPMorgan was given immunity in exchange for cooperating with the authorities.
In pretrial hearings in Sydney, three senior JPMorgan staffers said they began discussing possible immunity deals with the ACCC in 2016 and wrote witness statements months later. 
Herbert-Smith said he first met the ACCC over the stock issue in March 2016, seven months after the capital raising, and agreed to provide a frank account of his role in it.
But he said he rejected an ACCC investigator's suggestion that the three banks had colluded in a recorded phone call during the capital raising.
""I disagreed and stood my ground,"" Herbert-Smith told a packed courtroom. ""In relation to the part of the call (between the bankers) where people said they would stay out of the market of the day... it was not an agreement.""
""It was three independent positions which happened to be the same,"" he added.
The three investment banks and ANZ have declined to comment on the matter outside of what is said in court. Herbert-Smith left the bank in February 2016, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page.
JPMorgan's Australian head of trading, Mark Dewar, also spoke at the hearing, describing more than a year of meetings with the ACCC over drafting the witness statement he signed.
In a meeting over three days in October 2016, Dewar, who still holds his position at JPMorgan, said ACCC staff showed him a draft on a screen ""so everybody could see"". He said he gave notes verbally while an ACCC staffer wrote them down.
After several more meetings, he signed the statement in April 2017, he said. 
""I probably needed a holiday after that,"" he added.
The ACCC ultimately brought the charges in June 2018 against Citi, Deutsche and ANZ, and their former executives.

All the banks have said they will defend themselves against the charges and declined to comment further on the case outside of court.

Phoenix Group (LON:PHNX) said it has agreed to buy the U.K. life insurance business of   Swiss Re   AG (SIX:SRENH) for a total consideration of 3.2 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) in an all-share deal, making the biggest consolidator of the life and pensions business in Europe.
Swiss Re will get a stake of between 13% and 17% in the enlarged group, depending on Phoenix’s share price at the time of completion.
Phoenix, which specializes in buying back books of life insurance and annuity policies, said the assets of ReAssure will generate approximately 7 billion pounds in cash flows over time, of which 2.7 billion pounds will come by the end of 2023.
ReAssure has 4.1 million policies with assets under administration of 84 billion pounds. The transaction price represents a discount of 9% to ReAssure’s Own Funds of 3.5 billion.
Phoenix said its expects synergies of 800 million pounds, net of 50 million pounds in integration costs. The deal will support a proposed 3% increase in the final dividend.

Primark is set to be outshone for once by the other half of Associated British Foods (LON:ABF) over the next 12 months.
Chairman Michael McLintock will tell the company’s annual shareholder meeting that the traditional sugar and grocery businesses are both on course for strong years, sugar benefiting from the upturn in commodity prices in the EU over the previous year, and Twinings benefiting from a more efficient tea supply chain.
Primark, meanwhile, is likely to see its profit margins fall slightly, as a weaker pound bumps up purchasing costs, offsetting the benefit of overhead reductions.
McLintock will reiterate the company’s guidance for a modest increase in adjusted earnings per share this year and will also say that the group is now fully prepared for Brexit.

Homebuilder Berkeley Group (LON:BKGH) said profit before tax fell 31% to 276.7 million pounds in the six months to the end of October, in line with estimates, reflecting fewer completions and a slight drop in average selling prices.

Publisher Relx (LON:REL) said it will sharply cut the volume of share buybacks next year to 100 million pounds after completing a 600 million-pound program for 2019.
Relx also said it had cancelled 33.3 million of the 75.6 million shares it was holding in treasury. The share count is thus reduced to 1,938,439,225.

Berkeley sold 1,389 homes in 2019 with an average selling price of 644,000 pounds, down from 2,027 homes in 2018 with an average selling price of 740,000 pounds.

The Korean company is preparing the biggest overhaul to the cameras on its flagship phones for next year, according to people familiar with the company’s plans. Its upcoming Galaxy S11 will sport a 108-megapixel sensor for the main camera -- versus the iPhone 11’s 12 -- flanked by three more on the back of the device including an ultrawide-angle lens and 5x optical zoom, they said. The marquee device will also adopt a time-of-flight sensor for depth detection similar to one already in the Note 10+, a feature that can aid portrait photos and augmented-reality applications, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing specifications that haven’t been made public.
Samsung will also extend the high-resolution sensor and 5x zoom camera to the Galaxy Fold clamshell device -- which is expected to be publicly unveiled around the time of the Galaxy S11’s launch in February, the people said. The raft of new features signal Samsung’s renewed commitment to mobile photography after years of minimal innovation, as well as an attempt to catch Apple in the camera stakes.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Communications Workers of America union filed a federal labor charge against Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google on Thursday, accusing the company of unlawfully firing four employees to deter workers from engaging in union activities.
The complaint, seen by Reuters, will trigger a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) investigation into whether Google violated the four individuals' right to collectively raise concerns about working conditions. 
Google fired the four named employees ""to discourage and chill employees from engaging in protected concerted and union activities,"" the filing states. ""Its actions are the antithesis of the freedoms and transparency it publicly touts.""
Google did not respond to a request for comment on the filing, though it has said the four workers were let go for violating the company's data-security policies. 
Google also last month acknowledged hiring a consultancy known for defeating unionism.
The CWA union, which represents 700,000 North Americans working at AT&T Inc (N:T), Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and companies in several other industries, has been trying to organize workers at Google, said Laurie Burgess, an attorney at Messing Adam & Jasmine who worked on the NLRB filing.
The union stepped forward to make the charge against the company ""because it has been harmed by Google's actions,"" she said.
If at the end of its investigation the NLRB finds Google has a case to answer, the union could seek to reach a settlement or, ultimately appeal to a court.
CWA spokeswoman Beth Allen said its organizing director has been in touch with Google employees for some time to offer assistance.
""It's a good partnership we have and through their own organizing if they decide they want to form a union, we’re here to help them,"" she said. ""We really believe in workers leading their own struggles.""
The four workers, who were fired Nov. 25, ""visibly led and participated in"" organizing at Google, according to the filing. 
""I was fired for organizing my coworkers and advocating for better working conditions for everyone who works at Google (including employees, temps, vendors, and contractors),"" one of the workers, Paul Duke, said in a tweet on Wednesday.
He and others in social media posts since their exit have alleged that Google, which has faced a swell of worker activism over the past two years, wanted to demonstrate consequences for speaking out.
Duke and sacked co-workers Laurence Berland and Sophie Waldman publicly signed a petition in August urging Google to reject business from three U.S. immigration agencies that the petition said had mistreated migrants. The fourth fired worker, Rebecca Rivers, had protested Google policies that appeared to undermine its support for people who identify as gay, lesbian or transgender.
When the NLRB finds violations, it typically tries to help accusers and companies reach a settlement.
Google in September announced such a settlement after an employee accused the company of firing him for his conservative political views. Google said it agreed to remind employees that its ""policies do not prevent employees from discussing workplace issues.""
The company has long prided itself on listening to employee feedback and even adjusting course on the spot based on ideas at all-staff meetings. But it now serves more than 3 billion consumers and business customers across search, navigation and health technology, and it faces fierce competition in advertising and increased regulatory scrutiny. 
The company in the last year has reeled in elements of its unorthodox culture, such as by cutting back on companywide meetings next year, as it deals with its much broader influence.
Workers and investors have been able to exercise limited oversight over Google's practices because co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin control Alphabet's shareholder voting power. 

The co-founders stepped down Tuesday from their executive roles but retain their votes and board seats.

(Reuters) - Ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc said it received over 3,000 reports of sexual assault related to its 1.3 billion rides in the United States last year, in a report aimed at ensuring drivers and the public it was serious about safety.
The figure represents a 16% fall in the rate of incidents from the previous year in the five most serious categories of sexual assault reported, Uber said on Thursday in its first biennial U.S. Safety Report https://www.uber-assets.com/image/upload/v1575580686/Documents/Safety/UberUSSafetyReport_201718_FullReport.pdf.
The firm also said reports of assaults on passengers overlooked risks for drivers as riders accounted for roughly half of the accused.
The 84-page report comes almost two weeks after Uber said it would appeal the loss of its license to carry passengers in London over a ""pattern of failures"" on safety and security.
Uber, which in the past has faced criticism over safety on its platform and has been repeatedly hit with lawsuits over driver misconduct, last year committed to releasing a safety report in a sign of a cultural turnaround under its new CEO.
The firm, which operates in 70 countries, said the report showed its commitment to transparency to improve accountability and safety industry-wide. It said it would use what it learned producing the report for its ""next steps"" in other places.
""I suspect many people will be surprised at how rare these incidents are; others will understandably think they're still too common. Some people will appreciate how much we've done on safety; others will say we have more work to do. They will all be right,"" tweeted Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi.
In the report, Uber said 99.9% of its 2.3 billion U.S. trips in 2017 and 2018 ended without safety incidents.
It said it received 235 reports of ""non-consensual sexual penetration"" last year and 280 of ""attempted non-consensual sexual penetration"" - nearly all filed by women. The remaining assault reports included incidents of unwanted kissing or touching of body parts.
It also detailed 10 fatal physical assaults in 2017 and nine in 2018 - eight victims were riders, seven were drivers using Uber's app, and four were third parties such as bystanders.
At an event on Wednesday, Khosrowshahi said he prioritized improving Uber's culture and safety when assuming his role in 2017. At the time, Uber was dealing with regulatory fallout and public backlash over its business practices, forcing former CEO and founder Travis Kalanick to step down.
""We had to change the culture internally and we simply got to do the right thing,"" Khosrowshahi said, adding that Uber was not hiding anything by publishing internal information.
Rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) in a statement said it was committed to releasing its own safety report and sharing information on unsafe drivers. It did not state a release date for its report.
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Uber said it puts drivers through a vigorous background check before accepting them onto its platform. In its report, it said one million drivers failed to pass the screening test in 2017 and 2018 and more than 40,000 were removed from the app after extra screening layers.
Regulators have long said Uber's screening process was insufficient and inferior to those in place for taxi drivers, with several U.S. cities attempting to compel Uber to mandate fingerprinting of its drivers.
New York City is currently the only U.S. city where drivers have to provide fingerprints and undergo the same licensing requirements as regular taxi drivers.
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission in response to Uber's safety report on Thursday said there was no substitute for background checks based on fingerprinting.
""They are the best way to prevent against drivers with criminal records,"" its Acting Commissioner Bill Heinzen said in a statement.
An Uber spokeswoman on Thursday said the firm's screening process was robust and rigorous, and was more reliable than the database for fingerprints where she said not all crimes are updated promptly.

Uber's share price was down 1.57% in after-hours trade at $28.20.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese investors more than doubled their Hong Kong stocks purchases this year, braving market headwinds from violent street protests and the protracted Sino-U.S. trade war, which have battered the Asian financial hub's economy.
Data from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) showed mainland investors had been net buyers of Hong Kong stocks for the nine months through to November, as they hunted for bargains in the wobbly $4.5 trillion stock market.
Total net inflows via the Stock Connect linking mainland and Hong Kong in the Jan-Nov period amounted to about HK$208 billion ($26.58 billion), versus about HK$83 billion for the full year of 2018, according to HKEX.

The months-long protests and their hit to sectors including tourism, retail and real estate have all contributed to the benchmark Hang Seng index's (HSI) global underperformance this year.

Mainland investors have been undeterred, though, seeing opportunities to buy on the dip when the overall appetite for risk is dampened and valuations of Hong Kong stocks hover near three-year lows.
For firms dual-listed in mainland China and Hong Kong, the latest AH premium index (HSCAHPI) indicates Hong Kong-listed shares are more than 20% cheaper on average than their mainland peers.
China's No. 2 telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063), for example, on Wednesday, traded at 31.18 yuan in Shenzhen, while selling at HK$20.9 in Hong Kong, representing a near 40% discount.

Still, there has been a tendency to shun local Hong Kong firms and chase mainland companies whose business operations derive revenue and profits mainly from outside of Hong Kong.
Among mainland investors' darlings, Chinese food-delivery giant  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690) has seen its share price more than double this year, with upward momentum enhanced by its inclusion in the Stock Connect scheme.
Shares of another consumer bellwether, Haidilao International (HK:6862), also doubled this year, amid bets Beijing would roll out more measures to spur domestic consumption to shore up growth.

Mainland investors are playing an increasingly significant part in the Hong Kong stock market, owning stakes of 20% or more in several dozen firms.

Analysts believe in the long-run there is still abundant room for their exposure to Hong Kong stocks to keep rising, as their overall holdings are far from dominant and as the listings of tech giants, such as  Alibaba  (N:BABA) (HK:9988), boost the offshore market's attractiveness.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 09:23PM ET</span>",No apology to Elon Musk from British diver at 'pedo guy' defamation trial,"By Steve Gorman and Rachel Parsons
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The British cave explorer suing Elon Musk for calling him a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter testified on Thursday that his criticism of the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive that led to the tweet was not a personal attack.
In the defamation trial's third day, Vernon Unsworth also refused to apologize for a July 13, 2018, CNN interview in which he said that Musk's offer of a mini-submarine to help rescue a boys' soccer team from a flooded Thailand cave was a ""PR stunt"" and Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurts.""
""My insult was to the tube and not to Mr. Musk personally,"" Unsworth said while being cross-examined by Bill Price, one of Musk's lawyers. ""I'm not sure how I need to apologize. It was my opinion at the time and I stand by that opinion.""
Unsworth's lawsuit focuses on three Musk tweets on July 15, 2018, five days after the diver helped complete the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from the cave.
Musk's first tweet questioned Unsworth's role in the rescue, while the second said, ""Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it."" The third tweet, in response to a follower who asked Musk about the second tweet, said ""Bet ya a signed dollar it's true.""
Unsworth, 64, said the tweets harmed his reputation by branding him a pedophile and a liar, and said on Wednesday they left him ""humiliated, ashamed, dirtied.""
His lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from Musk, who told the court this week his net worth is around $20 billion.
Legal experts are closely watching the case because it is believed to be the first major defamation lawsuit brought by a private individual to go to trial over a tweet. 
Musk, 48, who was questioned throughout the afternoon on Tuesday by Unsworth's lawyer, has maintained his composure. He apologized to Unsworth, and suggested to jurors the stress of working 80 to 100 hours a week during a challenging period for Tesla contributed to the outburst.
Jurors are expected to begin deliberations Friday after Judge Stephen Wilson formally instructs them before the two sides give closing arguments. Wilson rejected a motion from Musk's lawyers to dismiss the case.
UNSWORTH'S REPUTATION 
The Unsworth trial has revived discussion of Musk’s erratic behavior during 2018, when he also used Twitter to float a leveraged buyout proposal for Tesla that was scuttled and ultimately led to Musk paying $20 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint. 
For most of this year, however, Musk, who has nearly 30 million Twitter followers, has largely kept his public comments focused on Tesla’s new models and improved profitability and on the technical progress of SpaceX.
Musk's lawyers on Thursday tried to weaken the defamation argument, suggesting Unsworth's reputation was unsullied and that he even tried to profit from his role in the rescue, which won him plaudits from the Thai and British governments.
Asked if there was talk of his being a pedophile at a 10 Downing Street event where he stood next to Theresa May, then Britain's prime minister, Unsworth said: ""Not that I recall.""
Unsworth's legal team called expert witness Jim Jansen who said the Musk tweets were disseminated widely in the news media - 490 English language articles in 33 countries. 
They also called Unsworth's estranged wife who gave him a character endorsement, despite the fact that Unsworth is living with his girlfriend part of the time in Thailand.
The ""pedo-guy"" tweet was ""totally false"", she said.
In his own testimony, Musk dismissed his tweets as an ""off the cuff"" response to watching a replay of Unsworth's CNN interview, at a time he felt overworked from running Tesla, which makes electric cars, and SpaceX, a rocket company that offered the mini-submarine.

To win his lawsuit, Unsworth needs to show Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified him and caused him harm. He does not need to show that Musk acted with ""actual malice,"" which is much tougher to prove.

(Reuters) - Two former top executives at  Celadon Group Inc  (PK:CGIP) have been charged with fraud and lying to auditors by concealing losses in the trucking company's aging fleet as the market softened, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday.
The charges against former chief operating officer William Eric Meek and former chief financial officer Bobby Lee Peavler follow Celadon's agreement in April to pay $42.2 million and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to settle related claims.
Authorities charged Meek and Peavler with involvement in a 2016 scheme where a Celadon unit, Quality Companies, tried to rid itself of hundreds of older and unused trucks by swapping them to a large dealer in exchange for newer used trucks.
The Justice Department said that instead of disclosing losses connected to the older trucks, Celadon hid them from investors by inflating prices on invoices for the trades.
Meek, 39, and Peavler, 40, both of Indianapolis, were arrested on Thursday and have been released on bail, the Justice Department said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil fraud charges against both men.
""Mr. Meek looks forward to defending himself against these inaccurate charges, and clearing his name,"" his lawyer Sean Berkowitz said in an interview.
Sergio Acosta, a lawyer for Peavler, declined to comment. 
Celadon's share price fell significantly in May 2017 after the Indianapolis-based company said investors could no longer rely on its financial statements covering the periods of the alleged wrongdoing, the Justice Department said.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 06:16PM ET</span>",Watchdog report faults EPA efforts to eliminate pollution rules for some trucks,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration failed to do a cost-benefit analysis to assess air quality or take into account the impact on children’s health when it sought to eliminate pollution limits on heavy-duty trucks with rebuilt engines, according to a report from an EPA watchdog on Thursday.
The Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Inspector General also faulted the EPA for failing to keep adequate records of the discussions and said the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) impeded the inspector general and refused to turn over some requested information.
The vehicles known as ""glider trucks"" have a used engine, transmission and rear axle in a new chassis and cab assembly. Under rules finalized under former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2016, nearly all heavy-duty trucks must use more efficient, less polluting engines as the glider trucks would effectively be phased out by 2021. The glider trucks emit up to 450 times more diesel particulate matter and up to 43 times more smog-forming nitrogen oxides than new trucks, the EPA has said.
Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt directed that the repeal rule be completed as ""quickly as possible"" and not to complete a cost and benefit analysis required for ""economically significant"" regulatory actions, the report said. EPA, which said the 2016 rules would result up to $14 billion in health benefits, has since listed the issue as ""economically significantly"" in regulatory documents.
Democratic Senators Tom Carper and Tom Udall said in a joint statement the report shows ""Pruitt secretly orchestrated a legally and scientifically flawed process to undo protections against dirty glider trucks, a move that would undermine decades of clean air progress largely for the benefit of one politically connected company.""
EPA told the inspector general's office it anticipated making a decision about whether it will move ahead with the repeal in 2020. The EPA told the office it is ""committed to the transparency of the rulemaking process and believes that public input is critical to improving regulations,"" but declined to comment further.
OMB spokesman Chase Jennings said it ""does not release deliberative information from the interagency review process"" and said it ""provided appropriate information"" to the inspector general.
The Environmental Defense Fund said the ""EPA flagrantly and knowingly violated the law as it tried to ram through a loophole to allow more super-polluting 'glider' freight trucks onto America’s roads.""
Volvo Group North America,  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI) and Navistar International Corp told EPA in 2017 they opposed efforts to reverse glider trucks limits as it could hurt their industry.
The EPA previously said if gliders were allowed through 2025, they would make up 5% of freight trucks on the road but account for 33% of all nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from the U.S. heavy truck fleet."
372,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 06:13PM ET</span>",Boeing says 737 MAX approval delays could hit production,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Significant additional regulatory requirements or delays in returning Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX to commercial service could cause it to cut or temporarily halt production of the aircraft, it said in an Oct. 18 letter released on Thursday. 
In its letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing said it does not expect 737 MAX order cancellations due to the grounding of its best-selling single-aisle jet to have a material impact on revenues or earnings. 
It cited the size of the 737 order backlog and its ability to shift planned customer delivery dates.
Boeing's letter was a response to requests from the SEC to clarify the company's comments in earlier financial filings on the 737 MAX grounding related to revenue and production.
The correspondence was released on the Edgar filing system on Thursday.
Boeing, the world's largest planemaker, is trying to rebuild trust with customers, regulators and the flying public in the wake of twin 737 MAX crashes in the span of five months that killed 346 people.
Boeing has said extra delays or a cut in production are possible as regulators around the world evaluate the 737 MAX, including Boeing's proposed upgrade of software at the center of both crashes and complementary training materials. 
Boeing said last month that it expected the Federal Aviation Administration would lift the grounding around mid-December, though it did not expect the agency to complete its review of revised training requirements until January.
In the October letter, Boeing also said it does not expect a shortage of space to store parked 737 MAX jetliners - which continue to roll out of a its Seattle-area factory - would limit its ability to continue their production.
The contents were released a day after Boeing wrapped up two days of meetings with consultants, pilots and other ""select aviation leaders"" it hosted in the Seattle area to discuss 737 MAX preparations, according to an invitation seen by Reuters and one person who attended the meetings. 
Events included a demonstration in a flight simulator, meetings with Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg and other Boeing executives, and a tour of the 737 factory in Renton, south of Seattle, the person added.

Media were not invited to the two-day summit. Boeing was planning a separate session with journalists at a later date, a Boeing spokesman said.

373,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 05:59PM ET</span>",Judge blocks higher White House tariffs on imported solar panels,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge overseeing trade issues temporarily blocked the Trump administration on Thursday from reimposing tariffs on some imported double-sided solar panels, a defeat for domestic manufacturers that caused shares of some to fall.
Judge Gary Katzmann of the U.S. Court of International Trade in Manhattan said it was in the public interest to block trade officials from enforcing their decision to eliminate an exemption for so-called bifacial solar panels from the tariffs, while opponents challenge it in court.
Katzmann's preliminary injunction is a victory for solar farm developers, including Chicago-based Invenergy Renewables LLC, that favored the exemption.
The office of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer did not respond to requests for comment.
In Thursday trading, shares of  First Solar Inc  (NASDAQ:FSLR) closed down 4.5%, while SunPower Corp fell 3.9%.
The United States in January 2018 imposed duties on solar panel imports beginning at 30% and expected to drop to 15% by 2021.
It exempted bifacial panels on June 12 but yanked the exemption on Oct. 4, projecting ""significant"" increases in imports. Invenergy sued on Oct. 22.
""The court has adopted nearly all of our arguments,"" Invenergy said in a statement. ""We are reviewing the order and preparing for the next steps.""
Bifacial technology is a small but growing part of the solar panel market, costing more but capable of producing greater power than traditional panels.
Consumers and importers said higher tariffs would boost their costs and were unnecessary because domestic producers did not make the panels and faced no harm from imports.
Domestic producers countered that solar farm developers could use monofacial or bifacial panels, and higher tariffs were needed to protect domestic production.
In his 55-page decision, Katzmann said tariff opponents would likely show it was ""arbitrary and capricious"" to withdraw the exemption.
""The facts on which USTR relied to implement the withdrawal remain unknown to all but USTR,"" Katzmann wrote. ""The public interest is served by ensuring that governmental bodies comply with the law.""
The Solar Energy Industries Association on Tuesday said tariffs from 2017 to 2021 on imported solar cells and modules would cut private sector investment by $19 billion and cost 62,000 U.S. jobs through layoffs or a lack of hiring.
SEIA President Abigail Ross Hopper said the trade group would ""continue to make the case that the... bifacial exclusion was a fair and reasonable solution to the problem of domestic module supply shortages.""

(Reuters) - The multi-billion-dollar philanthropic Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said on Thursday that its chief executive officer, Sue Desmond-Hellmann, is to step down after more than five years, to be replaced by Mark Suzman.
Desmond-Hellmann, who until October was also on the board of the social networking company  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), said she was stepping down from the Gates Foundation as of February 2020 to be able to ""care properly for myself and my family.""
Desmond-Hellmann was previously Chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco, the first woman to hold that position, and had worked at the pharmaceutical firm Genentech - now owned by Roche (S:ROG) - where she helped develop some of the first gene-targeted cancer drugs, Avastin and Herceptin. 
""This was without a doubt the toughest decision of my career. But... one of my mantras is: take your own pulse first. Over the last few weeks and months, I have done just that and concluded that I need to slow down,"" Desmond-Hellmann said in a letter to Foundation employees, a copy of which was shared with Reuters. 
The Gates Foundation, led by Microsoft (O:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, is one of the world's largest funders of global health programmes to combat disease and poverty. It has around $50 billion in assets.
Desmond-Hellmann's successor, Mark Suzman, joined the Gates Foundation in 2007 and is currently its chief strategy officer.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 05:56PM ET</span>",Trump turns to U.S. Supreme Court as last chance to keep his finances secret,"By Lawrence Hurley and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to keep his financial records out of the hands of a Democratic-led congressional panel, setting up a major clash between branches of government. 
Trump turned to the justices after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided on Nov. 13 that it would not revisit its October decision backing the House of Representatives Oversight Committee's authority to subpoena the records from Mazars LLP, Trump's longtime accounting firm.
The Supreme Court on Nov. 25 put that ruling on hold, giving Trump until Thursday to file his appeal.
The case represents an important showdown at the top U.S. court over the powers of the presidency versus those of Congress.
""This is a case of firsts. It is the first time that Congress has subpoenaed personal records of a sitting president,"" Trump's lawyers wrote.
The Republican president's lawyers say that the committee does not have authority to conduct what they describe as a law enforcement investigation.
The committee said it needs the records from Mazars to determine whether government disclosure laws need to be changed.
The lower court ruling, if left intact, would bring House Democrats closer to shedding light on Trump's business interests even as they pursue an impeachment inquiry against him focusing on his dealings with Ukraine.
Trump has already asked the Supreme Court to review a New York-based federal appeals court's ruling that local prosecutors can enforce a subpoena also issued to Mazars demanding Trump's personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018. The justices are due to discuss whether to hear that case at a meeting on Dec. 13.
In a third case, the New York-based appeals court on Tuesday directed  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) to comply with subpoenas from congressional Democrats demanding similar material.
Trump's lawyers have said they would ask the Supreme Court to put a hold on that case as well. As the court already blocked the similar Mazars ruling, it would likely grant that request.
The court has a 5-4 conservative majority that includes two Trump appointees: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. 

Both Mazars cases are likely to be on a fast track, meaning that if the court decides to hear them, a ruling would be possible before the end of June, when its current term ends.

Last month, Gary Jones resigned after 17 months in office as the union moved to remove him. He was linked to an ongoing federal corruption investigation by U.S. prosecutors that has so far seen 11 people plead guilty. Jones has not been charged.
Gamble has announced a number of reforms to clean up the union as he works to avoid a possible U.S. government takeover. The union will meet in June 2022 to select a new president. 
""There are difficult decisions that will need to be made in the coming months for our members. But I promise one thing, when I retire and turn over this office, we will deliver a clean union on solid footing,"" Gamble, 64, who led negotiations this year on a new contract with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, said in a statement.
Since Gamble took over as acting president last month, he has made a number of reforms including new financial controls, a new outside audit and stronger financial management practices.
On Wednesday, former UAW vice president Joseph Ashton pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud.
Ashton, a former General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) board member, was charged last month with conspiring with other union officials to receive ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and kickbacks"" according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit.
The FBI has been conducting an investigation into illegal payoffs to UAW officials by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). The widening probe raises questions about whether the U.S. government might seek to take over the UAW. 
In addition, the federal probe led GM last month to file a racketeering lawsuit against FCA, accusing its rival of bribing UAW officials to gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. FCA, which is working on a planned merger with France's PSA, brushed off the suit as meritless. 

UAW membership has plummeted 75 percent since 1979 and now stands at about 400,000. The UAW has failed for two decades to organize foreign automaker plants in the United States despite repeated efforts.

377,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 05:48PM ET</span>",Closings (and Cannabis) Contribute to Most Job Cuts Since 2015,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. employers cut 4% more jobs from their payrolls in the first 11 years months of this year than they did for all of 2018, according to new data.
A new reason has been added for the slump: poor regulation of cannabis.
Employers dropped 559,713 positions between January to November, surpassing 2018’s full-year total of 538,659, according to the report from staffing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. This marks the most job cuts in the 11-month period since 2015, the consultancy said.
Restructuring and closings accounted for more than 255,000, or 45%, of the firing announcements through November this year, according to the report. Cost cutting and bankruptcies led to more than 100,000 eliminations, while tariffs and other “trade difficulties,” accounted for another 15,000 lost jobs so far in 2019.
“Lack of cannabis regulation” cost 100 people their livelihoods -- more than job losses from contract disputes, privatization or climate legislation.
The Challenger report doesn’t specify the company behind the marijuana layoffs, but California-based Weedmaps -- which advertises pot sellers on its website -- cut at least 100 jobs in October, according to reports. Weedmaps had said in September that it was removing unlicensed cannabis retailers from its site."

379,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 05:12PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. It's Jobs Friday!
The U.S. labor market is expected to have rebounded last month as General Motors (NYSE:GM) strikers returned to work.
The Labor Department will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose by 186,000 last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That is ""well above the 128,000 see in October, as roughly 48,000 GM strikers and 12,000 workers who suffered layoffs during the GM strike are expected to have returned to payrolls during the month,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
The unemployment rate is forecast to remain unchanged at 3.6%.
Wage growth is expected to have crept up to a pace of 0.3% in November, up from 0.2% a month earlier, but unchanged year on year at 3%
2. Michigan Consumer Data
The holiday season is now in full swing, and many are eager to gauge if the U.S. consumer is showing any signs of reining in spending. 
The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for December due at 10:00 AM ET is forecast to show a preliminary reading of 97, up slightly from the previous reading of 96.8, while consumer expectations data will also be in focus.
3. Oil Markets in Focus 
OPEC agreed Thursday to deepen production cuts by 500,000 barrels a day along with its allies until the end of March, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing delegates.
Non-OPEC members, however, including Russia still need to back the proposed deal on Friday.
Crude oil futures settled unchanged at $53.43 a barrel amid concerns that the production cuts are having a diminishing impact on oil prices, as OPEC and its allies make up only about half of the world's crude production. 
Importantly, demand rather than supply has been the key driver of prices so far this year as global economic growth remains vulnerable to the ongoing U.S. and China trade war.
The latest rig count data will also come into focus Friday for clues on crude production activity as U.S. production remained at a record 12.9 million barrels a day.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 3 to 688. But the rig count is also down nearly 25% from a year ago. 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand."
380,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 05:09PM ET</span>",Stocks – Wall Street Rises Modestly Ahead of Jobs Report,"Investing.com – Stocks managed to rise for a second day in a row Thursday ahead of release of the important U.S. jobs report.
The S&P 500 rose 0.15%. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite pushed 0.05% higher while the Nasdaq 100 Index climbed 0.14%.
The small gains came after a weak open that saw the Dow fall as many as 87 points before a rally set in.
The rally seemed to be a bet that Friday's jobs report, due at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT) will be a winner.
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the report to show the economy added 186,000 jobs in November, up from 128,000 jobs in October and 155,00 jobs in November 2018. The unemployment rate is projected to hold steady at 3.6%, unchanged from October and down slightly from December 2018.
Early in the day, the Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to a seven-month low. And the Commerce Department said factory orders in October rose 0.3% from September. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing report, released Monday, suggested U.S. manufacturing was slowing. 
With Thursday's gain, the major averages are looking at small losses for the week.
But the S&P 500 is just 1.17% under its all-time high reached just before Thanksgiving, with the Dow at 1.76% below its peak, and the Nasdaq off 1.55% from its November all-time high.
Throughout the day, materials, financial and tech stocks were the market leaders.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),   Campbell Soup   (NYSE:CPB) and RH (NYSE:RH) hit new 52-week highs.
There seemed to be little news on the U.S.-China trade talks except that both sides said they were still talking. In addition, President Donald Trump said ""something could happen"" on whether the United States will impose new tariffs on Chinese goods starting Dec. 15. 
Saudi Aramco's initial public offering was priced Thursday giving the oil giant a market cap of $1.7 trillion, exceeding Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) current market cap of $1.2 trillion. But Saudi Arabia had originally hoped for a $2 trillion market cap. The shares are not available on U.S. exchanges.
Ride-sharing companies   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) both fell after 21 women sued Lyft in San Francisco charging they'd been sexually assaulted or raped.
Gold moved up slightly in New York. Crude oil was mostly flat. Interest rates moved higher, with the 10-Year Treasury yield hitting $1.798%, up from Wednesday's 1,781%.
Clothing company PVH (NYSE:PVH), biotech company Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), fashion company Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) and tool-maker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) were the top S&P 500 performers on the day. 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN), liquor-maker Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb), networking company F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) and fashion retailer L Brands (NYSE:LB) were the weakest S&P 500 performers."

When the dust settled in afternoon trading, the presentation from Biogen, combined with key study data from Sage Therapeutics Inc. and Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc., resulted in a combined $7.6 billion shift in value for the three companies. The huge moves were yet another reminder of how biotechnology investing -- and, more specifically, betting on drug development for diseases affecting the brain -- can often resemble a roulette wheel.
Biogen’s standing-room-only presentation of detailed results for its Alzheimer’s disease drug at a California medical meeting initially sank its shares by 5%. The stock later rallied to add about $2 billion to the company’s market value. Despite Biogen’s advance, some analysts on Wall Street were skeptical, including Mizuho’s Salim Syed, who called the data “not that impressive” and added that “old questions remain, new ones raised.”
For Sage, Thursday’s trading action was a day to forget. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company saw its shares plummet about 60%. That was worth a whopping $4.6 billion as some investors quickly pointed out that sales of the company’s lone drug on the market are projected to top out at less than $500 million annually, Bloomberg data show.
Acadia, a company focused on developing drugs to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system disorders, was among the day’s big winners after data drew praise across Wall Street. The company added a cool $1 billion to its value after presenting better than anticipated data at a conference Wednesday night for patients with dementia.
Small-cap drug developer Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc., while not focused on neurological diseases, briefly doubled Thursday after promising data."

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Authorities on Thursday lifted a second evacuation order in a week for thousands of people in a Texas city as U.S. safety officials began examining what caused the latest in a series of chemical plant fires in the state. 
The about 14,000 residents of Port Neches 95 miles (153 km) east of Houston were told to flee late on Wednesday when air monitors detected high levels of cancer causing petrochemicals butane and butadiene following an explosion last week.
Butadiene is the main product of the TPC Group's [TPCL.UL] facility in the city struck by last week's blast and fire, which injured three workers and prompted an initial, two-day evacuation.
The fire was put out on Tuesday after burning for six days.
""This was a very serious explosion,"" Manuel Ehrlich, a board member of the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, said at a briefing on Thursday. He described the incident as ""a fundamental failure in the system"" at the plant.
It was the fourth major petrochemical fire in Texas this year. 
A March blaze outside Houston burned for days and was followed a month later by a fire at another Houston-area chemical plant that killed one worker. An  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) chemical plant fire in Baytown, Texas, injured 37 in July.
""The reason why we're seeing so many this year is difficult to quantify,"" said safety board investigator Lauren Grim.
The specific event that triggered the TPC explosion and fire has not been determined, Ehrlich said. Workers at the plant had noticed a vapor cloud before the blast. 
""We are not trying to assume any ideas about what the cause was,"" Jason Sanders, a TPC official said in response to the description of a failure in the system. ""The CSB is there to thoroughly investigate what happened. We need to trust their process."" 
The top executive of Jefferson County, Jeff Branick, lifted the latest order less than a day after warning that elevated butadiene levels measured in some parts of Port Neches could cause dizziness, nausea, headaches, irritated eyes and throats.
""I don't want this being characterized as a regular occurrence, because it is not,"" Branick said at a media briefing. 
Fire officials said workers at TPC on Thursday stemmed butadiene leaks, reducing chemical levels over Port Neches, which is in Jefferson County, to non-irritating levels.
Schools in Port Neches and nearby Groves were closed for the rest of the week. Students had been allowed to return on Tuesday.
""There are a lot of these old plants that ought to be shut down,"" said Neil Carman, clean air program director for the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental group that has sued industrial plants over toxic emissions. ""TPC is 75 years old."" 
TPC's Sanders said it would take weeks to remove all the chemicals from the plant. 

The 218-acre (88-hectare) plant makes flammable chemicals used in the production of synthetic rubber and a gasoline additive.

384,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 04:34PM ET</span>",Citi Tells Rich Clients Stop Being So Nervous About Stocks,"(Bloomberg) --  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s private bank wants its clients to work on an attitude adjustment.
Next year will be “brighter than many expect,” Citi Private Bank said in its 2020 outlook -- “Staying Positive in a Negative (Yielding) World” -- published Thursday. It rejects the idea that a recession is imminent.
“The point of view of many family clients I meet is one of a world full of angst due to politics and trade,” David Bailin, the private bank’s chief investment officer, said in an interview. That uneasy feeling “is pervasive, yet when you look at the economy you see facts that are completely different than that.”
Bailin said he hopes the report will help clients stay fully invested and avoid “the fear and paralysis” that led many to miss this year’s market rebound. A November survey by UBS Global Wealth Management found that among more than 3,400 global respondents, each of whom had more than $1 million in investable assets, cash made up 25% of portfolios, on average.
‘Staying Strong’
Strong consumer spending and a high U.S. savings rate feed into Bailin’s argument for a rosier outlook.
“Manufacturers both for consumer goods and industrial goods were expecting a downturn that never happened,” he said. “Between the consumer staying strong and the Federal Reserve and other central banks being accomodative, there was success in extending an already-long expansion.”
The bank predicts the expansion will continue, anticipating global corporate earnings to rise 7% or more from current levels, barring an escalation of trade disputes. Citi also forecasts equity returns in the U.S. and abroad of about 7% in 2020.

The bond market is one area where Citi has a negative outlook.
“In the U.S., we take positive yield for granted, but at one moment this year there was around $18 trillion in negative-yielding global debt,” Bailin said. He sees no reason for clients to own bonds when the only upside is capital appreciation.
Citi suggests switching out some bond holdings for certain equities with histories of earnings and dividend growth. Some of Citi’s private clients are already making outright bets on improvements in the markets, said Bailin. “Our Asian clients have been buying Asian equities, which in my mind is anticipatory of a trade deal,” he said.
Citi’s report also suggests investors look well beyond 2020 to what it calls “unstoppable trends” that will unfold regardless of the economy. Those include opportunities in leading companies that help protect against cybersecurity threats, have innovative financial technologies and that are part of the transition to renewable energy.

385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>",Uranium Miners Rise as Trump Panel Urges U.S. Buy Domestic,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
A White House task force’s recommendation that President Donald Trump direct the federal government to buy more uranium from domestic producers sent shares of U.S. mining companies higher Thursday.
The purchase of uranium by the U.S. Defense Department is among the recommendations being made by the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group, comprised of cabinet level and other high-ranking officials, according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss non-public deliberations.
Energy Fuels Inc. surged 18% while Ur-Energy Inc. rose as much as 16% for the biggest increase for each company in two years. Hecla Mining Co. rose as much as 8%. The companies were the biggest gainers on the Russell 2000 Materials & Processing Index.
Revival Sought
The task force was established to study ways to revive the U.S. uranium mining industry.
One of the people said the Energy Department, home of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which maintains the nation’s nuclear stockpile, would be involved in the effort as well, which could include the creation of a new national uranium stockpile.
It remains to be seen what options Trump, who’s yet to be briefed on the non-public report, might choose to execute, if any -- though he’s been sympathetic to both the mining and nuclear power industries.
The White House and the National Security Council declined to comment.
Any government intervention could be a windfall for the handful of domestic uranium miners, including Energy Fuels and Ur-Energy, which earlier petitioned the White House to put a 25% domestic market quota on foreign imports of uranium, citing national security concerns.
The White House rejected that request in July and instead Trump formed the working group comprised of six cabinet secretaries and several top White House officials to analyze other options.
Among the options working group staff considered was a request by the nuclear industry to use the 1950 Defense Production Act, requiring the government to buy American uranium to replenish its stockpiles and for other purposes.
‘Security Stockpile’
Domestic uranium miners have asked the government to ensure production of as much as 10 million pounds per year through measures such as the creation of a new “Federal Uranium Security Stockpile.”
About 90% of the country’s uranium -- used to power nuclear reactors and submarines as well as to make nuclear weapons -- is imported from countries including Canada, Kazakhstan, Australia and Russia, according to Energy Department data.
“It’s clear that the U.S. nuclear industrial base has diminished to the point that the government must act to preserve it,” Energy Fuels President Mark Chalmers said in a statement. “The American nuclear fuel cycle needs the president’s immediate support or we risk the loss of this critical capacity, its miners and workers.”

386,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 04:01PM ET</span>",Big European banks face call to end funding for firms building coal-fired plants,"By Susanna Twidale, Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of Europe's biggest banks are being challenged by environmental groups to sever all lending to utilities which they say are still developing new coal-fired power plants.
The call comes as some 190 countries meet in Madrid to assess progress on the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which demands a virtual end to coal power by 2050.
A United Nations report last year said almost all coal-fired power plants would need to close by the middle of this century to curb a rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, in line with the level scientists say is needed to stave off the worst effects of climate change.
""Some banks have pledged to not directly finance new coal plants but they are providing general finance to companies which are building new plants,"" Katrin Ganswindt of German environmental pressure group Urgewald told Reuters.
Urgewald and BankTrack, an NGO focused on banks and the activities they finance, said an analysis of the 10 most active European lenders to companies which are still planning or developing new coal plants indicated total debt funding had risen to $56 billion between 2017 and the end of September 2019.
This compared with a calculation of $48 billion for the period 2014 to 2016, the pressure groups said in a report provided to Reuters on Thursday.
The 10 banks were  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), HSBC, ING, Nordea,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and UniCredit.
(GRAPHIC: Lending by European banks to utilities building coal-fired power plants - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/EUROPE-BANKS-COAL/0H001QXN29R6/eikon.png)
Most of those named said the report did not reflect their efforts to stop funding coal plant development or a commitment to lowering carbon emissions. Credit Suisse declined to comment.
Britain's Barclays said it no longer provides project finance to any new coal-fired power plants or expansions of existing ones and disagreed with some of the data:
""The report misrepresents and does not differentiate cases where Barclays finances a subsidiary investing in renewable energy, when its parent company may have other subsidiaries involved in coal, which have no relationship with Barclays.""
BANK ACTION
Since Paris, many European banks have adopted policies such as cutting lending to firms which rely on coal for a high percentage of their revenues or pledging to end funding for new mines.
Last week UniCredit said it would halt all lending for thermal coal financing by 2023, while BNP Paribas said this month it would stop financing the thermal coal sector in the European Union by 2030 and by 2040 worldwide.
Deutsche Bank said that since 2016 it no longer finances ""directly or indirectly the construction of new coal-fired power plants or new mining projects for the production of steam coal"".
Some banks have increased their funding of renewable energy projects and stepped up engagement with clients to encourage a faster shift away from coal production and consumption.
""In a majority of cases we know the use of funds and are able to do our due diligence to make sure the financing is compatible with our policies, which include no direct financing for new coal-fired power plants,"" Standard Chartered said.
Urgewald and BankTrack said their analysis was based on financial databases and public disclosures of loans obtained by 258 coal power producers and the underwriting of bonds issued by them, although for some syndicated loans and bond commitments the analysis had estimated each bank's share.
Dutch bank ING said it did not ""recognize the figures mentioned by Urgewald and the conclusions drawn from them"".
""ING supports new clients in the utilities sector only when their reliance on coal is 10% percent or less and they have a strategy to reduce their coal percentage to close to zero by 2025,"" it added."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) must hand a record number of aircraft to customers in December to meet delivery goals, company data showed on Thursday, and is all but certain of winning an annual order race against Boeing.
The European planemaker has been facing production snags in its best-selling A321neo jet, due in part to the introduction of a complex new flexible cabin, but has said it is confident of meeting a goal of 860 jets in 2019, revised down from 880-890.
To reach that target it must deliver 135 jets in December, beating a previous record of 127 December deliveries by 6%. 
Airbus delivered 77 aircraft in November to reach 725 for the year so far, according to Thursday's progress report.
Airbus has a track record of achieving a late surge in deliveries, though it is also working to spread deliveries more evenly over the year in future to smooth earnings and avoid quality problems that can creep in when it is working flat out.
Whether or not it meets targets, Airbus is set to regain the crown as the world's largest commercial plane producer this year as U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) approaches nine months without deliveries of its 737 MAX, grounded after two crashes.
Boeing is expected to jump back into the lead next year as projected deliveries include 737 MAX jets parked during the grounding, while remaining ahead on larger jets, but the timing of the 737 MAX return to service depends on global regulators.
Airbus is also on course to win an annual order contest between the plane giants after booking orders for 222 aircraft in November, driven mainly by last month's Dubai Airshow.
Emirates ordered 50 A350-900 jets at the show as part of a fleet shake-up that also saw the world's largest wide-body operator cut a remaining order for A380s and reduce its requirement for Boeing 777X jets, while adding the Boeing 787.
Airbus sold a total of 940 jets in January-November, or 718 after cancellations, leaving it well ahead of Boeing (N:BA), whose year has been derailed by the grounding of the 737 MAX. In the latest period for which data is available, Boeing sold 180 jets in the first nine months or 45 after cancellations.
The latest figures were released days after Airbus won a sale of 50 A321XLR jets to United Airlines (N:UAL), narrowing the potential market for a mid-market plane that Boeing has been studying, while slowing those discussions during the MAX crisis.

United also delayed delivery of 45 A350s by several years to 2027 and beyond. UK analysts Agency Partners said on Thursday that this could put pressure on A350 output in coming years.

388,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 03:42PM ET</span>",BlackRock global active equities chief to leave firm over relationship with colleague,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
(Reuters) - Mark Wiseman, global head of active equities at BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), is leaving the firm following a violation of the company's ""relationships at work policy,"" the world's largest asset manager said in an internal memo on Thursday.
Wiseman, one of several people tipped as BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink's possible successors, is a former Canadian pension manager who ran active equities and served as chairman of the $7 trillion indexing behemoth's alternatives unit.
""When the firm becomes aware of a breach of policy or conduct that is not in line with our values, we move quickly and decisively to address it,"" Fink and BlackRock President Rob Kapito said in the memo, which was reviewed by Reuters.
Fink, one of BlackRock’s founders in 1988, has not publicly named a successor or announced any plans to retire, but Wiseman was one of a handful of executives analysts have pointed to as a potential successor.
In a separate memo to employees, Wiseman said, ""I am leaving BlackRock because in recent months I engaged in a consensual relationship with one of our colleagues without reporting it as required by BlackRock’s Relationships at Work Policy. I regret my mistake and I accept responsibility for my actions.""
Wiseman's conduct had no impact on any portfolios or client activities, the first memo said. BlackRock's active equity unit had about $290 billion in assets at the end of June.
The leaders of the active equity teams who previously reported to Wiseman will now report to Kapito, the company said. 
""Mark was a high-profile addition to BlackRock with a distinguished background but BlackRock has a deep bench and a very strong leadership team,"" Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes said.
BlackRock hired Wiseman and his wife Marcia Moffat in recent years. Wiseman joined in May 2016 from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, where he served as chief executive, while Moffat joined BlackRock from RBC in July 2015 to head the asset manager's Canadian operations. 
The relationship that Wiseman failed to disclose was with a different BlackRock employee, the Wall Street Journal said on Thursday, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. The Financial Times also reported his departure earlier in the day.
Wiseman is the second BlackRock senior executive to leave this year due to lapses in personal conduct. Jeff Smith, head of the human resources group at BlackRock, left in July because ""he failed to adhere to company policy,"" BlackRock said at the time.
Earlier this year, BlackRock made several changes to its senior leadership ranks aimed at winning more business and boosting growth of its alternative investing business. 
BlackRock declined to comment beyond the contents of the memo. 

BlackRock shares, up about 24% this year, were 0.8% higher at $487.44 in morning trade on Thursday.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>",UK bribery investigation adds to Glencore's legal headaches,"By Yadarisa Shabong, Julia Payne and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a bribery investigation into  Glencore  (L:GLEN), adding to legal troubles that have hit the shares of one of the world's biggest miners and commodity traders.
The SFO said on Thursday it had opened an investigation into suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business by the Glencore group of companies, its officials, employees, agents and associated persons in June. It declined to comment on the scope of its inquiry.
The London-listed shares of Glencore, which has operations in over 150 countries, fell 9% to 216.9 pence, their lowest level in more than three years, knocking 2.6 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) off the company's market value.
Glencore, which was subpoenaed in July 2018 by the U.S. Department of Justice over possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act relating to operations in Nigeria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said it would cooperate with the investigation.
Two sources familiar with the matter said the SFO had recently sought information relating to Glencore's involvement in the DRC and its former business partner, Israeli billionaire businessman Dan Gertler.
Reuters was unable to ascertain whether those enquiries were part of the SFO's bribery probe.
A London-based spokesman for Gertler declined to comment.
Gertler was sanctioned by the United States in 2017 over allegations he used his friendship with former DRC President Joseph Kabila to secure sweetheart mining deals. He denied all allegations of impropriety at the time.
Over the course of this year, Glencore's shares have fallen more than 20%, pressured by broader concerns about safety and sustainability in the DRC. Canada's regulatory authorities fined a Glencore-controlled subsidiary last year after allegations of inadequate financial disclosures in the DRC.
The legal difficulties have upset shareholders. Boies Schiller Flexner, a London-based law firm, said it was mounting a fully-funded legal action on behalf of institutional investors against Glencore for damages that could exceed 1.0 billion pounds.
Glencore's CEO Ivan Glasenberg told investors earlier this week he expected to step down next year once a new management team is in place.
The investigation is one of the most high-profile SFO probes launched under Lisa Osofsky, a former FBI lawyer appointed director last August, who has come under fire for abandoning some of the agency's most prominent and lengthy probes.
The SFO dropped its investigations into aero engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and drugs maker GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) in February and ended a seven-year, Libor benchmark interest rate inquiry in February."
391,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 02:32PM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco Raises $25.6 Billion in World’s Biggest IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco raised $25.6 billion from the world’s biggest initial public offering, closing a deal that became synonymous with the kingdom’s controversial crown prince and his plans to reshape the oil-rich nation.
The state-owned oil giant set the final price of its shares at 32 riyals ($8.53), valuing the world’s most profitable company at $1.7 trillion. It received total bids of $119 billion.
For Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the sale could help restore credibility undermined by setbacks to his blueprint to overhaul the economy and a global reputation tarnished by the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the war in Yemen.
But the deal ended up being very different from what the prince had envisaged when he first floated the idea in 2016 with an ambition to raise as much as $100 billion. Aramco offered just 1.5% of its shares and opted for a local listing after global investors balked at its hopes of valuing the company at $2 trillion.
Instead, Aramco relied heavily on local investors and funds from neighboring Gulf Arab monarchies. In the offering for individuals, almost 5 million people applied for shares. The institutional tranche closed on Wednesday and attracted bids totaling 397 billion riyals.
The kingdom’s richest families, some of whom had members detained in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel during a so-called corruption crackdown in 2017, are expected to have made significant contributions. Global banks working on the deal were sidelined after Saudi Arabia decided to focus on selling the shares to local and regional investors.
Still, Aramco will become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company once it starts trading, overtaking  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The deal opens up one of the world’s most secretive companies, whose profits helped bankroll the kingdom and its ruling family for decades, to investors and Saudi individuals. Until this year, Aramco had never published financial statements or borrowed in international debt markets.
It will also mean the company now has shareholders other than the Saudi government for the first time since it was nationalized in the late 1970s.
Saudi Arabia had been pulling out all the stops to ensure the IPO is a success. It cut the tax rate for Aramco three times, promised the world’s largest dividend and offered bonus shares for retail investors who keep hold of the stock.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., acting as share stabilizing manager, has the right to exercise a so-called greenshoe option of 450 million shares. The purchase option can be executed in whole or in part at any time on or before 30 calendar days after the trading debut. It could raise the IPO proceeds to $29.4 billion.
Funds from the sale will be transferred to the Public Investment Fund, which has been making a number of bold investments, plowing $45 billion into SoftBank Corp.’s Vision Fund, taking a $3.5 billion stake in Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and planning a $500 billion futuristic city.
The sale is the first major disposal of state assets since Prince Mohammed launched a much-touted plan to reduce the economy’s addiction to oil revenue in 2016.
The last major government privatization, the 2014 IPO of National Commercial Bank, received $83 billion in subscriptions from investors."
392,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 02:32PM ET</span>",Stocks Edge Higher as Trade in Focus; Bonds Drop: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks edged higher as investors weighed the chances that the Trump administration will scrap a tariff hike on Chinese goods scheduled for Dec. 15. Treasuries and the dollar declined.
The S&P 500 Index rebounded early losses after President Donald Trump’s remarks that negotiations with China were “moving along well.” Treasury yields climbed after data showed U.S. jobless claims slumped to a seven-month low, signaling resilience in the labor market ahead of Friday’s jobs report. Oil got whipsawed as OPEC ministers gathered to discuss output cuts.
Investors watched for signs the two largest economies will reach a truce in a dispute that’s led to the biggest volley of tariffs since the 1930s. Chinese officials are in “close contact” with their American counterparts on negotiations, said Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng. U.S. trade with China extended its slide in October as goods imports from the nation fell to a three-year low, Commerce Department data showed Thursday
“It’s more of the same,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “We see a continuation of fairly choppy markets, but markets that are holding steady waiting for a resolution to the U.S.-China trade deal.”
Traders also awaited Friday’s U.S. jobs report, which may signal that both the labor market and consumers remain buoyant enough to sustain the expansion. That would validate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s view that rates can stay on hold following three cuts. But it could also reduce the urgency for a deal with China, given that escalating levies have so far failed to significantly dent employment.
Elsewhere, oil swung between gains and losses as OPEC reached an agreement that adjusts its official production targets, but removes few barrels from a market that’s forecast to return to surplus early next year.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 01:38PM ET</span>","U.S. vaping-related deaths rise to 48, cases of illness to 2,291","(Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Thursday reported one new case and one more death from a respiratory illness tied to vaping over a two-week period, taking the total death toll to 48.
As of Dec. 4, 2019, there were 2,291 hospitalized cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories. There are more deaths under investigation, health officials said.
Last month, U.S. officials reported the discovery of Vitamin E acetate — believed to be used as a cutting agent in illicit vaping products containing marijuana components — in all lung samples from 29 patients.
CDC has called Vitamin E acetate as a ""chemical of concern"" and recommended that the substance not be added to e-cigarette, or vaping products, while the investigation is underway. 
Investigators had earlier pointed to vaping oils containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, as being especially risky.
The spate of serious respiratory illnesses has led to U.S. officials urging people to stop vaping, especially those products containing THC.

395,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Etsy Falls as Morgan Stanley Downgrades Outlook,"Investing.com – Etsy fell on Thursday after Morgan Stanley downgraded its outlook on the company on worries that recently introduced sales-tax legislation in some U.S. states and a decision to cut advertising investment may hurt growth.
Morgan Stanley's Lauren Cassel downgraded its rating on Etsy to underweight from equal-weight and cut her price on target on the stock to $38 from $52. Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) fell about 3%.
Changes in sales-tax compliance laws – introduced at the start of October requiring marketplace facilitators like Etsy to collect and remit sales tax in more than a dozen states – have created a greater risk of cart abandonment and lower conversion, Cassel said.
The crafts marketplace may also see fourth-quarter growth come under pressure following its decision to cut investment in product-listing ads – a proven source of traffic to many Etsy shops - and focus on driving sellers to ramp up marketing spend.
The strategy has a longer payback period and may lead to slower growth, Morgan Stanley suggested.
These headwinds, however, are more than likely to offset the company's free-shipping program, which was rolled out in July this year.
“A shorter holiday calendar and algorithm changes are two other 4Q risks.”   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) said.
“While we like Etsy's business model and competitive moat it has established, we now anticipate slowing core GMS growth to result in negative top-line and EBITDA revisions, likely leading to additional multiple compression,” it added."

The company has been trying to cut costs after its profit plunged this fiscal year, hit by a stronger yen and falling sales in China and the United States. It was even forced to slash its forecast for operating income to an 11-year low.
""To optimize business performance and competitiveness, Nissan North America will implement two office closure days in the U.S. on January 2 and January 3, 2020,"" Nissan said in a statement. 
The closure, however, would not affect dealers including those of its Infiniti brand, the company said.  
Automotive News had earlier reported that Nissan was putting the entire U.S. organization on two days of unpaid furlough next month and cutting employee travel expenses by half, effective immediately, citing a memo to employees.
The closure will affect the company's headquarters in suburban Nashville and assembly plants in Smyrna and Decherd, Tennessee and Canton, Mississippi, the report said."

402,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 12:37PM ET</span>",United Airlines picks industry veteran Kirby for top job,"By Rachit Vats and Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) insider Scott Kirby will succeed Oscar Munoz as chief executive officer next year as part of a transition the airline hopes will secure a growth path after some tumultuous years.
Kirby was recruited as the airline's president from rival  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) in 2016 and has been groomed for the top job. He will take the helm in May, when Munoz will assume a one-year position as executive chairman.
The leadership change follows share price and earnings improvements for United thanks to an aggressive growth strategy implemented by Kirby last year, following a public outcry over a viral video showing a 69-year-old passenger being dragged off https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ual-passenger/united-airlines-reaches-settlement-with-passenger-dragged-from-plane-idUSKBN17T2WM a sold-out United flight in April 2017.
To improve United's image, Munoz implemented ""compassion"" training to employees and focused on building morale after years of strained labor relations, while Kirby overhauled the airline's hubs and built up its flight network.
""With United in a stronger position than ever, now is the right time to begin the process of passing the baton to a new leader,"" Munoz said in a statement. 
Kirby, 52, is known as one of the industry's most talented executives, though he does not have the reputation that Munoz built with front-line employees and the market has sometimes viewed his strategies as aggressive. 
""Thank you for taking a chance on me,"" Kirby said in a video message alongside Munoz. ""As we look forward to the next few years, we'll continue the growth."" 
Chicago-based United's shares, which have risen about 54% since Munoz took over as CEO, were down 0.5% at $87.74 at midday on Thursday.
Munoz, a longtime rail executive, suffered a heart attack shortly after taking the helm at United and received a transplant in January 2016. While recovering, he continued to take part in major decisions across the company and meetings with employees and shareholders.
Munoz replaced Jeff Smisek, who resigned because of probes into United's relationship with the Port Authority of New York.
As part of the transition, United's current Chairman, Jane Garvey, will retire from the Board in May 2020.
Kirby's ascension to the top job will end speculation about his possible return to American, which has been struggling with poor operation and earnings underperformance versus its peers. American's shares have fallen about 23% since Kirby left the company.

One of the sector's biggest challenges next year will be returning Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX jets to their networks after a prolonged grounding triggered by two fatal crashes on flights operated by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines. United had 14 MAX jets in its fleet at the time of the March grounding and dozens more on order.

The company said its popular Beyond Burgers will be sold in states including Texas, Florida and New York for $14.99 per eight-patty pack.
The retail market for plant-based meat is heating up as food makers flood grocery aisles with new products. Beyond Meat's main rival, Impossible Foods, recently began selling products in some stores. 
Retailers themselves are starting to enter the market - Kroger Co's (N:KR) private label brand Simple Truth recently began rolling out its own plant-based line, which includes burger patties.
The global plant-based market is expected to explode to an estimated $140 billion over the next decade, fueled by increasingly health-conscious consumers who want to cut down on eating meat and worry about the environmental impact of industrial animal farming.

This fall, Costco began stocking burgers made by vegan meat maker Don Lee Farms, a former Beyond Meat supplier. Some Costco stores also sell Swiss food giant Nestle's (S:NESN) Awesome Burger.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that discussions with China are going very well.
“If we do just muddle along and there aren’t the tariff increases on Dec. 15, we’ll probably see something of a stable stock-market environment,” Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd., told Bloomberg TV. Any negative trade news “could be the spoiler for what otherwise would be a fairly solid month for stocks,” she said.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 10:46AM ET</span>",Finland braces for fresh wave of strikes next week,"(Reuters) - Finland was set for a fresh round of strikes at some of its biggest companies from Monday after state mediators failed to negotiate a deal between industrial sector unions and employer organizations on wages and work conditions.
The Industrial Union, which organizes workers in the metals chemicals and wood products sectors, and two more unions have said that about 100,000 workers will begin a three-day strike on Monday, stalling production at companies including Nokian Tyres (HE:TYRES), oil refiner Neste (HE:NESTE) and stainless steel producer Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V).
The Confederation of Finnish Industries, Finland's biggest employers' association, estimates the strikes will cost the companies a combined 500 million euros ($551 million) in lost revenue and hit the wider economy to the tune of 200 million euros.
""Mediators have today met with the parties in the ongoing labor disputes, but there are still no grounds for finding solutions,"" the National Conciliator's Office said in a statement on Thursday.
The Finnish Forest Industries Federation has announced a six-day lockout from Dec. 12 unless the conflict is solved, closing half of the country's sawmills and plywood plants.
""No new meetings have been agreed,"" state mediator Vuokko Piekkala said in the statement. ""Mediation can resume only when the parties' stances change.""
Finland has suffered a number of large labor disputes lately, with last month's two-week strike at the state postal service leading to the resignation of the prime minister this week."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers on Thursday backed plans for greater powers to combat money laundering after a series of revelations about large amounts of dirty money flowing through European banks.
The EU last year experienced its largest money-laundering scandal when it emerged that 200 billion euros ($220 billion) in suspicious payments were made between 2007 and 2015 through Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) tiny Estonian branch.
Several other cases have emerged since then, the latest involving Malta's largest lender, Bank of Valletta, which the European Central Bank said had for years failed to address dirty-money risks.
In a joint statement, ministers called on the European Commission to explore the possibility of transferring supervisory powers to an EU body and to amend rules to strengthen coordination among national authorities.
Despite criminal organizations frequently laundering the proceeds of their illegal activities abroad, the fight against financial crime in the EU is currently mostly handled by national authorities, which do not always cooperate fully.
Ministers said an EU body ""with an independent structure and direct powers"" over banks should be considered, reversing opposition to such a move last year.
They also urged a fresh overhaul of EU rules to fight dirty money, only a year after the bloc adopted the fifth revision of its anti money-laundering rules. 
Last year's reform was watered down by conflicting interests among EU states, and quickly appeared insufficient as new scandals emerged.
Before the meeting, some of the EU's largest states, including Germany, France and Italy, said powers should be transferred to an EU authority because national watchdogs had proved incapable of tackling financial crime.
They went as far as saying there was a risk of some national supervisors ""being influenced directly or indirectly by supervised institutions or interest groups"".
Smaller states, such as Luxembourg, Malta, Cyprus and the Baltic countries, have been accused of lax controls which have allowed repeated cases of money laundering.
Most ministers supported the joint statement at a public session of their meeting on Thursday, but some, such as Luxembourg, did not join the discussion, leaving it unclear whether they would back the reform.
Malta's finance minister, Edward Scicluna, said he fully backed the overhaul. He faces a criminal probe over money laundering in which he denies wrongdoing. The Maltese government has also confirmed support for state-owned Bank of Valletta after its dirty-money shortfalls emerged last month.

Aston Martin, the drive of choice for fictional British secret agent James Bond, has seen its shares slump since its flotation in October 2018 as sales have failed to meet expectations.
Stroll, who is the father of Formula One driver Lance Stroll, is heading up a consortium looking to take a ""major shareholding"" in the British company, Autocar and the racefans.net website reported on Thursday.
Racefans.net said Racing Point could be rebranded as Aston Martin if Stroll succeeded in taking a controlling stake.
Aston Martin declined to comment and Racing Point said Stroll was unavailable for comment.
The carmaker's shares were up nearly 17% at 5.88 pounds ($7.54) at 1414 GMT, valuing the business at about 1.3 billion pounds, but still far below their initial public offering (IPO) price of 19 pounds.
As the car industry consolidates through deals such as the Peugeot-Fiat merger, Aston has said it does not need to belong to a bigger automotive group, pointing to the success of stand-alone rival  Ferrari  (MI:RACE).
But the sale of a stake could help boost the company's prospects as it seeks to turn around a poor performance, which pushed it to a 92.3 million pound ($118.4 million) loss in the first nine months of the year.
FORMULA ONE LINK-UP?
In August, Aston's biggest investor, Strategic European Investment Group, acquired an additional 3% stake in the company.
A month later, Aston raised $150 million in debt at 12% interest, hiking its borrowing costs, to bolster its balance sheet for the launch of its DBX sports utility vehicle next year, with the option for another $100 million.
The company's hopes rest on almost doubling sales with its first SUV, which enters production in 2020, particularly by attracting more female buyers to the brand.
Aston is also the title sponsor of the Honda-powered Red Bull team, former world champions who won three races this year with Dutch 22-year-old Max Verstappen.
Aston will be competing in the World Endurance Championship and the Le Mans 24 Hours with its Valkyrie hypercar from 2021.
Mercedes' parent  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) also has a small stake in Aston.
Stroll, a collector of vintage Ferraris, has been involved in Formula One and motor racing for years and also owns Canada's Mont Tremblant circuit in Quebec.
He made his money through investing in fashion brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors, but came to wider prominence in motor racing circles after bankrolling his son's career.
Lance Stroll, 21, moved to Racing Point from Williams (NYSE:WMB) this season after a consortium led by his father bought the Force India team, which was co-owned by financially troubled Indian magnate Vijay Mallya and had fallen into administration.
The Silverstone-based team, which uses Mercedes engines, finished seventh overall this season but is planning a factory expansion.

Glencore will cooperate with the probe conducted by the Serious Fraud Office, according to a statement. It didn’t provide any further details and a spokesman declined to comment. The shares plunged as much as 7.7% in London, the biggest intraday drop since June.
While Glencore is already under investigation in the U.S. for possible corruption and money-laundering, the announcement from the U.K. adds to the challenges that have scared investors and shaken the company.
“It’s more of the same, but now its getting attacked from a different angle,” said Hunter Hillcoat, a London-based analyst at Investec Securities Ltd. “Glencore was already trading at a discount because of the DoJ, but when this news comes out it gets whacked again.”
The scale of the investigations over the past year have also raised fundamental questions about how the business of commodities trading is conducted around the world.
Glencore has long relied on intermediaries, who work on commission. The agents network with well-connected business and government officials in developing nations with the goal of securing commodity-trading deals.
More investigations will also add pressure on Glencore’s billionaire Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg. He told investors earlier this week to prepare for more leadership changes and hinted that his own departure may come sooner than previously anticipated.
Glencore is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice and Brazilian authorities in the Car Wash scandal. The company has also been subpoenaed by the Justice Department for documents relating to possible corruption and money laundering in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is also investigating the company for possible corrupt practices.

(Reuters) - Luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co (N:TIF), which is being bought by Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH), missed market expectations for quarterly profit and sales on Thursday, hit by lower spending by foreign tourists in the United States and Hong Kong.
The jeweler has been struggling to lure price-conscious millennials who have been preferring lower-priced competitors including Denmark's  Pandora  A/S (CO:PNDORA) and Signet Jewelers (N:SIG).
Slowing growth in China, mainly due to its prolonged trade war with the United States and a stronger dollar, has also impacted sales for Tiffany, which relies on tourists from the world's second largest economy. 
Net sales in the Americas fell 4% in the third quarter. In the Asia-Pacific region, sales did not grow despite a double-digit growth in mainland China because of business disruptions in Hong Kong.
The company said lower spending by foreign tourists in Hong Kong, where sales plunged 49%, offset increased demand by locals. 
Overall same-store sales, excluding the effects of currency fluctuations, rose 1% in the quarter, but missed analysts' average estimate of a 1.44% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Tiffany has significant potential, but it is still coming short of unlocking it. We see the LVMH acquisition with favor,"" Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said.
French luxury goods maker LVMH has agreed to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion, a deal that could help the U.S. jeweler, whose dated collections has hit demand and forced it to launch more affordable pendants and earrings.
Tiffany's net earnings fell to $78.4 million, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Oct. 31, from $94.9 million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier. Wall Street had expected it to earn 85 cents per share.
Net sales were largely flat at $1.01 billion, while the average analyst estimate was $1.03 billion.

Shares of the company, which have risen about 66% this year, were down marginally at $133.55.

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM).and South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) said on Thursday they will invest $2.3 billion to set up an electric vehicle battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio, creating one of the world's largest battery facilities.
The plant, which will be built on a new location near the site of GM's closed assembly plant in Lordstown in northeast Ohio, will employ more than 1,100 people, the companies said. Construction is set to begin in mid-2020 and the plant will have an annual capacity of more than 30 gigawatt hours with the flexibility to expand.
The plant will build battery cells for ""a dedicated production stream of future EVs"" from GM, including a truck in fall 2021, the companies said.
""Combining our manufacturing expertise with LG Chem's leading battery-cell technology will help accelerate our pursuit of an all-electric future,"" GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a statement.
LG Chem previously said it would invest $916 million in its U.S. subsidiary by 2023 to set up the venture. An LG Chem spokesman confirmed an earlier Reuters report on the joint venture, but declined to give details.
Sources familiar with the plan said workers at the plant were expected to be represented by the United Auto Workers union and earn in the range of $15 to $17 an hour. 
A GM-LG plant could be the first unionized battery factory in the United States. Tesla's factory, and LG Chem's battery factory in Michigan do not have unions. 
Ohio has become a lightning rod in the 2020 presidential election after GM announced in November 2018 plans to close a car manufacturing plant in Lordstown, drawing condemnation from U.S. President Donald Trump.
The plant’s closure was one issue during a lengthy strike by GM workers.
GM said in September it planned to bring battery cell production to the Lordstown area, which it said would create about 1,000 manufacturing jobs.
Reuters first reported in July that LG Chem was considering its second U.S. factory with production slated to start in 2022. 

Last month, GM sold its shuttered Lordstown Assembly plant to a start-up company that plans to begin building electric pickup trucks by the end of 2020.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Thirty years after the Berlin Wall fell, private bank  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) is still fighting German government efforts to recover hundreds of millions in East German cash that vanished via Swiss accounts after the communist state collapsed.
Julius Baer said late on Wednesday it had set aside 153 million Swiss francs ($153 million) to fight the case, but vowed to appeal a Zurich court's ruling this week that withdrawals dating back nearly three decades that the German government contends were illegal, should be returned.
The money is part of a stash allegedly worth hundreds of millions of euros that an East German-registered company that handled import-export business with the West, Vienna-based Novum Handelsgesellschaft, helped funnel out of East Germany.
Julius Baer was swept up in the case because it bought Zurich-based Bank Cantrade from UBS in 2005, which the German government contends allowed unauthorized withdrawals from Novum accounts between 1989 and 1992.
""Julius Baer will claim for reimbursement (from UBS) of any finally awarded amount,"" Zurich-based Baer said in a statement. ""Julius Baer has always contested and continues contesting the claims.""
UBS (S:UBSG) declined to comment.
'RED FINE'
Baer is just the latest European money manager to be snared in this long-running post-Cold War dispute over communist cash, which Novum's ex-director, an Austrian communist named Rudolfine ""Red Fine"" Steindling who died in 2012, was accused of moving into Austrian Communist Party accounts that later went missing.
In 2013, UniCredit's Bank Austria took a profit hit after the German government demanded 254 million euros ($280 million) that Steindling was alleged to have moved via Novum accounts at a Swiss subsidiary. [https://reut.rs/389fZEg]
In the ongoing Swiss case, the Zurich Court of Appeals originally sided with Julius Baer in 2018, but reconsidered its verdict this year when the Swiss Federal Supreme Court sent it back to be reheard.
The Swiss high court concluded there were ""obvious shortcomings"" in Bank Cantrade's handling of the Novum funds.
The German agency seeking to recover the money, called the Federal Office for Reunification-related Special Tasks (BvS), could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Austrian Communist Party did not return an email and phone call seeking comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks gained amid trade war headlines on Thursday, while sterling rose to its highest in more than two years against the euro on hopes next week's UK election will lead to a smooth Brexit.
Belief a trade deal would be struck stemmed from a Bloomberg report on Wednesday that China and the U.S. were close to phase one of a deal and from U.S. President Donald Trump's remarks that talks were going ""very well"". Trump has said earlier a deal might have to wait until after U.S. elections in November 2020.
If no agreement is reached soon, the next important date is Dec. 15, when Washington is scheduled to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods.
""People are a bit exhausted of the pump and dump around the trade deal news flow,"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy, John Hardy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.4%, mainly driven by utilities, healthcare and real estate shares. France's CAC (FCHI) rose 0.7% while the trade-sensitive German blue-chip index (GDAXI) was little changed. 
Luxury stocks were in focus after a report that Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) held ""exploratory"" talks about a potential deal with Italy's Moncler (MI:MONC), though the latter said there were no concrete options on the table.
Futures were suggesting U.S. stock markets would open 0.3% higher, ready to extend the previous day's gains. 
POUNDS SHINES
While the dollar softened against most major currencies for a fifth straight session, sterling rallied to touch a seven-month high against the dollar and a two-and-a-half-year high against the euro, after extending recent gains on growing expectations next week's general election will not result in a hung parliament.
""With only a week to go until the UK election, the Tory party still hold a sizeable lead of around 10 percentage points over Labour,"" MUFG analysts told clients in a note. ""It has made market participants increasingly confident to price in a Tory majority and an end to the deadlock in parliament.""
By 1250 GMT, sterling was up 0.2% against the greenback at $1.3129  and flat against the euro at 84.49 pence.
""It is getting quite aggressive here and shows people are pricing in a very smooth Brexit, but that also enhances any shock if there is a hung parliament,"" said Saxo Bank's Hardy.
In contrast to the upbeat tones for sterling, British fund manager M&G Investments (L:MNG) suspended dealing in its flagship UK property fund, blaming Brexit uncertainty and weakness in retailing.
The yen  weakened, ceding some of the previous day's gains as positive signs about the trade dispute hurt demand for safe-haven currencies. In a bid to revive growth, Japan's cabinet approved a $122 billion fiscal package on Thursday to support stalling expansion in the world's third-largest economy amid offshore risks and as policymakers look to sustain activity beyond the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) stood at 1.7809%, clinging of the gains made the day before. Most European government yields nudged higher. [GVD/EUR]

On Wednesday, a source close to the matter said the Italian tax agency believed Fiat Chrysler (FCA) had underestimated the value of its U.S. business, after its phased acquisition of Chrysler by 5.1 billion euros.
""We strongly disagree with this preliminary report,"" an FCA spokesperson said on Thursday.
The tax audit comes at a delicate time for the carmaker which is finalizing talks with PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen, over a planned $50 billion merger to create the world's fourth-largest automaker.
A source close to PSA said the information was public and came as no surprise for the French carmaker.
The tax audit is ""another complication"" in the way of a binding merger agreement with PSA, but one but which FCA can manage, an analyst at Italian broker Equita said.
""We think it will be less relevant than the GM lawsuit, as negotiations with tax authorities are ongoing, which are expected to be closed by year-end and possibly leading to an accord on a much lower amount,"" Martino De Ambroggi said.
Last month rival General Motors (NYSE:GM) filed a racketeering lawsuit against FCA, alleging it bribed union officials in the U.S. over many years to corrupt the bargaining process. 
FCA has called the allegation ""groundless"".
The Italian tax authority audit, which concerns transactions dating back to 2014, could result in FCA having to pay back taxes for $1.5 billion, the source said.
""We are confident we will successfully make the case for a material reduction in the assessment,"" the FCA spokesperson said.
In its third-quarter report in October, FCA said Italy's inland revenue had issued the company with a final audit report in October this year.
It said the issuance of a final audit report starts a 60-day negotiation period, which ends with the issuance of a final audit assessment expected to be received by the end of December 2019.
If confirmed, the audit could result in a material proposed tax adjustment relating to the 2014 merger of Fiat into FCA NV, it said.
""Any remaining taxable gain assessed would be offset by carry forward tax losses with no material cash outflow or impact on earnings,"" the FCA spokesman said on Thursday.
FCA shares were down 0.64% by 1255 GMT, underperforming a 0.4% rise of Italian blue-chip index FTSE MIB (FTMIB).

420,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>","Dollar General lifts profit forecast, tops third-quarter expectations on sales","(Reuters) - Discount store operator  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG) raised its full-year profit forecast on Thursday after reporting its best quarterly same-store sales rise in nearly five years, benefiting from a wider selection of products and revamped stores.
Shares of the company rose about 5% in premarket trading as the retailer raised its adjusted profit for fiscal 2019 to the range of $6.55 to $6.65 per share from $6.45 to $6.60.
The retailer has been aggressively opening hundreds of new stores, creating private label and adding food, health and beauty products to its existing outlets as it tries to better compete with other retailers and grocers.
The efforts boosted same-store sales growth to 4.6% in the third quarter ended Nov. 1, above the average analyst estimate of 3.34% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company now expects full-year same-store sales to grow in the mid-to-high 3% range compared with the prior low-to-mid 3% range.
The upbeat forecast comes in contrast to rival  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR), which cut its full-year profit forecast last month, as the discount retailer fell short in its efforts to counter the impact of latest U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.
Dollar General's net sales rose 8.9% to $6.99 billion in the quarter, above the estimate of $6.92 billion.
Net income rose to $365.6 million, or $1.42 per share, from $334.1 million, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.38 per share."

MILAN (Reuters) - Dutch bank  ING Groep  NV's (AS:INGA) Italian business has reached a provisional deal with Milan prosecutors to settle a money-laundering investigation by paying 30 million euros ($33 million), two sources familiar with the matter said.
The proposed settlement, known as an ""agreed penalty"", has yet to be confirmed by a judge but it has already won the backing of the prosecutors, the sources said.
ING had no immediate comment.
Last year ING, the Netherlands' largest financial services provider, admitted criminals had been able to launder money through its accounts and agreed to pay 775 million euros to settle the case in its home country.
The Italian investigation was launched at the beginning of this year after Milan prosecutors received requests for assistance from several other European countries, and in particular from Germany, where hundreds of people had reported online scams, the sources added.
The alleged scams investigated by Milan prosecutors were carried out from 2016 to 2018 using various online accounts and the stolen money ended up in about 310 current accounts at ING in Milan, the sources said.
ING Italy was put under investigation for money laundering in March, alleging it lacked adequate control systems and failed to prevent money laundering transactions through its accounts.
Last March Bank of Italy, which had carried out its own inspection, told ING that it would not be allowed to take on new customers in Italy if it did not improve its monitoring of client behavior.

LONDON (Reuters) - Regulators made proposals on Thursday to strengthen the ability of banks and payment firms in Britain to recover from disruptions to services within set timeframes.
A parliamentary committee called for changes in October following a string of IT failures at banks, most recently one at TSB that left thousands of customers unable to make payments from their accounts.
The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority have proposed that banks and financial market infrastructure (FMIs) firms like Visa (NYSE:V) that make payments possible set ""impact tolerances"" for important services.
This would quantify the maximum level of disruption they would tolerate in terms of time, volume of business or number of customers affected.
A metric based on time alone may be insufficient, the regulators said, taking a more nuanced approach from an earlier discussion paper.
Firms will have to spell out what back up plans they have to stay within these tolerances.
Firms will set their own tolerances but should expect ""close supervisory scrutiny and engagement"", the regulators said.
""It is in the public interest that a resilient financial system is able to supply the most important services with minimal interruption even during severe operational events,"" FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said in a statement.
The regulators also issued papers on how operational resilience relates to services outsourced by financial firms, such as cloud computing, that can leave them vulnerable to disruptions.
Firms must be certain that important services can recover from a disruption within a set period even when they rely on outsourcing or third party providers for those services, the BoE said.
""Firms and FMIs should use impact tolerances as a planning tool and should assure themselves they are able to remain within them in severe but plausible scenarios,"" the BoE said."

426,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Kering-Moncler Report Propels Luxury Names,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- There’s merger speculation in the air among Europe’s luxury groups Thursday, with shares in Moncler (MI:MONC) – the Italian maker of high-end puffa jackets – rising nearly 10% after reports that it may be swallowed by Gucci-owner   Kering   (PA:PRTP).
Bloomberg reported late on Wednesday that  Kering  (PA:PRTP), which also owns brands such as Yves St Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Alexander McQueen, has held preliminary talks about a takeover. Neither company officially confirmed the talks.
The move would, to all intents and purposes, be  Kering  (PA:PRTP) patriarch Francois-Henri Pinault’s response to the recent move by his arch-rival Bernard Arnault on iconic U.S. jeweller   Tiffany & Co  . Arnault’s LVMH (PA:LVMH) agreed to buy Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) for $16.2 billion last month.
An approach for Moncler doesn’t quite have the same powerful strategic logic behind it: Tiffany will make LVMH the world leader in ‘hard luxury’, catapulting it above Swiss-based   Richemont   SA (SIX:CFR), while Moncler would simply add some extra heft in fashion, an area where  Kering  (PA:PRTP) is already strong. The combined annual revenues of Kering-Moncler, at some 18 billion euros, would still be less than one-third of a Tiffany-enhanced LVMH.
At a current price of nearly 11 billion euros ($1.22 billion) and a price-earrnings ratio of over 29, Moncler wouldn’t come cheap, but it is at least growing revenues at well over 10%, and its long-term future would arguably be more secure in a bigger stable such as  Kering  (PA:PRTP). 
Kering’s share price also rose 1.2% in Paris on Thursday on the news, while two other potential targets in the sector Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) and   Burberry   (LON:BRBY) were 6.9% and 3.6% higher, respectively.
Elsewhere, markets inched up again, extending their recovery from disappointing news on the trade front earlier in the week, although another batch of weak German factory orders ensured that the DAX underperformed, staying flat on the day. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 rose 0.3% to 404.28, while the luxury-heavy CAC 40 rose 0.5%."
427,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>",European stocks pause for breath after wild trade ping pong,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares steadied on Thursday after a red-hot rally, as mixed signals on a U.S.-China ""phase-one"" trade deal discouraged investors from making risky bets.
Stocks were on a roller coaster ride this week as investors found it difficult to demystify messages from U.S. President Donald Trump on the trade war.
The comments during his London visit for the NATO summit swung wildly with him saying talks with China were going ""very well"" at one meeting, while warning that the deal may come only after elections in November 2020 at another.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.1% by 0920 GMT, mainly driven by utilities, healthcare and real estate sectors as investors were seeking shelter under bond proxy names until clarity emerged on the trade deal.
German blue-chip index (GDAXI), home to major industrial exporters, fell 0.3%.
""Back to 2019 and we are living in a pre-December 15th world where one headline or tweet on trade has the ability to turn a good day into a bad one and visa-versa,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid said.
A further set of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods is set to take effect on Dec. 15.
Luxury stocks were the pick of the day after Bloomberg reported that Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) held ""exploratory"" talks about a potential deal with Italian luxury puffer coat maker Moncler (MI:MONC).
The news sent Moncler's shares up 11%, also boosting its local peers Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) and Tod's (MI:TOD) shares up 3%.
The rally in luxury stocks come as a relief after pulling back on Tuesday on Washington's threat with punitive duties of up to 100% on champagne, handbags and other French products imports from France."
428,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 04:42AM ET</span>",Stocks Edge Higher as Next Tariff Deadline Looms: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- European stocks edged higher with U.S. equity-index futures on Thursday after a mostly positive session in Asia as investors weighed the prospects of America removing a scheduled tariff hike on Chinese imports in 10 days. The dollar drifted lower.
Retail and utilities were among the leading sectors as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index edged up, although German shares dipped after the country’s factory orders unexpectedly fell. Contracts on the three main American equity gauges were also marginally firmer. Earlier in Asia most major stock benchmarks posted sold gains although shares in South Korea fell. An index of emerging-market equities climbed.
Treasuries held their losses from Wednesday, when a report indicated the U.S. and China were closer to a deal that would avoid the next round of tariffs. India’s government bonds tumbled after its central bank unexpectedly left interest rates unchanged. The pound rose for a fifth day against the greenback as expectations grow for a Conservative victory in next week’s election.
Investors are focused on whether a phase-one trade deal can come together in time to avert another scheduled hike in American duties on Chinese goods, a result that many say is priced into various asset classes. With fears of a global economic slowdown subsiding as the year draws to a close, concern has shifted to the prospect that political tension will infect progress on trade -- particularly U.S. support for Hong Kong protesters and Chinese Muslims.
“If we do just muddle along and there aren’t the tariff increases on Dec. 15, we’ll probably see something of a stable stock-market environment,” Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd., told Bloomberg TV. Any negative trade news “could be the spoiler for what otherwise would be a fairly solid month for stocks,” she said.
Elsewhere, iron and steel stocks led gains in Japan after a government stimulus package was announced at 26 trillion yen ($239 billion), slightly larger than expected, to support growth. Oil futures nudged lower but largely preserved this week’s rally after Energy Information Administration data showed U.S. crude inventories fell more than expected.
Here are some key events coming up this week:
Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering is scheduled to be priced on Thursday, with Riyadh looking to raise more than $25 billion.Friday brings the U.S. jobs report, where estimates are for non-farm payrolls to rise by 190,000 in November.These are the main moves in markets:

NEW YORK (Reuters) - At a glance, a near-record accumulation of speculative bets on market tranquility looks like it couldn't have come at a worse time. 
Elevated net short positions in Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures are reminiscent of a similar spike in 2017, when prolonged calm in U.S. stocks prompted a rush into short-volatility exchange-traded products. That episode ended with billions of dollars in losses in early 2018 when a surge in volatility caught investors unprepared.
But Wall Street might not be so vulnerable this time around as investors have built up defensive positions in S&P 500 Index (SPX) options and VIX-linked exchange-traded products. 
""The market isn't complacent,"" said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia. ""We have seen shifts over this past month where investors have become more defensive.""
That defense looks timely as back-and-forth headlines on the status of a U.S.-China trade deal have jolted stocks this week.
The one-month moving average for the put-to-call ratio of open contracts on the S&P 500 is at 2.2, well above its level ahead of previous sell-offs, data from options analytics firm Trade Alert show. A higher ratio reflects greater demand for puts, which are often used to hedge against a decline in shares.

Based on net short positions in VIX futures, investors may not seem very cautious. But while money poured into short-volatility ETFs in 2017, this time around, money is flowing into ETPs that gain from higher volatility.
As assets in long-volatility funds grow, their issuers must load up on VIX futures, which are being supplied by speculators seeking to generate income in a yield-starved environment, said Maneesh Deshpande, head of U.S. equity strategy and global equity derivatives strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
For a graphic on Specs' short VIX futures close to a record high, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9519/9431/Pasted%20Image.jpg
Assets under management for one of the largest long-volatility VIX-linked exchange-traded products, the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (O:TVIX), hit a record high of $1.42 billion in early August and have remained close to those levels. As of Tuesday, the ETN had assets of $1.09 billion, according to YCharts.
""The long-volatility investor is in the driver's seat,"" Deshpande said.
For a graphic on Growing interest in downside protection, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9515/9427/Pasted%20Image.jpg
The VIX itself also reflects expectations for future stock gyrations well in excess of movements in recent weeks.
The index has risen past 14. By contrast, the S&P 500's 1-month historical volatility, a measure of how much stocks have moved over the last month, sits at just 7.3, according to data from Refinitiv.
That difference ""is at one of the highest levels we've seen in years,"" said Glenmede's Gilbert.

Packaging group DS Smith (LON:SMDS) said its profit before tax rose 31% to 213 million pounds in the first half of the year ending in April, driven by the rise of online shopping and market share gains in fast-moving consumer goods.
Spread-better IG Group (LON:IGG) said it expects net revenue in the first half of its fiscal year to have been flat at 250 million pounds ($328 million), which translates into a modest underlying gain given that the comparable period included a period of two months before new European regulations hit its core spread=betting business.
Revenue from core markets fell an estimated 6% due to the same factors.
On a brighter note, IG said it served 4% more clients on average. IT also said revenue from “businesses identified as significant opportunities” rose 43% to 40 million pounds, helped by “promising” uptake for its new turbo24 service in Europe, which has attracted 700 clients in less than two months since launching.
Revenue rose 4% to 3.19 billion pounds and CEO Miles Roberts said he expects volume growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, given that its greenfield box plant in Indiana is now operational.
Return on sales rose 110 basis points to 11%, its highest ever. The group raised its interim dividend 4% to 5.4p, on adjusted earnings per share of 17.4p
DS Smith also said it expects the disposal of its plastics business to complete around the year-end, generating net proceeds of 400 million pounds.
Retailer   Dunelm Group   (LON:DNLM) said it expects full-year profit to top its previous expectations, after completing an overhaul of its website without any major disruptions.
The retailer, which has over 100 stores, said it hopes to use the new site to accelerate online offerings,

435,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 01:26AM ET</span>",Indian government's loan bonanza seen a temporary salve and a long-term pain,"By Nupur Anand and Manoj Kumar
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Deen Dyal, who runs a tea stall on the outskirts of New Delhi, was beaming when he walked out of a community hall where  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) was disbursing loans as part of government efforts to get credit flowing back into the economy.
A 50,000 rupees ($700) loan he applied for a year ago to expand his range of snacks had finally been approved.
Reviving a practice not used in three decades, India's government in September ordered state-run banks to hold more than 400 loan ""melas"" or fairs across the country over the following month - a measure aimed at boosting economic growth at six-year lows and lending growth at its weakest in three years.
Dyal, 32, said PNB previously refused him a loan despite repeated requests. But once the government announced the melas, he'd been inundated with calls from bank officials to grab an approval letter there.
""I had to lose half a day of wages to come to the mela, though the loan could have been given at the bank branch itself,"" he said.
The Finance Ministry said the melas ""disbursed"" loans worth about 2,500 billion rupees ($35 billion) in October, with some private and shadow banks joining 18 state-run lenders. Several bankers told Reuters, however, the figure also included loans that been approved before the fairs.
It represents a record for monthly lending and a huge jump over the $12 billion in overall Indian bank loans given in September.
But bankers and analysts worry the October result is but an artificial and temporary spike in lending, and that normal due diligence standards were abandoned which will come back to bite a sector already saddled with $140 billion in stressed debt.
""Not much paper work was done in sanctioning the loans,"" said one banker involved in organizing a mela in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh.
The banker, who was not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified, said the usual checks on income tax returns or to verify property ownership were dropped and instead limited to bank account statements and repayment history.
Pressure to lend felt intense, bankers said.
At the launch of the fairs, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman declared: ""For every new customer given a loan, there will be five more coming in their wake.""
""Somebody who has never taken loan from the bank should be brought in and given a loan,"" she added.
IF HISTORY IS ANY INDICATION
Banking and policy experts said government lending schemes had a track record of skimping on due diligence, leading to higher-than-normal levels of bad loans.
""Banks usually lower their guards on the risk profiling of borrowers and we have seen this earlier as well in government related schemes,"" said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at India's National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.
In the 1980s, when loan melas were established to boost rural consumer spending, the rules were so lax that a phone number was viewed as proof of residency and income, and was sufficient to get a loan, said an executive director at a public sector bank, requesting anonymity.
During that era, bad loans increased and bank profitability took a hit. Return on assets - a key performance gauge - slid to 0.15% in 1990 from 0.56% in 1980, according to a central bank report which cited the melas as a contributing factor.
More recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship lending scheme for small businesses has seen bad debt surge in the past year, according to online media publication The Wire.
Non-performing loans for Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, which was set up in 2015, jumped 126% in the past financial year to 164.81 billion rupees ($2.3 billion), the report said, citing data gained from a ""right to information"" filing.
The Finance Ministry did not respond to request for comment about MUDRA loans.
India's huge bad debt problems have long choked the banking system's ability to generate fresh lending - a problem that has worsened this year with the shadow banking industry reining in loans after the collapse of lender IL&FS.
While that may have helped prompt the government's call for loan melas, for many experts it is only a step backwards.
""With lot of difficulty the central bank has been trying to resolve this whole bad loan problem and why do we want to bring it back even if it comes at the cost of some additional economic activity,"" said Amol Agarwal, an assistant professor at Ahmedabad University's Amrut Mody School of Management. "
436,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 01:01AM ET</span>","Ex-JPMorgan banker began Australia regulator contact two years before Citi, Deutsche cartel charges","By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) began internal discussions that would lead to immunity from prosecution over a troubled Australian capital raising two years before two rivals were charged with criminal cartel behaviour, a court heard on Thursday.
A former JPMorgan banker gave the timeline as the first witness to testify in a legal battle that is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it may change the way they are permitted to conduct capital raising.
JPMorgan,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) worked on a A$2.5 billion ($1.70 billion) stock issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) (AX:ANZ) in August 2015. 
All but JPMorgan were charged last year with withholding details of the sale process to investors. Prosecutors accuse the three banks of forming a cartel to restrict the supply of ANZ shares and maintain their price after the banks were unable to sell them all to regular investors, court documents showed.
JPMorgan was given immunity on condition that it cooperate with authorities, the court previously heard.
The defendants' lawyers want to question prosecution witnesses to determine how and when they came to give signed statements, and who was involved.
""I received a call from my boss in Hong Kong, Nicholas Johnson, telling me to be (available) in mid-March 2016,"" JPMorgan's former head of equity capital markets, Richard Galvin, told a packed court room in Sydney on Thursday.
At a meeting a few days later with company lawyers in Sydney, ""they mentioned there was a matter that had come up around the ANZ capital raising,"" Galvin said.
In June 2016, Galvin said he received a ""letter of comfort"" from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), assuring him immunity if he co-operated with their investigation into the capital raising.
The next month, he met ACCC investigators during which they began to draft a statement about his recollection of the raising, Galvin told the court.
Two years later, in June 2018, the ACCC brought criminal charges against Citi, Deutsche and ANZ.
The banks and their executives have yet to enter formal pleas but have said they will defend the case.
ANZ, Citi, Deutsche and JPMorgan have declined to comment on the matter outside of court hearings.
The pre-trial hearing continued on Thursday.

China’s largest technology company by sales said it has filed a lawsuit with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the American agency’s decision to bar the use of federal subsidies by rural carriers purchasing its equipment. Huawei complained it wasn’t accorded due process and was unfairly labeled a national security threat.
The lawsuit is the latest attempt by Huawei to fight American sanctions and curbs that threaten the world’s largest networking business. Huawei, which the White House accuses of aiding Beijing in espionage, is stepping up a worldwide legal and publicity campaign to protest what it deems unfair treatment by the U.S. and its allies. It’s turned increasingly to courts to fight a plethora of issues from alleged defamation to American network restrictions.
“The U.S. is great because it embraces openness, inclusiveness and the rule of law,” Chief Legal Officer Song Liuping told reporters at a briefing in Shenzhen on Thursday. “If it abuses its power, the ultimate loser may be itself.”
FCC representatives weren’t immediately available for comment outside of normal business hours.

Huawei has initiated a number of high-profile legal actions to defend its business and reputation overseas. In March, the company brought the U.S. government to court in Texas, arguing a provision in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act that barred it from certain networks violated the U.S. Constitution. It also filed defamation claims in Paris last month over claims made on TV about its alleged ties with the Chinese government, something the company has repeatedly denied. Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei chief financial officer who faces potential extradition to the U.S. for alleged fraud, has also sued the Canadian authorities for wrongful detention.
Even as Huawei fights to safeguard its reputation abroad, it may be facing a public backlash back home. This week, news that it had reported an employee to police who was subsequently detained for 251 days -- then released without charges -- sparked a social media furor against the company’s infamously demanding work environment. Local media reported the longtime employee had sought severance pay upon dismissal over unspecified reasons, but was then detained on extortion charges. “We are obligated to report to the authorities if we find any suspicious or unlawful acts,” Song said Thursday, saying he had nothing more to add.
The backlash stood in stark contrast to the consistent support Huawei has enjoyed at home since it ended up in Washington’s cross-hairs. Huawei is considered a central facet of sensitive U.S.-Chinese negotiations intended to defuse trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The Trump administration however has said issues related to the company won’t be included in any potential deal and is a separate process.
The FCC’s move comprises one aspect of a broader campaign to contain a Chinese national champion Washington views with suspicion. In May, the White House placed Huawei on a blacklist that prohibited the sale of American software and circuitry. It’s so far defied those curbs -- reporting hyper-growth in quarterly sales and smartphone shipments -- but expects Washington’s ban to erase $10 billion in 2019 revenue. That’s down from the $30 billion Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei, previously feared.
The U.S. market itself has shrunk in importance in past years for Huawei. The country’s biggest telecom carriers, including AT&T Inc. and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ)., barely buy any of its gear and dropped plans to sell Huawei phones last year under pressure from the U.S. government. Huawei still maintains business ties with a number of small American carriers serving rural areas.

Named the ""Tencent Nintendo Switch (Official Mainland China version)”, the console will sell for $298 along with a copy of New Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. It will also come with a one-year warranty.
In April, Tencent won the approval to distribute Nintendo Switch video game in China. Nintendo’s share price was supported by the expectations for launching the console in the world’s largest games market.
Analysts said the launch of the console would be an interesting test in a market dominated by smartphone gaming.
Tencent was hammered by a crackdown by the Chinese government on gaming last year. The government cited youth gaming addiction and other concerns as the reason for the move, leading to a nine-month freeze in game license approvals.
On Thursday, Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700)'s shares traded 0.27% higher at HK$329.50, while Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974)’s shares were down 0.57% to trade at JPY 43,600."

Most markets in Asia gained during morning trading on Thursday but the gains were modest compared to several days of losses. The risk-on mood was fueled by news, first reported by Bloomberg, that negotiators may be closers to an agreement on tariff relief measures that would be part of a phase one deal between the US and China and that such a deal could even happen before additional US tariffs on Chinese goods kick in on Dec. 15. 
On Wednesday, a day after saying he has no deadline for a deal and would not be opposed to waiting until after the elections in November 2020, US President Donald Trump said discussions are going very well. 
The Dow 30 ended the Wednesday session in the US up 0.53% and the S&P 500 gained 0.63% while the Nasdaq climbed 0.54%. 
In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng opened up and gained 0.53% to 26,169 by 8:50 PM ET (01:50 GMT) making back some ground after days of heavy losses. 
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.40% to 2,889 while the SZSE Component was up 0.29% at 9714.

One of the world’s largest solar-panel manufacturers sees booming growth in the U.S. even if President Donald Trump doesn’t lower tariffs next year.
China’s JinkoSolar Holding Co. Chief Financial Officer Charlie Cao expects U.S. demand for its products to surge nearly 45%, to 4 gigawatts, in 2020 as the Trump administration considers whether to move ahead with a scheduled 5% cut to duties on imported panels.
“It’s not going to have any change,” Cao said in an interview Wednesday at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. “This small change will not have a fundamental impact. A 50% change, that would be a disaster.”
The leading U.S. solar trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, warned Tuesday that the White House may curtail the scheduled reduction in tariffs, imposed by Trump in 2018 to spur U.S. manufacturing.
While they’ve prompted a handful of panel makers -- including JinkoSolar -- to open U.S. factories, the duties have driven up costs for developers and panel installers who employ most of the industry’s workers. If left in place, the duties will cost the industry $19 billion in investment and will lead to 62,000 fewer jobs by 2021, the solar association said in a report Tuesday.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro called the group’s report “fake news dressed up in academic mumbo jumbo.”
Even after opening its factory in Florida, JinkoSolar still makes about 90% of the panels it sells to U.S. developers in Asia. The company has gained 28% since Nov. 19, when it provided a bullish forecast for U.S. and global sales next year.

Treasury yields stabilized after gains.
Shares opened higher in Sydney, Tokyo and Seoul, while equity futures in Hong Kong were higher after the S&P 500 Index climbed overnight. News that negotiators are nearing an agreement on the amount of tariff relief in a phase-one U.S.-China accord helped risk assets after concerns earlier in the week when President Donald Trump downplayed the urgency of a deal. New Zealand’s dollar edged up after the country’s largest lenders were told to increase capital buffers.
The U.S. expects a deal with China to be completed before the next tranche of American tariffs are due to kick in on Dec. 15, according to people familiar with the talks. Trump said Wednesday discussions with China are going very well.
“If we do just muddle along and there aren’t the tariff increases on December 15 we’ll probably see something of a stable stock-market environment,” Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd., told Bloomberg TV.

(Reuters) -  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit as it signed on larger companies to its workplace communication platform, sending its shares up nearly 3% in trading after the bell.
The company competes directly with Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) workplace messaging platform, Teams, which grew more than 50% to roughly 20 million daily active users in the September quarter.
In the latest quarter ended Oct. 31, Slack grew by about 20% to more than 12 million daily active users.
""It may take some time for Slack to shake off the 'Microsoft overhang', but this is a step in the right direction to dispute that narrative with investors,"" said Rishi Jaluria from research firm DA Davidson & Co.
The company has seen strong adoption and benefits from allowing users to use other apps like Salesforce and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive without leaving the platform, he added.
Slack added more than 105,000 paid users during the quarter.
It went public in June opting for a direct listing, instead of an initial public offering, at an offering price of $26 per share. Its shares soared nearly 50% on debut, taking its valuation past $23 billion.
The company forecast fourth-quarter loss between 6 cents and 7 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 6 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
It forecast current-quarter revenue between $172 million and $174 million, compared with analysts' estimates of 172.9 million.
Slack's revenue jumped nearly 60% to $168.7 million in the third quarter ended Oct.31, above analysts' average estimates of $156.0 million, according to IBES data by Refinitiv.
The company's total operating expenses soared 68.4% to $142.9 million during the quarter.
However, net loss attributable to common stockholders widened to $89.2 million from $47.7 million a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company reported a loss of 2 cents per share, compared with analysts' estimates of a loss of 8 cents per share."
445,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 06:14PM ET</span>",UAW union leaders recommend approval of Fiat Chrysler labor deal,"DETROIT (Reuters) - United Auto Workers leaders from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's U.S. plants on Wednesday recommended approval of a tentative labor agreement that would allow the Italian-American automaker to avoid a strike as it works to merge with France's Groupe PSA.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen, in October announced a planned $50 billion merger to create the world's fourth-largest automaker.
The tentative four-year agreement with FCA, reached last week, must now be ratified by the 47,200 UAW members at the company, with voting set to begin Friday. The deal follows contracts the UAW already concluded with larger rivals General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
FCA declined to comment on Wednesday. 
The UAW previously said the contract included a commitment by the automaker to invest $9 billion, creating 7,900 new jobs over the course of the contract. Of the $9 billion, $4.5 billion was announced earlier this year, to be invested in five plants and creating 6,500 jobs.
The investments include $2.8 billion at Warren Truck Assembly plant to build a new a plug-in hybrid SUV in 2021 and a potential increase of 1,500 jobs.
FCA will also invest $160 million at its Toledo plant to build a new plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler next year, and $3 billion at its Jefferson Assembly plant in Detroit to a build a plug-in hybrid Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2021 among other new vehicles.
While the deals with GM and Ford were approved, ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at FCA in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract. In addition, a federal corruption probe related to embezzlement at the union could also raise doubts among union members about the deal's terms.
UAW members must complete voting by Dec. 11.
The federal corruption probe led GM to file a racketeering lawsuit against FCA, alleging its rival bribed union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. FCA has brushed off the lawsuit as groundless.
The deal with GM followed a 40-day strike in the United States that virtually shuttered GM's North American operations and cost the automaker $3 billion.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 06:08PM ET</span>","Elon Musk, at defamation trial, says he wrote 'pedo guy' tweet 'off the cuff'","By Nichola Groom and Rachel Parsons
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Elon Musk, wrapping up two days of testimony at his defamation trial on Wednesday, insisted his ""pedo guy"" Twitter message at the heart of the case was an ""off-the-cuff"" insult hurriedly written in anger and not meant to be taken literally.
The chief executive of electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and founder of rocket company SpaceX also acknowledged in a packed Los Angeles federal courtroom his net worth, mostly from stock holdings in those two companies, was about $20 billion.
“Sometimes people think I have a lot of cash. I actually don’t,” he said.
Musk, 48, the first witness to testify at his trial, also apologized again from the stand to the plaintiff, Vernon Unsworth, the British cave explorer and diver who is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages in the case.
After leading a successful rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand in July 2018, Unsworth in a CNN interview mocked Musk's offer of a mini-submersible as a public relations stunt, and said Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurts."" 
Musk testified he took to Twitter two days later to lash back at Unsworth because he found Unsworth's comments ""extremely rude and contemptuous."" 
""This was very much an off-the-cuff response,"" Musk said.
'IT'S AN INSULT' 
Asked whether he was accusing Unsworth of the crime of pedophilia by referring to him as ""pedo guy"" in a series of tweets, Musk said, ""absolutely not.""
""It's an insult, like saying mother-effer doesn't actually mean someone having sex with their mother,"" he said, using a sanitized version of a more vulgar expression.
Musk's ""pedo guy"" tweet is one of three tweets that Unsworth has said defamed him and harmed his reputation. In one of the others, Musk wrote: ""Bet ya a signed dollar it's true,"" in response to a Twitter follower asking whether he was really suggesting that Unsworth was a pedophile.
On the witness stand on Wednesday, Musk downplayed that tweet, saying: ""It's obviously a low-stakes wager.""
U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson has said the case hinges on whether a reasonable person would take Musk's tweets to mean that he was calling Unsworth a pedophile.
To win the defamation case, Unsworth needs to show that Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified him and caused him harm. ""Actual malice"" by Musk does not need to be proven because the judge deemed Unsworth a private individual, not a public figure.
Although the case does not involve Tesla, Musk's Twitter habits have long been under close scrutiny, with the company's investors and regulators expressing concerns about his tweets.
With 29.9 million followers, Musk's social media account is a major source of publicity for the Palo Alto, California-based Tesla, which does not advertise.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>",Italy tax authorities say Fiat underestimated value of Chrysler by $5.6 billion,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian tax authorities believe that  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) underestimated the value of its U.S. business by 5.1 billion euros ($5.6 billion) following Fiat's phased acquisition of Chrysler, according to a company filing and a source close to the matter.
The audit, which concerns transactions dating back to 2014, could result in FCA having to pay back taxes for $1.5 billion, the source added, confirming a report by Bloomberg.
FCA said in its third-quarter report that the tax authorities had issued to the company a final audit report in October this year ""which, if confirmed in the final audit assessment, could result in a material proposed tax adjustment related to the October 12, 2014 merger of Fiat SpA into FCA NV.""
It said the issuance of a final audit report starts a 60-day negotiation period, which ends with the issuance of a final audit assessment expected to be received by the end of December 2019.
""The company believes that its tax position with respect to the merger is fully supported by both the facts and applicable tax law and will vigorously defend its position,"" it said in the third-quarter report.
A spokesman for Italy's tax agency declined to comment.
""At this time, we cannot predict whether any settlement may be reached or if no settlement is reached, the outcome of any litigation. As such, we are unable to reliably evaluate the likelihood that a loss will be incurred or estimate a range of possible loss,"" Fiat said.
News of the tax probe comes at a delicate time for Fiat Chrysler, which is finalizing talks with PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen, over a planned $50 billion merger to create the world's fourth-largest automaker."
449,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>",Gold miners flash the cash in biggest deal binge in a decade,"By Jeff Lewis and Zandi Shabalala
TORONTO/LONDON (Reuters) - Gold miners look set to extend a deal spree after notching transactions worth a record $30.5 billion this year, according to data, the biggest M&A binge since bullion prices peaked nearly a decade ago.
Led by top producers Newmont Goldcorp Corp and Barrick Gold Corp, miners are bulking up to replace dwindling reserves and win back investors who in recent years shunned the sector because of disappointing returns.
This year has seen 348 deals worth more than $30.5 billion, including net debt, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
That is up from $10.8 billion last year and surpasses a previous high of $25.7 billion set in 2010, the data show. Gold topped $1,900 per ounce in 2011 and currently trades around $1,484, after hitting a six-year high in September.
The 2011 gold boom prompted buyers to overspend on acquisitions, leading to billions in impairments when prices crashed in subsequent years. This time, investors say acquirers are being more cautious.
""The reality of the market is that nobody is able to go and pay the lofty premiums that we have seen in prior cycles because their own shareholders won't sanction it,"" said Rob Crayfourd, fund manager for CQS Natural Resources Growth.
The premiums linked to recent gold transactions are far below those paid in the previous price boom, when 40% to 50% premiums were not uncommon.
Gold investor group Paulson in September urged the smaller gold miners to seek nil-premium mergers to eliminate duplication and lower costs.
Barrick paid no premium when it bought Africa's Randgold (LON:RRS) last year while Newmont offered an 18% premium when it snapped up Goldcorp to create the world's largest gold miner.
More deals are likely among mid-tier miners, who face pressure from activist investors to lower costs and financing constraints, said Peter Grosskopf, CEO of precious metals-focused fund manager Sprott Inc..
In a flurry of deals this week, Canada's Endeavour Mining Corp made a $1.9 billion all-stock takeover proposal for Africa-focused Centamin Plc.
A day earlier, China's Zijin Mining Group Co Ltd struck a deal to buy Continental Gold Inc for $1.3 billion in cash.
In November, Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. bid C$4.3 billion for Detour Gold while Australia's Saracen Mineral Holdings Ltd. snapped up Barrick's stake in Super Pit gold mine in Australia.
""That pendulum just started swinging and it's got a lot further to go,"" Grosskopf said, referring to more deals.
Pretium Resources Inc, Pure Gold Mining Inc, Roxgold Inc and Silvercrest Metals Inc are among possible targets, according to industry sources.
Canadian miner Iamgold Corp has drawn interest from state-backed China Gold International Resources Corp Ltd.
Gold miners have also boosted returns to shareholders, with Barrick, Kirkland Lake Gold and Yamana Gold hiking payouts on the back of revenues boosted by higher gold prices."

1. Dollar General, Kroger to Issue Results
Retail leads the way with the earnings reports ahead of the bell tomorrow, from the biggest of discounters to the swankiest of brands.
Dollar General (NYSE:DG) will report fiscal third-quarter earnings, with expectations for a profit of $1.38 per share on sales of about $6.9 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Comparable sales are forecast to rise 3.2% for the period, up from a rise of 2.8% in same quarter a year ago, according to Briefing.com.
The shares are off 1.2% this year, in part because of the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports.
Supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) will issues numbers as well. Analysts are predicting a profit of 49 cents per share on sales of $28.15 billion. A year ago, Kroger earned 48 cents on sales of $27.7 billion.
  Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) upgraded the stock last month to hold from sell, saying it expects digital initiatives to gain traction. The shares are up 0.5% this year.
Luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) will also report earnings tomorrow, but there will be little stock movement after the its deal to be acquired by LVMH for $135 per share, or about $16.2 billion.
2. Job Cuts, Claims Arrive Ahead of Payrolls
A couple more employment indicators arrive before the big U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

The S&P 500 rose 0.63%, with the Dow Jones industrials  up 0.53%. The Nasdaq Composite and the Nasdaq 100 indices were up 0.54% and 0.51%, respectively.
The rally trimmed the losses the market had sustained in the last three sessions. But the major averages remained roughly 1.5% below their record highs reached just last week.
Energy shares were the strongest sector of the market. Crude oil was the catalyst on reports OPEC and its allies may agree to deeper production cuts to boost global prices. In addition, the Energy Information Administration's weekly report on crude oil inventories showed a steeper decline than expected.
West Texas Intermediate rose 4.2% to $58.43. Brent crude, the global benchmark, had its biggest percentage gain since September, rising 3.6% to $63.
  Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) were among the energy sector leaders.
At the same time, higher oil prices pushed airline stocks lower. Fuel costs are among the carriers' biggest expenses.
Meanwhile, financial, industrial and health care stocks also helped the market. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was a leader of the Dow, along with 3M (NYSE:MMM) and health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH).
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was off about 0.9% after United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) chose to buy 50 Airbus 321 jets to replace its aging fleet of Boeing 757s. United shares were off 0.8%, however. 
Travel company   Expedia   (NASDAQ:EXPE) shares jumped 6.2% after the company's chief executive and chief financial officer resigned after clashing with Chairman Barry Diller and the company's board over the company's strategy and vision.
 
Financial stocks were helped by rising interest rates. The 10-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.772% from Tuesday's 1.709%. Gold  fell back.
With 18 trading days left in 2019, the S&P 500 is up 24.2%, with the Dow up 18.5% and the Nasdaq Composite up 29.1%, likely their best annual gains since 2013.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 04:18PM ET</span>","Exclusive: As Citgo profit rises, pressure to restore dividend grows - sources","By Marianna Parraga
(Reuters) - Citgo Petroleum Corp's directors are unlikely to bow to pressure this week to resume dividend payments, two sources close to the discussions said, as the refiner cannot yet help Venezuela's interim government ease creditors' claims against its parent PDVSA that also are threatening its assets.
Citgo has long been the prized possession of state oil company PDVSA, as one of the largest U.S. refiners with a network of more than 5,000 gas stations. But the company broke away from its parent earlier this year in the wake of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, naming new management with backing from the country's opposition leader, Juan Guaido.
Some PDVSA creditors expect Citgo, which is set to report strong third-quarter profit on Thursday, to help pay off PDVSA debts.
If the Venezuelan Congress and the U.S Treasury were to give approval to use Citgo's dividends to pay PDVSA's debt, which range from arbitration claims to defaulted bonds, the Guaido-supported team could gain a negotiating tool in talks with creditors asking U.S. courts to seize Citgo's assets.
But directors who meet this week are likely to call for reinvesting profits, the people said, citing years of underinvestment under a board led by socialist President Nicolas Maduro. The unusual battle reflects Citgo's place as the South American nation's foreign crown jewel.
Restricting other uses of its profit are Citgo's debt covenants and a decree that requires the Venezuelan Congress to approve any use of Citgo repatriated profit. The refining subsidiary, which is Venezuela's largest foreign asset, once contributed over $1 billion a year in dividends to its parent.
""Citgo will not be a source of money for Guaido's government for at least two years,"" said a person close to his team after reviewing the company's debt covenants and earnings forecasts.
Debt covenants, which limit the refiner's ability to declare or pay dividends until the company's debt-to-equity ratio improves, are the main obstacles to transfer at least a portion of Citgo's net income for covering PDVSA bond payments, the people said.
Citgo is expected to disclose strong profit in the third quarter on top of earnings in the second quarter of $122 million, its first profit after U.S. sanctions deprived it of PDVSA's oil. Those measures drove the Houston-based refiner into the red in the first quarter as executives scrambled to replace crude once imported from Venezuela.
Internal audits and work done by the previous administration also will be discussed by Citgo and its parent's directors, the people said, amid criticism in Venezuela over corruption accusations involving companies linked both to Maduro's government and some opposition figures.
A Citgo spokeswoman declined to comment other than to say investors would be informed of third-quarter results on Thursday.
Another person familiar with its results said this year's profit is not high, but the company's increased liquidity ""is helping a lot.""
U.S. sanctions gave Guaido's team an opportunity to take control of Citgo, which he did by appointing a new board loyal to his interim government in February. The Venezuelan Congress also created an ad-hoc board over PDVSA, which operates outside of Venezuela and will meet in Houston this week.
PDVSA's ad-hoc board is tangled in a lawsuit in a U.S. court over $1.68 billion in outstanding debt due holders of PDVSA's 2020 bond, which fell into default earlier this year. Bondholders and other Venezuela creditors are seeking to collect by staking claims on Citgo's assets and shares.
Citgo was used as a piggy bank for over a decade to finance late President Hugo Chavez's government, Maduro's rule and PDVSA's budget. The refiner supported pet PDVSA projects, its shares used as collateral on loans and millions of dollars a year transferred to PDVSA as dividends.
In the past, Citgo executives who argued that more of its profit should be reinvested were criticized or dismissed by the government.
""PDVSA was sucking the money out,"" said a former executive under the Maduro-led board. ""Their idea was to keep everything running, but there was not a tremendous amount of capital going back"" into Citgo's operations."
453,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 04:10PM ET</span>",Former UAW official pleads guilty to accepting kickbacks,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Former United Auto Workers vice president Joseph Ashton pleaded guilty on Wednesday to conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud as part of a wide-ranging federal corruption probe into the union.
Ashton, a former General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) board member, was charged last month with conspiring with other union officials to receive ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and kickbacks"" according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit.
Ashton, when asked by the judge whether he was pleading guilty because he was guilty, responded ""Yes, your honor."" He declined to comment after the brief hearing.
""Sometimes you just find that good people just make really bad decisions,"" Ashton's attorney, Jerome Ballarotto, told reporters.
""He has asked me to apologize to all the members of the UAW,"" Ballarotto said of Ashton.
Under the plea agreement, Ashton faces prison time of 30 to 37 months, although his attorney said they will seek a lower sentence. Ashton, who left the GM board in December 2017 amid the federal investigation, also has agreed to forfeit the $250,000 in kickbacks he received. 
Ashton will be sentenced on March 3. The deal did not include any language about cooperation in other cases related to the federal corruption probe. 
The FBI has been conducting an investigation into illegal payoffs to UAW officials by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). Eleven people have pleaded guilty in connection with the probe. 
The widening probe raises questions about whether the U.S. government might seek to take over the UAW. 
In addition, the federal probe led GM last month to file a racketeering lawsuit against FCA, accusing its rival of bribing UAW officials to gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. FCA, which is working on a planned merger with France's PSA, brushed off the suit as meritless. 
Federal prosecutors said Ashton and other UAW officials steered an inflated $4 million contract to a vendor to provide 58,000 watches to UAW members. The watches were never distributed and remain in storage in Detroit.
Last month, former UAW president Gary Jones, who has been linked to the federal probe, resigned his position and subsequently left the union.
The UAW said on Wednesday Ashton's crimes ""demonstrate his self-interest, and signify his lack of respect for the oath he took."" 

GM reiterated on Wednesday it was not aware of Ashton's illegal activity until it was revealed by the government's probe. “The criminal conduct Joe Ashton admitted to is outrageous,"" the company said in a statement.

Following an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department that began about 10 years ago, 46 companies agreed to pay a total of nearly $3 billion in fines while pleading guilty to price-fixing and bid-rigging in the auto parts industry.
More than 22 million cars are registered in California, the most of any U.S. state.
The largest California settlement is with Japan's Denso Corp (T:6902) for $4.25 million, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.
Denso said on Wednesday it ""has instituted extensive group-wide efforts to ensure we are in total compliance with applicable antitrust laws."" The company added it is ""committed to taking any action necessary to ensure Denso remains in complete accordance with applicable antitrust laws.""
In 2013, the Justice Department said international price fixing conspiracies affected more than $5 billion in automobile parts used in U.S. vehicles; in total, more than 25 million cars purchased by American consumers were affected.
Denso pleaded guilty to price-fixing in 2012 and agreed to pay a $78 million fine to settle a Justice Department probe. A total of 32 auto parts executives also pleaded guilty, including several Denso executives.
Law enforcement authorities in the United States and elsewhere have brought price-fixing cases related to seat belts, radiators, windshield wipers, air-conditioning systems, power window motors and power steering components among other parts.
A separate settlement has been reached for up to $1.2 billion covering auto purchasers who sued saying the price fixing and bid rigging had caused millions of consumers and businesses from around the country to pay more for some new or leased vehicles and replacement parts.
Other California settlements include nearly $1 million for Toyoda Gosei Co (T:7282) signed last month.

457,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 03:16PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court skeptical of Intel in retirement fund dispute,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared skeptical of Intel Corp's (O:INTC) bid to avoid a lawsuit accusing it of violating federal law in making employee retirement plan investments that cost beneficiaries hundreds of millions of dollars.
The justices heard an hour of arguments in Intel's appeal of a lower court ruling reviving the proposed class action lawsuit that a judge decided in 2017 had been filed too late.
The case is significant for companies because it could expand the time that many plan beneficiaries have to bring lawsuits, which could lead to higher damages.
Conservative and liberal justices alike seemed to sympathize with the former Intel employee who filed suit in 2015 claiming he did not have ""actual knowledge"" of the alleged investment problems because he did not read the relevant documents that were only posted online.
""Most people don't read them, or many,"" conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. ""So how do you have actual knowledge if you haven't read it?""
""I must say, I don't read all the mailings that I get about my investments,"" echoed liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
At issue is the time period for alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a federal law requiring plan managers to invest prudently.
Beneficiaries generally have six years to sue over ill-advised investment decisions. That deadline is cut to three years if a problem is known sooner.
The lawsuit, filed by former Intel engineer Christopher Sulyma, accused company retirement plans and administrators of breaching their fiduciary duty to the participants by placing an overly heavy emphasis on hedge funds and private equity, in contrast to peer funds.
Sulyma, backed by President Donald Trump's administration in the case, said that while employed at Intel between 2010 and 2012 he was unaware of the alternative investments in the online documents, that they performed poorly or even what hedge funds were.
California-based Intel said the lawsuit should be thrown out because the fund participants knew of the issue more than three years before the lawsuit was filed based on emails the company had sent with links to documents about the investments.
The investments were chosen to better diversify the plans' portfolios, the company said.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year let the case proceed, ruling that the three-year deadline applied only if Sulyma was actually aware of the facts of a violation, not merely that those facts were available."

The plane and train maker has previously said it expects to deliver 15 to 20 Global 7500s in 2019 but will need to make the lion's share of those deliveries during the last three months of the year, leaving little room for error in execution.
Investors and analysts are closely watching deliveries of the Global 7500 business jet, which lists for $73 million and is a key revenue driver for Bombardier.
Bombardier's strategy of shifting manpower from its Global 5500 and 6500 business jets to the Global 7500 is working and will help the planemaker make guidance by year's end, Chief Operating Officer Paul Sislian said.
""The strategy is that we have highly skilled people on both our product lines,"" Sislian told Reuters on the sidelines of an event at a Bombardier plant near Toronto.
""What we’re trying to do is leverage the people from one product to the other so we hit our targets for all of them.""
Bombardier said in October it had already delivered five of the jets and would need to deliver another 10 to 15 during the last quarter of 2019.
Sislian said workers on Bombardier's Global 5500 and 6500 jets are being trained on the 7500 so the workforce can be shifted around as needed to meet deadlines on the different programs.
Montreal-based Bombardier is in the middle of a broader restructuring, shedding underperforming commercial plane programs to focus on its more profitable business jet and rail units."

Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) shares were down nearly 6.5% after starting the day higher. The stock fell 9.1% on Tuesday over the ad that some viewers claim is sexist. Critics have asked that the ad, which depicts a woman recording a video diary of an exercise bike her partner gave her, be taken down.


“We constantly hear from our members how their lives have been meaningfully and positively impacted after purchasing or being gifted a Peloton Bike or Tread, often in ways that surprise them,” a company spokesperson told CNBC by email. “Our holiday spot was created to celebrate that fitness and wellness journey.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Latin American lender CAF and the United Nations are seeking to provide financing to the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to improve electricity supply in the crisis-stricken nation that is suffering chronic blackouts, the two institutions told Reuters.
Lawmakers in Venezuela's congress have proposed a financing mechanism under which CAF would provide $350 million to make improvements to the ailing power sector, with the U.N. Development Program carrying out the investments.
But the proposal has created a deep divide within the country's opposition between those who say the proposal will provide humanitarian assistance and those who oppose it because it will provide new funding for Maduro's government - which is widely accused of corruption and mismanagement.
""The project is a CAF loan to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela which is requested by the Ministry of Finance and has to be approved by the National Assembly,"" a U.N. official wrote in an emailed response to questions from Reuters.
CAF in an emailed response to questions confirmed that the loan will go to Venezuela's government.
No funds would be transferred to state electrical authorities, the U.N. official said, and the financing mechanism has a system of checks and balances ""to ensure that the resources are only used for this purpose.""
Though the amount is relatively small, its approval could pave the way for Maduro to receive additional international financing down the road. That could eventually undercut the effects of U.S. sanctions, which block American citizens from lending money to Maduro as part of an effort to push him from power.
Draft legislation for the proposal does not describe the financial conditions of the loan, which are usually provided to the legislature before such financing is approved.
Venezuela's information ministry, which fields questions on behalf of the finance ministry, did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Chronic blackouts around the country have undermined the functioning of everything from routine commerce to hospital emergency rooms. Especially hard hit has been the western state of Zulia, where citizens routinely go 12 hours without power.
""Zulia, #withoutpower and distressed, is demanding solutions,"" wrote opposition politician Manuel Rosales on Twitter. ""It hasn't been days or months but years of electrical chaos that have disrupted the lives of the people of Zulia.""
Electricity sector expert Miguel Lara warned that legislators who voted for the project would be adding to the country's debt burden by providing funds to the government
""It does not make technical or economic sense,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""All resources given to the current (state power company) Corpoelec are lost. They are the crisis.""
The legislature on Tuesday postponed discussion of the proposal until next week in order to seek out more support among lawmakers. Opposition legislators opposed to the measure declined to comment, saying they prefer to wait for it to come up for a vote.
Critics have for years denounced widespread corruption in the ruling Socialist Party's management of the power sector.
Those complaints focused on a 2010 declaration of an ""electrical emergency"" that led to the disbursement of billions of dollars in no-bid contracts for generation projects that were never completed. Critics call it one of the largest embezzlement schemes in the country's history.
Maduro's government denies misuse of funds and blames power problems on sabotage by the opposition.
It was not immediately evident if or how U.S. sanctions would apply to the proposal in question.
The U.S. Treasury did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment."
465,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 01:49PM ET</span>",The FAANGs of Europe: U.S. tariffs won't harm appeal of French luxury firms,"By Elizabeth Howcroft and Joice Alves
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - The U.S. threat of tariffs on French goods from handbags to Champagne proved just a glancing blow to giants like LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) this week, as investors refused to give up their decade-long love affair with luxury goods.
The European luxury conglomerates are the leading lights of continental exchanges, just like digital behemoths Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netlix and Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (FAANGs) are the vanguard of Wall Street stock indices and portfolios.
Equity analysts reckon the appeal of companies such as Hermes (PA:HRMS), whose Birkin handbags sell for $10,000-plus and often have waiting lists, will be undimmed despite attempts to hit their exports as retaliation for European taxation of U.S. digital companies.
With a price tag of over 200 billion euros ($220 billion), Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior owner LVMH is the biggest stock by market capitalization on the Paris exchange and is worth twice as much as pan-European planemaker Airbus which is also at the center of the transatlantic trade war.
Last year, LVMH, which just spent over $16 billion snapping up U.S. jeweler Tiffany (N:TIF), generated 24% of its revenue in the U.S., but only about 6% of its operating profit would be exposed to tariffs on France, said Aneta Wynimko, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International.
""For me, these tariffs are manageable"", said Claudia Panseri, an equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. 
""When I look into the total amount of sales generated by luxury goods in France I think the impact will be small"". 
LVMH's rival Kering, owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, has a smaller market capitalization of 68 billion euros, but that still makes it bigger than Paris-based  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), which is the euro zone's biggest bank.
Kering and LVMH have seen their shares multiply over 6 times within 10 years, while the pan-European Euro STOXX has risen by two thirds.
In a nutshell, French luxury groups are to European equities what the FAANGs are to Wall Street. 
(Graphic: Luxury stock valuations link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/15/2047/2047/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
Valuations for both groups make them expensive stocks. LVMH's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is around 24, well above the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index's 14.7. 
""It's deservedly, like the FAANG stocks, on a high price earnings multiple,"" said Jonathan Bell, chief investment officer at Stanhope Capital who says he has LVMH on his ""buy list"". 
The U.S. threat to hit France with up to 100% tariffs on $2.4 billion of U.S. imports of products, including cosmetics and porcelain, did knock a few percentage points off share prices, but for Bell, the impact is likely to be temporary.
""In the long run I think most of the owners of LVMH are people that (are) a bit like Warren Buffet in Coca Cola, they buy it and own it for the long term.""
The revenues of LVMH and Kering are much more aligned to the growing appetite for luxury brands from a new generation of Chinese shoppers rather than U.S. shoppers and Fidelity's Wynimko said high pricing power protects luxury brands.
""If someone has been waiting for the Birkin handbag for, I don't know, three years, and now the bag is available and it costs $500 more I doubt they are going to say 'no, I'm not going to buy it because of the tariffs',"" said Fidelity's Wynimko. 
LVMH, Kering and Hermes declined to comment for this story.

Luxury goods makers and beauty firms are increasingly shifting sales online, but many are also sprucing up stores and trying to turn them into day-trip worthy destinations to lure shoppers who are turning away from malls and other centers.
Lancome, one of the biggest brands of French cosmetics' group L'Oreal, already sells its creams and make-up though airport retailers, department stores and other networks, including 50 freestanding stores in China.
It is launching a 300 square meter flagship store on Paris' Champs Elysee avenue, a major tourist magnet. The concept, which includes video gimmicks on interactive walls, mirrors similar moves by other fashion or sporting brands, Lancome CEO Francoise Lehmann said.
A second flagship store is planned for Beijing in 2020. Lehmann declined to give financial details.
Groups like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) are also spending on jazzed-up retail ventures - the French conglomerate is about to relaunch a major department store on the banks of the Seine river - even as some historic peers like Barneys in New York struggle and are having to slim down.
Pricier luxury cosmetics have proved a sweet spot for beauty firms like L'Oreal and U.S. rival  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) in recent quarters, driven by thriving demand from Chinese consumers and despite competition from start-up make-up brands.
""Young Chinese women are drawn very early on to skincare products,"" Lehmann said, adding that even among 20 to 35 year-olds, rejuvenating treatments were particularly popular."

470,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 12:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi Aramco pursues war cover after attacks - sources,"By Carolyn Cohn, Stephen Kalin and Marwa Rashad
LONDON/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is looking to buy insurance against war and terror attacks after a damaging drone and missile attack on some of its oil facilities in September, two sources told Reuters.
Aramco, the world's largest oil company, has been looking for cover from insurers including those based at Lloyd's of London and elsewhere in the London market, they added.
The firm is seeking cover for facilities in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, its oil heartland, where it suffered the September attacks, one of the sources said.
Aramco said in the prospectus of this month's planned listing that it did not insure against all risks and its cover may not protect it from terrorism or acts of war.
At the launch of the IPO, which could be the world's biggest and raise up to $25.6 billion, Aramco said that it did not expect the Sept. 14 attack to have a material impact on its finances and operations. 
Aramco declined to comment.
Available insurance options range from cover against a terror attack or sabotage through to full coverage, which includes war or civil war, along with compensation for the cost of business interruption.
An initial loss estimate from the strikes on Aramco's plants was 2 billion riyals ($533 million), a third source said.
Aramco insures much of its property itself through a so-called captive insurer, Bermuda-based Stellar Insurance.
Although one of the sources said Aramco also has an ""excess of loss"" cover with international insurers for any property damage above $200 million, this does not cover war or terror attacks, or revenue losses due to business interruption.
Aramco, which said in October it had fully restored oil output after the September attacks on its facilities, did have war cover around five years ago, the source added.
'WAKING UP'
Companies have become nervous about attacks on their property in Saudi Arabia, the world’s top crude exporter, after the strikes which temporarily shut down 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Aramco's output, more than 5% of global oil supply.
As well as Aramco, a Saudi petrochemical company is also looking for terror and war insurance in Eastern Province where the attacks took place, a fourth source said.
""We have received more enquiries,"" said Scott Bolton, director, crisis management at insurance broker Aon (N:AON), adding that both domestic and international companies were checking whether they were covered for such attacks. Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) (SE:2010), which Aramco agreed to buy in a $69.1 billion deal this year, already has war insurance, one of the sources said.
SABIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said in its 2018 annual report that it ""kept a close eye on emerging geopolitical interruption risks"" and had added cyber insurance to its global insurance program. 
Riyadh and Washington have blamed the September strikes on Iran, which denies involvement. The United States has sent troops to Saudi Arabia, which it says is aimed at deterring further attacks amid heightened regional tensions.
The cost of war and terror policies in Saudi Arabia has risen by ""multiples"" since the attacks, one of the sources said without giving more detail on pricing. Another added that companies in the region were ""waking up"" to the idea.
Aramco's captive insurer, Stellar, offers energy onshore and offshore property, general liability and associated business interruption cover, insurance ratings agency AM Best said. 
AM Best confirmed Stellar's financial strength rating of A (excellent) with a stable outlook in October, adding that the insurer had indicated its property program had ""no exposure"" to the strikes.
The captive has a ""diversified panel of financially strong reinsurers"", AM Best said.

Global reinsurers Hannover Re (DE:HNRGn), Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) and  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH), which help insurers cover large risks, declined to comment, while Aon (N:AON) said it did not have ""visibility"" into whether Aramco was seeking insurance.

The advertisement, called ""The Gift That Gives Back"", shows a woman receiving a Peloton bike as a gift from her husband following which she records her workouts over a year and shares them with him through a video blog.
The company spokeswoman said on Wednesday it was disappointed how some people had misinterpreted the commercial, which also had other positive feedback on a campaign that was meant to celebrate fitness.
The 30-second ad sparked a storm on Twitter, with several users pegging it as sexist. Some said the husband was ""controlling"" and ""manipulative"" as buying his wife an exercise bike suggested that the she needed to lose weight.
Comedian and writer Jess Dweck compared the advertisement, which has been viewed more than 2 million times on YouTube, with an episode of Netflix's dystopian anthology series ""Black Mirror"".
""This was just a clueless mistake that social media is going to rip you apart over,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of Patriarch Organization, a Los Angeles-based private-equity firm. 
""I don't think it's going to create an avalanche of negative implications to revenues."" 
Refinitiv's Eikon Social Media Monitor showed sentiment toward Peloton turned negative on Tuesday, having been firmly positive in the past couple of months.
Founded in 2012, Peloton sells indoor exercise bicycles and offers packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home. Its flagship product is a stationary bike priced at over $2,200.
The company's stock has risen 16% since its initial public offering in September as investors bet on the growing popularity of its bicycles that offer on-demand workout programs.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - WeWork China has set out ambitious revenue goals for 2020 even though it faces staff cutbacks and weak occupancy numbers at its properties across China, sources familiar with the matter said, citing targets announced by the division's general manager at an internal meeting in Shanghai on Wednesday.
Alan Ai told employees at the meeting that the firm has set a goal to bring in non-core revenue of around $30 million in the year 2020 and for non-core revenue to account for more than 6% of its total takings in the country, the sources said. 
That would represent a significant increase in the revenue generated from technology services and other products for tenants and shows one of the ways the office-leasing company hopes to turn around its business.
The China division's global parent, WeWork, declined to comment.
WeWork is undergoing a broad restructuring after it was thrown a $9.5 billion lifeline by Japanese technology conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) following a failed public offering and the ouster of founder Adam Neumann.
The company last month said it would lay off around 2,400 employees globally, almost 20% of its workforce, to cut costs.
WeWork owns 59% of WeWork China, whose other investors include Softbank, Hony Capital and Trustbridge, according to the group's prospectus for its initial public offering.  
The China division has been a sore spot for the company, burdened with low occupancy rates and intense competition from local players. In 2018, WeWork China generated $99.5 million in revenue, according to WeWork's IPO prospectus.
The revenue targets for the China division disclosed at the staff meeting suggest that the company could be looking to achieve as much as $500 million in revenue from China next year, should non-core revenue account for a 6% share, according to Reuters calculations.
Ai did not discuss at the meeting how the company planned to achieve its non-core revenue targets, one source said. 
The company currently rents out office space in 120 buildings in 10 cities across China, according to its website. In addition to major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, it also has facilities in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Wuhan, and other smaller markets. 
Occupancy rates for China were ""around 60%"" at the end of September, according to internal company data seen by Reuters. Smaller cities, classified as ""new markets"", had an average occupancy rate of 43%, while some cities like Wuhan and Xi’an had occupancy rates around 25%.
Ai also said during the meeting that layoffs were over in China and next year would be better, one source said. Ai did not disclose how the cuts had affected its Chinese staff, but sources have estimated that at least 100 people had left internal company messaging groups in the past two weeks. 
The non-core revenue target also marks a move to tilt revenues away from rents and towards technology and other services. As of the middle of this year, non-core revenue, which consists of ""technology"" and ""business services,” as well as paid events and WeWork Go, accounted for less than 1% of the total revenue of WeWork China, according to one separate source. 

WeWork Go offers a pay-as-you-go service for individuals who want to use WeWork office space without paying monthly fees.

Bellew resigned as Ryanair Chief Operations Officer in July and the Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, has asked the Irish High Court to delay his departure to arch-rival easyJet (L:EZJ), saying he is subject to a 12-month non-compete clause.
Former Malaysia Airlines boss Bellew denies he is subject to the clause and plans to start working with the British airline at the start of next year.
O'Leary was in court to give evidence for a second day. On Tuesday he had made a series of accusations against Bellew, accusing him of lying and of failing to perform, citing ""repeated complaints"" from employees working under him about slow decisions or no decision making.
""If I am hiring Sergio Aguero, I expect him to score goals, I don't expect to have to show him which side of the goal to shoot at,"" O'Leary told the court, comparing Bellew to the Manchester City soccer club striker.
Queried about a number of successes in parts of the company that Bellew was responsible for, O'Leary said they were despite rather than because of his performance, although he admitted telling Bellew in March 2018 that he had made ""a significant and positive impact"" during his first four months in the role.
Bellew returned to Ryanair in December 2017, where he had been director of flight operations before leaving for Malaysia Airlines in 2014.
Bellew's lawyer, John Rogers, said that O'Leary had told his operations chief that he was ""too nice for Ryanair"" and he accused the long-serving Ryanair boss of turning the case into an attack on his client.
The court was read a letter sent by Bellew to O'Leary after he announced his move to easyJet in which he accused his boss of bullying him in trying to force him to accept the 12-month non-compete clause.
Asked by Bellew's lawyer if this was the case, O'Leary replied: ""This isn't bullying, it is just factual.""
O'Leary said he had made significant efforts to entice Bellew to stay and had been ""stunned and deeply disappointed"" when he announced the move to easyJet.
A lawyer for Ryanair told the court during the first day of the case on Tuesday that Bellew possessed information of immense competitive value that the airline could not allow to be passed to its rival, including details of delays to the delivery of Boeing's (N:BA) grounded 737 MAX aircraft."

""That Bloomberg comment seems to suggest that the two nations can have a political disagreement about what is going on in certain areas on one hand, but that won't necessarily affect how they move forward in terms of the trade negotiations,"" said Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spreadex in London.

SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's poor start to December has some investors bracing for a choppy end-of-year as fears about the U.S.-China trade war resurface. 
The S&P 500 (SPX) suffered its third successive decline on Tuesday, and is down almost 2% since closing at a record high last Wednesday. The latest selling came after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a trade agreement with China might not happen before the U.S. presidential election in November 2020.[L8N28D4ZM]
U.S. stock index futures staged a partial recovery early on Wednesday, following a report that the United States and China were moving closer to signing a 'phase-one' trade deal.
At 7:04 a.m. ET, S&P 500 e-minis  were up 11.25 points, or 0.36%.
The overall uncertainty about the ultimate fate of a trade deal has led Wall Street investors to take to the equity options market to hedge against a downturn.
Investors are particularly sensitive about potential end-of-year weakness after the final month of 2018 was the worst December on Wall Street since the Great Depression.
""The narrative on trade has quickly been turned upside down as negative headlines on tariffs have ignited a risk averse tone in the markets,"" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management, wrote in an email, referring to the bumpy start to the week.
The constant barrage of trade-related headlines - some positive, others negative - has left traders on edge.
""How can one tease reality out of the trade headlines when what we read could simply be leverage-seeking from each side?""  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) analysts Bill O'Donnell and Ed Acton said in a note on Wednesday. 
Wall Street has been shaken at times this year by trade-related tweets and comments by Trump, but the market overall has extended its decade-long rally, helped by low interest rates.

Investment strategists recently polled by Reuters on average expected U.S. stocks to rise in 2020 at a modest pace, helped by low interest rates, stable global growth and a better-than-expected recovery in U.S. earnings.
Positioning in stock options appears to be cautious, however, particularly for those contracts expiring soon after December 15, when new U.S. tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese imports are set to kick in, including on cell phones, laptop computers and toys.

It is not unusual to see a bias toward defensive options in broad index options. However, the overall put-to-call ratio of S&P 500 options is near the most defensive it has been in at least five years, according to Trade Alert data.    
Defensive positioning into the year-end appears to stem from a combination of worries about a trade deal not coming to fruition and from investors protecting gains after Wall Street's strong performance this year, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin.

""When you are up 25% year-to-date, you would almost be a fool to not put on some sort of downside hedge or do something to protect yourself, especially with this critical date coming up (Dec 15),"" Frederick said.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks recovered on Wednesday from their losses the day before, when U.S. President Donald Trump surprised world markets by saying a trade deal with China could wait until after the 2020 presidential election in November.
Morning gains became a rally when Bloomberg, citing unidentified sources, said the United States and China were in fact moving closer to agreeing on the amount of tariffs that would be rolled back in phase one of a trade deal.
While Trump had dashed hoped for a preliminary agreement and triggered a sell-off in stocks on Wall Street and in Asia, the Bloomberg report caused a brutal swing that took traders by surprise.
""There are playing with the nerves of investors,"" said Mikael Jacoby, a senior equity sales trader at Oddo Securities, adding there was a sense of fatigue and frustration watching markets swing on the basis of headlines and tweets.
""One day they will guide positively, another negatively"", Jacoby said, noting that markets could be expected to continue their up and down moves until a trade agreement is reached.
Fresh U.S. tariffs on Argentina and Brazil, plus a threat to impose duties on French goods, are fuelling fears that risks are tilting toward an escalation of the crisis. 
The pan-European equity index STOXX 600 (STOXX), which had slumped 2.2% since the beginning of the month, was up 1%. Futures markets were signaling a Wall Street opening in positive territory. 
Before the Bloomberg report, European trading showed little reaction when data indicated euro zone business activity stayed near stall speed last month. Manufacturing continued to drag on the dominant services industry. 
Euro zone government bond yields yo-yoed in early trading, but speculation on a possible U.S./China agreement pushed 10-year German Bund yields up 1 basis point to -0.337% (DE10YT=RR). 
Yields across the euro area followed suit, rising by 1 to 2 bps. In the United States, the 10-year Treasury yield jumped by 1.75%, then fell back to about 1.74%. 
TOO COMPLACENT? 
The latest trade war scare ended a rally that had lifted the S&P 500 since early October, when top diplomats from China and the United States met and outlined an initial agreement that Trump said he hoped could be sealed within weeks.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that if no substantial progress was made soon, another round of duties on Chinese imports, including cell phones, laptops and toys, would take effect on Dec. 15.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill proposing a stronger response to a crackdown on Muslims in western China, drawing swift condemnation from Beijing on Wednesday, to add another layer of tension. Beijing's handling of unrest in Hong Kong has also drawn criticism from Washington. 
""The market was too complacent, thinking both superpowers would be able to compartmentalize these issues away from the broader trade narrative,"" Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist at AxiTrader, said in a note. 
In currency markets, the euro retreated against the dollar to 1.1068 (EUR=). The Japanese yen  and Swiss franc , seen as safe havens, were down 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The wife of the chairman of conglomerate SK Group filed for divorce on Wednesday, court records showed, and has demanded more than $1 billion worth of shares in the company as part of her settlement, media reports said.
Roh Soh-yeong, SK Group chair Chey Tae-won's wife, wants SK Holdings shares worth 1.4 trillion won ($1.19 billion) that are held by Chey, local media, including Yonhap News Agency, said, citing unnamed sources.
Chey, 59, is the second-generation head of South Korea's third biggest conglomerate. The company's businesses include memory chip maker SK Hynix and SK Innovation that has the country's top oil refiner and makes electric vehicle batteries.
He is the biggest shareholder of SK Holdings with 18.4%.
If Chey were to transfer the shares reportedly claimed by his wife, he would still be the biggest shareholder in the holding company.
Their marriage in 1988 attracted a lot of attention in South Korea as Chey was being groomed to lead the conglomerate and Roh was the daughter of South Korean president at that time Roh Tae-woo.
But in 2015, Chey sent a 3-page letter to a local newspaper, publicly confessing that he had extramarital affairs.
Two years later, Chey sought a divorce settlement mediated by a court but the two failed to reach an agreement, according to the Seoul Family Court database.
Last year, a divorce trial began with Chey as a plaintiff and Roh as a defendant. Roh filed a counterclaim against Chey on Wednesday, the Seoul Family Court records show.
""I think it is time to let my husband go and let him find happiness he has desperately desired,"" Roh wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Wednesday, but did not mention her countersuit.

China's Foreign Ministry, however, issued a statement again insisting upon ""equality"" in any phase-1 deal - the term Beijing has used as shorthand for wanting all U.S. tariffs revoked as part of the agreement. Trump said on Tuesday that the phase-1 deal cannot be ""equal"".
The news came just one day after President Donald Trump said that there was no deadline for a trade deal for China and that it may be after next year’s election. 
Nasdaq 100 rose 52 points or 0.6% by 6:43 AM ET (11:43 GMT), while Dow futures jumped 143 points or 0.5% and S&P 500 Futures gained 14 points or 0.5%.

Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was up 0.3%, but was held back slightly after the Seoul High Court upheld a $873 million fine from South Korea’s antitrust regulator for abuse of its dominant position in the mobile phone market. 
Peloton Interactive(NASDAQ:PTON) was on watch after it fell 10% on Tuesday over a holiday ad that some viewers claim is sexist. Critics have asked that the ad, which depicts a woman recording a video diary of an exercise bike her partner gave her, be taken down.

The Federal Court ruled that Switzerland's biggest bank must hand over historical data on more than 40,000 client accounts to French tax authorities in a landmark case keenly watched by other countries seeking similar information.
The ruling was also closely watched for the impact it might have on the Swiss bank's separate 4.5 billion euro ($5 billion) legal battle with France in a criminal case over alleged tax avoidance by UBS clients.
Revenue-hungry governments, for years thwarted by Switzerland's strict secrecy rules, are monitoring developments to see if they can use historical evidence of their citizens' trying to hide money from tax authorities.
In its written ruling released on Wednesday, the court said it would not help ""fishing expeditions"" by foreign tax authorities seeking potential evidence of wrongdoing by groups of citizens.
Tax authorities must give a detailed description of the group involved and specific circumstances that led to the request; explain the applicable law and reasons to assume that taxpayers did not fulfill their obligations; and demonstrate that the information requested could help make them do so.
The court reinforced its stance that the client data UBS is providing French tax authorities cannot be used by French prosecutors in the criminal investigation of UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager.
The data is solely to help go after French tax dodgers.
The thousands of accounts in question and the more than 11 billion Swiss francs ($11 billion) they held justified Switzerland's granting legal assistance in this case, the court has said.
""It should be noted that the periods from which the transmitted lists came (2006 and 2008) fall within the period for which UBS is suspected of having set up a comprehensive tax evasion system,"" it added.
""In this context, it was essential for the French tax administration to carry out systematic checks on the information supplied by the German tax authorities.""
German authorities acting on information bought from a leaker had discovered the list of account numbers held by French taxpayers at UBS. The Germans shared the information with France, which wanted names of the account holders to see whether they had properly declared and taxed their foreign assets.

(Reuters) - ABX Air pilots who fly for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other clients cast a near-unanimous vote of ""no confidence"" against company management as the holiday shipping season, which depends on airplanes for fast delivery, takes off.
ABX pilots fly roughly a half-dozen planes for Amazon Air, which contracts planes and services from ABX parent Air Transport Services Group.
The pilots, whose salaries are among the lowest in the industry, have been locked in a dispute with ABX and ATSG for more than five years over issues ranging from scheduling to retirement contributions. Two-hundred four of the 205 pilots who voted cast a ""no confidence"" vote against management.
The vote is symbolic since pilots cannot strike without permission from the National Mediation Board, but it adds uncertainty as Amazon accelerates package delivery speeds in a shortened holiday season that is expected to set a new record for online sales.
""It's difficult to ignore that the model on which Amazon bases its business - quick delivery - is critically dependent on these carriers functioning,"" said Dan Akins of Flightpath Economics.
Most retailers lock in their holiday shipping partnerships well in advance. FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) threw a wrench in Amazon’s plans this summer, ending its relationship with the e-commerce company due to strategic reasons. That piled pressure on Amazon Air providers ATSG and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc and shifted volume to  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS).
In a statement, Amazon said, ""We ... are confident in our ability to serve customers this holiday season.""
Representatives of ATSG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Amazon Air and the companies that operate its 47-plane fleet have said they are prepared for the holiday peak.
""They have delayed, delayed, delayed. Our crews are fed up,"" Rick Ziebarth, an ABX Air pilot and executive council chairman of Airline Professionals Association Teamsters Local 1224, said of management.
Amazon's air delivery contractors pay their pilots significantly less than UPS and FedEx, where hourly pay was $288 and $243 respectively in 2018, according to Flightpath Economics.
That compares with $152 at ATSG and $139 at Atlas, which is locked in a bitter contract talks with pilots. ABX and Atlas pilots say the low pay make it difficult to attract and retain skilled flight crews amid a global pilot shortage. Experienced pilots are less likely to job-hop because losing seniority reduces their earnings."

The Gulf energy giant has discussed pricing its IPO shares at 32 riyals apiece, after marketing them at 30 to 32 riyals each, according to the people. Many local fund managers placed orders at that level under the assumption strong domestic demand will lead the deal to price at the top, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Saudi Arabia is selling a 1.5% stake in the state oil producer through the offering. The deal would raise $25.6 billion if it prices at the top end, surpassing Chinese internet giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s $25 billion U.S. share sale in 2014 as the largest IPO of all time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The top end of the IPO price range values the company at $1.71 trillion. Aramco hasn’t formally set the final price, and it could change depending on the final order levels, the people said. It wants to ensure that it can still show strong performance in the first few days of trading even if it prices at the top end, one of the people said.
The company is expected to announce the final price on Dec. 5, according to the IPO prospectus. Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets bounced sharply on Wednesday on a report claiming that the U.S. and China are actually moving closer to a trade deal, despite a barrage of news flow in recent days that suggests the opposite.

Bloomberg cited “people familiar with the matter” as downplaying President Donald Trump’s remarks on Tuesday, which raised the prospect of no trade deal being signed for over a year, because “he was speaking off-the-cuff.""
The news agency’s sources claimed that U.S. negotiators still expect a deal before Dec. 15, when a new round of tariffs on previously untouched goods from China will come into force. However, they noted that there is still no agreement on how far existing tariffs can or should be rolled back, nor how Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods can be guaranteed.

European markets, which had fallen heavily on Tuesday in response to Trump’s comments, recovered a little less than half their losses on the report. By 5 AM ET (1000 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 600 was up 1.1% at 402.66, while the German DAX was up 1.2% while the U.K. FTSE 100 lagged with a gain of 0.3%, most of the rebound coming through the exchange rate channel instead as the pound popped above $1.3000.
Some weren’t convinced. Hu Xijin, editor of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper, implicitly dismissed the news as little more than market manipulation.
On Tuesday, Trump had said – not for the first time – that the so-called ‘phase-1’ agreement “cannot be an even deal,” implying a rejection of China’s line that all tariffs raised so far should be rescinded.
Elsewhere Wednesday, at much the same time, China’s Foreign Ministry was furiously responding to the latest move on Capitol Hill to tighten scrutiny of its human rights policy. The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed the Uighur Act of 2019, which calls on Trump to denounce rehabilitation camps in the (mainly-Muslim) western Chinese province of Xinjiang and calls for sanctions on top-level Chinese politicians. The bill must now go to the Senate. 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry reacted by saying the bill “wantonly smears China's efforts to eliminate and combat extremism"" and called on Washington to “stop using Xinjiang as a way to interfere in China's domestic affairs.""
The bill, if passed, would embed human rights concerns more deeply in the trade negotiations process, coming so soon after the U.S. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy act explicitly tied its access to U.S. markets to its respect for Hong Kong’s autonomy."

496,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 04:21AM ET</span>",South Korea's SK Innovation signs Glencore cobalt supply deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - South Korean battery maker SK Innovation has signed a six-year deal to buy up to 30,000 tonnes of cobalt from miner  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), allowing it produce batteries for 3 million electric vehicles.
Hit by oversupply, cobalt prices have shrunk from $95,000 per tonne in May 2018 to around $35,000 now. The slump has weighed on Glencore's share price and prompted the company to reduce output of the battery metal.
Analysts predict, however, demand will recover as the take-up in electric vehicles gathers speed. SK Innovation has been competing for a share of the battery market, beating its larger rival LG Chem to a deal to supply auto maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
SK Innovation said in a statement on Wednesday it assumed global cobalt demand for electric vehicle batteries would be 32,000 tonnes in 2020 and 92,000 tonnes in 2025.
Glencore and China dominate global production of cobalt, which is concentrated in Democratic Republic of Congo, prompting concerns about conflict and artisanal labor.
Glencore and SK Innovation said they were committed to ensuring ethical and responsible production and the companies agreed the Congolese operations would be independently audited each year against a due diligence standard defined by the Responsible Mining Initiative.
Investor sentiment around Glencore has been depressed this year, leading to a 19% fall in its stock.
Shares rallied nearly 1% by 0907 GMT on Wednesday after falling around 4% on Tuesday when the company delivered weaker-than-expected production guidance and said it expected a new CEO to be appointed next year, which analysts said added to the uncertainty surrounding the company."

Orange SA (PA:ORAN) meanwhile fell 3.7% after the French telecoms company said that it plans to extract greater value from its network infrastructure.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>","Hadi Zablit promoted to general secretary of Renault, Nissan alliance","TOKYO (Reuters) -  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) on Wednesday said they had promoted Hadi Zablit to general secretary of their automaking alliance to accelerate business efficiencies across the companies.
Zablit, senior vice president of business development at the alliance, takes up the newly created position on Monday and will focus on maximising the contribution of the alliance's scale to the profits of each company, the automakers said in a statement.
The announcement comes as Nissan and Renault try to mend ties amid falling profits a year after the Carlos Ghosn scandal. Nissan brought in a new executive team this week, while Renault is set to choose a new CEO in the coming weeks.
The 49-year-old, who holds Lebanese and French citizenship, began his career at Renault in 1994 as a production process engineer at the automaker's powertrain division. He later joined Boston Consulting Group where he eventually became a senior partner, before returning to Renault in 2017.
Since then, he has served as head of Renault's digital operations, and among other tasks, heads the partnership's joint ventures for autonomous mobility services. 
In his new role, Zablit will be tasked with overseeing special projects to enable the three automakers to work more efficiently. In a statement, the alliance said that details of these projects would be announced in coming weeks.
Renault has held a 43% stake in Nissan since the French automaker rescued Nissan from a financial crisis two decades ago. Their partnership has focused on using their combined scale to lower costs for research and development, procurement and production.
Both automakers and their junior partner Mitsubishi were shaken by the arrest of former chairman Ghosn last November on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies.
Zablit's position is the first executive role to be announced by the alliance in the past year since Ghosn's arrest. Since then, some positions which focus on joint tasks, including communications, have stopped operating. 
Earlier this year, Renault tried to forge deeper capital ties with Nissan, only to be rebuffed by the Japanese automaker. This week, Nissan's new CEO, Makoto Uchida, told reporters that the alliance had ""to benefit each of its partners in terms of revenue and profit"".

Uchida added that closer capital ties with Renault were not a focus in the short term.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor plans to invest about 61.1 trillion won ($51.81 billion) between 2020 and 2025, the company said on Wednesday, with a third of the expenditure focused on electric and autonomous vehicles, but analysts want to see it deliver.
The South Korean car maker unveiled a ""Strategy 2025"" roadmap that envisages annual average spending of 10 trillion won, exceeding that of previous years, and up from a 2018 figure of 6.1 trillion won. 
Shares in Hyundai rose as much as 2% on the news, only to give up most of their gains by the close of trade, with analysts waiting to see how its intentions translate into action.
""Its announcement of investment plan and goals is full of good words, but not real results yet,"" said Lee Han-joon, an analyst at KTB Investment & Securities. ""The plan itself also wasn't an amazing one."" 
South Korea's top automaker is accelerating efforts to catch up in the race to bring self-driving cars to market.
Hyundai Motor is also looking at developing flying cars, which could be commercialized ahead of the most advanced self-driving cars, its executive vice chairman, Euisun Chung, has said. 
Ensuring survival is a key task as the auto industry's shift towards zero-emission and self-driving technology requires massive investment at a time of profit pressured by slowing growth, Hyundai said in a presentation to investors.
Hyundai aims to devote about 20 trillion won of the total investment, spread across six years, to future technologies.
It also set an ambitious deadline of 2025 to place itself among the world's top three makers of battery and fuel cell vehicles, with annual sales of 670,000 electric vehicles, including 560,000 battery-based cars. 
Hyundai plans to cut raw material costs by 34.5 trillion won through 2022.
""So, the goal is set, now results should be good, with good products being delivered,"" said Kim Jin-woo an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.
""That's when investors will make a decision about their bets on Hyundai.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Orange (PA:ORAN) said it planned to carve out its mobile towers in most European countries where it is present, in a move aimed at shoring up the telecom group's value as tough competition in the region has hampered its growth and margins.
The French telecoms operator is following similar moves by other European companies that are looking at selling mobile networks as in valuations for infrastructure assets sky-rocket amid growing appetite from investors, such as U.S. private equity firm KKR (N:KKR) and Spain's Cellnex (MC:CLNX).
Bigger rivals Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and Britain's  Vodafone  (L:VOD) have separated their mast mobile assets and are seeking to sell part of them via a listing or a private sale. Shares in Vodafone, the world's second-largest mobile operator, rose as much as 10% when it announced plans to spin off its mobile masts.
""Today, we believe that the value of our all of our networks isn't reflected in our stock prices,"" Orange Chief Executive Stephane Richard said.
Orange's mobile towers could be worth around 10 billion euros ($11 billion), analysts have estimated, while Citi said their value may reach 13 billion euros, or 20 times the operating results generated by towers.
France's former telecoms monopoly said that it owned about 40,000 towers of its mobile network on the continent. The first ""TowerCos"" will be created in France and Spain, the company's two biggest markets, in 2020.
The Paris-based company will retain control over all these new entities and is hoping to eventually merge them into a European company. This entity will also be majority-owned by Orange.
The group also said it was selling 1,500 mobile masts to Spain's Cellnex for 260 million euros.
The divestments were part of Orange's five-year strategic plan, in which it said it would share the deployment of high-speed fiber broadband technology with other operators through dedicated companies that could be opened up to outside investors.
Orange shares fell 3.8% in early trade, with some traders citing disappointment over the company's dividend outlook. It said it will pay out a minimum annual dividend of 70 cents per share over the period."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are stepping aside as leaders of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, ending an extraordinary run that saw them build one of the world's most valuable and influential companies.
Trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, will immediately take the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
""While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it's time to assume the role of proud parents — offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!"" Page and Brin wrote in a blog https:// post on Tuesday.
Page, Brin and Pichai have shared an emphasis on developing artificial intelligence software to make web searching faster and more personalized, while expanding the range of information and services available from a simple text query.
But their vision faces unprecedented scrutiny, with governments on five continents demanding better safeguards, an end to what many view as anticompetitive conduct, and more taxes from the world's largest online advertising company. Thousands of employees have protested, and some have even resigned, over ongoing concern that Google's famous ""don't be evil"" mantra - once embraced by Page and Brin - may be cracking.
Streamlining Alphabet's unorthodox management structure could help the company better respond to the challenges and focus on growing profits, investors said.
""This signals a shift away from the more fringy efforts ... and more towards a company focused on technology that makes money,"" said Kim Caughey Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
Alphabet, which owns more than a dozen companies including self-driving car business Waymo and health care software company Verily, was created in 2015 as part of a restructuring. The Google unit retained control of major businesses including video giant YouTube, the Android smartphone software and hardware operations, and cloud computing.
Page had wanted to focus on developing the newer businesses, which collectively lose money. He left Google, by far the biggest and most profitable part of Alphabet, to Pichai, who in turn delegates a lot of authority to deputies who manage the various product lines. Brin had stayed on as Alphabet's president, spending time on robotics, health ventures and other research projects.
But Page and Brin, once regular sights at public events and at Google headquarters, had become much less visible in recent years. Page's retreat into the background drew increasing criticism from employees and U.S. lawmakers, who demanded answers from him rather than Pichai about controversial projects such as an experimental search app for Chinese users.
Page and Brin, both 46, remain directors of the parent company but will cede their respective CEO and president titles immediately, Alphabet said. The president role will not be filled, it said, describing the changes as long discussed.
Page's voice has been impaired for years because of a chronic condition, but his health did not play a role in the decision to step aside, Alphabet said.
""With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it's the natural time to simplify our management structure,"" the co-founders said. ""We are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term.""
The co-founders still control the company through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26.1% of Alphabet's total voting power, Brin 25.25% and Pichai less than 1%. Alphabet shares rose 0.56% following the after-hours announcement to $1,302.
'MOONSHOTS' AND REGULATORS
Page and Brin developed the core Google search technology while they were still graduate students at Stanford, and it quickly proved far superior to competing search engines of the early Internet era.
By the time it went public in 2004, Google dominated Web search and was on its way to becoming a household name and the most powerful force in the global advertising business. The young co-founders also nurtured a free-wheeling, engineering-driven culture that became a model in Silicon Valley, which is littered with startups launched by Google veterans.
Pichai, 47, who has spent 15 years at Google, rose to prominence while leading development of Google's Chrome browser. He later led product development and engineering across all of Google's services for a year before gaining the CEO title.
Page and Brin are active in a range of non-Google ventures. Page funded a company attempting to develop flying cars, and Brin at a conference last year discussed a budding interest in cryptocurrency. The Alphabet structure was designed in part to let them pursue new ""moonshot"" projects.
Investors and regulators, however, were never completely sold.
Alphabet had used the separation between Page's and Pichai's roles to defend its limited financial disclosures about YouTube and other large Google businesses when the practice was questioned by U.S. securities regulators in 2017.
It contended that publicly reported financial results were in line with what Page reviewed as Alphabet CEO. Regulators did not take further action, but the company's stance has frustrated investors trying to evaluate its performance.
Alphabet declined to comment on whether public financial reporting would change with Pichai assuming both CEO positions."

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Safety fears in Hong Kong have prompted firms to shift arbitration hearings out of the Chinese-ruled city, industry sources said, another sign that pro-democracy protests are denting its appeal as an international business hub.
Months of demonstrations against mainland China's growing influence have pushed the city's economy into its first recession in a decade, prompted some tycoons to move their wealth offshore, and canceled events such as industry conferences and music festivals.
Lawyers and other legal professionals told Reuters the unrest also risks undermining the city's position as one of the world's top centers for arbitration - a process of settling disputes outside the public court system - with cases moving to rival Singapore.
International firms in dispute look for neutral sites with trusted legal systems for arbitration, and the parties involved decide where to hold hearings and which jurisdiction's rules should be used.
Countries compete to become international arbitration venues not just because it is a multi-billion dollar global industry, but because it bolsters their reputation for being a good place to do business. Singapore and Hong Kong are the two leading arbitration hubs in Asia, and in the top five globally, according to Queen Mary University of London.
Australian mining firm Kingsgate (AX:KCN) said last month it had moved hearings related to a dispute with the Thai government from Hong Kong to Singapore early next year over safety concerns.
Lawyers say at least two other cases have moved their hearings from Hong Kong to Singapore because of the unrest, adding that more could follow.
Maxwell Chambers, the main venue for arbitration meetings in Singapore, said a ""few hearings"" had moved there from Hong Kong in recent months because of the protests. It did not give details of the cases.
Sarah Grimmer, Secretary General of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center, declined to comment. But she said the center's case numbers were at a record high, up 20% from this time last year.
""There are some cases - some hearings - that have shifted just for short-term practical reasons,"" said Singapore-based barrister Toby Landau, adding that he knew of two or three cases that had moved from Hong Kong to Singapore.
He said the bigger question was whether parties would choose an arbitration jurisdiction outside Hong Kong ""because of a view about long–term instability.""
If Hong Kong laws are chosen as the framework for arbitration - making it the ""seat"" for the case - its courts will have supervisory powers over the arbitration even if the proceedings are held elsewhere.
Although most of the unrest has been restricted to certain areas in Hong Kong, protests paralyzed broader parts of the city for nearly a week in November, including the central business district."

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors cheered Spanish group Repsol's (MC:REP) pledge to slash net carbon emissions to zero by mid-century, saying they hope it will pile pressure on rival oil and gas companies to follow suit in the fight against climate change.
The world's top oil and gas companies are under heavy pressure, not only from environmental groups but also from institutional investors, to fall in line with targets set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming.
Repsol on Monday became the first leading energy firm to commit to a net-zero emission target, outdoing Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) that had set out an ambition to halve emissions by 2050.
""It is clear that this is a very significant commitment from Repsol that raises the bar across the oil and gas sector,"" said Adam Matthews, Director for Ethics and Engagement at the Church of England Pensions Board, who co-led discussion between a major group of investors with Shell on a climate resolution last year.
Several companies set short-term targets to reduce emissions by limiting gas leaks and burning of excess gas, but none have set out long-term reduction targets before Repsol.
""We have been pressing fossil fuel companies to commit to align with a net zero emissions pathway by 2050 for some time. It is good to see Repsol showing this leadership, including clear milestones along the way,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship, Sarasin & Partners.
""In the end, shareholders need to know their companies are looking forward, not back, when it comes to the energy transition."" Sarasin & Partners manages 14.3 billion pounds ($18.35 billion) in assets.

CARBON STORAGE
Repsol's targets encompass 95% of all its emissions, including from fuels sold to clients. It also wrote down 4.8 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in the value of its oil and gas assets to reflect its lower oil and gas price outlook. 
Net-zero targets are generally expected to be achieved by offsetting emissions through investments in carbon storage technology or in natural sinks such as forests. 
Companies are also increasing production of natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, as well as renewable power such as solar and wind, whose consumption is expected to
jump in coming decades as demand for electricity grows.
Repsol said it would sharply increase its low-carbon power generation capacity by 2030, partly by expanding its renewables business. 
Mark van Baal, head of investor advocacy Follow This, which has taken part in a number of shareholder climate resolutions, said Repsol was the first oil major to be ""truly aligned"" with the Paris goals.
""This decision will result in a complete turnaround in investments from exploring for more oil and gas to exploring for new business models in renewable energy,"" van Baal said.
Fossil fuel burning accounts for around two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions. Energy-related emissions rose by 1.7% in 2018, according to the International Energy Agency.
""It's brilliant to have a poster child because we can all point to that and say 'well, if they can do it, why can’t you?',"" said the head of corporate governance at a leading UK asset manager.

506,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 02:32AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Oil companies swap stakes in Mexico as government holds off on auctions,"By Marianna Parraga and Adriana Barrera
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - With Mexico's government insisting that energy companies increase oil and gas output before it auctions off more of the country's vast reserves or offers more partnerships with state-run Pemex, firms ranging from foreign majors to local players are scrambling to buy and sell blocks they already own. 
The negotiations are creating a dynamic secondary market for oil acreage, which could be the only investment opportunity left for firms until leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador unblocks his predecessor's flagship energy reform that has seen no new licensing rounds since 2018. 
Companies selling stakes include large foreign producers that were awarded blocks in previous rounds such as China's CNOOC (HK:0883) and Germany's Wintershall Dea. Smaller firms including Hokchi Energy and Grupo Diavaz are also trying to share a portion of their assets.
For sellers, allowing partners to get into their projects is a way to limit growing political and financial risks while sharing required capital expenditure. For buyers, this secondary market can open a way into a country whose industry still holds enormous potential although its competitiveness is fading. 
""If I want to grow and there are no rounds, the only option left is to buy a stake in some of the existing,"" said Benigna Leiss, former country manager of U.S.  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) in Mexico. ""Fortunately, regulation allows doing so.""
Several high-profile negotiations were announced since last year between firms including Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI), Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and Chevron.
Former President Enrique Pena Nieto awarded over 100 contracts to energy firms in 2015-2018 to explore and produce oil and gas in Mexico. His reforms also opened the door for Pemex to form joint ventures. 
But Lopez Obrador's administration has suspended auctions planned for 2019 and halted farm-out opportunities until the existing projects add barrels to Mexico's dwindling output. 
Now, negotiations of stakes have brought opportunities for all types of investors, ranging from promising deepwater areas at Mexico's Gulf to small onshore fields. 
CNOOC, which faces heavy capital investment in Guyana, plans to sell stakes in two offshore blocks at Mexico's Perdido basin. The negotiations are expected to be done in January, the company said, without revealing names of the interested buyers.
CNOOC in 2018 said it could sell or swap some of its unit Nexen Petroleum's U.S. Gulf assets as part of a portfolio rebalancing. But planned stake sales in Mexico are ""ordinary trading"" of projects for oil exploration unrelated to other regions, the firm added in an email to Reuters.
Wintershall Dea, the oil and gas unit of chemicals giant BASF (DE:BASFn), is also reshuffling its Mexican portfolio after buying independent firm Sierra Oil and Gas in late 2018 by offering a stake in an offshore block it shares with Malaysia's Petronas [PETRA.UL], according to three sources.
Wintershall declined to comment.
LOST INVESTMENT 
The Mexican government has maintained pressure on oil firms to ramp up production and help reverse 15 years of decline.
""If there are no material results soon, we don't have to offer more rounds,"" said Energy Secretary Rocio Nahle last month.
Lopez Obrador has also pledged to strengthen Pemex, so some of Mexico's most emblematic energy projects could be operated by the state firm.
Yet some analysts say the government is wasting time while providing scant incentive for private firms and Pemex to jointly achieve the goal of adding 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2024, a 76% increase from current output of 1.7 million bpd. 
Mexico's Association of Hydrocarbon Companies (Amexhi) estimates the nation could have received an additional $104 billion in government take through 2040 if it had not interrupted oil rounds. 
""If success is not what the government expects, it will be evident that more private investment is needed,"", said Ruaraidh Montgomery, director of Research at consultancy Welligence.
""Mexico's secondary market is interesting to some competitors as it allows them to monetize portfolios, but does not bring new investment opportunities,"" he said. 
Some of the planned stake sales are driven by the need for investments to start production. 
Hokchi Energy, a unit of Pan American Energy, is looking for a partner willing to share investment for the Hokchi oilfield, one of Mexico's most promising shallow-water projects, the vice president of the firm, Vinicio Suro, told Reuters. 
Smaller players also are selling stakes to catch needed capital. 
Mexican Grupo Diavaz' director of Exploration and Production Luis Zagaglia told Reuters the company is looking for a financial partner for the Miquetla onshore field it shares with Pemex. And Perseus Energy has put its fields Tajon A and B at Southern (NYSE:SO) Tabasco state on the table, according to three sources with knowledge of the talks.
Among companies interested in buying more stakes in Mexico are Chevron, Vista Oil & Gas (MX:VISTAA) and Japan's  Inpex Corp.  (T:1605), according to the sources. 
Perseus, Inpex and Vista Oil & Gas did not reply to requests for comment.
Shell, which recently sold a 40%-stake in three offshore blocks to Chevron, is open to more negotiations, said the president of its Mexico unit, Alberto de la Fuente. 

For its part, Chevron continues interested in opportunities that meet its ""investment criteria,"" the company's spokesperson Ray Fohr told Reuters while declining to comment on details.

Now a reckoning may be looming as car sales slow and the government reduces subsidies for the nascent industry.
That leaves the flagship companies of Jack Ma, Pony Ma, Hui Ka Yan and Robin Li facing an increasingly steep path to profitability on their bets that electric vehicles can be smartphones-on-wheels connecting passengers to other businesses. Their capital, along with dozens of startups raising $18 billion, helped inflate an electric bubble that now looks to be in danger of popping.
China’s car market is experiencing a prolonged sales slump, prompting EV makers to slash earnings outlooks. With China considering further cuts to the subsidies for consumer purchases in order to force automakers to compete on their own, a shakeout is looming that not even the tycoons’ support may be able to prevent, said Rachel Miu, an analyst with DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong. “For the new kids on the block in the EV space, it’s a steep uphill climb,” she said.
Here’s what China’s richest people have to show for their companies’ EV investments:
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA): Xpeng Coupe, Accusations
Jack Ma stepped down as chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in September after amassing a $40 billion-plus fortune, but China’s richest man retains his board seat -- and influence -- at the e-commerce emporium he created. Alibaba has participated in several funding rounds for Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology Co., or Xpeng Motors, including one in 2018 that raised 2.2 billion yuan ($313 million) for the carmaker co-founded by former Alibaba executive He Xiaopeng.
Xpeng launched its first vehicle, the five-seat G3 SUV, last year and has sold 11,940 vehicles so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The company, founded in 2014, also is teaming up with more-established automakers. A factory built with Haima Automobile Co. can produce 150,000 EVs annually. Another should soon begin assembling the P7 coupe, scheduled to begin deliveries next year.
The journey hasn’t been without controversy, though, as some engineers bound for Xpeng stand accused of stealing from their ex-employers in the U.S. In March, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. sued a former engineer, alleging he uploaded files, directories and copies of source code to his personal cloud storage account before resigning. Also, a former Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). engineer was indicted last year for allegedly pilfering self-driving car secrets on his way to an Xpeng job. His trial is upcoming.
Xpeng wasn’t accused of wrongdoing.
“We are very adamant that we pursue our own R&D,” President Brian Gu said. “Copyright is very important to us.”
Hangzhou-based Alibaba, the second-largest shareholder in Xpeng, didn’t answer specific questions about the automaker.
Xiaomi Corp., the consumer-electronics company, participated in another $400 million fundraising round, the automaker said Nov. 13.
Tencent: NIO Lists, Then Cuts
Pony Ma’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., whose WeChat messaging app helped make him China’s second-richest person, led a $1 billion investment round in NIO Inc. in 2017. With more than 26,000 vehicles sold, NIO’s one of the few Chinese startups making multiple models, and it beat rivals with an initial public offering in New York last year.
But losses piled up with the overall sales slump and as the company, which has been described as “China’s Tesla,” plowed money into marketing and real estate. It sponsored a Bruno Mars concert and opened luxury clubs for NIO owners that feature showrooms, coffee bars and performance spaces. By August the company had opened 19 NIO Houses over 22 months, and combined rental expenses were equivalent to 6.3% of revenue during the 12 months ended March, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
“NIO chooses the direct sales mode and pays great attention to user experience,” the company said. It doesn’t plan to close its existing clubs -- or open new ones.
NIO lost $2.8 billion in the 12 months ended June on revenue of $1.2 billion, and its shares have plunged this year. The Shanghai-based company cut about 20% of its workforce through September. Separately, NIO has said that Tencent and Chief Executive Officer William Li planned to inject $100 million each into the company, though the carmaker hasn’t clarified whether the investment has been completed.
“Our sales have been under pressure since the subsidies went down,” Li said. “It has come to a new era that one can only win customers with quality products and services.”
Shenzhen-based Tencent expressed support for EVs but didn’t answer specific questions about NIO.
Evergrande: High Hopes
One of the more startling entrants in the EV industry is property developer China Evergrande Group, which declared it wanted to be the world’s biggest manufacturer within three to five years. That means surpassing Tesla, which just opened a factory in Shanghai. Between September 2018 and June 2019, Evergrande invested more than $3.8 billion in EV-related companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, and will start producing its Hengchi brand next year.
Evergrande, which wants to open 10 production bases, plans to spend 45 billion yuan on new-energy vehicles between 2019 and 2021. On Nov. 10, a unit announced it would spend almost $3 billion to boost its stake in National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB to 82% from 68%.
Billionaire chairman and founder Hui Ka Yan, who’s diversifying into businesses such as soccer and health care, acknowledged there isn’t much overlap between Evergrande’s real-estate business and its EV ambitions.
“We don’t have any talent, technology, experience, or production base in manufacturing cars,” Hui said. “How can we compete with the century-old automakers in the world?”
His answer: by opening Evergrande’s wallet.
“Whatever core technology and company we can buy, we will buy,” he said.
Yet Hui’s whatever-it-takes strategy may take a toll on Evergrande because of the cash-burning nature of NEV investments. The company’s forecast of spending 45 billion yuan is probably an underestimate, and that may exacerbate its cash crunch, according to BI.
“This could crimp its home-sales margin given an urgency to sustain price cuts to boost cash collection from sales,” analyst Kristy Hung said in a Nov. 22 report.
Baidu: WM Factories, Lawsuit
Robin Li, the CEO of China’s dominant internet search-engine company, made WM Motor Technology Co. part of Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).’s move into autonomous driving. Baidu led a fundraising round this year that generated 3 billion yuan for the Shanghai-based automaker. Baidu owns a 13% stake.
WM rolled out an electric SUV last year and has delivered more than 19,000 vehicles, Chief Strategy Officer Rupert Mitchell said. So far this year, WM sold 14,273 of its battery-powered SUVs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That puts WM behind market leader BYD Co. -- backed by Warren Buffett -- and NIO, but ahead of Xpeng. WM launched a second SUV model on Nov. 22.
WM has an advantage over rivals started by employees from internet companies, Mitchell said. Founder Freeman Shen used to run Volvo Car Group in China.
“We are not moonlighters from the technology industry that are having a crack at mass-market automotive,” he said.
Volvo parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group has sued WM, seeking 2.1 billion yuan compensation for alleged copyright infringement, Chinese state media reported in September. WM has denied wrongdoing.
WM is producing vehicles at fully owned factories, which helps maintain quality control, Mitchell said. The company, which is opening a second factory next year that can make 150,000 vehicles annually, wants to raise another $1 billion, Mitchell said.
Baidu declined to comment.

US Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross also said Huawei has been encouraging its suppliers to violate US law by telling them to move operations offshore in a bid to avoid US sanctions. 
In May, Huawei was put on a trade blacklist by the US over national security concerns. Suppliers have had to apply for special licenses to sell equipment to Huawei.

Investing.com – Comments by US President Donald Trump kept the ongoing US-China trade war as a focal point in Asia on Wednesday morning, sending markets down across the board with Australia leading the way.  
Most markets were in the red across the region after Trump said overnight that he may delay making a deal with China until after the presidential election towards the end of 2020.  
The possibility of a phase one deal before Dec. 15, when new US tariffs on Chinese goods take effect, had been fuelling investor optimism. Trumps comments dampened that positive outlook.  
“In some ways, I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal, but they want to make a deal now and we will see whether or not the deal is going to be right,” he said on Tuesday, adding that he does not have a deadline.  
His comments helped push Wall Street down, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing 1.01% down and the S&P 500 losing 0.66% during Tuesday’s session in the US. 
Asian stocks followed suit.  
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, which has been battered this week by bleak news on the domestic economy, started the morning down as much as 1.32% to 26,049 by 9:10 PM ET (02:10 GMT).  The city has gone through more than six months of protests and social unrest and is currently in a recession. Retail sales volume in October fell 26.2% year-on-year.  
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.27% to 2,877 in early morning trade while the SZSE Component fell 0.13% to 9,644. 
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 continued to plummet, falling 1.67% to 6,600. 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.36% to 23,068. 
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.02% to 2,063. 
“It’s very difficult to have conviction about which way the trade situation will go,” said Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management in an interview with Bloomberg TV.  
On Tuesday, lawmakers in the US passed legislation that would require the president to sanction Chinese government officials involved in a crackdown of Uighurs in Western China. The new legislation follows two other bills signed by Trump last week to support protesters in Hong Kong. Both bills could add to the tension between the US and China.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 09:13PM ET</span>","U.S. judge disqualifies Huawei lawyer from fraud, sanctions case","By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday disqualified James Cole, a Washington lawyer for China's Huawei, from defending the telecommunications equipment maker against charges of bank fraud and sanctions violations. 
Judge Ann Donnelly of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York, issued her order after federal prosecutors argued that Cole's prior work at the Department of Justice created conflicts of interest.
Cole served as the deputy attorney general, the No. 2 official, at the Justice Department between 2011 and 2015.
""There is a 'substantial risk' that Cole could use 'confidential factual information' obtained while serving as DAG to 'materially advance' Huawei's current defense strategy,"" the U.S. prosecutors said in a May court filing. 
Cole, a partner at the law firm Sidley Austin, said he had no recollection of matters referenced as the basis for his disqualification. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the judge's decision.
""We are disappointed in the court's decision, which we believe violates Huawei's Sixth Amendment right to counsel of its choice,"" Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly said in a statement. ""We reserve our right to appeal this decision when appropriate."" 
In the May court filing, the government argued that, as deputy attorney general, Cole ""personally supervised and participated in aspects of"" a related investigation, but said the details were classified.
A redacted version of Donnelly's decision to disqualify Cole will be made public by Jan. 10, the judge said in her order.
The criminal case against Huawei accuses the company of conspiring to defraud  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and other banks by misrepresenting its relationship with a company that operated in Iran. Prosecutors said Huawei put the banks at risk of penalties for processing transactions that violated U.S. sanctions.
Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary in March.
The company's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei's founder, is fighting extradition from Canada, where she was arrested last December for her role in the alleged fraud. Meng has said she is innocent.
Michael Levy, another lawyer for the company, argued in court in September that the effort to stop Cole from representing Huawei was another tactical step in a broader U.S. government campaign against the Chinese company.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 09:13PM ET</span>",Johnson & Johnson says new tests show no asbestos in Johnson's Baby Powder,"By Sanjana Shivdas and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said on Tuesday that recent tests showed that Johnson's Baby Powder was free of asbestos, after U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigations reported trace amounts of the material in the product earlier this year.
A total of 155 tests were conducted by two different third-party labs using four different testing methods on samples from the same bottle tested by the FDA's contracted lab, the company said.
The tests are the latest effort by J&J to prove the safety of its widely used consumer product after the test by the FDA prompted J&J to undertake a nationwide recall of one lot of Johnson's Baby Powder in October.
The FDA was not immediately available for comment. However, in response to an October announcement from J&J that a smaller number of independent tests also found no asbestos, the regulatory agency said it stood by its findings.
The different test outcomes could have resulted from the fact that contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and there is no standard test for asbestos in talc, FDA officials told Reuters in October.
Tests conducted by the third-party labs showed asbestos was not present in the single bottle that the FDA's contracted lab had tested, nor was it present in retained samples of the finished lot from which the bottle was produced, the company said on Tuesday.
The company said its investigation concluded that the most probable root causes for the FDA's reported results were either test sample contamination or analyst error at the lab, or both.
In October, J&J recalled around 33,000 bottles of baby powder in the United States after the FDA said it had found trace amounts of asbestos in samples taken from a bottle purchased online.
The voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson's Baby Powder produced and shipped in the United States in 2018, the company said at the time.
That move marked the first time the company recalled its baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time U.S. regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma.
The recall was the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old U.S. healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal.

J&J faces more than 15,000 lawsuits from consumers claiming its talc products, including Johnson's Baby Powder, caused their cancer.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) announced on Tuesday an order for 50 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A321XLR jets to fly between the U.S East Coast and Europe, becoming the latest U.S. airline to ink a deal for the European planemaker's new passenger jet.
The long-range A321XLR jets will replace United's 53 Boeing 757-200 planes beginning in 2024, the Chicago-based planemaker said, flying to cities like Porto, Portugal and other potential new destinations.
United's 757 planes will reach the end of their lifespan in about a decade and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is not building any more of the large single-aisle model.
Instead, the U.S. planemaker has been considering a new twin-aisle plane, provisionally known as the NMA, but has delayed a launch decision until 2020 while it manages the ongoing global grounding of its 737 MAX jets following two fatal crashes.
United's chief operating officer Andrew Nocella told reporters the airline has worked closely with Boeing on the potential new aircraft and is still open to orders if the planemaker decides to move forward with developing the NMA.
Meanwhile, U.S carriers including  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) and  Spirit Airlines  Inc (N:SAVE) have agreed orders for Airbus A320neo-family jets.
Among the benefits of the A321XLR is a 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, United said.
United has also ordered the larger A350 widebody jets but said it is deferring delivery of those jets until they are needed in 2027.

Its A321XLR order is the second for a U.S. carrier following tariffs that the United States is imposing on European-made aircraft.

518,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 07:39PM ET</span>",Elon Musk testifies his 'pedo guy' tweet not meant to be taken literally,"By Rachel Parsons and Nichola Groom
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - High-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk testified at his defamation trial on Tuesday that his ""pedo guy"" Twitter message at the center of the case was not meant to be taken literally and was sent in response to an ""unprovoked"" insult he received from the man now suing him.
Musk, the billionaire chief executive of electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), was the first witness called to the stand in the lawsuit brought against him by a British cave diver who gained fame for his lead role in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand last year.
The diver, Vernon Unsworth, says Musk, also founder of the rocket company SpaceX, falsely labeled him a pedophile on Twitter and should pay punitive and other damages.
The case stems from an offer Musk made to furnish a mini-submarine from SpaceX to assist in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave rescue in July 2018.
Unsworth told CNN on July 13, 2018, three days after the rescue was successfully completed, that Musk's offer was a ""PR stunt"" and that Musk should ""stick his submarine where it hurts.""
Two days later, Musk lashed out at Unsworth in a series of tweets, including one which called the cave diver a ""pedo guy."" Musk later apologized for the comment, saying the term was a common insult in South Africa where he grew up.
Unsworth called the slur a lie that has harmed his reputation. 
Musk was called to testify by plaintiff's lawyers after a jury was selected to hear the case and the two sides delivered opening statements.
Musk said he was merely responding in kind to Unsworth's remarks, a video of which Musk said he watched on Twitter. Those comments were ""an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids,” Musk testified. ""It was wrong and insulting, and so I insulted him back.”
""I thought he (Unsworth) was just some random creepy guy,” Musk added. ""I thought at the time that he was unrelated to the rescue.”
Pressed under questioning by lawyer Lin Wood, Musk testified that he did not mean for his tweet about Unsworth to be taken literally.
""I assume he did not mean to sodomize me with a submarine ... Just as I didn't literally mean he was a pedophile,"" he said.
U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson has explained the case hinges on whether a reasonable person would take Musk's Twitter statement to mean that he was calling Unsworth a pedophile.
To win the defamation case, Unsworth needs to show that Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified the plaintiff and caused him harm. ""Actual malice"" on Musk's part does not need to be proven because the judge has deemed Unsworth a private individual rather than a public figure.
MUSK'S TWITTER FOLLOWERS
Although the case does not involve Tesla, Musk's Twitter habits have long been under close scrutiny, with investors and regulators expressing concerns about his tweets.
With 29.8 million followers, Musk's Twitter account is a major source of publicity for his Palo Alto, California-based electric car company, which does not advertise.
Wood, representing Unsworth, tried to establish that Musk knew he had a high degree of influence with his Twitter followers and the public, and that the veracity of what he said thus carried significant weight.
“People say a lot of things on Twitter that aren’t true,” Musk said.
In an opening statement earlier in the day, lawyer Taylor Wilson, another member of Unsworth's legal team, said the tweet in question was more than a slip-up, and Musk had no business branding Unsworth a predator ""in what should have been one of the proudest moments of his life.""
Musk lawyer Alex Spiro countered that Unsworth did not act after the tweet like a man who suffered because of it.

""The plaintiff is saying he has been horribly damaged, and deserves money,"" Spiro said. ""He doesn't.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Cao Xianli, the owner of a 'ribs and rice' restaurant in eastern China's Qingdao city, is facing his biggest test in a decade of running the eatery.
Not only have costs doubled in the last year because of soaring pork prices, but he's not even sure he'll be able to secure enough of the meat needed for his signature dish.
""My concern is how much longer I will still be able to buy pork. If I can't buy pork, I have to close my shop,"" Cao told Reuters.
Graphic: China's restaurants feel the heat as pork supplies plunge, prices soar - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7642/7624/ChinaPorkPricesDec2019.png
China's rocketing pork prices come after a deadly disease ravaged its huge hog herd, leaving the world's top consumer of the meat short of about a quarter of its usual supplies. That's about 13.5 million tonnes, more than the entire pork production of the United States. 
Graphic: China's sow and pig herd changes from the year before - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7621/7603/ChinaHogSowHrdNov2019.png
With pork by far the most popular meat in China, food inflation is running at its highest in almost eight years, surprising both seasoned economists and restaurateurs. 
""In the past year, both we and the market underestimated the pace of pork price inflation,"" wrote analyst Lu Ting and colleagues at Japanese bank Nomura in an October report, revising up their forecast for inflation next year.
PURCHASING POWER
Sky rocketing pork prices are impacting the entire supply chain. Wholesale chicken prices are up 33% on a year ago, driven by widescale substitution of pricy pork with cheaper poultry, meaning China's popular fried chicken chains are also feeling the heat. 
Industry leader KFC has managed the surge in costs by forcing suppliers to take much of the hit, keeping inflation under 10%, executives with the firm's owner Yum China Holdings (N:YUMC) said on an Oct. 28 earnings call.
Graphic: China is the top pork and hog producer - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6666/6648/ChinaPorkHogProduction.png
To absorb the rest of the increase, it has increased the number of non-chicken items on its menu, adding a duck meat wrap and a Portobello mushroom burger. Duck is China's cheapest meat.
KFC is also using cheaper chicken parts, replacing wings with 'strips' of breast meat, and offering a 'wing tip bucket' in July and again in October. 
Though little more than skin, bone and cartilage at the end of the chicken wing, the fried wing tips proved popular, said chief executive Joey Wat on the recent call. ""There are a group, not a huge group, but there's still a group of people who just love it"", she told analysts.
The company warned that 2020 will be ""another challenging year for commodity inflation"" but said it will be ""prudent"" on the portion of costs passed on to customers. 
NO ROOM TO DIVERSIFY
The millions of smaller players in China's 4 trillion yuan ($568 billion) catering sector have fewer options to cope with soaring costs and limited supplies.
Though imports have surged this year, an expected 3 million tonnes of pork from abroad can't plug domestic needs, and Beijing only has small volumes of frozen pork in state reserves.
""The impact on us is huge. We sell ribs, that's it. For us, there is no room for diversification,"" said Cao, owner of the Qingdao restaurant. 
Cao hiked his prices by about 10% to 19 yuan per serving and managed to retain his customers. ""People still come as they also have no choice. If they go to the market to buy pork, they'll find it's no cheaper,"" he said.
But others have struggled to keep customers while raising prices. Xishaoye, a Beijing-based chain that specialises in 'roujiamo', the traditional Chinese pork bun, had to lower prices again after a small hike hurt business, said Ji Chen, a manager at one of the chain's outlets. 
""It's a highly competitive market, you can't raise your price more than by a low single-digit,"" said Lina Yan, consumer analyst at HSBC. Xishaoye has resorted to promoting chicken and vegetable variants of the pork bun, and offering a set menu with pork-free side dishes to steer customers away from their bestselling item.
That helped to halve pork consumption at their 43 restaurants but it has still racked up losses of more than 6 million yuan this year, said chief executive Meng Bing.
""Ingredients usually account for about 30-40% of costs, so if the cost of ingredients increases by 20% to 30%, the company is highly likely to lose money,"" said Meng.
China's Vice Premier Hu Chunhua has urged farmers to restock empty farms and called on provincial authorities to do all they can to guarantee pork supplies, particularly ahead of the important Lunar New Year holiday next month.
The agriculture ministry says pig production should return to about 80% of normal levels by late 2020, but many others believe that forecast is overly optimistic, particularly as swine fever is still spreading.
After dipping last month, pork prices are rising again and even larger companies could come under greater pressure if inflation doesn't soon subside. 
An executive with one of China's largest mass-market catering companies said it may soon be forced to raise prices. 

""Increasing the price is really the last resort as our consumers are price-sensitive. But if pork prices stay high in 2020, we will have no choice,"" he said, declining to be identified because pork supplies are a sensitive topic.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>",Huawei urging suppliers to break the law by moving offshore: Ross,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - China's telecoms giant Huawei has been encouraging its suppliers to violate U.S. law by telling them to move operations offshore in a bid to avoid U.S. sanctions, Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross told Reuters on Tuesday.
In May, the U.S. government placed Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on a trade blacklist known as the entity list, over national security concerns, forcing some suppliers to apply for special licenses to sell equipment to the company.
But the U.S. government has become frustrated by the limitations of the blacklisting to keep overseas suppliers from selling to the company, the world's largest telecoms equipment supplier, Reuters reported last week.
On Tuesday, Ross said in an interview that those frustrations extended to a push from Huawei to move its supply chain overseas.
Huawei has ""been openly advocating companies to move their production offshore to get around the fact that we put Huawei on the list,"" Ross said. ""Anybody who does move the product out specifically to avoid the sanction... that's a violation of U.S. law. So here you have Huawei encouraging American suppliers to violate the law,"" he added.
Huawei spokesman Rob Manfredo declined to comment.
Reuters reported last week that the U.S. government may expand its power to stop more foreign shipments of products with U.S. technology to Huawei, by broadening the reach of two key rules to capture more products.
One of those regulations, known as the De minimis Rule, dictates how much U.S. content in a foreign-made product gives the U.S. government authority to block an export. Currently the de minimis threshold for China is set at 25%, meaning that if American content constitutes more than a quarter of the value of the item, U.S. rules apply to its export to China.
Ross declined to say whether such rule changes were imminent. However, he said Huawei's advocacy of suppliers moving offshore ""has flagged an issue we've been starting to deal with,"" that is, whether the 25% threshold is right for China.
""Whether 25% is forever and all time the right ratio, that's something to be resolved,"" Ross said, adding that the agency was always considering such moves.

The S&P 500 fell as many as 44 points soon after the open. The Dow Jones industrials were off nearly 458 points before some modest bargain hunting set in and the president, who was attending a NATO meeting in London, withdrew for the night.
The bargain hunting helped cut the day's losses substantially. The S&P 500 closed down 0.66%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped about 0.55%. The Dow ended off 1.01%, or 280 points, in part because of weakness in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD).
Boeing was lower as skepticism that its troubled 737 Max jetliner will be re-certified by Dec. 31.
Defensive stocks, including Merck (NYSE:MRK),   Verizon Communications   (NYSE:VZ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) led the blue-chip index. Only five of the 30 stocks were higher.
Much of the initial selling came so quickly after the open that it appeared to be computer driven.
Then, humans slowly bid stocks up and forced the market to recover at least some of its losses.
The Dow's loss was its largest since Oct. 8. The losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite at the close were smaller than their Monday losses.
Tech stocks were hurt, especially chip stocks and hardware, because of the possibility of more tariffs being imposed on goods imported from China and because the Chinese market is so important to these companies as well. Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) were among the biggest losers among stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index.
Apple, Intel, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) combined to generate 33 points of the Nasdaq 100's 54.5-point loss -- 61% of the total. 
After hours, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) beat earnings estimates compiled by Investing.com. But weaker-than-expected guidance pushed shares lower after hours.
 
 
The market has regularly jumped when the president or other officials working on the China trade talks have said a deal is on track. Wall Street may become skeptical about the assurances going forward.
Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were lower, with energy, financial and industrial stocks suffering most. Utilities and real estate were the only winners as investors looked to them for safety.
They also bid up bonds and gold, looking for safety from the political headwinds. 
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.716%, down from 1.728% on Monday. 
Gold jumped $15.20 to $1,484.40 an ounce. 
Crude oil was mixed with West Texas intermediate crude up 14 cents to $56.10 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell 10 cents to $60.82.
Cell-phone tower company Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI), information technology company DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC), gaming company   Take-Two Interactive   Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) and real-estate-investment trust SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) were among the top S&P 500 performers on Tuesday.
Oil-and-gas producer Apache (NYSE:APA), employtee-benefits company   Unum Group   (NYSE:UNM), oil-and-gas producer   Cimarex Energy   (NYSE:XEC) and mining company Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX) were among the worst S&P 500 performers. "
523,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Private Sector Jobs, Services Activity in Focus 
The U.S. labor market and services sectors will be in focus on Wednesday, with the release of ADP’s measure of private-sector employment and the ISM's non-manufacturing index.
The ADP report is due at 8:15 AM ET (13:15 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect that private nonfarm payrolls rose by 140,000 last month, up from 125,000 in October.
The update on the private labor market comes just days ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls report.
An ISM survey on the service sector activity, meanwhile, is slated for 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT)
Economists forecast that ISM non-manufacturing data for November will show a slight downtick to a reading of 54.5 from 54.7 previously. However, a reading above 50 means the sector is still growing.
2. Crude Inventories Data in Spotlight
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases its petroleum report on Wednesday.
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of about 1.73 million barrels.
Crude oil futures settled up 14 cents to settle at $56.10 in a choppy session as traders weighed fading hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal against expectations for OPEC to announce cuts at a meeting later this week.
""The global oil supply-demand balance requires an extension of the current OPEC+ cuts,"" Goldman Sachs said.
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data, which, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels, that showed weekly crude stockpiles fell by 3.7 million barrels last week
3. Campbell Soup Earnings Due
  Campbell Soup   (NYSE:CPB) reports earnings before the opening bell Wednesday.
Ahead of the report, some on Wall Street have warned that sales may fall short of expectations as a later date for Thanksgiving and the sale of its U.K. snacks segment will likely keep a lid on growth.
""We think net sales may trail consensus given the impact of a later Thanksgiving on soup shipments,"" Wells Fargo said in a note to clients.
Campbell Soup is expected to report earnings of 72 cents a share on revenue of $2.2 billion. That would be down from 79 cents a share in earnings on revenue of $2.69 billion in the year ago quarter.

The system relies on electric motors embedded in landing gear to allow planes to push back and taxi without their jet engines running - saving fuel, curbing emissions and ending last-minute delays while waiting for airport tugs.
Several such projects emerged during a spike in oil prices earlier this decade and have come to the fore again due to pressure to reduce emissions, but development has been hindered by weaker oil prices and shifts in jet flying patterns.
Safran acknowledges the system would be uneconomic for long flights because those jets do not spend enough time taxiing to justify carrying the motors, which weigh some 400 kg (882 lb).
But for planes doing six or seven short trips a day and looking to cut extra minutes off turnaround times, the benefits could be worth 4% in lower fuel consumption, the French company said.
Analysts say the trend in single-aisle jets like the A320 has recently, however, been toward longer flights enabled by design improvements.
Safran Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the Airbus decision, which emerged weeks after Air India became the first airline to use a rival system called TaxiBot, developed by a unit of Israel Aerospace Industries.
""We offered various forms of partnership (to Airbus),"" he told reporters.
An Airbus spokesman said the system did not offer enough technical maturity and performance ""in its current form.""
Airbus continues to explore ways to curb emissions, he added.
Safran had previously worked with Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) on a similar product for Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 jets but they parted ways due to problems adapting it to the wheels of the slightly smaller airplane.
Wheeltug, a unit of  Borealis Exploration  Ltd (PK:BOREF), said in September it had reached agreement with an unidentified party to support Wheeltug, a system allowing the Boeing 737 to taxi forwards and backwards using a motor in the nosewheel.
As part of a wider technology drive, Safran is studying longer-term autonomous systems that could take over a pilot's job of taxiing or ease the workload so that only one pilot is engaged, Safran researchers said on Tuesday."

529,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 03:26PM ET</span>","U.S. senators call for banning, prosecuting ‘slumlords’ of military housing","By M.B. Pell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Tuesday demanded the Defense Department crack down on private landlords who provide substandard housing at military bases with criminal prosecutions or contract cancellations, citing Reuters reports of slum-like living conditions and falsified accounting.
The top civilian and military leaders of the Army, Navy and Air Force appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee, in the latest hearing addressing substandard military housing.
On Tuesday, senators were presented with a new report from the Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog conducting a review of the housing program that was launched following the Reuters reports. Among the GAO’s core findings: Housing reports sent to Congress are often misleading, painting a falsely positive picture of housing conditions. The program also suffers from inaccurate landlord maintenance reports and lax military oversight, the GAO reported.
To read the GAO report, click: https:// Some senators asked whether the military’s two-decade-old program of having private landlords provide housing on U.S. military bases has failed.
“Are any of them not acting like slumlords at this point? Are any of them doing a good job?” asked Senator Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican and former U.S. Air Force combat pilot. “This pisses me off.”
For more than a year, Reuters has exposed lead, asbestos, mold and vermin contaminating homes where private landlords house thousands of military families on behalf of the Pentagon. More recently, the news agency disclosed how one major landlord doctored maintenance records at some of its bases to help it collect bonus incentive fees.
To read the coverage, click: https://reut.rs/2r1Bkim
Top Defense Department officials have long touted high occupancy rates and satisfaction scores on military family surveys as evidence the effort is generally successful, despite occasional hiccups. But Elizabeth A. Field, the GAO’s director of defense capabilities and management, told senators: “There’s clearly a problem here.”
Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy defended the privatization effort, saying it allowed the military to tap private borrowing that would otherwise be unavailable.
“That doesn’t mean it’s worked out great,” added Acting Navy Secretary Thomas B. Modly. Some privatized housing is “fantastic,” he said, but other housing is not.
The secretaries cited reform steps already taken, including far-reaching inspections of military housing and a planned tenant bill of rights to empower military families.
Senators pressed the secretaries to do more to hold accountable military leaders and landlords.
Oklahoma Republican Jim Inhofe, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, asked Air Force Secretary Barbara M. Barrett why she couldn’t “pull the plug” on  Balfour Beatty  Communities, one of the military’s largest landlords.
This year, Reuters quoted five former Balfour Beatty employees who said they filed false maintenance records at Air Force bases to help the company collect millions in bonus payments. Balfour Beatty, a unit of British infrastructure giant Balfour Beatty PLC (L:BALF), has said that it is committed to improving its maintenance, and that it has tapped outside counsel and auditors to investigate.
Air Force Secretary Barrett said the Air Force has lost confidence in the company, but stopped short of committing to removing it from the program.
A company spokesman said Balfour Beatty plans this month to finish a “performance improvement plan” requested by the Air Force.
Democratic senators Richard Blumenthal, from Connecticut, and Mazie Hirono, from Hawaii, urged the military to refer instances of fraud for criminal prosecution.
“We probably need to make an example out of a couple of them,” said Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican."

The bank reiterated an overweight recommendation on the Brazilian stock market -- its sole overweight in the region -- and set a target of 130,000 points for the benchmark Ibovespa index by the end of 2020, which implies upside of about 20% from current levels.
“Economic activity data have been supporting the idea of accelerating growth,” said David Beker, BofA’s Latin America equity strategist, in a phone interview. “As growth picks up, Brazilian companies should be able to deliver stronger earnings and the local equity market should continue to rally.” He sees local earnings expanding about 17% in 2020.
Beker also expects Brazil’s gross domestic product growth to accelerate to 2.4% in 2020 and 3.5% in 2021, amid a scenario of low rates, benign inflation and continuing reforms from President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration. “The government has been making efforts in order to improve Brazil’s business environment and we’ll have further adjustments,” Beker said.
Wall Street banks have broadly bullish bets for Brazilian stocks, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) seeing an acceleration in economic growth and strong rotation to equities from fixed income boosting the local market. Since Bolsonaro came to office in January, the Ibovespa has rallied 24% -- the 10th-best among 94 global benchmarks.
At the end of last year, when Ibovespa was hovering around 89,000 points, Beker placed the most optimistic 2019 year-end estimate for the index -- at 120,000. The benchmark is now trading around 109,000.
Among Brazilian stocks, BofA prefers state-controlled firms, consumer names and stocks that are more linked to a low-rate environment. The firm also likes banks as they should benefit from improving credit volume and can overcome fintech disruption by cutting costs.
BofA maintained its market-weight recommendation for Mexico and underweight for Chile. The bank has no allocation to Colombia and no exposure to Argentina."
532,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 03:15PM ET</span>",Alibaba’s Hong Kong Rally Is At Risk From Three Misconceptions,"(Bloomberg) --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s landmark $11 billion share sale and listing in Hong Kong on Nov. 26 was galvanized by expectations the Chinese e-commerce giant will attract a vast pool of capital from its home country. But some investors caution against unrealistic expectations, especially by mainland investors, and highlight certain restrictions that still govern -- and potentially curtail -- trading activity in Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares.
The company’s sheer size and the unprecedented nature of its secondary listing (the primary listing is still in New York) and unique management structure present challenges for investors hoping to gauge everything from Alibaba’s inclusion in indexes -- crucial because they direct the flow of capital from tracker funds -- to its listing status.
Here’s what we know.
1. Will Alibaba get added to the Hang Seng Index?
Not right now. Alibaba will be added to Hang Seng Composite Index on Dec. 9, but it isn’t qualified to join the benchmark Hang Seng Index or the Hang Seng China Enterprise Index because they comprise only primary listings and corporations without so-called weighted voting rights (WVR).
Membership of the 50-member Hang Seng is coveted by corporations because it could trigger billions of dollars of inflows from funds tracking the 50-year-old gauge. Hang Seng Indexes Co. plans a consultation in the first quarter to discuss issues including whether firms with weighted voting rights, like Alibaba, should be eligible for the HSI. Any conclusions should be published by May, Daniel Wong, its head of research and analytics, said in a statement. Even if the index compiler decides to overhaul its rules, the required process means it may not be until late 2020 before Alibaba could join the major Hang Seng benchmarks.
Representatives for HKEx and Alibaba declined to comment.

2. Will Alibaba be included in the stock connect program?
Maybe, but a lot hinges on policy makers. China doesn’t spell out criteria or qualifications for joining the program, which allows mainland investors to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. Unlike the HSI, the program isn’t limited to primary listings. It does require review by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the stock market watchdog.
The first companies in stock connect with weighted voting rights were Meituan Dianping and Xiaomi Corp., which mainland investors got access to in late October through the program. That’s after similarly structured Chinese firms started listing in July on Shanghai’s new tech-focused Star board. Many investors expect Beijing to ultimately allow Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares to trade through the stock link with the city as well.
But it may not necessarily be in China’s best interest to do so. That’s because other U.S.-listed Chinese firms -- among the country’s largest corporations, from JD.com Inc. to Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). -- may be encouraged to follow in Alibaba’s footsteps and conduct their own secondary listings in Hong Kong, bypassing the Shanghai or Shenzhen bourses. That may run counter to Beijing’s longstanding ambitions of developing healthy, vibrant mainland exchanges, particularly as unrest grips Hong Kong.
3. Can Alibaba change its primary listing to Hong Kong?
It’s possible -- thereby attracting investors with a preference for main listings, and at the same time scoring brownie points with some in Beijing who could view that as supporting China’s policy ambitions. Alibaba was given the green light to list in Hong Kong based on a new “Secondary Listing” rule, or Chapter 19C. It allows companies to conduct follow-on share offerings without complying with more stringent rules laid down by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. governing first-time listees.
Alibaba may enjoy special status in having more freedom to comply with Hong Kong listing requirements. Under rules laid out in a consultation paper in April last year, Chinese firms that went public before Dec. 15, 2017 don’t need to comply with “WVR” safeguards if they later switch their primary listing to Hong Kong. Alibaba, which debuted in New York in 2014, said in its Hong Kong listing prospectus it’s a “WVR” company similar to Meituan and Xiaomi.
Meanwhile, Alibaba employs a fairly unique structure in which a group of partners have the right to nominate a majority of the firm’s board -- exerting outsized influence on Alibaba’s direction.
In addition, Hong Kong listing rules say if trading volume there exceeds 55% of global turnover over an entire fiscal year, the stock has to adopt primary listing status in Hong Kong. HKEx gives such Chinese companies a year to comply. But with Hong Kong’s stock registration office listing just 23% of outstanding Alibaba shares as of Nov. 28, a majority of trading volume occurring there may be a tall order."
533,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 03:12PM ET</span>","When Trump Tweets on China Trade Talks, Buy Canadian Stocks","(Bloomberg) -- There’s no question about it -- global stock markets are roiled when Donald Trump tweets about the U.S.-China trade negotiations. Here’s one way to hedge against all that volatility: Buy Canadian stocks.
Just like that, clients get exposure to a developed $2 trillion market with a stable government and one more thing: a gold and silver haven. Miners have about an 11% weighting on the S&P/TSX Composite, while similar stocks on the U.S. benchmark have a mere 2.7% weight.
That’s helpful on days like today, when Trump signals he could wait for another year before striking a trade agreement with China, sending investors fleeing risk assets and piling into havens. While the S&P 500 Index fell as much as 1.4% Tuesday, the TSX slipped by only half that amount.
Staying Local
This is a regular occurrence for Canada stock traders, which might explain why locals are so heavily invested in their home country. Seventy-two percent of the time when Trump tweets about “China,” or “tariffs” or “trade” and stocks slump, the TSX outperforms U.S. stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to the start of 2017.
In May, after Trump declared that the 10% tariffs on Chinese goods would rise to 25%, the S&P 500 plunged as much as 1.6%, while the TSX dropped 1%. When he said “China broke the deal,” the American benchmark fell 1.5% and its Canadian counterpart slipped 0.8%.
To be sure, on days where there’s positive trade news, the rally in U.S. equities tops that in Canada. And the market up north is generally less volatile than its southern neighbor.
While that’s partly due to the contribution of mining stocks, it’s also because banks, which make up a third of the TSX, are a bellwether of the nation’s economy and pay out dividends at ratios that are hard to find elsewhere. Utilities and REITs have also helped protect Canada’s key stock gauge from major plunges."

PARIS (Reuters) - The head of French jet engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) has voiced caution over the ability of aerospace supply chains to ramp up quickly after the return to service of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, which has been grounded for months following two fatal accidents.
Safran co-produces the LEAP engine for the MAX through its CFM International joint venture with  General Electric  (N:GE).
Once the jet returns to service - the timing of which is in the hands of regulators - Boeing plans to reach a previously targeted production level of 57 aircraft a month by end-2020 from its current rate of 42, down from 52 before the grounding.
It has not offered further details on how fast output would rise. 
Speaking to a group of reporters, Safran CEO Philippe Petitcolin noted planemakers like Boeing typically alter production in incremental steps of 5 aircraft a month.
""It is usually recommended to go up by 5 a month every 6 months, otherwise you can lose everyone (suppliers),"" he said.
He declined to comment directly on Boeing production plans, but his comments suggest the planemaker may not find it easy to reach 57 a month until 2021, even if the MAX is ungrounded this year.
Boeing's current plan implies output increases every four months instead of every six, a rate of change in the supply chain that Petitcolin described as ambitious.
Boeing said any production increases would occur gradually once deliveries resumed, ensuring the health of the supply chain and keeping production systems stable.
""We continue to assess production decisions and always work on plans with our suppliers,"" a spokesman said.
Not all suppliers are exposed to the same pressure. Some have continued to produce at 52 a month during the crisis in order to avoid kinks in production.
Once the grounding is lifted, Boeing has suggested it can deliver 70 MAX aircraft a month, matching the most it has delivered in any previous month.
The actual production rate in its assembly plant may depend on the degree to which Boeing decides to meet this goal directly from the production line or from the hundreds of aircraft now in storage, which have been built during the grounding.
Petitcolin said CFM would work hard to respond to whatever production rate Boeing deemed necessary.
It is also bracing for increased demand for LEAP engines from Europe's Airbus because of increases in CFM sales against rival Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX).
The two engine makers compete for airline contracts to power the Airbus A320neo, while CFM alone powers the MAX.
Pratt & Whitney has been hit by technical problems and recently lost two customers to CFM.

The original A320neo production plan assumed a roughly 50/50 split between CFM and Pratt & Whitney engines, but CFM has been asked to plan for an average of about 55%, executives said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street set course for its third consecutive sell-off on Tuesday as investor optimism over a potential near-term respite from the U.S.-China trade war evaporated following commentary from President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
All three major stock indexes stepped further away from last week's record highs that were fueled by hopes that an interim deal between the United States and China was in the offing.
Those hopes dimmed as President Trump suggested a deal might have to wait until after the 2020 election, and separately, Secretary Ross confirmed that new tariffs on Chinese imports would go into effect on Dec. 15 as scheduled, unless substantial progress was made.
These comments, on the heels of France's threatened retaliation over potential new U.S. duties on French products, itself a retaliation against a proposed French ""digital tax,"" suggested that America's hydra-headed tariff war against its major trading partners would continue to dominate markets for the foreseeable future.
""We've seen this happen numerous times, where there's a trade disappointment and there's a stock market sell-off,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. ""There's disappointment that 'phase 1' (of a U.S.-China deal) has been pushed back.""
Tariff-sensitive chipmakers were down, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index falling 2.0%, on track for its worst day in nearly two months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 357.45 points, or 1.29%, to 27,425.59, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 29.61 points, or 0.95%, to 3,084.26 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 79.97 points, or 0.93%, to 8,488.01.
Nine the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 were in negative territory, with momentum stocks Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN) weighing heaviest.
Financials (SPSY), consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and energy (SPNY) stocks, as well as trade-vulnerable industrial (SPLRCI) and tech (SPLRCT) sectors suffered the largest percentage losses.

Negotiations between the two companies have dragged on for months as the parties debated who should lead the efforts to develop an engine for the strategic Franco-German project.
But in a statement on Tuesday, the companies agreed Safran would be ""prime contractor"" - a term typically used in the defence industry for the company running a project - with MTU billed as ""main partner"" during the initial research phase.
The two firms will then set up a 50/50 venture by end-2021 to manage later stages of the project, including development, production and after-sales support of the new engine.
Safran will take the lead in engine design and integration, and MTU will take the lead in engine services, they said.
There had been reports of concerns in Germany's parliament over Safran being awarded the lead engine role in the project, which was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2017 to deepen defence ties.

537,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 01:46PM ET</span>","U.S. regions hard hit by opioids to ditch class action, pursue own lawsuits","By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del(Reuters) - Local governments in regions hard hit by the U.S. opioid epidemic have opted out of massive litigation taking aim at the drug industry over the crisis, potentially weakening a novel legal mechanism created to help settle thousands of lawsuits.
Overall, 98% of some 34,000 local governments agreed to be bound by a class action against companies such as drug distributor McKesson Corp (N:MCK), drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA), according to a Monday court filing.
However, the 541 local governments that opted out included Florida's Palm Beach County and counties in West Virginia, according to attorneys, raising the prospect that companies could face expensive trials even if they settled with the class. The two regions are among the hardest hit by the crisis, which has contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997.
Officials from Houston's Harris County, one of the largest U.S. counties, have said it would opt out, meaning they would pursue their own lawsuit and not receive funds from a nationwide settlement.
The court filing did not identify opt-outs.
U.S. Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, who has been overseeing 2,600 consolidated opioid lawsuits, is pushing hard for a settlement to help get funds to those most in need in a timely fashion. He approved the novel ""negotiation class"" as a way to reassure companies that any deal to resolve the lawsuits would bind remaining governments and prevent them from filing a case.
The lawsuits generally allege that drugmakers improperly marketed opioids while distributors and pharmacy chains failed to stop suspicious orders. The defendants deny the allegations.
Typical class actions allow members to opt out after a settlement has been reached, but the negotiation class fixes the members first. Any settlement must be approved by 75% of the class.
Lawyers said towns and counties less affected by the crisis had little reason to opt out, while areas ravaged by opioids, like West Virginia, had more incentive to pursue and control their own lawsuit.
The number of opt-outs represented around 20% of those that have already sued and could be significant if it included large cities, according to Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.

Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet cut his rating on the stock to neutral from buy, and price target to $325 from $410. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 1.5%. Some of the decline may be due to Tuesday's market slump.
 
""The bulk of Netflix’s growth stems from net adds (which require high marginal costs on content, marketing and technical expenses),"" Bazinet said. ""In our view, to justify the valuation, the firm needs growth to come from material price hikes,"" he added. In this case, net adds means net new subscribers.
""Over the last eight years, every $1 billion sequential increase in cash content spend results in 7 million net adds,"" Bazinet added. ""Our numbers suggest that if content costs rise, Netflix's equity could fall 15%,"" he added. ""If net add forecasts come down, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) equity could fall 5%.""
The streaming giant, however, is unlikely to hike prices until the majority of Netflix’s U.S. subs are cord-cutters and competition moderates, which would likely take ""many, many years,"" according to Bazinet.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is up about 14% for the year and has an average price target of $363, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com. 
The shares are down about 21% from their 52-week high of $385.99, reached in early May."

DETROIT (Reuters) - British exotic sports car maker McLaren Automotive will bank on expanded sales in Asia and a new generation of hybrid cars as it steers toward a potential public offering, the company's chief executive said on Tuesday.
""We need to put more cars into Asia,"" McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt said in a meeting with reporters in Detroit. Sales of McLaren's carbon fiber and aluminum sports cars, which start at about $200,000 in the United States, have fallen in the United Kingdom, its largest market. Flewitt said that reflects uncertainty over Brexit.
Demand in the United States and in Asian markets outside of China remains strong, he said.
McLaren plans to open dealerships in Vietnam and the Philippines, Flewitt said. ""The next big ones are India and Russia. We're not in either and probably should be.""
Flewitt has said in the past that the owners of the McLaren Group, led by Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund, are considering an initial public offering by 2025. An IPO will likely come after all parts of the group, including McLaren Racing and a unit that markets technology, are generating cash, he said on Tuesday.
Exotic sports car makers have a mixed record on public markets.  Ferrari  NV (MI:RACE) has been one of the auto sector's best-performing stocks, up 68% this year. However, British premium sports car maker  Aston Martin  Lagonda Global Holdings (L:AML) has suffered a 59% decline.
McLaren sold about 4,800 cars in 2018, and is on track for a slightly lower number in 2019, Flewitt said.
An important piece of McLaren's expansion strategy will be unveiled next spring - a hybrid car with a new architecture under the skin. However, McLaren does not plan to follow its rivals into the SUV market.
""We couldn't afford to do it,"" Flewitt said, adding, ""it just doesn't fit the brand.""
By 2024, McLaren will have additional production capacity coming online to increase sales to 6,000 cars a year - if the company can hit that volume without sacrificing profit margins, Flewitt said.
Profitability plays a role in McLaren's decision, so far, not to develop an all-electric car, Flewitt said.
Eventually, the super car niche will go electric, but for McLaren that will have to wait for lighter, lower-cost, solid-state batteries to be ready for commercial use, he said.
""Nobody is out there making money with electric cars,"" he said. ""We can do what we need to do with hybrids."""
540,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 01:28PM ET</span>",Black Friday Can’t Spare Nissan From 16% Drop: Auto Sales Update,"(Bloomberg) -- Black Friday deals likely helped lift U.S. auto sales at most automakers in November, as a bumper crop of old model-year vehicles spurred carmakers to offer record discounts. But it wasn’t enough to spare troubled Nissan Motor Co. from a 15.9% decline.
Total light-vehicle sales in the country probably ran at an adjusted annualized rate of 17.5 million in November, a touch better than 17.4 million a year ago, according to a projection by LMC Automotive and J.D. Power. The market researchers expect industry deliveries to drop to 16.8 million in 2020, from about 17.1 million this year.
It’s not just sales that rose in November, so did prices, which averaged $35,623, up 1.3% from a year ago, according to researcher TrueCar. BMW AG, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Hyundai Motor Co. all saw gains in average transaction prices, driven by popular new models.
To move older model year vehicles from dealer lots, automakers boosted incentive spending by an estimated 12% to $4,538 per vehicle in November, J.D. Power estimated last week, exceeding $4,500 for the first time. Those discounts, plus the later date for this year’s Thanksgiving holiday, was expected to spur some of the best Black Friday deals in years, according to car-shopping researcher Edmunds.
Detroit’s three major manufacturers have stopped reporting monthly numbers, so tallies for November won’t include official figures from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. or Fiat Chrysler. Other automakers generated about 56% of U.S. new-vehicle sales in the first half of the year.
Here are highlights from the automakers that are reporting results for last month:
Nissan Stuck in Reverse
Nissan posted a third straight monthly decline in November, with sales falling below 100,000 vehicles for the first time since July. Deliveries of its top seller, the Rogue SUV, sank 25.5% and demand for the Murano crossover and Frontier pickup also declined by double digits. Only three models notched gains in the month, led by a 37% surge in sales of the Altima sedan.
The automaker has suffered from turmoil in its senior management ranks in Japan and a refocusing of its U.S. business away from reliance on steep discounts and fleet sales.
“It’s going to take a bit of time for us, and we’re not taking any shortcuts to get there,” said David Kershaw, division vice president for the Nissan brand at the company’s U.S. sales unit.
Trucks are Honda’s Heroes
Honda Motor Co. sales soared 11% in November to 133,952 vehicles, paced by demand for sport utility vehicles and trucks.
The automaker’s top-seller, the CR-V crossover, had a record month, and deliveries of the smaller HR-V more than doubled. Sales of the Ridgeline pickup climbed 31%.
Hybrids Power Toyota
Toyota Motor Corp.’s U.S. deliveries jumped 9.2% to 207,857 vehicles, led by a 26% increase for its biggest-volume model, the RAV4 compact SUV. The Tacoma mid-size truck and Camry and Corolla sedans also had strong showings.
The Japanese automaker said nearly a quarter of its 44,665 RAV4 sales were gasoline-electric models. Sales of all Toyota- and Lexus-brand hybrids surged 65% to 27,274 vehicles -- about 13% of total U.S. deliveries.
Hyundai Leans on SUVs
South Korea’s Hyundai reported a solid 6.2% rise in November sales to 60,601 vehicles, its 15th gain in the last 16 months.
SUVs including the compact Tucson and mid-size Santa Fe and Palisade models led the way, but its hybrid and electric vehicles are also on the ascent, soaring 78% for the month."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss cocoa products maker Barry Callebaut (S:BARN) said on Tuesday that 26% of the farmer groups from which it sourced products in 2018/2019 had programmes to prevent child labour,
more than double the figure from the previous year.
Barry Callebaut, whose largest shareholder is the billionaire Jacobs family, added it would eradicate child labour from its supply chain by 2025 and aim for all its ingredients to be from sustainable sources by that point.
It is estimated that more than 2 million children are working on cocoa farms in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, the firm said in its ""Forever Chocolate"" report.
""Poverty keeps farmers from hiring professional workers, forcing them to rely on their family members, including their children, to work the fields,"" the company said.
""As a result, the future generation of cocoa farmers, deprived of their childhood and education, will not be empowered to break this vicious cycle,"" it added.
Activists have criticised chocolate companies for not doing enough to tackle child labour in the industry.
Zurich-based Barry Callebaut, which makes products for customers including Nestle (S:NESN) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), said it reduced its carbon footprint by 6.7%, distributed 2.5 million shade trees and cocoa seedlings and regenerated 3,800 hectares (14.7 square miles) of forest in 2018/19.
""We have reached a milestone this year, sourcing over 50% of all our raw materials from sustainable sources. This includes 47% of sustainably sourced cocoa beans and 54% of non-cocoa raw materials,"" Barry Callebaut said on its website. ""However, we do recognize that we still have many challenges to reach our 100% goal."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Signs that a deal to end the U.S.-China trade war might not come until after the November 2020 elections weighed on global equity markets on Tuesday as investors sought out the perceived safety of bonds. 
Comments by U.S. President Donald Trump that the trade war may last another year came a day after his administration announced new tariffs on steel from Brazil and Argentina and threatened duties of up to 100% on French goods from champagne to handbags because of a digital services tax that Washington says harms U.S. tech companies.
His latest comments appear to dash hopes that an agreement with China could be reached before another round of tariff hikes kicks in on Dec. 15.
“As we get closer to the December 15th deadline for new tariffs being imposed on China, risk markets will likely become increasingly nervous as each day passes if we get no news confirming either a date to sign a phase one deal or a delay in these tariffs being imposed,"" said Mohammed Kazmi, portfolio manager for UBP's Global & Absolute Fixed Income team.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.75% following broad declines in Europe.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 377.44 points, or 1.36%, to 27,405.6, the S&P 500 lost 32.17 points, or 1.03%, to 3,081.7 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 89.40 points, or 1.04%, to 8,478.59.
Europe appeared to be the next theater of the global trade war. 
""If history is any guide, the Europeans are likely to find U.S. crosshairs start to move increasingly their way, the closer to next year’s U.S. election we get,"" CMC Markets told clients.
France said Tuesday it was prepared to push the European Union to respond in kind if the United States followed through on its threats to raise tariffs. 
""In the case of new American sanctions, the European Union would be willing to retaliate,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Radio Classique.
Investors sought out bonds as a safe haven, pushing U.S. Treasuries yields off of two-week highs. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 39/32 in price to yield 1.702%, from 1.836% late on Monday. The rush into Treasuries produced the largest one-day decline in yields since August. 
German bond yields meanwhile, slipped off three-week highs, but bond prices are likely to stay under pressure amid renewed risks of early elections or a minority government in the biggest euro zone economy.
The safe-haven bid was in evidence on currency markets too, with the yen at a one-week high to the dollar. The euro edged away from a near two-week peak versus the greenback. The dollar index slipped to a two-week low.
""This may have run its course, but there's no reason to chase the dollar's upside from here,"" Daiwa Securities' foreign exchange strategist Yukio Ishizuki said, noting weak manufacturing data had forced many to cut long dollar positions.

""Trade friction remains a lingering threat, which is not good for market sentiment.""

547,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 12:31PM ET</span>","U.S. shoppers, mostly online, spend 16% more over holiday weekend","By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A record number of U.S. consumers spent more online and in stores over the holiday weekend for everything from clothing to toys, the National Retail Federation said on Tuesday.
NRF's survey found nearly 190 million people made purchases over the five-day holiday shopping period from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, an increase of roughly 14% from 165 million a year ago. It cited a healthy economy and a condensed holiday shopping season.
The world's largest retail trade association said its survey of 6,746 adult consumers, conducted Wednesday through Monday by research firm Prosper Insights & Analytics, showed that shoppers spent $361.90 on average over the five-day period, up 16 percent from $313.29 during the same period last year.
Shoppers made more purchases online on Black Friday than in the mall - hurting traffic and sales at brick-and-mortar stores, with many retailers offering earlier holiday promotions and year-round discounts. NRF said 124 million people shopped in stores, while roughly 142 million shopped on retailers' websites. For the first time, Black Friday topped Cyber Monday as the busiest day for online shopping, it added.
Black Friday remains important for holiday shopping but its relevance is fading amid early promotions, with six fewer sales days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and a shift toward online shopping.
""Americans continue to start their holiday shopping earlier in the year, and Thanksgiving is still a critical weekend for millions,"" NRF Chief Executive Officer Matt Shay said. He noted that more than half of consumers polled by NRF in the first week of November had begun making purchases.
""With the condensed holiday season, consumers are feeling the pressure to get their shopping done in time."" The NRF stuck to its forecast for retail sales to rise between 3.8% and 4.2% this holiday season from a year ago, for a total of $727.9 billion to $730.7 billion. Craig Johnson, president of retail consultancy Consumer Growth Partners, projected that over the four-day Black Friday weekend, store sales grew by 3%, whereas online sales rose 14% from last year.
He said sales were led by the ""Big Four"" mega-retailers — Walmart (N:WMT), Amazon (O:AMZN), Costco (O:COST) and  Target  (N:TGT), and ""both Black Friday and the full weekend reached record levels..."" Sneakers, laptops, Air Pod Pros, and Frozen 2 merchandise were among the popular items bought over the weekend, he said. Research released on Monday by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Insights, which tracks transactions at 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers, showed total sales for the weekend to be roughly $29 billion. RetailNext, another analytics firm, on Monday said net sales at brick-and-mortar stores fell nearly 1% over the holiday weekend and store traffic was down 4.2%."

Prosecutors said investigators aimed to confiscate documents. Volkswagen, which admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines, said it was fully cooperating with the authorities, but viewed the investigation as unfounded. 
Volkswagen said the raids were linked to an investigation into diesel cars with engine type EA 288, a successor model to the EA 189 which was at the heart of the test cheating scandal.
The carmaker said it had itself disclosed the issue at the center of the new investigation - which is targeting individual employees - to the relevant registration authorities. 
In simulations, vehicles with the EA 288 engine did not indicate a failure of the diesel filter, while still complying with emissions limits, Volkswagen said, adding the engine did not have an illegal defeat device. 
News in 2015 that Volkswagen had used such devices to cheat emissions tests has so far cost the company about 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines, vehicle refits and legal costs, and also triggered a global backlash against diesel vehicles.

Volkswagen said when the scandal broke that about 11 million vehicles worldwide were fitted with the illegal software.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration considered banning China's Huawei from the U.S. financial system earlier this year as part of a host of policy options to thwart the blacklisted telecoms equipment giant, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The plan, which was ultimately shelved, called for placing Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], the world's second largest smartphone producer, on the Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. 
One of the people familiar with the matter, who favors the move, said it could be revived in the coming months depending on how things go with Huawei. 
The plan was considered by the White House National Security Council, and seen by officials as a nuclear option atop a ladder of policy tools to sanction the company, two of the people said. Such a designation can make it virtually impossible for a company to complete transactions in U.S. dollars. 
Administration officials drafted a memo and held interagency meetings on the issue, according to one of the people, showing the extent to which administration officials mulled deploying the United States' most aggressive sanctioning tool against the Chinese company. 
Its use was tabled in favor of other measures, such as placing Huawei on a trade blacklist, which forces some suppliers to obtain a special license to sell to it. 
Huawei did not respond to a request for comment. A Treasury spokesperson said the agency ""does not comment on investigations or prospective actions, including to confirm whether one exists."" 
When asked about the Reuters report during a CNBC interview on Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the United States is ""always considering all sorts of measures against all kinds of companies. But I don’t believe there’s anything imminent this morning on that.” 
Huawei would have been among the largest companies ever added to the list, which has included Russia's Rusal, the world's second largest aluminum company, Russian oligarchs, Iranian politicians and Venezuelan drug traffickers. 
Annie Fixler, a cyber expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, said designating the company ""would have broad, widespread implications for Huawei across the globe,"" noting that its business would be ""severely impacted"" in Europe and in Asia outside of China.
The U.S. government has brought criminal charges against Huawei, alleging theft of trade secrets, bank fraud, violations of U.S. sanctions against Iran, and has sought to convince allies to ban it from 5G networks over spying fears.
But placing the company on the ""SDN list"" would mean a host of logistical, diplomatic and economic difficulties for the U.S. government. 
The designation prohibits American companies or citizens from trading or conducting financial transactions with those listed and freezes assets held in the United States. 
Adding Huawei would therefore hammer U.S. allies that already rely on the company for their 4G networks, since almost all dollar payments clear through U.S. financial institutions. 
The Treasury could grant licenses to exempt U.S. banks involved in those transactions. But it has generally shied away from doing so, concerned that too many exemptions would blunt the strength of the tool, experts said.
Huawei's sprawling size, with dozens of subsidiaries, would significantly complicate enforcement and carve-out efforts, experts said.
""The larger an entity is, the harder it is for a U.S. Administration to foresee and prepare for the major effects, foreign and domestic, that placing it on the SDN list may cause"" said Matthew Tuchband, a former Treasury official who added that careful consideration is needed before designating a company the size of Huawei.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who is seen by many China hawks in the administration as sympathetic to Beijing, has rarely overseen the use of the tool against China, designating a handful of Chinese persons for trafficking in fentanyl and over violations of sanctions against North Korea and Iran.
Nevertheless, some lawmakers still see designating Huawei as worth considering. 
""Given Huawei's relentless drive to dominate the 5G landscape, it is one of the most urgent national security threats facing the free world,"" Republican Congressman Michael Gallagher said. 

""All options should be on the table in order to impose maximum pressure,"" he added.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 11:39AM ET</span>",Nokia names veteran Sari Baldauf as group boss to take on 5G challenge,"By Tarmo Virki
(Reuters) - Telecoms equipment maker Nokia (HE:NOKIA) announced on Tuesday that it plans to appoint its former networks chief Sari Baldauf as chairman, succeeding Risto Siilasmaa who will step down after eight years in the job.
Taking on the top job at Nokia will make Baldauf, 64, one of the most high-profile female executives in the telecoms industry globally. 
She faces the task of catching up with rivals Huawei and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) in 5G, after Nokia in October cut its outlook for this year and next because of the need to step up its investments - news that knocked a third off its share price.
It also suspended dividend payments to conserve cash and pledged to speed up the introduction of new 5G chipsets.
Baldauf headed Nokia's networks unit - now the company's main business - between 1998 and 2005. She has sat on Nokia's board of directors since last year and has also sat on the boards of companies including  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO) and Finnish utility  Fortum  (HE:FORTUM).
""I think it is a hugely positive move to see a woman take such an important role in such a prestigious business,"" said Ben Wood, head of research at UK-based tech consultancy CCS Insight. Wood has followed Nokia for nearly 20 years.
Baldauf said in a statement on Tuesday that she sees a clear opportunity to help create long-term shareholder value, working with CEO Rajeev Suri. 
""Rajeev and his team are working hard to address both the short-term issues and strengthen Nokia's longer-term value drivers,"" she said. 
Her appointment is subject to shareholder approval at the group's annual general meeting in April. 
Baldauf is the last remaining executive from former chairman and CEO Jorma Ollila's team which in the late 1990s built a Finnish company with a tiny tech unit into the world's biggest cellphone maker.
""Nokia is going back to the future! The recent profit warning, dividend cut and 5G lag have rattled the company,"" said Neil Mawston, director at research firm Strategy Analytics.
""Huawei and Ericsson have arguably inched ahead on R&D, and Nokia is feeling the business pressure. Nokia is turning to the old ""dream team"" for help,"" Mawston said.
Siilasmaa, 53, played a central role in revamping Nokia from cellphone maker with a network arm into a top three telecom equipment maker globally. 

Nokia, however, was wrong-footed in waiting for 5G radio standards to come into force late last year, while rivals were quicker to revamp products in anticipation of early rollouts in the United States and South Korea, industry sources and analysts have said.

558,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 10:11AM ET</span>","PG&E Could Have Prevented Deadly California Fire, State Says","(Bloomberg) -- Bankrupt utility giant PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG) for years failed to properly inspect and maintain its transmission system -- an oversight that led a live wire to fall and ignite the deadliest blaze in California history last year, state investigators said.
A PG&E crew hadn’t climbed and inspected the tower and hook that failed, sparking the catastrophic Camp Fire, in 17 years, a California Public Utilities Commission investigation made public Monday shows. The company would’ve discovered that the hook had worn down if it had checked the tower, and its “timely replacement could have prevented” the blaze from happening, the commission’s safety division said in the nearly 700-page report.
“The identified shortcomings in PG&E’s inspection and maintenance of the incident tower were not isolated, but rather indicative of an overall pattern of inadequate inspection and maintenance of PG&E’s transmission facilities,” the agency said in its findings.
The November 2018 Camp Fire killed 85 people, burned down tens of thousands of homes and all but destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise. It ultimately led to PG&E’s undoing, saddling the company with crippling liabilities. In January, the company declared the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history amid an estimated $30 billion in damages tied to that wildfire and a series of others that broke out across Northern California in 2017.
PG&E shares fell as much as 3.7% Tuesday.
PG&E said in an emailed statement that it “accepts” the conclusion in the report that its power line caused the Camp Fire. “We remain deeply sorry about the role our equipment had in this tragedy, and we apologize to all those impacted,” the company said.
California fire investigators had already identified PG&E’s equipment in a previous report as the ignition source of the Camp Fire. The utility commission’s probe revealed more detail on the rules that PG&E broke leading up to the blaze, identifying 12 violations. The findings may result in fines or penalties imposed by the five-member panel.
The district attorney of Butte County, where the Camp Fire broke out, and California’s attorney general were still deciding whether to file criminal charges related to the blaze.
Estimating Liabilities
The report is hitting just as PG&E prepares for a federal court case that will determine exactly how much in wildfire liabilities it’s responsible for. In the coming months, a judge will hold hearings to decide on the size of claims stemming from the Camp fire and 2017 blazes. The outcome could serve as the foundation of a restructuring plan that PG&E hopes will have it emerging from bankruptcy by the middle of next year.
The commission’s report described PG&E’s routine inspections as “inadequate,” failing to detect defective hooks and other equipment prone to failure. One so-called C-hook close to the transmission failure showed a “material loss of over 50%” in one section, according to the investigation.
Based on PG&E’s own maintenance manual, the report said, “this is a hazardous Priority A condition which requires immediate response and continued action until the condition is repaired.” Butte County prosecutors asked the state to collect the hook as evidence.
PG&E said it has accelerated inspections since the 2017 and 2018 blazes and has “completed an unprecedented process to inspect every element of our electric system within the high-threat fire areas.” The company said it has checked almost 730,000 transmission, distribution and substation structures and more than 25 million electrical components in those areas.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's largest pension fund, has suspended stock lending for short selling, calling the practice inconsistent with its responsibilities as a long-term investor.
The move, announced by the GPIF on Tuesday, is a blow for short sellers, who rely on securities lending to bet against companies and who are facing renewed moves in a number of countries to curb their activities.
""The current stock lending scheme lacks transparency in terms of who is the ultimate borrower and for what purpose they are borrowing,"" the GPIF said on its website.
The move by the fund will affect shares in its 42.5 trillion yen ($391.20 billion) foreign equities portfolio.
Japanese and overseas shares account for half of the GPIF's 160 trillion yen worth of assets. It said it will continue to lend debt securities and may reconsider the halt to foreign stock lending if it sees an improvement in transparency. It does not lend its holdings of domestic shares.
Short sellers borrow shares and immediately sell them, betting the price will fall before they buy back the shares and return them, pocketing the difference.
Advocates see them as a healthy counterbalance to investor over-confidence and corporate spin. Critics argue they are destabilizing because they have an incentive to drive down a company's share price.
Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (O:TSLA), a popular target for short sellers, was quick to applaud the GPIF's move.
""Bravo, right thing to do! Short selling should be illegal,"" the high tech entrepreneur said in a tweet. 
Musk has previously criticized fund managers for lending shares for hedge funds to short, saying the fund firms made ""excessive profit"" from the practice.
Securities lending has emerged as a small but significant source of extra returns for funds. GPIF earned 37.58 billion yen ($345.91 million) in fees from lending shares from its foreign equity portfolio over three years to the end of its 2018 financial year.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, reported total securities lending revenue of $597 million in 2017, compared with $579 million in 2016, according to a securities filing.

In the July-September quarter, GPIF reported a profit of 1.8 trillion yen. Amid Japan's ultra-low interest rates, the fund, which is closely watched by global investors, has retreated from unprofitable domestic bonds in favor of foreign assets.

The lender took the charge, which was C$484 million ($364 million) before taxes, mostly for severance payments as it eliminated 810 full-time positions, or 1.7% of its workforce, in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Chief Executive Officer Darryl White cited a “clear bank-wide focus on disciplined expense management” while announcing earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. The Toronto-based bank has “a number of initiatives under way, including today’s announcement of a restructuring charge, that will serve to accelerate our momentum and help us meet our efficiency objectives over the long-term,” he said in a statement Tuesday.
The latest restructuring charge -- which follows one taken in the second quarter of 2018, also tied to severances -- included a small amount of real-estate related costs and is part of White’s efforts to improve efficiencies at what has been Canada’s least-efficient bank. The company’s adjusted efficiency ratio -- a measure of what it costs to produce a dollar of revenue -- was 60% in the fourth quarter, down from 62.2% a year earlier, as the lender moves toward White’s target of 58% or better by the end of fiscal 2021.
“It is difficult for us to credit good expense control in the face of yet another restructuring charge from this bank, this time approaching C$500 million,” CIBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Sedran said in a note to clients. “However, the underlying segment performance was solid with improving volume growth, positive operating leverage and stable credit quality. A decent result.”
The job cuts were mostly in Canada and are the deepest since the last large round of reductions in May 2016, when it announced a 4% cut to its workforce, amounting to about 1,850 jobs. The bank had 45,513 employees as of the end of October, down from 46,323 at the end of July. The latest move comes about six months after the bank eliminated about 100 jobs across its capital-markets division.
Earnings Decline
The restructuring costs contributed to a 30% decline in net income in the quarter, with the bank posting earnings of C$1.19 billion, or C$1.78 a share. Adjusted per-share earnings were C$2.43, beating the C$2.41 average estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The bank raised its quarterly dividend 2.9% to C$1.06 a share.
Wealth management led profit growth in the quarter, with a 22% increase in earnings from the year earlier, while Canadian and U.S. banking also gained. Earnings from the company’s BMO Capital Markets unit fell 9.7% amid a tougher year for dealmaking.
Also in the earnings announcement:
Wealth management had its best quarter for profit growth since last year, with earnings of C$267 million, helping lift annual net income to C$1.06 billion. The bank aims to get C$2 billion in annual profit from wealth management by 2023.Earnings from Canadian personal-and-commercial banking, Bank of Montreal’s biggest business, rose 6.2% to C$716 million.In the U.S. banking division, which includes Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, earnings climbed 5.6% to C$393 million in the quarter, even after the impact of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Net interest margins in the U.S. division narrowed to 3.35%, the lowest since at least 2010.Earnings from BMO Capital Markets fell 9.7% to C$269 million on a decline in revenue from investment banking fees and trading."

(Reuters) - At an invitation-only gathering late last year, U.S. regulators and their guests huddled at a hotel near Washington, D.C., to discuss the best way to detect cancer-causing asbestos in talc powders and cosmetics.
The “Asbestos in Talc Symposium,” sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration, was dominated by industry hands: Most of the 21 non-government participants had done work for talc companies, such as testing and serving as expert witnesses and consultants, symposium documents and other records show.
Key sessions were led by witnesses for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in lawsuits alleging the company failed to warn customers that its Baby Powder was tainted with cancer-causing asbestos, the records show. Others who sought invitations were turned away, including a physician who had testified against J&J in trials that resulted in billions of dollars in damage awards against the company.
History was repeating itself.
Over the past 50 years, the FDA has relied upon - and often deferred to - industry even as outside experts and consumers repeatedly raised serious health concerns about talc powders and cosmetics, a Reuters investigation found.
Again and again since at least the 1970s, the agency has downplayed the risk of asbestos contamination and declined to issue warnings or impose safety standards, according to documents produced in court proceedings and in response to public records requests.
The agency said it lacks the authority to require manufacturers to test for asbestos in talc or report any results. And it seldom has ordered its own tests - until recently.
Amid heightened scrutiny in Congress, a criminal investigation of J&J and costly jury verdicts against the company, the regulator commissioned tests that found asbestos in 11 talc-based cosmetics, including Johnson’s Baby Powder. J&J recalled 33,000 bottles.
Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois congressman who chairs a U.S. House subcommittee investigating talc safety, told Reuters it was time for regulators to stop relying on manufacturers’ safety assurances.
“When something as serious as cancer or carcinogens are at issue,” Krishnamoorthi said, “self-regulation doesn’t make a lot of sense.”
In written responses to questions from Reuters, the FDA said its resources and authority to regulate the cosmetic industry are limited. The agency said it has no power to ensure the safety of cosmetics before they are put on store shelves, nor to force companies to pull them off when potential hazards are discovered.
“We are dependent on manufacturers to take steps to ensure the safety of their products,” the FDA said after announcing a voluntary recall of tainted cosmetics in March.
FDA officials declined to comment on the decisions of former employees over the years, saying only that the agency relies on the best information available and that studies “have improved our understanding of how and why asbestos fibers are hazardous.”
The agency said it now recognizes, as the World Health Organization and other public health agencies did years ago, that there is no known safe level of asbestos. FDA officials said their current policy is to act swiftly - and if necessary encourage recalls - even when small amounts are discovered.
The regulator has stood by its recent tests of Johnson’s Baby Powder, despite pushback from the company.
J&J, the world’s largest producer of talc powders, said in a statement that it recalled the 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder out of an “abundance of caution.” Eleven days later, the company announced that tests by labs it hired had determined that there was no asbestos - other than some contamination it said came from an air conditioner - in samples from the one bottle tested by the FDA and the batch it came from.
In written responses to Reuters, J&J said it systematically tests its talc and has always found its powders to be safe and pure. “Throughout the 1970s and '80s, the FDA and other regulatory bodies defended talc,” J&J's Chief Executive Alex Gorsky testified in an Oct. 3 deposition. “FDA agreed overall with the position that we had taken with the safety of our talc.”
The company told Reuters that it “has long cooperated (with) and supported the FDA in its mission to protect the public health,” and that any suggestion it has unduly influenced the agency to reduce regulation or standards is “just false.”
The FDA now is under increasing pressure to ensure talc powders and cosmetics are free from asbestos. The agency’s testing of talc-based cosmetics this year followed jury verdicts totaling more than $5 billion against J&J in cancer lawsuits, as well as a Dec. 14 Reuters report showing that J&J knew its raw talc and powders sometimes tested positive for asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s and did not report those findings to the agency. 
J&J has disputed the Reuters report as ""one-sided, false and inflammatory.""
In the wake of the Reuters report, the company announced it was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to people familiar with the matter, these include a criminal grand jury probe into how forthright J&J has been about the safety of its powders.
'NO HEALTH HAZARD'
The FDA began looking into talc safety in 1971 after researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York found what appeared to be asbestos in unnamed brands of talc powder.
Two years later, FDA records show, the agency found asbestos in a sample of Shower to Shower, a J&J powder at the time that was made with the same talc as Johnson’s Baby Powder. The FDA never publicly announced the finding.
J&J told Reuters the result was not final, citing findings in an FDA table issued in 1976. But that table, reviewed by Reuters, is ambiguous, listing no result for the type of asbestos found in 1973. 
J&J told Reuters the gap means no asbestos was found. 
Assured by J&J and other manufacturers that their talc was safe, the FDA eventually ended its inquiry without taking action because “the potential hazard did not warrant a recall,” Heinz J. Eiermann, a former J&J researcher who at the time ran the agency’s cosmetics division, wrote in a March 1976 memo.
That same year, J&J, other talc companies and their trade group, the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association, persuaded FDA officials that manufacturers could monitor the safety of their own products, according to records J&J and the group produced in litigation.
The FDA dropped plans to impose testing and purity standards for talc powders and cosmetics. The trade group published its own test, which was voluntary for companies to use. The written standard for that test acknowledges that it cannot detect most types of asbestos at low levels, nor one common type - chrysotile - at all.
In a statement to Reuters, the trade group said it believed that chrysotile was not commonly linked to talc used in cosmetics.
Chrysotile is the type of asbestos the FDA-commissioned test found in Baby Powder this year. It also was found in several tests conducted by labs for J&J on its talc from 1972 through 2003, according to records produced in litigation. J&J has said that some of the tests were on industrial talc and that others, on Baby Powder talc, reflected background contamination.
Asbestos is a loose term for a group of six minerals that readily separate into needles or fibers. Easily inhaled, they are known to cause lung, ovarian and other types of cancer. While most people exposed never get cancer, for some even small amounts are enough to trigger the disease. Just how small has not been established.
'A BIG ISSUE'
Talc safety concerns resurfaced in 1983 when a graduate student scouring geology journals for a toxicology class came across information he considered disturbing: Talc deposits are commonly laced with asbestos, a similar mineral.
Philippe Douillet immediately thought of the talc powder his sister used on her baby, he recalled in an interview with Reuters. He urged her to stop using it. Then he petitioned the FDA to require an asbestos warning on talc powders.
“It was really obvious to me there was a big issue there,” said Douillet, who now runs a biotechnology company in Miami.
When the FDA began evaluating Douillet’s petition, it looked to J&J for key information, agency records show. The FDA’s June 1985 risk assessment relied upon a decade-old letter from the company for the agency’s estimate of the amount of dust babies were exposed to during diapering.
That 1974 letter from J&J to the FDA said that, hypothetically, even if babies were exposed to talc powder with as much as 1% asbestos, it would be a far lower concentration than allowed at the time for industrial workers.
J&J told Reuters in a statement that “at no point has Johnson & Johnson taken the position that it would consider talc containing 1% asbestos appropriate for sale to consumers.” 
In the end, the FDA decided there was no need for an asbestos warning on talc powders. In a July 1986 letter to Douillet, acting associate FDA commissioner J.W. Swanson wrote that the quality of cosmetic talc had improved “and that even when asbestos was present, the levels were so low that no health hazard existed.”
What’s more, Swanson wrote, agency officials had come to question earlier reported findings of asbestos in talc powders. Those doubts, he wrote, were based in part on a paper published in the proceedings of a 1977 scientific conference.
Both of the paper’s authors had worked for J&J, one as an asbestos testing contractor and the other as its longtime talc supply manager. The authors argued that some testing methods were apt to misidentify microscopic lookalike rock splinters as asbestos. The industry’s test, the paper said, was designed to avoid this confusion.
Other U.S. and European public health authorities have come to regard such splinters as presumptive toxins because of their similarity to asbestos.
The FDA defended its 1986 decision to reject Douillet’s petition. In a statement, it said the graduate student “did not provide persuasive evidence that the cosmetic talc produced at the time contained significant amounts of asbestos minerals.”
NOT A PRIORITY
Eight years later, the regulator received a new request for a warning label on talc powders. This one came from Dr. Samuel Epstein, a University of Illinois environmental medicine professor who chaired the Cancer Prevention Coalition, an advocacy group.
Epstein’s 1994 petition didn’t concern asbestos. It raised the possibility that talc, by itself, was a hazard worthy of a warning label. His petition was based on research showing that talc, when used as an antiperspirant and deodorant in underwear, was associated with ovarian cancer.
In a brief July 1995 letter, FDA acting cosmetics chief John Bailey told Epstein's coalition that the agency had taken no action because it had other priorities.
Bailey told Reuters in a statement that he issued this “interim” response because the petition lacked scientific support.
In 2002, having taken no action on the petition, Bailey moved to the cosmetic trade group, now known as Personal Care Products Council. The council considered him a “key employee” because of his “former employment with the FDA,” according to a tax filing by the group.
Now a consultant, Bailey serves as a litigation expert witness to J&J and other talc companies. In his statement to Reuters, Bailey said he had been hired at the council “as a scientist responsible for applying sound science to decision making.” He disputed Reuters’ finding that the FDA deferred to industry, saying the agency takes potential health concerns seriously and does its own evaluations.
In 2006, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified use of talc powder in the perineum area - the pelvic region between the legs - as “possibly carcinogenic.” Two years later, Illinois medical scientist Epstein filed a second petition to the FDA seeking a cancer warning label on talc products.
J&J went to work to defeat it. In a May 2008 email to colleagues, J&J executive Kathleen K. Wille wrote: “Our response could be a potential source of data and information on which the FDA can base their response.”
Together, J&J, its talc supplier and the Personal Care Products Council arranged for a pair of scientists to assess the published studies that linked talc and ovarian cancer, according to emails and other records produced in litigation. The scientists concluded that the evidence was too weak to consider talc as a cause.
At a May 2009 meeting, Bailey, Wille and other industry representatives briefed FDA officials on the assessment, according to a meeting memo produced in litigation by J&J’s talc supplier.
Three days later, Wille told colleagues in an email, “We have every confidence that the FDA will dismiss this petition once they have reviewed our submission.”
J&J told Reuters in a statement that the company had been confident because it believed the agency would be swayed by science, which it said supported J&J’s position that talc does not cause ovarian cancer.
Before the FDA ruled on the warning requests, however, concerns about asbestos contamination flared again. This time, the FDA’s South Korean counterpart reported finding asbestos in talc powders.
Acting on that 2009 report, the FDA commissioned talc tests for the first time in 40 years, hiring Maryland-based AMA Analytical Services Inc, which analyzed 34 samples of talc powders and cosmetics, including Johnson’s Baby Powder. It found no asbestos in any of them.
The lab had no experience testing for asbestos in talc. Its prior work focused on building materials such as vinyl flooring, according to the deposition testimony of AMA lab director Andreas Saldivar.
The FDA has said Saldivar’s lab used “the most sensitive techniques available” but cautioned that the results were limited to the 34 talc powders and cosmetics tested.
The testing had other limitations as well. Saldivar’s lab looked at less talc per sample than other labs that have found asbestos in talc powders. And it did its work in a fraction of the time typical for such analyses, according to a Reuters review of the lab report and interviews with experts who test talc for asbestos. 
Saldivar’s lab was recently rehired by the FDA. This time, it found the asbestos that led to the first recall of J&J’s iconic Baby Powder. Saldivar declined to comment.
DUTY TO WARN
In the first verdict of its kind, a South Dakota jury found in October 2013 that J&J had a duty to warn women that research had linked its talc powder to ovarian cancer. No damages were awarded.
Then the FDA weighed in on the issue. In April 2014, 20 years after Epstein first contacted the agency, the FDA rejected both of his petitions for warning labels. Its announcement said the science wasn’t strong enough to support a cancer warning, echoing the assessment J&J and its industry partners had presented to the agency in 2009.
In court, such arguments have not always proved convincing. In early 2016, a Missouri jury concluded J&J’s powders caused a woman’s ovarian cancer death and awarded her survivors $72 million. An appellate court later set that verdict aside, ruling that the woman had filed her suit in the wrong state.
In the aftermath, the FDA asked J&J for “safety literature and data regarding talc,” correspondence shows. The company submitted a report saying no asbestos had “ever been found during any testing” of its talc.
Since then, lawsuits have compelled J&J to produce internal documents that show the company knew its talc and powders had tested positive for asbestos on occasion for decades.
The company now faces more than 16,000 lawsuits alleging that its powders caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, an incurable cancer. The vast majority are awaiting trial. In court, there have been mixed verdicts, mistrials and some appellate rulings in J&J’s favor.
Last year, in response to renewed asbestos concerns, FDA cosmetics chief Linda Katz began organizing the November 2018 symposium and a public hearing on talc testing, now planned for next year.
She reached out to J&J for help. J&J vice president Jethro Ekuta responded by sending Katz a letter in June 2018 recommending a list of three talc testing experts. All three had served as defense witnesses or consultants for J&J.
Two of the experts Ekuta recommended, as well as a third J&J defense witness, led sessions at the closed-door “Asbestos in Talc Symposium” on Nov. 28, 2018. None of the sessions were led by medical experts who had questioned the safety of talc powders and cosmetics.
J&J said that apart from recommending experts, it did not advise the FDA on the symposium. Ekuta, who has left J&J, declined to comment.
NOT INVITED
In a statement to Reuters, the FDA downplayed its role in the symposium, saying the event was “hosted” by the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (JIFSAN), a research group co-founded by the FDA. “No formal or regulatory recommendations were expected or made,” the agency said.
In fact, records show, the FDA initiated and paid for the meeting, set the agenda and chose the participants.
The meeting set the stage for formal recommendations on how to test products used every day by millions of people. The FDA said a government committee tasked with proposing a standard test for asbestos in talc powders and cosmetics is “continuing to work through issues discussed at the JIFSAN symposium.”
Many FDA meetings are held in public and invite comment. Details on the talc symposium were hard to come by, however, even after it was over.
The FDA declined Reuters’ requests to provide a list of participants or any information on what transpired. After Reuters filed a public records request with JIFSAN, the research group posted meeting information online and released planning emails.
The guest list showed that more than half of the 54 participants were employed by or recently retired from FDA and other agencies. Of the 21 non-government participants, 17 had either worked for talc companies, done lab testing or served as expert witnesses for the industry, Reuters found. Five of the participants affiliated with talc companies also have served as expert witnesses for plaintiffs. Most of the non-government participants were experts in geology or minerals testing.
In a statement, the FDA said it would ordinarily avoid having sessions led by defense or plaintiff witnesses. However, the agency said there are a “limited number of experts worldwide with scientific knowledge” on asbestos testing, standards and results analysis.
Not everyone was welcome.
Among those turned away was Dr. David Egilman, a clinical professor of family medicine at Brown University. He testified last year in a trial that ended in a $4.69 billion verdict for women alleging J&J’s talc powders caused their ovarian cancers.
Egilman told Reuters he was concerned that if the FDA was guided by geologists and industry consultants, it might overlook fundamental questions about which mineral fibers cause cancer. He wanted to offer his expertise, as a physician and researcher, on what technicians should look for under the microscope.
Testing hinges “on the determination of what particles or elements should be tested for,” he wrote in a November 2018 email to organizers asking to be included in the symposium. “This is a medical question and not a technical question.”
Katz took a different view. In an email forwarded to Egilman, she said: “This meeting is not intended to discuss health-related issues or concerns.” She met with Egilman later.
Katz also told Egilman that the symposium was not intended to reach any consensus. At its conclusion, however, session leaders, including three who have served as defense witnesses for J&J, drafted what they called “consensus” or “concurrence” reports.
Two of the reports reviewed by Reuters embraced industry positions on what fibers should be counted as hazardous, an issue of fierce contention in courtrooms across the country. The reports discouraged counting fibers that may or may not be asbestos, saying that doing so might exaggerate the hazard.
That view runs contrary to the positions of other U.S. and European public health officials, who presume mineral fibers that even look like asbestos are toxic.
As Arnold Brody, a professor emeritus at Tulane University Medical School, told jurors in a talc powder trial last year, “The lung doesn’t care"" what it's called.
These issues are likely to be aired at the public hearing the FDA said it is planning for next year. The gathering could signal how the agency intends to navigate between industry and consumer interests in coming years.
Krishnamoorthi, the congressman heading the House investigation into talc safety, said the agency needs to bring consumers and their advocates into the discussion.

“In light of the public interest around this particular issue,” he said, “we need to find out what’s going on.”

(Reuters) - Bankrupt California power producer PG&E Corp (N:PCG) did not properly inspect and replace transmission lines before a faulty wire sparked a wildfire that killed more than 80 people in 2018, a probe by a state regulator has concluded. 
The Caribou-Palermo transmission line was identified as the cause of the Camp Fire last year, which virtually incinerated the Northern California town of Paradise and stands as the state's most lethal blaze.
""PG&E failed to maintain an effective inspection and maintenance program to identify and correct hazardous conditions on its transmission lines ... as are necessary to promote the safety and health of its patrons and the public,"" a 700-page report by the California Public Utilities Commission said. 
The report was dated Nov. 8, 2019. It was released to the public on Monday. 
The probe concluded that PG&E's inspection shortcomings were part of a pattern of 'inadequate' execution of those tasks. 
In response to the report, PG&E acknowledged the role of its equipment in the fire and apologized. 
""We remain deeply sorry about the role our equipment had in this tragedy, and we apologize to all those impacted by the devastating Camp Fire,"" the company told Reuters in an emailed statement, adding that it accepted the probe's conclusion that the company's electrical transmission lines caused that fire.
The utility filed for bankruptcy in January, citing potential civil liabilities of more than $30 billion from wildfires linked to its gear.
Last week, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali ruled that PG&E is strictly liable for fires tied to its equipment, even if the utility was not negligent.
PG&E was fined $1.6 billion for a deadly 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, California.

""In some ways, I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal, but they want to make a deal now and we will see whether or not the deal is going to be right,"" Trump told reporters in London. 
The news was a sharp change in tone from assurances over the last two weeks that the two countries had a ""consensus"" on the major points of a 'phase-1' deal. Adding to the sour mood, The Global Times reported that China will release a blacklist of ""unreliable entities"" that appears set to include U.S. companies, in what would be a direct retaliation to Trump's signing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act last week.
Tensions also rose with Europe, after France said it would retaliate if the White House follows through on additional tariffs on French imports. The Trump administration is considering the tariffs in response to France’s digital services tax. ING analysts said it's not clear whether Trump has the legal authority to impose the tariffs, after missing a six-month deadline to do so in November.

Gou, Taiwan's richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion according to Forbes, stepped down as chief of Foxconn this year, handing over the running of the company to an operations committee.
But he retained a seat on the board of the company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd.
Gou, who is attending the White House Christmas party as part of his 10-day trip, met Trump in Washington in May to discuss the Taiwanese company's planned investment in Wisconsin.
He told reporters at Taipei airport he has two meetings arranged with administration officials about investment, and wants to discuss the China-U.S. trade war to try and ""understand when there will be a fairly good conclusion"".
Trump, however, will be more interested in the Wisconsin investment, Gou added, sitting by a cap with a Taiwanese and U.S. flag on it and the words ""Make America great again"" - a popular slogan of Trump's.
""If I bump into him I'll tell him about the progress,"" Gou said.
Foxconn is finding it hard to find workers, given the low unemployment rate in the United States, he added.
""In Wisconsin it's not easy to find this year's target of 500 people. It's very difficult.""
Foxconn pledged to create 13,000 jobs and build a $10 billion campus in Wisconsin, including factories, but it has not met early hiring targets and has said it has been reconsidering its plans.
The planned 20-million-square-foot campus in southeastern Wisconsin had been hailed by the White House as the largest investment for a brand new location by a foreign-based company in U.S. history and proof that Trump was reviving American manufacturing.
But Foxconn's changing plans have raised doubts about how many jobs it will create.
Foxconn initially sought to manufacture advanced large-screen displays for TVs and other consumer and professional products at the Wisconsin site.
It later said it would build smaller Generation 6 liquid crystal display screens instead and is currently constructing a nearly 1 million-square-foot facility that will begin production in 2020's 4th quarter."

573,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2019 05:18AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Unicredit Buyback May Be a Big Moment for Eurozone Banks,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The headline news looks dire, but an arcane detail in the accompanying documents suggests that Unicredit is about to turn a corner – and that other European banks may follow it.
Italy’s second-largest bank said Tuesday it will cut 8,000 jobs and close 500 branches, the latest in a long line of restructuring measures by Europe’s banks this year aimed at slimming down networks made uneconomic by digitalization and negative interest rates.
However, the more eye-catching part of the bank’s new four-year plan is its intention to buy back 2 billion euros in shares – its first buyback in a decade. That’s a radical departure from the trend of the last 10 years in which Unicredit and most other banks have been furiously trying to accumulate capital.
Unicredit’s plan would allow it to pay out 40% of underlying net profit, double its previous target. The total payout, including dividends and buybacks could rise to 50% in 2023.
The bank’s shares rose as much as 2% in early trading in Milan before falling back to be up 0.9% by 5 AM ET (1000 GMT), still the best performing bank stock in Europe on a morning when most bourses were under pressure from President Donald Trump’s latest tariff salvo. The Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.2% while the FTSE MIB was up 0.4% and the French CAC 40, where most of the luxury names targeted by Trump are concentrated, was down 0.5%.
The big question is whether Unicredit’s regulators at the ECB will agree. The obvious answer is that it’s highly unlikely CEO Jean-Pierre Mustier would risk the embarrassment of rejection, and that, privately, ECB supervisors have already indicated they will support the request.
Indeed, the whole plan appears predicated on the assumption that the ECB is going to loosen its approach to measuring bank capital requirements in a manner that is arcane, but important for shareholders. Under its previous head Daniele Nouy, the ECB’s Supervisory Board had broadly insisted that so-called Pillar 2 capital requirements (set on a bank-by-bank basis according to an institute’s risk profile) must be satisfied with common equity – even though EU law allows banks to use subordinated debt instruments instead.
Under the new plan, Unicredit would only have the space to buy back shares if it is allowed to exploit the freedom it has under that regulation to use so-called Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments. Obviously, what is good for shareholders is bad for holders of the bank’s existing AT1 and T2 instruments, who now must reckon with the bank issuing much more of the same paper.
Certainly, the personnel at the top of the ECB have taken a more pragmatic appearance in the last year. Nouy was succeeded by Andrea Enria, an Italian who designed a series of stress tests at the European Banking Authority that were more conspicuous for their mercy than their rigor.
Moreover, Italy is about to dispatch a fierce advocate for its banking sector to Frankfurt to serve on the ECB’s directorate, having nominated Fabio Panetta, currently deputy governor of the Bank of Italy, to replace the Frenchman Benoit Coeure at the end of the year. Panetta was quoted by newswires on Thursday as telling the European Parliament that ""we have to stimulate bank profitability"" - something that Mario Draghi always insisted was not part of the ECB's mandate. 
Panetta's nomination reportedly contributed to the decision by German banking hawk Sabine Lautenschlaeger to resign her seat in September. Lautenschlaeger was replaced by Isabel Schnabel, whose career outside of the Deutsche Bundesbank has kept her immune to that institution’s profound scepticism toward the ECB.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India is considering setting an experience threshold for pilots who fly Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX planes, as it moves to ensure safety once the aircraft returns to service, a senior official of the air safety regulator told Reuters.
The 737 MAX, the fastest-selling plane in the history of Boeing, has been grounded worldwide since March, after 346 people were killed in two crashes in five months.
Boeing is making software changes, readying a new pilot training plan and must run a key certification test flight to get approval from the U.S. regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), before the planes can resume flying.
India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) may consider mandating a minimum number of flying hours for pilots of the 737 MAX, the source said, adding a decision would be made once it is clear when the planes are fit to return to the air.
""Pilot training is a serious matter for the DGCA and the airlines will also need to work on building pilot confidence,"" said the source, who sought anonymity, as the discussions were private.
The regulator will also make it mandatory for Boeing to set up simulators in India and for airlines to carry out comprehensive pilot training before it allows the planes to start flying, the source added.
Reuters could not immediately reach the DGCA to seek comment.
In a statement, Boeing said it was working closely with global regulators on a training program to help enhance pilots' understanding of the updated 737 MAX flight control systems.
""Boeing will continue its commitment to developing training that supports safe, efficient operations and meets regulatory requirements,"" it said in the emailed statement.
India's DGCA is one of several regulators that have indicated they will perform independent inspections of the grounded planes once the U.S. FAA clears them to fly.
Indian carrier SpiceJet (BO:SPJT) has about a dozen Boeing 737 MAX planes in its fleet and 155 on order - among the largest single orders for the narrow-body plane.
Boeing had delivered close to 400 of the 737 MAX globally before the March grounding, and it has nearly 5,000 orders for the aircraft, a more fuel-efficient version of its best-selling single-aisle 737 series."

The fund, dubbed NB Renaissance Partners III, was launched last year and is seeking deals in Europe's fourth-largest economy in sectors that include industrials, pharmaceuticals, aerospace and technology.
New York-based Neuberger Berman has amassed 670 million euros ($738 million) for its latest Italy-focused fund, one of the sources said.
Neuberger Berman, which has not previously disclosed the target size of the fund, declined to comment.
In its previous Italy-focused fund, the buyout firm raised 300 million euros from investors in 2017, while the inaugural fund raised 620 million euros in 2015.
Neuberger Berman's investments in Italy include Engineering-Ingegneria Informatica, an information-technology company; Alfasigma, a pharmaceutical firm; and Farnese Vini, a manufacturer of wines and spirits.

MILAN (Reuters) - In the red corner is Italy's reigning cookie champion, Barilla's Gocciola. Across the ring in the blue corner is the challenger, Ferrero's Nutella Biscuit. Fight!
After clashing over chocolate spreads, Italy's two biggest food companies, Barilla and Ferrero, are now battling about biscuits.
Ferrero is the challenger this time, launching the Nutella cookie in an attempt to crack Barilla's leadership of the biscuit sector in Italy, where the latter has a 37% market share with products including top-seller Gocciola.
The newcomer is made of pastry and filled with Ferrero's flagship chocolate spread, which was invented by the family-owned food company in 1964.
But Barilla is defending its corner, and is itself preparing to launch a new cookie in a similar vein to Nutella Biscuit: Biscocrema, made of a cocoa cookie covered with Barilla's own spread and topped with a chocolate disk with a white star.
The showdown is the reverse of the state of play in the spreads sector, where Barilla introduced chocolate spread Crema di Pan di Stelle in January to challenge the dominance of Nutella, which has a market share of more than 80% in Italy.
FERRERO'S FIGHTING TALK
""We want Nutella Biscuit to be the best-selling cookie in Italy, reaching annual sales of around 80 million euros,"" Ferrero Chief Executive for Italy Alessandro d'Este said when he presented the cookie last month.
But Barilla, which is known worldwide for its pasta, does not want to talk about a battle among cookies.
""Biscocrema is more an indulgence product than a biscuit for breakfast ... that's why we are looking at expanding the overall cookie category with it more than competing with others,"" Barilla's senior marketing executive Julia Schwoerer said at an event to present the new product on Friday.
For Italians, who normally eat biscuits at breakfast, the two cookies offer a sweet snack between meals and could expand the overall biscuit market, which is currently worth 1.2 billion euros ($1.32 billion) in annual sales.
NEXT UP: WORLD CHAMP OREO
The two new cookies could also appeal to customers outside Italy, where biscuits are more often eaten as snacks.
The global market for cookies, worth $73.7 billion according to market research provider Euromonitor International, is dominated by Mondelez (O:MDLZ) with its creme-filled Oreo.
Ferrero's Nutella Biscuits went on sale in Italy last month and the company has already started to sell them in France and aims to gradually spread them across Europe.
Barilla, which will start selling Biscocrema in Italy in January, does not as yet have concrete plans for foreign markets."

In September, it named a new chief executive officer and said it would separate the UK operations in a bid to focus more on its business in the United States, its largest market.
Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP disclosed a 6% stake in the company in June. It is among the best known U.S. activist hedge funds that take stakes in companies they view as undervalued and force major changes to generate returns for shareholders.
""Ferguson continued to take market share against a backdrop of flat U.S. markets and we remain firmly focused on maximizing organic revenue growth, while tightly managing gross margins and costs,"" CEO Kevin Murphy said.
For the full year, Ferguson kept its outlook unchanged and said the planned demerger of  Wolseley  UK is expected to be completed in 2020.
However, the Virginia-based firm, which mainly serves the repair, maintenance and improvement markets, said its U.S. gross margins were slightly lower in the quarter, blaming tough comparisons from last year.
For Wolseley UK, which has been reported as non-ongoing operations, organic revenue dropped 4.2% due to uncertainty in the repair, maintenance and improvement markets, it said.

A 6.2% increase in the U.S., its most important market, was the biggest driver, coming despite what CEO Kevin Murphy called “flat” trading conditions there.
“Our order books support continued modest revenue growth in the months ahead,” Murphy said, reiterating the company’s existing guidance.

Fast fashion group boohoo.com (LON:BOOH) said it had had a record performance over the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend, boasting a “strong operational performance” at both its warehouses.
As such, it said it “continues to trade comfortably in line with market expectations.”
The company said it has successfully integrated the Karen Millen, Coast and Miss Pap brands into its platform since buying them earlier this year.
Boohoo’s next update is scheduled for Jan. 14.

AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) said it has agreed to sell the U.S. and Canadian commercial rights for its off-patent drug Seroquel to Germany’s Cheplapharm Arzneimittel for an initial $35 million.
The price may rise to $41 million contingent on future sales of the drug, which is used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
Cineworld (LON:CINE) revised its outlook for the full year “slightly” lower, without giving any more precise guidance, after a quarter dominated by a 12% currency-adjusted global drop in box office takings in the first 11 months of the year.
Revenue from U.S. theaters fell 14%, while the U.K. and Ireland held up better with only an 8.1% drop, while takings from the Rest of the World rose 1.2%.
Despite the disappointing numbers, Cineworld said the benefits from its acquisition of Regal cinemas were greater than it had expected. It now expects synergies of $190 million from that deal, rather than the $150 million initially expected.
It also added that its U.S. refurbishment program is on track, and that it expects 20 new sites to be completed within the next 12 months."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A long-running dispute between two Australian partners in an oil field off Senegal is set to be resolved this month, just as the companies look to sign off on a $4.2 billion plan to develop the West African nation's first oil project.
Oil minnow Far Ltd has been mired in a bitter row over the acquisition by Woodside Petroleum of a 35% stake in the Sangomar oil field from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) for $350 million in 2016.
Far went to the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris in June 2017 seeking arbitration to resolve the dispute. A ruling is due by Dec. 28.
WHAT'S AT STAKE?
For Woodside the Sangomar project, formerly known as SNE, is key to boosting its output from 2023, ahead of two mega projects in Australia.
For minority partner Far, which discovered the field in the largest oil find of 2014, the development is set to be a company-maker.
Far contends it was not allowed to exercise its right to pre-empt the sale of Conoco's stake in the joint venture. If it had, Far would have been able to increase its 15% stake for what was considered a relatively cheap price. Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman has called the claim ""frivolous"".
WHAT COULD HAPPEN?
In the worst case for Woodside, the arbitrator would find that Far had a pre-emptive right and Woodside would need to sell all or part of its Sangomar stake to Far.
Analysts see a selldown as highly unlikely given Woodside is deeply involved in the project and has a key role as operator.
Even if the arbitration did clear the way for Far to buy Woodside's stake, the minnow, with a market capitalization of A$289 million ($196 million), would be hard-pressed to stump up the cash for the stake.
If Far wins, analysts say the mostly likely outcome would be some form of compensation. That could include a cash payout from Conoco or Woodside, some agreement by Woodside to help fund Far's share of the capital cost of the project, or a combination of those.
WILL THIS AFFECT THE PROJECT?
The Sangomar partners, including Cairn Energy and the Senegalese state oil company, submitted plans to the government on Monday to proceed with the project, paving the way for final investment decisions later this month.
Resolution of the dispute should help clear the way for the minority partners to line up project finance by giving lenders more certainty about Woodside's role in Sangomar, say analysts.
Far's share of the capital cost of the project is estimated at $480 million. It has lined up a $350 million debt facility with Macquarie Bank and is looking to put in place a second debt facility.
WHAT IF FAR LOSES?
If the arbitration finds that Far had no pre-emptive rights, then it would be status quo for the partners.
Far's share price has dropped by nearly a third this year amid speculation it will have to sell new shares to fund its share of the project.
Filing of the development plan boosted its shares as much as 3.3% on Tuesday, while the energy index was down 1.5%.
Far declined to comment ahead of the ruling. Woodside had no immediate comment. Conoco declined to comment on the arbitration."

India’s economic growth collapsed below 5% for the first time since 2013 in the three months through September.

The problems arising out of weak economic growth are “under-appreciated,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s strategist Neelkanth Mishra wrote in a note on Monday.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 11:13PM ET</span>","Elon Musk's jury to be queried on opinions of billionaires, visitors to Thailand","By Rachel Parsons
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Potential jurors in the defamation trial of high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk may be excused from the case if they voice strong feelings about billionaires or people who visit Thailand.
Jury selection was set to begin on Tuesday in the civil suit brought against the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive by a British cave explorer who gained fame for his leading role in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand last year.
The explorer, Vernon Unsworth, says the billionaire, who also founded private rocket company SpaceX, falsely labeled him ""pedo guy"" on Twitter and should pay punitive and other damages for harming his reputation.
At a pretrial hearing on Monday, U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles ruled on several procedural matters and went over ground rules with attorneys for both sides, including the list of questions he will pose during jury selection.
In addition to relatively standard queries such as ""Have you ever been a party to a lawsuit,"" the judge said he would ask prospective jurors some questions unique to the Musk case, including: ""Do you have a strong opinion about billionaires?"" and ""Do you have strong opinions of people who visit or live in Thailand?""
Although an affirmative answer does not necessarily ensure that a potential juror would be excused, such questions are designed to discern an individual's ability to be impartial.
The judge will empanel six to 12 jurors, though Wilson said he finds an eight-member panel to be ideal. Opening statements are expected to begin right after jury selection finishes on Tuesday.
Musk is slated to be the first witness for the plaintiff's team once testimony begins.
The case stems from an offer Musk made to furnish a mini-submarine from his SpaceX company to help with the cave rescue in July 2018.
Unsworth told CNN on July 13, 2018, three days after the rescue was completed, that the offer was a ""PR stunt"" and that Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurts."" 
Two days later, Musk lashed out at Unsworth in a series of tweets, including one which called him a ""pedo guy."" Musk later apologized for that comment. 
The judge explained the case hinges on whether a reasonable person would take Musk's Twitter statement to mean that he was calling Unsworth a pedophile.
To win the defamation case, Unsworth needs to show that Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified the plaintiff and caused him harm. ""Actual malice"" on Musk's part does not need to be proven because the judge has deemed Unsworth a private individual rather than a public figure.
Although the case does not involve Tesla, Musk's Twitter habits have long been under close scrutiny, with investors and regulators expressing concerns about his tweets.
With 29.8 million followers, Musk's Twitter account is a major source of publicity for his Palo Alto, California-based electric car company, which does not advertise. 
On Monday, the judge refused a defense request to reverse a decision allowing Unsworth's attorneys to introduce an email Musk sent to the news website BuzzFeed in which Musk chided a reporter there to ""stop defending child rapists.""

Wilson also refused to reverse a ruling that bars plaintiff's lawyers from introducing Musk's financial statements, after defense attorneys acknowledged in court that their client has publicly put his net worth at $20 billion.

The struggling airline is on the edge of closing business as it could face a review that could lead to license suspension if it fails to boost finances by Saturday.
HNA said it will use the loan to pay staff salaries, aircraft leases, fuel, airport charges and other costs at its affiliated airlines, but it did not specify which companies the money will go to. The heavily indebted group has about two-dozen aviation companies, including its flagship carrier Hainan Airlines.
Last week, Hong Kong Airlines, which is the third-largest carrier in the city, said it had to delay salaries for some of its staff as its business. It said its revenue dropped “significantly” in November and impacted the monthly payroll. It is the first time the airline has to hold back salaries because of a cash flow problem.
The news weighed on other airlines’ stocks on Tuesday morning. Cathay Pacific Airways Limited (HK:0293)'s share price dipped 1.91%. Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) saw its share price down 0.55%, and China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd (HK:0670) down 0.25%."

China's market for NEVs - which include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells - has been a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster car market, with sales jumping 62% last year, versus a 2.8% drop in all car sales.
But a steep cut in subsidies this year has dented NEV sales in recent months. In October, NEV sales fell 45.6% from a year earlier.
China sold a total of 28.1 million cars in 2018, including 1.3 million NEVs, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, so NEV sales were 4.6% of the overall market.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's draft proposal on NEVs noted that China would keep developing electric vehicle battery technologies, and improve infrastructure for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and connected vehicles.
The proposal, covering NEV development from 2021 to 2035, did not include sales forecasts or targets for 2030 or 2035.
China is also discussing introducing stricter green car quotas in coming years that would require carmakers to produce a certain amount of NEVs."

Singapore's biggest liberalization of its banking sector in two decades seeks to enable online-only banks that can operate at lower costs and therefore offer different services than those of incumbents including DBS Group (SI:DBSM) and OCBC (SI:OCBC). 
But some conditions are stiffer than in other markets such as Hong Kong, including requiring S$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in paid-up capital for retail banks and local control. This is necessitating bidders to team up to combine banking know-how, consumer facing technology expertise and deep pockets.
Many firms are locked in last-minute negotiations to meet the year-end deadline for bidding, said the sources who were not authorized to speak to the media.
""There is a lot of speed dating going on,"" said Varun Mittal, who heads the emerging markets fintech business at consultancy EY.
Singapore's central bank will issue up to two retail and three wholesale bank licenses. Retail banks can accept deposits from and offer services to both retail and non-retail customers but must be led by a Singapore-based company. Wholesale banks will mostly serve small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
""Even today, SMEs have great difficulty getting working capital finances because the kinds of credit evaluation and collateral that need to be committed don't work for them, but for bigger corporations,"" said Shailesh Naik, CEO of fintech firm MatchMove, which is exploring joining a consortium.
Grab, Singtel and Standard Chartered confirmed their interest in a license but declined to specify details.
 Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) affiliate Ant Financial and Singapore gaming company Razer (HK:1337) are among others considering seeking licenses.
Sources said Chinese insurer Ping An (SS:601318), a consortium including Singapore tycoon Ron Sim's holding company V3, and others such as insurer Great Eastern (SI:GELA) are also interested. The companies declined to comment.
Divyesh Vithlani, who leads Accenture's financial services practice in ASEAN, said some applicants were teaming up to provide SMEs with accounting, payroll or insurance services as well as banking.
REGIONAL ASPIRATIONS
Some contenders hope their wide-ranging customer data combined with new technology and nimble operations will help them win customers in a Singapore banking market that has over 150 deposit-taking institutions, with total assets of about $2 trillion.
For companies with regional aspirations such as Grab and Ant, a Singapore banking license could offer a stepping stone to expanding in larger Southeast Asian markets as the region embraces an era of digital banks.
""The play needs to consider not only the local for local game but also the bigger prize that's out there around the cross-border activities,"" said Mohit Mehrotra, head of Deloitte's strategy practice in Asia Pacific.
Singapore's initiative follows moves elsewhere including in Hong Kong, which issued eight online-only banking licenses, four to consortiums.

The city-state is set to announce the winners in mid-2020 and the digital banks are expected to start operations in a phased manner from mid-2021.

Stocks fell in the US after President Donald Trump ratcheted up his trade war rhetoric and announced plans to reinstate steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina. Trump said the measures are necessary because the two countries, which are going through their own economic and financial problems, have seen significant devaluations of their currencies.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Monday down 0.96% and the S&P 500 dropped 0.86% while the Nasdaq gave up 1.12%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.44% to 26,322 by 9:50 PM ET (02:50 GMT), as the momentum faded from positive economic data out of China over the weekend and Monday.
The Hong Kong market came under pressure from local data. The city, which has been going through more than six months of protests and social unrest, is also going through a recession. Retail sales volume in October fell 26.2% year-on-year, the worst fall on record.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.38% to 2,864 while the SZSE Component fell 0.32% to 9,574.
US-China trade talks remained a focus for traders after Trump said on Monday that the signing of two pieces of legislation that support protesters in Hong Kong would not make negotiations easier. However, he said China still wants a deal.

(Reuters) - The chief executive officer of OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma LP should not collect a potential $1.3 million bonus when he has been accused of contributing to the opioid epidemic, a group of state attorneys general said in a court filing on Monday.
The attorneys general of 24 states said Craig Landau should not collect a bonus that would lift his pay to $3.9 million because of his alleged role in downplaying the risks of Purdue's drugs.
The filing also said Purdue increased Landau's potential pay in 2018 ""in preparation for the filing of this case,"" and possibly to circumvent the bankruptcy code's restrictions on such bonuses. Purdue filed for bankruptcy protection in September, under pressure from more than 2,500 lawsuits alleging it helped fuel the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic
Purdue said in a statement that the long-standing bonus plan will help motivate employees to maximize the value of the company and noted that it had worked with creditors to reduce the cost of the plan by $10 million.
Purdue is on track to pay $24 million in bonuses to eligible employees based on its 2019 performance, the company said in a Monday court filing. However, Purdue said that to get support for its bonus plan it would limit Landau's potential bonus to 50%, or $1.3 million of his $2.6 million base pay. Other employees would still get their target bonus.
The attorneys general said documents that have not been made public tie Landau to the alleged misconduct by the Sackler family owners of Purdue.
The filing said documents from a Massachusetts lawsuit against Purdue show Landau wrote a 2017 proposal entitled ""Sackler Pharma Enterprise"" aimed at seizing on rivals' concerns about the opioid epidemic to increase Purdue's business.
A few weeks later, the Sacklers made him CEO, according to the filing.
The attorneys general also alleged that Purdue in 2018 gave Landau $6 million in retention payments that were not due until 2020 and 2022, and raised his annual salary in 2018 to $2.5 million, citing a lawsuit by Colorado.
The official committee of unsecured creditors supported the bonus plan for Landau. 
Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September to pause thousands of lawsuits while it tries to build support for a proposed settlement it estimates is worth $10 billion. Most lawsuits were filed by state and local governments, which accuse it of hyping the benefits of its drugs while masking the risks. Purdue has denied the allegations.

The proposed settlement includes a contribution of at least $3 billion by the Sacklers.

Europe's biggest budget airline said in July that the former Malaysia Airlines boss would step down at the end of the year.
But after easyJet announced Bellew's appointment as its new chief operations officer a week later, Ryanair launched legal proceedings in Ireland's High Court.
Ryanair argues that all its senior executives commit to non-compete clauses barring them from joining a competitor for 12 months after leaving the Irish airline.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary told reporters in September that the only issue was whether Bellew, who is currently working out his notice, can join easyJet on Jan. 1, 2020, or Jan. 1, 2021, a full 18 months after easyJet announced his appointment.
An easyJet spokeswoman declined to comment on the case. Bellew has not commented on the case since Ryanair initiated proceedings.
O'Leary has said the timing of Bellew's switch is sensitive because of the problems Ryanair is currently having with Boeing's (N:BA) grounded 737 MAX jet, which have slowed down its growth plans.
Ryanair is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the MAX 737, with 210 on order, and the airline said last month it expected a further delay to deliveries that could leave it without the new jets next summer.
Bellew left his role as CEO of Malaysia Airlines two years ago to return to Ryanair where he was director of flight operations before leaving for Kuala Lumpur in 2014.
Tasked with tackling a pilot revolt that resulted in Ryanair's first ever strikes, Bellew has helped patch up relations with staff and agree deals on pay and conditions with trade unions that have quelled the unrest.
An Irish national, Bellew described his return to Ryanair in 2017 as ""a form of national service"" to help what he described as Ireland's greatest company. Some observers had seen Bellew as a possible future Ryanair chief executive."

Mothers will also have the option to take a further six months of leave without pay. 
The Durex condom and Lysol disinfectant maker also said it would increase paid paternity leave for fathers and partners to four weeks, with the option to take a further four weeks of leave without pay. 
Reckitt Benckiser has also launched suites for breastfeeding mothers returning to work and free breast pumps if needed.
The bluechip company (FTSE) said its new policies would also apply to employees who belong to the LGBTQ+ community and include adopting and surrogacy families.
Reckitt Benckiser said U.S. maternity leave, currently at 16 weeks with pay, would be reviewed in 12 months with the aim to align it with the global policy. The changes to paternity leave also exclude the United States, where new dads are entitled to six weeks paid leave.

597,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 06:52PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Brazil's Odebrecht in talks to stave off Braskem sale, keep payout - sources","By Carolina Mandl and Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Creditors of Brazil's Odebrecht SA are in advanced talks to let the corruption-ensnared conglomerate keep its crown jewel asset, listed petrochemical company Braskem SA (SA:BRKM5), for another two years, retreating from their prior demand for a quick sale, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
In a further victory for Odebrecht, which is trying to restructure 51 billion reais ($12.2 billion) in debt, its bank creditors will let it keep receiving most of Braskem's dividends - now virtually Odebrecht's sole revenue source - during that period.
The engineering and construction company, implicated in a series of graft scandals across Latin America, will submit its debt proposal to a creditors' meeting on Wednesday, but representatives of creditors whose debt is secured by Braskem shares have informally agreed to it, the sources added, asking for anonymity to disclose private talks.
Still, a final decision depends on approval by the banks' internal loan committees, the sources added.
Odebrecht and the bank creditors did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Under Odebrecht's proposal, none of its outstanding debt would be repaid during a 24-month period during which the banks would also concede nearly 80% of Braskem's dividends to Odebrecht, the sources said. After that period, banks could potentially agree on extending the standstill period for another 12 months.
For its part, Odebrecht would be required to give up any questioning in Justice of the right of banks to take possession or sell shares in Braskem, the group's crown jewel.
Earlier this year, Odebrecht argued in bankruptcy court the Braskem stake was an essential asset that could not be sold.
Although the plan falls short of banks' expectations, it is a temporary solution to avoid a fire-sale of Braskem. Loans from leading banks such as Banco do Brasil, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA and development bank BNDES are secured by Braskem shares.
If the banks sold Odebrecht's stake in Braskem at current market prices, it would barely cover the group's 12.6 billion reais in debt with these creditors. Shares in Braskem are down more than 38% this year.
The petrochemical company may have to pay for relocation of thousands of people in the northeastern Brazilian city of Maceio due to environmental damage caused by its mining activities near the city. It is unclear yet how much it will cost the company.
 LyondellBasell Industries  (N:LYB) broke off talks to acquire Braskem last June.
On Monday, Odebrecht's lawyers were still analyzing a decision by an appeal court in a request by state-owned lender Caixa Economica Federal requiring that creditors vote on the consolidation of debts of more than 20 companies controlled by the conglomerate. It was not clear how it may impact the group's restructuring plan."

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Monday Scott Powell will become chief operating officer, the second external recruit to join the top ranks since Chief Executive Charles Scharf took over six weeks ago.
Powell, who worked with Scharf at Bank One and then JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, most recently was chief executive officer of Santander (MC:SAN) Holdings USA Inc as well as of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.
Starting Dec. 9, Powell will report directly and will focus on Wells Fargo's relationships with regulators, which have been strained since the bank became tangled in a wide-ranging sales practices scandal in 2016.
Last month the bank hired another former JP Morgan executive and previous White House official, William Daley, to head public affairs.
Wells Fargo's board set a goal of hiring an outsider to lead the company following former CEO Tim Sloan's retirement to satisfy critics who claimed an insider could not transform the company's culture.
Scharf, who joined the company in October from Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp, is known to shake up leadership. Since he took over, general counsel and former interim CEO Allen Parker, and company veteran Avid Modjtabai have made plans to leave the company.
The chief operating officer position has been vacant since October 2016, when Tim Sloan was promoted as CEO."

Named Nikola Tre, the truck will be built for the European market, under the deal the two groups announced in September, which brought CNH Industrial to take a $250 million stake in Nikola, $100 million in cash and $150 million in services.
""Just three months after we signed out partnerships, we have been able to deliver this prototype,"" Nikola founder and Chief Executive Trevor Milton said at a dinner in Iveco's hometown in Turin.
The truck will be produced both in a full electric and in a hydrogen fuel cell version, allowing it a range up to 600 miles (966 km). Deliveries to clients are expected in 2021 for the electric version and in 2023 for the hydrogen one.
Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) use hydrogen combustion - which does not yields polluting agents - to produce power to fuel their electric engines.
The new truck is expected to give a boost to Iveco's European business, as the smallest among the big European traditional truck makers competes with the might of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler and Volvo Group.
On the other hand, the agreement is expected to give Nikola scale and manufacturing capacity for its technologies.
All of the main manufacturers have electric and fuel cell vehicles in their product line-ups for 2020 or 2021.
Zita Zigan, an analyst at research firm LMC Automotive, said these vehicles have been displayed at recent shows but that it would take some time before any of these were ready for market launch.
""A partnership like the one between Nikola and CNH Industrial could be a game changer – possibly a real threat to current hegemonic manufacturers,"" she said.
Regulatory constraints, rather than government incentives, are a strong driver to the development of alternatively-powered trucks, not just in the U.S. and Europe.
Governments have set ambitious greenhouse gases reduction targets, which will force manufacturers to move toward zero emission in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle sector.
""In Europe, manufacturers will be required to cut carbon dioxide emissions from new trucks on average by 15% from 2025 and by 30% from 2030, compared with 2019 levels,"" Zigan said."
602,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 05:34PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch," Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Salesforce, Marvell Tech Earnings in Focus
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) will report third-quarter earnings after the market closes on Tuesday.
Ahead of the report, many expect its recent acquisitions will likely have boosted Salesforce's enterprise software revenue.
With the recent addition of MuleSoft and Tableau, sales are expected to have topped $4.45 billion in the third quarter, up from $3.39 billion a year ago. and $4 billion in the second quarter.
Salesforce is expected to report earnings of 66 cents a share, up from 61 cents a share a year ago, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com.
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), meanwhile, also reports after the closing bell, with analysts expecting the chipmaker to report earnings of 17 cents per share on about $660 million in revenue, down from 33 cents a year ago on revenue of $851 million.
The earnings report comes at a fraught time for chipmakers as U.S.-China trade relations have soured, cooling expectations that both nations will sign the phase one trade deal sooner rather than later.
The company previously lowered its guidance for the third quarter and warned of a worsening macro environment along with the ongoing impact from the current restrictions on shipments to Huawei.
The restrictions on U.S. companies shipping supplies to Huawei, however, have since been lifted and extended until Feb. 16, 2020.
Beyond trade issues, the revival in data center spending and the earlier-than-expected first production shipments of 5G solutions will likely alleviate headwinds from the U.S.-China trade war.
2. Update on NY Business Condition, Vehicles Sales Due
The economic calendar is light on Tuesday, with an update on business conditions in New York due at 9:45 AM ET (14:45 GMT) and U.S. total vehicle sales due at 6 PM ET (23:00 GMT).
The ISM-NY Business Conditions Index is expected to have declined to 44.7% last month from 47.7% in October.
U.S. total vehicle sales will also be in focus after data last month showed the U.S. sold an annualized 16.8 million units in November, up from 16.6 million units in October but down from an annualized 17.5 million units in November 2018.
3. API Crude Inventories Data on Tap
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data is due after the closing bell on Tuesday.
The API last week reported domestic crude oil inventories for the week ended Nov. 29, rose by 3.6 million barrels.
Oil prices in recent sessions have been driven by the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S.-China and bets on whether OPEC will announce further production cuts at this week's meeting. The Vienna meeting starts Thursday. 
OPEC and its allies have been cutting output for three years in a struggle to get rid of a supply glut so prices can be steadied. Their current deal to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day began in January and expires at the end of March.
West Texas intermediate crude settled 79 cents higher at $55.96 a barrel in New York. WTI is up 23.2% this year.

604,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>","Stocks - Trade Battles, Manufacturing Weakness Hit S&P 500","Investing.com – Stocks began the last month of 2019 with their second selloff in two sessions Monday as worries grew about U.S. trade fights with just about everyone and new reports that showed weakening manufacturing and construction data.
The trade fights included the threat of new tariffs on Chinese imports if a trade deal isn't struck by Dec. 15 and the possibility of new tariffs imposed on imports from the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain. The targets would include Airbus airliners. In addition, the Trump Administration added new tariffs on Brazilian and Argentinian steel.
The S&P 500 was off 0.86%, the Dow Jones industrials were down 0.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indices fell 1.1% each.
Stocks opened higher but fell back fairly quickly on the announcement of tariffs in Brazilian and Argentinian steel.
The losses accelerated into the close with more tariff news. The declines at the close were the biggest for the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq since Oct. 8. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were both lower, and streaming video platform   Roku   (NASDAQ:ROKU) fell sharply after a downgrade.
Tech stocks generally were weak, with weakness among key stocks as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK).
Energy and consumer staples were the only S&P 500 sectors showing gains.
Energy shares were higher as oil prices moved up. West Texas intermediate crude was up 79 cents to $55.96 a barrel. Brent  crude, the global benchmark, finished ahead 43 cents to $60.92.
OPEC is to meet starting Thursday and is expected to extend production cuts into 2020.   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) was up 0.43%. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) added 1.4%, and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) rose 0.7%. But   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) fell 0.3%.
Consumer staples stocks were led by the Dow leaders Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).
Real estate and technology were the weakest sectors.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the weakest Dow stock, down 3% on continued worries about when the 737 Max jet will be re-certified. The tariffs that may be imposed on European imports related to Boeing's complaints that the European Union illegally subsidized the development of Airbus. The World Trade Organization agreed with Boeing on Monday.
Boeing's loss contributed 75 points, or about 28%, to the Dow's overall decline of more than 268 points. 
 
Meanwhile, reports suggested softening in manufacturing and construction. The Institute for Supply Management's widely watched manufacturing index fell for a fourth-straight month thanks in part to Boeing and pullbacks in oil and gas drilling.
Construction spending also fell back.
Despite Monday's selling, stocks are still enjoying their best performance since 2013. The S&P 500 is up 24.2% for the year, with Dow up 19.1% and the Nasdaq ahead by 29.1%.
The major averages had had record closes as late as Wednesday. So, the selling might have surprised many investors. The Dow fell 381 points on Friday and Monday.
But technical indicators have been signalling the U.S. stock market was getting well ahead of itself.
The U.S. economy is not showing signs of stress, the trade fights notwithstanding. Economists tracked by Investing.com see the U.S. unemployment rate holding at 3.6% for November when Labor Department issues its monthly jobs report on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by 180,000, up from 128,000 in October.
  Cimarex Energy   (NYSE:XEC), utility Edison International (NYSE:EIX), oil-and-gas company   Marathon Oil   (NYSE:MRO) and oil-refiner HollyFrontier (NYSE:HFC) were the top performing S&P 500 stocks on the day.
Oil-and-gas producer Apache (NYSE:APA), fashion retailer L Brands (NYSE:LB), insurance company Aflac (NYSE:AFL) and electronics design company Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) were the weakest S&P 500 performers."
605,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 04:45PM ET</span>",U.S. stocks retreat on economy and trade jitters,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stepped back from last week's record highs on Monday, with weak U.S. manufacturing data and fresh trade worries keeping buyers on the sidelines. 
All three major U.S. stock averages began the last month of the year in the red as investors returned from the long holiday weekend.
A report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed U.S. manufacturing activity contracted in November for the fourth consecutive month, stoking concerns that the longest period of economic expansion in U.S. history could be losing steam.
""The weaker-than-forecast manufacturing data doesn't help,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. ""That trend is likely to continue in the short term."" 
""The question is will consumers continue to keep the economy afloat,"" Pursche added. ""And so far, the preliminary data regarding Black Friday spending is very positive. It's a big number."" 
And Cyber Monday sales were expected to hit a record following $11.6 billion in online sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.
Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that he would restore tariffs on steel imported from Brazil and Argentina, boosting shares of U.S. steel makers U.S. Steel Corp (N:X) and AK Steel Holding Corp (N:AKS) by 4.2% and 4.7%, respectively.
Still, it was the latest sign that the multi-front trade between the United States and its global trading partners will continue to dominate markets and hinder global economic growth.
The news comes on the heels of recent Wall Street highs, driven to records last week on hopes of an imminent ""phase one"" trade agreement between the United States and China.
A senior adviser to Trump said on Monday it was still possible that a deal with China could be reached by the end of the year. 
""This is not just about Trump announcing steel tariffs, but fears that he's going to allow increases in tariffs against China on December 15,"" added Pursche. ""That's part of the story.
""On the trade front, we need something and it doesn't have to be much,"" Pursche continued. ""People have taken the slightest bit of positive news and sunk their teeth into it.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 267.35 points, or 0.95%, to 27,784.06, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 27 points, or 0.86%, to 3,113.98 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 97.48 points, or 1.12%, to 8,567.99.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, only consumer staples (SPLRCS) and energy (SPNY) ended the session in positive territory.
Real estate <.SPLRCR>, technology (SPLRCT) and trade-sensitive industrials (SPLRCI) were the largest percentage losers.
Monday's slide in U.S. stocks prompted at least one large investor to pay $31 million to buy stock options that would guard against a sharper hit to stocks into the start of next year.
Among stocks,  Roku  Inc (O:ROKU) dropped 15.2% following Morgan Stanley's downgrade to ""underweight"". 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.48-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 65 new highs and 39 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.84 billion shares, matching the 6.84 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

606,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>",Here Are the S&P 500 Bull Cases Helped by a Trade Agreement,"(Bloomberg) -- Putting an end to the U.S.-China trade war is central to some of the bigger bull cases for stocks in America and abroad. With equity futures perking up on news a deal is close on tariffs, the following is a sampling of what strategists have said the impact might be.
March contracts on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones 100 rose 0.3 percent as of 10:33 a.m. in London, while Nasdaq contracts were up 0.4 percent. Negotiators are nearing an agreement that could lift most or all U.S. tariffs as long as Beijing follows through on pledges ranging from better protecting intellectual-property rights to buying American products, two people familiar with the discussions said earlier.
European stocks started the week on a positive note, too, as miners and media companies led the advance amid trade optimism. Investors are also looking forward to the monetary policy meeting of the European Central Bank on Thursday.
Record Run
The S&P 500 could climb to about 3,020 should a “real deal” between the U.S. and China get struck, Bank of America strategists said in a note in February. That would exceed the September all-time high of 2,930. The reversal of 2018 tariffs would add 1 percent upside to companies’ per-share earnings growth, the strategists said.
June High
About 250 points of upside could be realized in the S&P 500 if trade concerns thaw, Keith Parker, head of U.S. equity strategy at UBS, said in December when the benchmark was priced near 2,670. That would send the S&P 500 up toward 2,920 -- a 4 percent gain from Friday’s close. Last week, he said the major average could reach new highs by the end of June, heading toward his year-end target of 2,950.
Headline Risk
JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Marko Kolanovic estimated in June that market reactions to trade headlines had yanked $1.25 trillion in value from U.S. stocks. In September, Kolanovic warned that per-share earnings for S&P 500 companies could drop by as much as $10 if bilateral tariffs of 25 percent were imposed.
What Wall Street Is Saying Now
Here are more recent comments from market strategists and investors:
Kristina Hooper, the chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd.:
“Recent reports suggest that the U.S. and China are very close to a trade deal. That should be a real positive for stocks globally, especially Chinese stocks; it wouldn’t be surprising to see stocks rise more than 2 percent on the news,” Hooper said Sunday. “However, I would caution that stocks can go down as easily as they rose if the talks don’t truly culminate in an agreement -- and I believe that is still a very real possibility. Recall that just last week Robert Lighthizer poured cold water on the president’s suggestion that a trade deal was close to fruition, cautioning Congress that significant hurdles remain as Lighthizer wants to see real structural reforms,” she said. “I don’t expect China to agree to significant concessions such as intellectual  property protections – and I believe that even more now that we are starting to see some improvement in Chinese economic data, as manufacturing PMI for February improved. If we get an actual deal, I would expect stocks globally to rise significantly.”
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden Capital Management in Minneapolis, said Sunday:
“They are just talking about eliminating tariffs the U.S. put on in the last year. That is not that unexpected and it would be good a deal was reached but I am not sure this deal is much more than was already expected and overall far from blockbuster news. That is, good for market on headline because war is over but probably not much ongoing positive for stocks.”
Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, said Sunday:
“This quote has been making the rounds for the past few weeks. We have seen each time the news of getting close hits the tape, stocks have reacted positively. Depending upon how close is close, stocks should jump at the open. It will do wonders for China, which could reignite global growth, likely held back by trade and tariffs.”
Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded “The Sevens Report” newsletter:
A trade deal addressing all three trade issues -- reduction of the trade deficit, expanded market access, and elimination of intellectual property theft -- would trigger a rally of as much as 5 percent, he wrote to clients last week. A deal that addresses all issues but only partly removes tariffs would trigger a short-term bounce that shouldn’t be chased. And a pact that addresses the trade issues but doesn’t include tariff removal would cause a decline.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Monday's slide in U.S. stocks prompted at least one large investors to load up big on stock options that would guard against a sharper hit to stocks into the start of next year.
Shortly after the market opened on Monday, an investor paid about $31 million to buy 16,000 of January put options at the 2,980 level on the S&P 500 Index (SPX), according data from options analytics firm Trade Alert.
The position struck about 4.6% below the market's current level around 3,124 appears to be hedging roughly $4.8 billion in assets, said Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert in New York.
An index put option gives the holder the right to sell the value of an underlying index at a fixed level in the future, thereby offering protection against a slide in the market.
U.S. stocks fell on Monday after President Donald Trump decided to restore tariffs on metal imports from Brazil and Argentina and weak factory activity fanned worries of a slowing domestic economy due to the long-drawn trade war with China.
The S&P 500 (SPX) was 0.53% lower at 3,124.45 in afternoon trading.
""The trade may be a year-end hedge following last week's all-time highs above $3154,"" Schwartz said.
On Monday, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a widely followed options-based barometer of expected near-term volatility for stocks, rose to a near 6-week high of 15.27 before paring gains to trade up 1.34 points at 13.96."

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday rejected Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) bid to dismiss a proposed class action lawsuit by customers who said it knew and concealed how the ""butterfly"" keyboards on its MacBook laptop computers were prone to failure.
U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California said Apple must face claims that its troubleshooting program did not provide an ""effective fix"" for MacBook design defects, or fully compensate customers for their out-of-pocket expenses while seeking repairs.
Customers claimed that their MacBook, MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptop keyboards suffered from sticky keys, unresponsive keys and keystrokes that failed to register when tiny amounts of dust or debris accumulated under or near keys.
They also said Apple's service program was inadequate because the Cupertino, California-based company often provided replacement keyboards that had the same problems.
The lawsuit covers purchasers of model year 2015 or later MacBook laptops, and model year 2016 or later MacBook Pros laptops. It seeks a variety of damages for violations of several states' consumer protection laws.
Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Benjamin Johns, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he was pleased with the decision and looked forward to pursuing the case.
Last month, Apple introduced a MacBook Pro with a larger screen and new ""Magic"" keyboard with the ""scissor"" mechanism more commonly found in the industry. The hinged butterfly mechanism resembles a butterfly's wings.
Mac sales, including various MacBook models, accounted for about 10% of Apple's $260.2 billion of net sales in its fiscal year ended Sept. 28.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>","Trump, citing U.S. farmers, slaps metal tariffs on Brazil, Argentina","By Andrea Shalal and Gabriel Stargardter
WASHINGTON/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ambushed Brazil and Argentina on Monday, announcing he would restore tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports from the two countries in apparent retaliation for currency weakness he said was hurting U.S. farmers.
""Effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel & Aluminum that is shipped into the U.S. from those countries,"" Trump wrote in an early morning tweet that sent officials from both countries scrambling for explanations from Washington. He added that Brazil and Argentina were ""presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies.""
In fact, the opposite is true: Both countries have actively been trying to strengthen their respective currencies against the dollar. The real and the peso have been buffeted by weakness partially linked to Trump's trade battle with China. 
U.S. farmers, who have been hit by the U.S.-China trade war, represent a key demographic for Trump ahead of the November 2020 election. They have watched in vain as the trade war has hurt the competitiveness of U.S. agricultural products, allowing their Brazilian and Argentine peers to get rich off China. 
""For many Brazilians, this smells like revenge for their country's soybean farmers bonanza – they have benefited enormously from the U.S.-China trade war by replacing U.S. soybeans sales into China,"" said Kim Catechis, head of investment strategy at Martin Currie.
Representatives for the U.S. State Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, an avowed Trump fan who has sought closer U.S. ties, said in a local radio interview that he would call his U.S. counterpart, who he was confident would listen to Brazil's concerns. 
""I don't see this as retaliation,"" Bolsonaro told Radio Itatiaia. ""I'm going to call him so that he doesn't penalize us ... Our economy basically comes from commodities, it's what we've got. I hope that he understands ... and I'm almost certain he'll listen to us.""
In a statement, Brazil's government said it was already in discussions with Washington. A source familiar with Brasilia's reaction rejected the U.S. claim of currency manipulation, noting the central bank was working to lift the real.
Argentine Production Minister Dante Sica said Trump's announcement was ""unexpected"" and he was seeking talks with U.S. officials. Additionally, Argentina's Foreign Ministry said it will begin negotiations with the U.S. State Department.
""We are trying to get more precision (about the announcement) and what impact it could have"" both commercially and administratively, Sica said. ""We do not yet know the magnitude (of the measure).""
Argentina's production ministry said in a statement the country has exported around $520 million in steel and aluminum to the United States so far this year after exporting $700 million in 2018.
CURRENCY QUESTIONS
Trump's accusation that the Brazilian and Argentine currencies were being artificially devalued was met with widespread skepticism. 
In Brazil, the recent slide in the real has caused a public outcry and led the central bank to intervene, while Argentina put in place currency controls to steady its beleaguered peso. 
Trump also urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates so countries ""no longer take advantage of our strong dollar. Lower Rates & Loosen - Fed!""
Trump has repeatedly urged the U.S. central bank to lower rates to below zero, but Fed policymakers have been reluctant. Fed policy makers hold their next meeting on Dec. 10-11.
The Instituto Aco Brasil, the country's main steel lobby, said it was ""perplexed"" by Trump's decision. It said in a statement that Brazil's government could not be meddling with the real as the currency is free-floating.
""The decision to tax Brazilian steel as a way of 'compensating' the American farmer is a retaliation against Brazil,"" it said. ""Such a decision ends up hurting the American steelmaking industry itself, which needs semi-finished products exported by Brazil in order to operate its mills.""
Shares of U.S. steelmakers rose on Monday, with United States Steel Corp (N:X) up 4.0% at $13.65 in afternoon trading and AK Steel Holding (N:AKS) rising 5.8% to $2.92.
Brazilian steelmakers' shares fell initially but then rebounded. Analysts from JP Morgan suggested buying the sector on any weakness, saying any tariff hike ""should not be material"" given their relatively small U.S. export volumes.

Shares of Ternium Argentina (BA:TXAR) slumped 5.5% after Trump's tweet, with JP Morgan noting it is the most exposed steelmaker in Latin America to the tariff move. The shares pared some losses to trade down 2.9% in afternoon.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 42-day term repo operation attracted $42.55 billion in bids, more than the $25 billion on offer. This action, with a maturity of Jan. 13, 2020, was the second of three operations to provide funding past the year-end period.
The maximum size of the Dec. 2 term operation was increased last week to $25 billion from its initial amount of at least $15 billion after the central bank’s first year-end offering was oversubscribed. Market participants had submitted $49.05 billion in bids for the 42-day term action on Nov. 25, which was more than the $25 billion available.
The third action to provide year-end funding is scheduled to take place on Dec. 9, when the Fed will offer at least $15 billion of 28-day cash.
The Fed’s overnight repo operation, as has been the case with most such actions recently, was undersubscribed on Monday. It attracted $72.9 billion of bids, less than the maximum offering size of $120 billion.

(Reuters) - Cyber Monday sales were on course to bring in a record $9.4 billion, according to early estimates, building on a bumper Black Friday weekend for retailers driven by earlier-than-usual promotions and free shipping.
Shoppers have already had nearly a month of special offers and deals as retailers look to draw out their vital holiday season, which is six days shorter this year due to a late Thanksgiving.
Estimates from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics on Monday predicted that some $72.1 billion has been spent online in the past month, with Cyber Monday - now traditionally the U.S. economy's biggest internet shopping day - logging $473 million as of 9 a.m. ET.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other traditional retailers such as  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) have beefed up delivery services to fulfill online orders faster as more customers shop on their mobile phones and tablets at home.
""At the end of the day, Cyber Monday is just Black Friday revisited so the momentum, and the deals, really started last week,"" said Carol Spieckerman president at consultancy Spieckerman Retail.
""Retailers' click and collect capabilities are running more efficiently, online shopping is more intuitive ... Amazon isn't the only one wearing the convenience crown this year.""
PENTHOUSE PROTEST
It may not all be smooth sailing for the world's biggest online retailer. Amazon warehouse workers, community groups, unions and elected officials, were set to march outside company chief Jeff Bezos' Fifth Avenue penthouse, citing poor treatment of workers and rising climate emissions from the company's push for speedier deliveries.
Activists also staged protests across France on Friday and tried to blockade a shopping mall in Paris, denouncing the spread of Black Friday to European shores.
Target and Walmart have also taken aim at the company this year by making free shipping or same-day in-store pickups widely available. Commentators say those sorts of deals have proven a success over the past month.
The National Retail Federation estimates nearly 69 million Americans will scour the web on Monday for deals on everything from mobile phones to kitchenware, with Adobe estimating the biggest discounts were on televisions and computers.
Topping Adobe's list of most popular products were Frozen 2 and Paw Patrol toys, L.O.L surprise dolls and Nintendo's Switch mobile console.
""#CyberMonday2019 The day of the year 85% of the U.S. population pretends to actually be working,"" tweeted Erika Mayor, a user in Miami.

612,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 02:01PM ET</span>",WTO rejects EU bid to stop U.S. tariffs over Airbus,"By Tim Hepher and Philip Blenkinsop
PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization on Monday rejected European Union claims that it no longer provides subsidies to planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), underscoring tariffs recently imposed by the United States on European goods. 
A new compliance report from the Geneva trade watchdog found that the Airbus A380 and A350 jetliners continue to be subsidized as a result of past European government loans.
It is the latest move in a record transatlantic trade dispute involving mutual claims of illegal aircraft subsidies, which comes to a head at a time of rising global trade tensions and has grabbed the attention of financial markets this year.
The United States was in October awarded the right to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of annual EU imports in its case against Airbus. It went ahead with partial tariffs on most Airbus jets and products from cheese to olives and single-malt whisky.
A decision on retaliation rights for the EU in a parallel case on aid for Boeing (N:BA) is due next year.
Officials on both sides have expressed support for a negotiated settlement, while accusing the other of failing to take the prospect of a negotiated solution seriously.
In Monday's finding, a three-person panel rejected EU claims that a recent decision by Airbus to stop producing the slow-selling A380 meant the giant airliner could no longer be seen as a threat to Boeing, whose competing 747 is also out of fashion.
While the WTO no longer faulted Airbus for causing lost sales to Boeing with the A380, which is no longer marketed, it ruled that the superjumbo would cause market-share damage to Boeing for as long as it is produced and delivered.
Airbus plans to shut production in mid-2021.
The WTO appeared to strengthen findings against the A350, saying it had both cost sales and damaged Boeing's market-share prospects - a process called impedance - in the busier twin-engined long-haul market where Boeing offers its 787 Dreamliner.
A previous WTO ruling had focused only on lost sales.
The latest report put the world's largest corporate trade dispute squarely on the agenda for new EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan, who started his term on Sunday. 
The Commission said the new findings contained serious legal errors and that it would consider its next steps, including a possible appeal, while seeking an accord with the United States.
There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Trade Representative.
APPEALS DILEMMA
As so often following the dozens of rulings in the 15-year-old trade case, Airbus and Boeing were left starkly at odds.
Boeing claimed a complete loss for its European rival Airbus, which it said continued to harm the U.S. aerospace industry by receiving billions of euros in illegal aid.
Airbus said the WTO's decision to drop previous references to the A380 causing lost sales to Boeing meant the United States should slash its authorized tariffs by $2 billion to $5.5 billion.
U.S. sources said only full compliance or a political settlement - which is widely seen as remote amid fragile economic ties - could legally cancel WTO approval for tariffs.
European executives warned against a ""lose-lose"" trade war.
Both sides can appeal the latest finding but doing so could place the WTO in uncertain legal territory, experts said.
The WTO Appellate Body will cease to function after Dec. 10 due to U.S. blocking of new appointments, leaving a tight deadline to challenge Monday's ruling.

Any appeals launched after that date risk falling into a legal void, while it remains unclear whether the body will be allowed to rule on appeals filed before then.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>",Roku tumbles 15% as Morgan Stanley warns of streaming 'exuberance',"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Roku Inc's high-flying stock tumbled 15% on Monday after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded the video streaming company, warning that revenue and profit growth could slow next year. 
Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne cut Roku to ""underweight"" from ""equal-weight"" and trimmed his price target by $10 to $110, warning of ""overall exuberance over all things streaming.""
The stock fell $23.50 to $136.87 shortly after midday.
A major winner in the consumer shift away from cable television in favor of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other streaming services, Roku's stock has gained more than 300% in 2019, even after Monday's slump.
Shares of the San Jose, California company, which reported a wider loss for the September quarter, are valued at an elevated 12 times revenue expected over the next 12 months, compared to a multiple of about 6 for streaming leader Netflix, according to Refinitiv.
""We believe there are risks to growth expectations not reflected in current valuation levels. Specifically, we think revenue and gross profit growth slow meaningfully in '20 and the multiple compresses,"" Swinburne wrote in a report.
Competition in the streaming market is increasing rapidly, with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) launching new services last month. AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's HBO Max and a new offering from Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) are expected to enter in 2020.
Reflecting growing competition in hardware used to deliver streaming services, Roku's stock tumbled 28% over three days in September after Comcast said it would offer internet customers a streaming media set top box for free.
Monday's drop in Roku's stock was on track to be just a bit less than the 16% sell-off from Nov. 7 after the company's quarterly report failed to satisfy investors, even after its net loss and revenue exceeded analysts' average expectations.
Also on Monday, Netflix fell 2.2%, trimming its gain in 2019 to 15%. Over last week's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, the company began streaming its hit mobster movie ""The Irishman,"" which JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said could boost its shares.
As the streaming video market has become more crowded, Roku has shifted its focus from device sales to advertising, which is now the company's fastest-growing revenue stream.

614,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Roku Slumps as Morgan Stanley Sounds Alarm on Valuation,"Investing.com –   Roku   (NASDAQ:ROKU) shares fell sharply on Monday after Morgan Stanley sounded the alarm on the streaming media platform's valuation amid rising competition and slowing growth.
Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne downgraded  Roku  to underweight from equal weight but raised his price target on the stock by $10 to $110. That was hardly an endorsement Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) was off more than 13% at $139.32 early Monday afternoon after plunging as much as 17.3%. 
 
With the phenomenon of consumers giving up cable in favor of streaming services in full swing, Roku has seen its shares rise as much as 476% on the year. The shares are still far too expensive, Swinburne warned.
""Roku shares are up over 400% (year to date) due to rising estimates and overall exuberance over all things streaming,"" he said. ""As a result, we see the risk/reward skewed to the downside.""
The streaming media platform is unlikely to generate the growth needed to justify its frothy valuation at a time when rising competition may well syphon off advertising dollars that would have previously made its way to Roku, according to Swinburne.
""This has been the case with other emerging digital, advertising businesses like Snap and Twitter, where rather than fade modestly, growth slowed dramatically,"" he said.
Roku has done little to alleviate fears of slowing growth after reporting weaker active-account growth in the latest quarter, on a year-over-year basis. 
For the moment, however, Roku has managed to avert the ""momentum growth selloff"" seen recently, thanks to the launches of AppleTV Plus and Disney+ in the past few weeks, Swinburne added.
The shares are down more than 21% since peaking at $176.55 in early September.
Sentiment on Roku was also soured by reports that, starting Dec. 1, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) ended support for older Roku Players, Vizio TVs, and some Samsung (KS:005930) smart TVs.
Customers using the older Roku players would likely need to purchase a new streaming device to continue watching content with their (NASDAQ:Netflix) subscription."

(Reuters) - A company led by former Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) chief executive David Cote and backed by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) is in talks to acquire U.S. backup power equipment firm Vertiv for more than $5 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.
Cote's firm, GS Acquisition Holdings Corp , is a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which raised $690 million in an initial public offering last year to buy a company without telling investors in advance what that would be.
GS Acquisition could use the money it raised in the IPO, in addition to debt financing, to acquire Vertiv from private equity firm Platinum Equity. The negotiations are ongoing, and there is no certainty a deal will be reached, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Vertiv has also drawn interest from other potential bidders, one of the sources added.
Vertiv declined to comment. Representatives for Platinum Equity and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cote could not be immediately reached for comment.
Based in Columbus, Ohio, Vertiv manufactures systems and provides maintenance for backup power and other safety systems to data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments.
Vertiv is the former network power business of Emerson Electric (N:EMR), which Platinum Equity acquired three years ago for about $4 billion, in one of the largest deals the Los Angeles-based buyout firm had ever completed. Emerson kept a minority interest in the company, according to a statement at the time.
In 2017, Platinum agreed to sell Vertiv's automatic transfer switch business to Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) for $1.25 billion.
Reuters reported last year that Platinum Equity was exploring a sale of Vertiv with advice from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM).
Cote served as Honeywell's CEO between 2002 and 2017. He is now leading Goldman's first SPAC, as the investment bank seeks to expand its asset management division."
616,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 01:28PM ET</span>",FAA chief to testify at Dec. 11 U.S. House hearing on grounded Boeing 737 MAX,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will testify on Dec. 11 before a U.S. House panel on the agency's review of the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, which was involved in two fatal crashes in five months.
Administrator Steve Dickson will testify before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the committee and the FAA confirmed on Monday.
Boeing has struggled to complete requirements necessary before it can win approval from the agency to resume flights, and U.S. officials told Reuters last week it is extremely unlikely, if not impossible, that the FAA will unground the plane before the end of December.
U.S. lawmakers have been critical of the FAA's prior decisions to delegate a significant amount of plane certification tasks to Boeing. 
The FAA said last week it is not delegating any of the ongoing review of the plane to Boeing, and will be the only issuer of airworthiness certificates for all new 737 MAX planes.
The FAA told Boeing it ""determined that the public interest and safety in air commerce require that the FAA retain authority to issue airworthiness certificates and export certificates of airworthiness for all 737 MAX airplanes.""
Boeing still must complete a software audit and schedule a key certification test flight before the plane can be ungrounded. Dickson, a veteran airline pilot, also has said he will personally fly the plane before he allows it to return to service. 
The three U.S. airlines that operate the 737 MAX - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV),  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) - are scheduling flights without use of the aircraft until early March 2020, nearly a year since the grounding after crashes killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
On Nov. 14, Dickson told his team to ""take whatever time is needed"" in their review of the 737 MAX. The comments came days after Boeing said it expected the FAA to certify the 737 MAX, issue an airworthiness directive and unground the plane in mid-December, even as it acknowledged it would not win approval for changes to pilot training until January.

618,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 01:01PM ET</span>",Off the radar: U.S. CEOs' jet perks add millions to corporate tax bills,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - As U.S. corporate jet use approaches pre-financial crisis levels and chief executives take an increasing number of personal trips on the company tab, many investors are being kept in the dark about the true cost of the perk.
For the S&P 500 companies that pay for their CEOs to use corporate jets for private trips, the estimated median value of that flying climbed 11 percent last year to $107,286 from $96,532 in 2017, according to the latest available figures from compensation research firm Equilar Inc. That is up 27 percent from $84,636 in 2007, the year before the financial crisis.
This is taxable income for executives. The estimates are often based on what a first-class seat would have cost on a commercial flight rather than on the true, much higher cost of using a corporate jet. 
But not only are companies left to pay the full cost of those flights, which can be for anything from family vacations to trips to major sports events or a commute from a distant family home, but they can also find that their tax bills can be significantly higher because of lost deductions.
That is because the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has limited a company's deductions on personal aircraft use to the estimated valuation of the executives' flights. 
As a result, companies forfeit a long list of tax deductions for the time the jets are used for personal trips, including pilots' salaries, maintenance costs, insurance, aircraft depreciation and finance charges. Companies usually can deduct the full cost of these expenses when planes are used for business flights.
Exacerbating the issue, U.S. President Donald Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated deductions on two kinds of flights, said Ruth Wimer, a tax expert and partner at law firm Winston & Strawn LLP in Washington. They are for trips taken purely for business entertainment - such as a CEO taking clients to a golf tournament - and an executive's use of a corporate jet to commute to work from his home, she said.
However, given that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not require disclosure of such lost deductions, investors are none the wiser.
U.S. business jet operations are on track to top 4.5 million arrivals and departures in 2019, the highest since 2007, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data, though only a small percentage are by major company executives.
Popular perceptions of U.S. corporate jet use hit a nadir in 2008 as the financial crisis was worsening. That was when members of Congress blasted the CEOs of the three big U.S. automakers for flying to Washington on corporate jets to ask for financial help. 
The fallout was so bad that in the terms of its bailout General Motors Co (N:GM) was initially barred from corporate jet use. 
""But since then, the whole economy has turned around. The stock market is setting records and jet use has rebounded along with it,"" said Nick Copley, president of SherpaReport.com, which analyzes private aviation trends.
GM is back to operating its own corporate aircraft, according to its disclosures.
'HIDDEN ELEMENT OF EXECUTIVE PAY'
The true cost of corporate jets are a mystery for investors in many companies, though.
A Reuters analysis of proxy filings by companies in the S&P 500 found that only a handful detailed the value of lost deductions in their public filings. 
Among the few to disclose was payments system and credit card company  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) . Its lost deductions from the personal use of company jets by executives and their guests have more than quadrupled between 2016 and 2018, and totaled $4.8 million in its fiscal year to September 2018, according to the company’s last proxy statement.
Visa did not reply to messages seeking comment.
Another exception is cable and broadcast TV group Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), which reported $8.8 million in disallowed deductions in 2018 on flights taken by its executives and guests. 
Comcast declined to comment.
This is a hidden element of executive pay, said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Investment Group, which represents union-sponsored pension funds with nearly 5 million members.
""Having a better sense of how expensive the C-suite is for the company is a very relevant number,"" Waizenegger said. ""If they aren’t disclosed, investors won't know about these lost deductions.""
While the costs for Visa and Comcast, both with annual net earnings of more than $10 billion, may be a drop in the bucket, lost deductions for smaller companies can have a much bigger impact.
Earlier this year, San Francisco-based hedge fund Voce Capital Management LLC targeted disallowed tax deductions in its campaign to gain board seats at insurer Argo Group International Holdings Ltd (N:ARGO). 
The hedge fund argued the Bermuda-based insurance company, which had net income of $63.6 million in 2018, was hurting investors by racking up disallowed tax deductions from corporate jets ""crisscrossing the globe at a dizzying pace."" 
Argo declined to comment for this story. It has said previously that when its executives use corporate aircraft for personal trips they do so at their own expense. However, it does not disclose how that is calculated or detail any lost tax deductions as a result of personal travel. 
Voce has not provided any estimates for lost tax deductions. It did not reply to messages seeking comment. 
However, it did outline in a statement earlier this year what it said ""most ordinary people would consider the trip of a lifetime,"" by then Argo CEO Mark Watson and his family on an Argo Gulfstream jet during the 2017 Christmas holidays.
The trip began in San Antonio, Texas, with stops in Bermuda, New York, Copenhagen and the Malabar Coast of India, Jaipur in northern India, Amsterdam, and then back to Texas over a three-week period.

The company said in October the SEC was investigating Argo's disclosures about executive compensation. Within a few weeks, the company announced Watson's departure.

625,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 10:53AM ET</span>",Norwegian Wins Coveted Heathrow Slots as It Rethinks Long-Haul,"(Bloomberg) --   Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA   (OL:NWC) secured highly-prized operating slots at London Heathrow airport as the discounter focuses long-haul flights on the biggest cities after cutting routes from Scandinavia.
Norwegian won six weekly slot pairs, enough to operate three return trips, according to a report from Airport Coordination Ltd., which allocates takeoff and landing rights at Europe’s busiest hub. The carrier has previously limited long-haul operations from London to the less popular Gatwick facility.
The Heathrow move comes after Norwegian said last week it would stop flying to the U.S. and Thailand from Stockholm and Copenhagen starting in March in order to free up Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 787 jetliners for additional trans-Atlantic services from London, Paris and Barcelona. It also means competing at the main base of British Airways, whose owner IAG (LON:ICAG) SA has made failed bids for Norwegian.
“We have a strong track record of disrupting incumbent carriers and alliances,” Norwegian Air said in emailed comments, adding that it continuously adjusts the network in response to demand.
While Heathrow slots are the priciest in aviation due to the airport’s limited capacity, the number allotted to Norwegian may leave it with a dilemma.
Norwegian initially sought seven slot pairs, which would have allowed it to offer a daily timetable. Operating just three times weekly would bring significant entrance costs with limited rewards, yet if the carrier doesn’t utilize the rights it risks losing them.
Norwegian’s Dreamliner fleet has also been afflicted with availability issues as glitches concerning the jets’ Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON:RR) engines require them to be idled for remedial work. An improved blade for the latest version of the Trent 1000 turbine won’t be ready until 2021.
The carrier in September called a halt to Trans-Atlantic flying with narrow-body planes, saying that while the move had been prompted by the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max model after two fatal crashes, the services between smaller cities in the U.S. and Europe wouldn’t be resumed."
626,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 10:52AM ET</span>",Repo Fretting Shifts to Treasuries as Market Faces Next Test,"(Bloomberg) -- Flare-ups in the repo market could still cause worries across the global banking system, more than two months after chaos subsided in this vital corner of finance.
Of particular concern: U.S. Treasuries, the world’s biggest bond market and the place where the federal government funds its escalating deficit. If repo rates become jumpy again -- and many are girding for that to happen in the middle and end of this month -- some of those leveraged investors may have to unwind Treasury holdings, potentially increasing the U.S. government’s interest costs at a time of record borrowing.
“If repos were much harder to get at reasonable rates, Treasury prices would drop,” said Darrell Duffie, a Stanford University finance professor who’s co-authored research on repo with Federal Reserve staffers. “The cost to taxpayers for funding the national debt would therefore rise.”
Mid-December will see a recurrence of the same circumstances that apparently led to the September eruption -- quarterly corporate tax payments that drained cash from the banking system, coupled with Treasury settlements that prompted a rush for scarce reserves. Also, many analysts believe banks, particularly those based in Europe, will retreat around New Year’s Eve from the repo market, driving up rates by pulling cash from the system as others try to secure financing. European banks face slightly different capital rules, encouraging them to reduce their end-of-year footprint and the amount of equity financing they need to back up their assets.
At the Fed’s term repo auction on Monday, demand for funds that would tie over financing through the end of the year came in about twice the amount the central bank was offering to lend, showing the thirst for cash during the period.
While the Fed has taken steps to bring order back to repo, adding liquidity by buying Treasury bills and doing overnight repo operations, many fret that won’t be enough to keep rates under control. For those still scarred by the financial crisis a decade ago, the spike in repo rates in September triggered painful memories of the credit contagion in 2008 that took down some of the largest U.S. banks. The risk has since shifted to hedge funds and independent broker-dealers, the primary users of short-term repos used to finance positions in U.S. government debt.
The repo market has changed significantly from September 2008, when nervous investors decided not to roll over overnight funding for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., causing the investment bank to collapse. Lehman was overly reliant on repo for its funding needs, and had too many assets tied to securitized subprime mortgages that had plunged in value as the U.S. housing market collapsed.
Today, big banks have lots of other funding sources -- more in deposits, in particular, than they had before the crisis. Repos -- or repurchase agreements, transactions that amount to collateralized short-term loans often made overnight -- are no longer a crucial source of funding for the biggest Wall Street firms, which are now net lenders in the market.
“As banks got smaller in the repo market, non-bank dealers like us filled the void,” said Scott Skyrm, executive vice president of Curvature Securities LLC. “We absorbed what used to go to the banks, and it’s all divvied up among lots of small firms. Banks are still active, but they’re not as big as they used to be.”
Instead of helping to fund esoteric structured products, repos now overwhelmingly finance Treasury holdings. So even if some of the weakest investors were to blow up, the contagion would be small because lenders can seize Treasuries backing the loans to cover losses.
While most smaller broker-dealers only intermediate between borrowers and lenders, a few also take positions with some of the money they borrow. Such proprietary trading was big for Lehman and other big Wall Street firms before being restricted under the Volcker Rule.
Independent dealers such as Ronin Capital LLC and Aardvark Securities LLC, both based in Chicago, are allowed to take proprietary risks because they aren’t part of banking groups. Neither firm responded to emails and phone calls seeking comment.
Hedge funds and broker-dealers aren’t the only buyers of U.S. government debt, of course. There are also cash buyers, such as mutual funds, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds, who buy the Treasuries with money they have, without any need to borrow. But leveraged buyers have gained importance as others slowed their purchases.
As U.S. government debt rose by $1 trillion in the 12 months through March, more than 80% of it was absorbed by “other investors,” a category in the U.S. Treasury Department’s latest available database that includes broker-dealers and hedge funds. In the same period, holdings by primary dealers -- mostly the biggest banks’ broker-dealer units -- increased by only about $100 billion.
Repo funding rose by at least $400 billion in the same period, New York Fed data show, a sign that the debt increase was taken up mostly by leveraged investors like hedge funds. Since March, the debt has risen by almost $1 trillion more. And, in the past two years, the rising supply coupled with shrinking demand from foreign buyers has forced primary dealers to increase their Treasury holdings, which they typically finance through the repo market as well.
“If it becomes a negative-carry trade due to constant spikes in funding rates, hedge funds and other leveraged investors won’t continue buying Treasuries,” said Peter Nowicki, head of the repo desk at Wedbush Securities Inc., a broker-dealer active in the market. “Meanwhile the magnitude of supply has been breathtaking. Can the plumbing absorb it?”
The weak demand for government bonds sold a few days after the September spikes shows the ultimate pain a troubled repo market can cause, Nowicki said. Even if cash investors picked up the slack, the weaker demand from repo-funded buyers could increase yields, even if not by huge amounts, according to Curvature’s Skyrm.
Banks, both before the crisis and now, serve as intermediaries between cash investors -- money-market funds, corporations, insurance companies and municipalities who want to lend their extra cash for a better return -- and short-term borrowers like hedge funds, real estate investment trusts and smaller broker-dealers who finance holdings of longer-term securities.
Recent turmoil aside, post-crisis regulations have tamed the repo market. Banks’ capital requirements increased, with repos no longer exempt from those calculations. The largest banks face surcharges for relying too much on short-term funding, and money-market funds -- the biggest suppliers of cash -- are no longer allowed to have fixed valuations if they invest in anything other than Treasuries or repos backed by them.
Stronger internal controls -- a post-crisis phenomenon that accompanied stricter rules and supervision -- also make the big banks more aware of how much risk their leveraged clients are taking with borrowed money, even if they’re the middle men. Hedge funds’ positions in the Treasury market using repos are constantly monitored by their prime-brokerage contacts at the big banks, who can then force the funds to exit their positions if and when losses mount, fund managers say.
That will limit systemic risk, bank executives and regulators say. But even if the risk isn’t significant, the Fed will pull all the stops to prevent future hiccups, said Glenn Havlicek, co-founder of GLMX LLC, which provides technology services to market players.
“The repo market is the oil in the wheels of the Treasury market,” Havlicek said."

630,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>",Could life insurance go up in smoke for some vapers?,"By Carolyn Cohn, Suzanne Barlyn and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global reinsurers are stepping up their warnings to life insurer clients about the potential risks of vaping, putting pressure on underwriters to charge certain vapers higher rates than smokers, or even exclude them altogether.
U.S. authorities said last month that there had been 47 deaths this year from a lung illness tied to vaping. The health concerns about vaping have grown despite evidence showing e-cigarettes help smokers to quit, and has led to bans in some countries including India and Brazil. 
Reinsurers insure the insurers, and often have large research arms which help their clients by modeling risk. They give broad advice to insurers, rather than specific policy or pricing recommendations, but can potentially refuse to provide reinsurance or can raise premiums if their guidance is ignored.
Most insurers have long treated smokers and vapers the same, meaning they can pay close to double the premiums of non-smokers or non-vapers. But three major reinsurers have provided updated advice on vaping in the past three months, with new warnings, while others are considering their approach. 
The new warnings focus on young vapers and the vaping of liquids containing marijuana ingredient THC, which is legal and prevalent in some U.S. states and has been linked to lung illnesses in the country.
The shift in the reinsurance and insurance sector represents a further blow to the vaping industry, which markets its products as healthier alternatives to smoking.  
Hannover RE (DE:HNRGn), which already advised life insurers to treat vapers like smokers, has asked them to be particularly cautious about insuring people aged under 25 following the ""epidemic"" of lung injuries in the United States, said Nico van Zyl, the reinsurer's U.S. medical director.
The question of whether to offer coverage to this higher risk group should be a consideration for life insurers, he said. 
French reinsurer SCOR (PA:SCOR) said in a paper on Oct. 24 that e-cigarettes contain nicotine which may have toxic effects, including on brain development in teenagers and young adults.
SCOR recommends life insurers treat vaping like smoking, and exclude individuals who use vaping products considered by U.S. authorities likely to cause lung issues - namely, those containing THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).
 Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) also treats vapers like smokers. In addition, Global Chief Medical Officer John Schoonbee said the reinsurer has told insurers in recent months to make extra checks on whether vapers are using cannabis products. 
(GRAPHIC: Insurers increasingly nervous about e-cigarettes - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/VAPING-INSURANCE/0H001QXMM9PW/eikon.png) 
AMERICAN WARNING
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged people not to use e-cigarettes containing THC, some of which contain vitamin E acetate, a ""chemical of concern"" among people with the vaping-associated lung injury EVALI. 
Stephen Cooley, Chief Medical Underwriter at PartnerRe Life & Health (N:PRE_pf), said more research on the long-term effects of vaping was needed and that life insurance rates for vapers would be the same as smoker rates ""at best"".
Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) and Gen Re said they were monitoring the recent developments in EVALI. 
Proponents of vaping as a tool to stop smoking say the insurers' and reinsurers' approach is harsh.
""Getting insurance is really expensive for people who have taken steps to quit tobacco,"" said Simon Manthorpe, CEO of British vaping product manufacturer Vapemate. 
Vaping in Britain and elsewhere in Europe is more heavily regulated than in the United States. Vapes containing THC or cannabis oil of any kind are banned in Britain, and Public Health England says vaping is at least 95% safer than smoking.

VAPING SWITCH
Twelve of 13 life insurers contacted by Reuters in Europe, South Africa and the United States said they already treated vaping like smoking. 
Most have taken this stance for years, but a handful have recently made the switch to treating vapers like smokers: U.S. insurer Prudential Financial (N:PRU) made the change in October, while the Irish subsidiaries of  Aviva  (L:AV) and Zurich (S:ZURN) have switched in the past year. 
Zurich in Ireland said its new approach followed consultation with reinsurers.
Explaining their caution on vaping, Britain's Aviva and South Africa's Discovery (J:DSYJ) said there was a lack of objective evidence of the long-term effects. Justin Harper, head of protection marketing at British insurer LV=, highlighted recent evidence indicating that vaping damages the lungs.
Harper said a 20-year policy for a 35-year old offering 100,000 pounds ($128,300) of life cover and 100,000 pounds of critical illness cover would cost 11.89 pounds a month for a non-smoker/non-vaper, and 20.56 pounds for a smoker/vaper.
The life insurers told Reuters they were not treating young vapers differently, though Zurich said it was monitoring statistics on increased deaths or illness among this age group. 
One exception among the life insurers in its vaping view is Reviti, a new insurer owned by cigarette and e-cigarette firm Philip Morris (N:PM). It is offering a discount of up to 15% for vapers in Britain. Customers who quit tobacco and nicotine altogether get a discount of up to 50%.

VW was caught using illegal software to cheat pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel and numerous court cases around the world that have so far cost the German company 30 billion euros ($33 billion)
Volkswagen has said about 11 million cars worldwide - and 1.2 million in Britain - were fitted with software that cheated diesel emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes and carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution.
A hearing at the High Court is set to last for two weeks.
""This trial will establish once and for all whether VW installed prohibited 'defeat devices' in affected vehicles and is a significant milestone in our clients' attempts to hold VW accountable in the UK,"" Gareth Pope, head of group litigation at law firm Slater and Gordon, said. Slater and Gordon is representing more than 70,000 VW customers.
The High Court will determine two issues of law. Firstly whether the software installed in vehicles was a ""defeat device"" under EU regulations and whether the High Court is bound by the German Regulator's finding that the software was a ""defeat device."" 
Volkswagen said the answer to both cases was no. 
""Volkswagen Group continues to defend robustly its position in the High Court in London,"" it said in a statement. ""It remains Volkswagen Group's case that the claimants did not suffer any loss at all and that the affected vehicles did not contain a prohibited defeat device. 
""The hearing will not affect any questions of liability or loss.""
VW agreed to pay up to $25 billion in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. It offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.

But the company has not reached a similar deal in Europe and has instead offered a software update. It argues it has not broken any English law.

YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) is committed to its automaking alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) but will not look to deepen its capital ties with the French automaker any time soon, its new CEO said on Monday.
On his first day in the new position, chief executive Makoto Uchida also pledged to repair profitability at Japan's No. 2 automaker and said setting realistic targets would be key toward that goal, as it tries to make a clean break from the leadership of former chairman Carlos Ghosn.
""Closer capital ties with Renault are not a focus in the short term,"" he told reporters.
Uchida became CEO of Nissan on Dec. 1, as the car maker tries to recover from a profit slump and draw a line under a year of turmoil after the Ghosn scandal. The ousted chairman is fighting financial misconduct charges in Japan.
One of the new CEO's big tasks is to salvage ties with Renault, which have deteriorated since Ghosn's ouster as chairman of both companies.
Renault holds a 43.4% stake in Nissan after it saved the Japanese automaker from financial ruin two decades ago, and has pushed for the two companies to merge.
In rejecting a notion of a merger with Renault, Uchida, 53, echoes his predecessor Hiroto Saikawa, who stepped down in September. 
He added that the alliance must re-think how it can serve all of its three members, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211).
""The alliance has to benefit each of its partners in terms of revenue and profit,"" he said.
""We need to re-evaluate what has worked and what hasn't worked in the alliance in the past few years.""
The CEO called for Nissan to set ""challenging but achievable"" targets, adding that this and the launch of more new car models and vehicle technologies would be key to its financial recovery. 
Nissan is bracing for its lowest annual profit in 11 years and has slashed its dividend by 65%. Its struggles come at a time when car companies desperately need scale to keep up with sweeping technological changes like electric vehicles and ride-hailing.
""Somewhere along the way we created a culture of setting targets which could not be achieved,"" Uchida said, adding that this had resulted in a focus on short-term results.

""Years of this had led Nissan to its current ""difficult situation,"" he said, using heavy vehicle discounting in the U.S. market as an example of how aggressive sales targets to grow market share had deteriorated the company's brand.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 06:01AM ET</span>",Italy to seek parliament vote to end ESM reform dispute,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy's government will hold a vote in parliament next week to decide on reform of the euro zone's bailout fund, as divisions within Rome's ruling coalition deepen.
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement opposes signing off on the reform until plans for a wider European banking union become clearer, while the center-left Democratic Party (PD) supports the plan.
The coalition infighting could hinder plans by the euro zone's 19 member states to reach agreement on reforming the fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) this month.
The proposed reform of the ESM would give it more powers to handle financial crises, broaden the euro zone's monitoring powers over countries with economic imbalances and, if required, facilitate the restructuring of government debt.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte met key government officials on Sunday in an attempt to settle the dispute, but failed to reach a final agreement.
""Any decision over the ESM will become definitive only after the Parliament resolutions that will be approved on Dec. 11,"" a source at the Prime Minister's office said after the meeting.
In what promises to be a heated debate, Conte is due to address parliament on the reform at 1200 GMT on Monday.
Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has repeatedly spoken in favor of ESM reform, dismissing charges by the opposition, right-wing League party that it is against Italy's interests and has been negotiated without parliament's approval.
However, 5-Star is closer to the League's position and says the reform needs substantial changes.
The compromise position that appears to be emerging among the ruling parties is that Italy will sign off on ESM changes only if it gets assurances on other aspects of euro zone reform currently on the table.
Rome wants assurances that sovereign bonds will not lose their status as risk-free assets with the European banking union, a government source told Reuters on Monday, a position later confirmed on the record by a junior economy minister.
""In particular, what we don't want (is that) public debts are risk-weighted according to the credit rating of the countries, which would be very damaging for us,"" Maria Cecilia Guerra said on the margins of a conference in Milan."

640,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 05:29AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Europe Markets Rise on PMIs, German Fiscal Boost Hopes","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets started December already in festive spirit, after purchasing manager indexes around the world showed further signs that the world economy may be stabilizing after a marked slowdown caused largely by the U.S.-China trade war.
By 5:20 AM ET (1020 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was at 408.86, up 0.4% from Friday, albeit well off an intraday high of 410.04, as the market reconsidered its initial exuberance.
At first sight, an uptick in PMIs from China and Japan to Turkey, Britain and the euro zone seemed too good to ignore.
However, analysts were quick to point to other recent news out of China suggesting that there will be no quick and sharp recovery, given the ongoing trade war and China’s increasing corporate and household debt problem, which limits its scope to reflate the domestic economy. 
In an article published over the weekend in a Communist Party magazine, central bank governor Yi Gang warned that “The world’s economic downturn will likely stay for a long time.”
“We should stay focused and targeted, while not competitively lowering interest rates to zero or engaging in quantitative easing,” Bloomberg quoted him as writing.
Among national markets, Germany’s Dax was among the biggest winners, gaining 0.7%. In addition to the support from China’s Caixin PMI, which lifted trade-sensitive stocks, the DAX also profited from domestic political developments at the weekend, where the Social Democrats’ election of a new and more clearly left-wing leadership raised the likelihood of Berlin loosening its purse strings. The yield on the German 10-year Bund rose to a three-week high in response.
If the German federal coalition should fall apart, it’s more than possible that any new administration would involve the Green Party. That awareness helped push down energy company RWE by over 2%, and kept rival E.On also at the bottom of the DAX. By contrast, wind turbine maker Nordex rose over 4.0% Elsewhere across Europe, conventional energy stocks were likewise under pressure at the start of a week that includes a high-level international conference in Spain on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China on Sunday put into effect new regulations that require Chinese telecom carriers to scan the faces of users registering new mobile phone services, a move the government says is aimed at cracking down on fraud.
The rules, first announced in September, mean millions more people will come under the purview of facial recognition technology in China.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not say which companies will provide the telecoms providers with these services but China is home to some of the world's leaders in facial recognition software, including Megvii and SenseTime.
WHAT ARE THE NEW RULES FOR CHINESE MOBILE PHONE USERS?
China's telecom operators must now use facial recognition technology and other means to verify the identity of people opening new mobile phone accounts.
China's three largest carriers are state-owned China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile. It was unclear how the law applies to existing mobile accounts.
WHERE ELSE IN CHINA HAS THE TECHNOLOGY BEEN USED?
Supermarkets, subway systems and airports already use facial recognition technology.  Alibaba  (N:BABA) gives customers the option to pay using their face at its Hema supermarket chain and runs a hotel in its headquarters city of Hangzhou where guests can scan their face with their smartphones for advance check-in.
The metro systems of some major Chinese cities have announced they will use the technology, with government-owned newspaper China Daily saying Beijing will use it to ""classify passengers"" to allow for ""different security check measures"".
In July, the Xinhua news agency said Beijing had, or was in the process of, installing facial recognition systems at the entrances of 59 public rental housing communities.
Reuters reported last year on its wide use in the western Xinjiang region, an area wracked by separatist violence and a crackdown by security forces that has seen Uighur Muslims and members of other ethic groups detained in camps. China says the camps are re-education and training centers.
Chinese police are also known to have high tech surveillance gadgets such as glasses with built-in facial recognition.
HOW HAS ITS INTRODUCTION BEEN VIEWED BY THE CHINESE PUBLIC?
Surveillance technologies have encountered little public opposition, but there has been some mostly anonymous debate on social media platforms like Weibo.
Some users argue that it is a needed to combat fraud, like scam calls, but others have voiced concerns about its implications for personal data, privacy and ethics.
One rare case of opposition has involved a university lecturer, who sued a wildlife park in Hangzhou after it replaced its fingerprint-based entry system with one that used facial recognition technology.
The Southern (NYSE:SO) Metropolis Daily newspaper, which reported on the case in November, said he was worried that the system might result in identify theft and asked for a refund. He sued after the park denied his request.
HAS CHINA EXPORTED ANY OF THIS TECH OVERSEAS?
Countries from Myanmar to Argentina have purchased surveillance technology from the likes of China's ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) and Huawei Technologies as part of plans to create ""smart cities"".
There has been U.S. blowback over the work Chinese firms like Megvii and SenseTime have played in Beijing's treatment of Muslim minorities. The United States expanded its trade blacklist in October to include these firms, and others, barring them from buying components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.
WHAT IS NEXT?
The technology is currently being tested in areas such as street crossings to catch jaywalkers and China has announced that it will eventually expand its use to others like student registrations for its National College Entrance Examination.
There has also been calls for greater regulatory oversight.
The People's Daily on Saturday called for an investigation, saying one of its reporters had found face data could be found for sale on the Internet, with a package of 5,000 faces costing just 10 yuan ($1.42).
Last week, China's Internet regulator announced new rules governing the use of deepfake technology, which uses AI to create hyper-realistic videos where a person appears to say or do something they did not."

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets rebounded on Monday as decent manufacturing data in China and renewed optimism over a trade deal eroded some of the jitters which emerged among investors last week.
The recovery in Europe followed gains in Asia, where share prices again approached record highs as investors stuck with bets that a trade deal between the United States and China is imminent, something which has fueled the rally in asset prices in recent weeks.
Last week's decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to sign legislation backing protesters in Hong Kong initially rattled markets, with worries it will unravel progress made in talks between Beijing and Washington.
But investors are nonetheless sticking with the broad view that a further escalation in the trade war can be avoided.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, edged up 0.1 percent and was close to last week's highs.
In Europe, the Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.26 percent while the German DAX (GDAXI) was 0.23 percent higher. French (FCHI) and British (FTSE) shares were also climbing.
Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 (http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/GLOBAL-CURRENCIES-PERFORMANCE/0100301V041/index.html)
Chinese data did much to help the mood after the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) index rose to 51.8 in November from 51.7 in the previous month, marking the fastest expansion since December 2016.
""What we had in China on the weekend with the two PMIs being above expectation is clearly a good sign in terms of making the global stabilization scenario more credible,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
Savary noted that European manufacturing data had also posted an improvement, while euro zone inflation was higher than expected.
""Not only do we have signs of economic stabilization, we also have a decreased risk of deflation. I am not sure if that means markets should be hitting record highs, a lot of positive news has been priced in,"" he added.
In Germany, the surprise election of new leftist leaders to the Social Democrats (SPD) threatened the ruling coalition, sparking a jump in German bond yields as markets bet it would ease the path towards fiscal expansion.
The 10-year German bond yield was last up 5 basis points at -0.302 percent (DE10YT=RR), a two-week high. That helped spur a selloff across euro zone government bond markets.
U.S. Treasury yields were also notably higher, with the 10-year bond yield up by more than 7 basis points at a two-week high (US10YT=RR).
The buoyant mood among investors was also evident in the U.S. dollar, which has tended to perform well on hopes for a trade deal. It rallied to a six-month high of 109.73 yen , its strongest against the safe-haven currency since May.
Currency markets were largely quiet elsewhere, with the euro little changed at $1.1016 (EUR=EBS).
Investors have long thought that the United States will avoid imposing an additional 15 percent tariff on about $156 billion of Chinese products on Dec. 15 after signing a deal with China.
But the two countries have been so far unable to bridge the gap over existing tariffs on Chinese goods, with Beijing demanding the scrapping of them as a part of any trade deal.
""It looks a bit difficult for two countries' leaders to shake hands and sign a deal this month. What is more likely is to essentially kick the can, with China buying more U.S. farm products while the U.S. postpones its next tariffs,"" said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.
""Markets will consider such an arrangement as a de facto deal whether they officially sign it or not,"" he said.
Oil prices recovered slightly after a big slump on Friday on record high U.S. crude production. Expectations that OPEC and its allies are set to extend existing oil output cuts when they meet this week helped drive the rebound.
Brent crude (LCOc1) futures rose 1.21 percent to $61.22 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) gained 0.85 percent to $56.02 per barrel.

Ocado (LON:OCDO) said it will issue around 500 million pounds ($646 million) in convertible bonds to fund the expansion of its Ocado Solutions automated warehousing technology, following recent big deals with U.S. supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Sweden’s ICA.
Terms of the bond offering will be finalized later today. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are joint bookrunners.

Separately, Ocado (LON:OCDO) also gave a brief update on Ocado Retail, the U.K. operations that it is folding into a joint venture with Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS). It said it expects sales to be up by 10%-11% in the 13 weeks to Dec. 1.

Gold and silver miner   Fresnillo   (LON:FRES) said this year’s output of gold and silver would be at the bottom of the range it had previously announced, at 885,000 ounces of gold and 55 million ounces of silver. It also pushed back the timeline for developing its Orisyvo and Ciénega mines, so as to focus on its current operations.
 Fresnillo  (LON:FRES) had already cut its guidance forecast in July due to lower-than-expected ore grades and construction problems at the Herradura mine in Mexico. The updated guidance is as follows:
2020: c. 54moz ±5% of silver and c. 857koz ±5% of gold.
2021: c. 66moz ±5% of silver and c. 785koz ±5% of gold. 
2022: c. 71moz ±5% of silver and c. 665koz ±5% of gold
 Fresnillo  (LON:FRES) also said it expects capital expenditure of $585 million this year, as it defers $65 million in spending at its Juanicipio mine into 2020. That means 2020 capex will total around $670 million, falling to $475 million in 2021 and $415 million in 2022.

Real estate developer  Capital & Counties Properties  (LON:CAPCC) said it will revert to REIT status by the end of the year after agreeing the sale of its vast Earls Court development site.


The company will receive 211 million pounds up front with the remaining 156 million pounds (after adjusting for net debt and other items) to be paid in two installments over the next two years.


The sale leaves Capco with 900 million pounds in cash overall at a time when economic weakness and structural change in the commercial market have created some rare opportunities in the prime London market.


  Premier Oil   (LON:PMO) said had produced the first gas find from its BIG-P project in Indonesia.
The oil and gas company has revised its estimate of gas reserves at the project higher after discovering additional productive sands during the drilling process.
Beleaguered fashion brand   Ted Baker   (LON:TED) said it had identified that the value of inventory held on its balance sheet had been overstated. 
Based on preliminary analysis, the Board estimates an impact on value of £20m to £25m.
The company, whose shares have fallen by 74% already this year after losing its CEO to a governance scandal, said there would be no cash impact from the revaluation, which would relate only to prior years. 

Production at the BIG-P site is part of a wider long-term oil and gas expansion project in Asia.
The oil and gas company said the find was completed below budget and on schedule.
""This is further evidence of Premier's ability to execute full cycle projects from exploration through to production. BIG-P increases the deliverability from our operated Natuna Sea Block A enabling us to meet a growing market share within our existing gas contracts."" CEO Tony Durrant said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Tadawul has introduced an equity index (TASI) cap of 15% which is set to address concerns over the weighting oil giant Saudi Aramco will have when it lists on the exchange.
State-owned oil firm Aramco is expected to list 1.5% of its shares this month in a deal which could raise more than $25 billion and top the record initial public offering (IPO) of Chinese retailer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014.
The Aramco IPO is seen as a test for the Saudi exchange, where the largest listing so far has been worth $6 billion.
""Any constituent whose index weight reaches or exceeds the threshold will be capped in accordance with the set limit,"" Tadawul said in a statement on Monday.
The move is part of a broader update of Tadawul's index methodology, including a revision of the free float shares calculation methodology for shares owned by government entities.
The new measures will ""ensure more balanced indices, which will accurately represent the movement of the market, enhance disclosures and transparency and minimize securities’ dominance,"" Tadawul's CEO Khalid Al Hussan said in a statement.
Tadawul also said it has applied a new ""Fast Entry"" rule allowing shares of IPOs to be included in the all-share equity index at the close of the fifth trading day.

U.S. prosecutors are currently investigating former members of the union in connection with a corruption probe. A former UAW board member has been charged with conspiring with other union leaders to embezzle hundreds of thousands of dollars of rank-and-file members' dues.
""Government oversight of the UAW is a possible solution to reforming the union,"" said Schneider, who is leading the probe. He added that pushing for federal oversight of the UAW is a little premature.

FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has in recent weeks stepped up its investigation into Deutsche Bank's role in the 200 billion euro ($220 billion)  Danske Bank  money laundering scandal, four people familiar with the inquiry told Reuters.
One source said the DoJ's new line of inquiry is whether Deutsche (DE:DBKGn) helped move tainted money from Danske (CO:DANSKE), Denmark's largest lender, into the United States. If proven, that could lead to steep financial penalties.
Officials from the DoJ, who have been working closely with Estonian prosecutors for around a year, have also begun cooperating with Frankfurt state prosecutors, the sources said.
The Frankfurt prosecutors have been exploring Deutsche's role in processing payments for the Danish bank.
The DoJ's focus on Germany's largest bank and its work with Frankfurt prosecutors have not previously been reported.
A Danske spokesman said it continued to cooperate with the authorities in Estonia, Denmark, France and the United States.
The DoJ and Frankfurt state prosecutors declined to comment on the U.S. investigation, which two sources told Reuters is due to be completed next year.
Deutsche Bank's spokesman said it had significantly improved controls in recent years.
""We have repeatedly stressed that we are in a good and constructive exchange with the authorities,"" he added.
Danske's admission last year that suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros from Russia and elsewhere flowed through its branch in Estonia has triggered worldwide probes.
The bulk of these payments were processed by Deutsche, sources have previously told Reuters.
Although the Justice Department requested information from Deutsche last year relating to Danske transactions, at the time its executives believed that the investigation was focused onDanske and that the German bank itself was not a target.
However, Deutsche officials were made aware in recent months that the scope of the DoJ probe had broadened to the bank's role in facilitating the Danske trades and its possible failure to report suspicious transactions quickly enough, one of the people said.
Deutsche has already paid nearly $700 million in fines by New York and British regulators in a separate money laundering case involving $10 billion in so-called mirror trades from Russia, which the DoJ is still investigating.
FOLLOWING THE MONEY
U.S. investigators have spoken to current and former Deutsche compliance staff in the U.S. who raised concerns over possible suspect transactions with supervisors but were ignored, two people said, adding that some involved Danske.
Estonian prosecutors are sharing their findings on Danske, hoping they will share in the proceeds in the event of U.S. fines, four people said.
One source said Estonian prosecutors are examining more than ten transactions involving up to $2 billion of suspect criminal funds in total. Reuters could not ascertain the details of those deals.
Deutsche alerted Germany's money laundering data authority and state prosecutors in February to more than one million suspect money transfers, two people said, five years after a whistleblower raised the alarm at Danske.
Washington and Frankfurt are now asking what led to the delay and whether there were lapses as some of the contested money transfers, which were earlier singled out by compliance staff, are among those Deutsche later flagged, two people said.
Frankfurt prosecutors have also questioned Sylvie Matherat, Deutsche's former top official in charge of anti-moneylaundering and the highest ranking of ten Deutsche bankers and executives they have interviewed.
Matherat, who left Deutsche this year, and the others were interviewed as witnesses whose first-hand knowledge is being drawn on to form an overall picture, the person said.
Matherat declined to comment. A Deutsche spokesman confirmed she had been interviewed as a witness."

The U.S. embassy in London submitted the extradition request on Nov. 21 for Lynch to stand trial in the United States, according to a court filing dated Dec. 1.
Lynch, once hailed as Britain's answer to Bill Gates, is currently battling the American IT giant in London's High Court.
HP is seeking damages of $5 billion from Lynch and Sushovan Hussain, the former chief financial officer of Autonomy, alleging that they inflated the value of the company before selling it. HP took an $8.8 billion writedown a year after buying Autonomy.
Lynch has denied the accusations, saying HP mismanaged the acquisition. He is counter-suing for loss and damages.
The extradition order relates to Lynch's indictment in San Francisco on 17 counts including wire fraud, conspiracy and securities fraud, which carries a maximum term of 25 years in prison.
A spokesman for Lynch has said the charges are ""baseless and egregious"".
Hussain has already been sentenced in San Francisco, receiving a five-year prison term and a $4 million fine in May. He was also ordered to forfeit $6.1 million after being convicted on 16 counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy.
Hussain was granted bail in June while he appeals his conviction. In allowing the appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said it raised a ""substantial question"" of law.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.5% to 26,505 by 9:20 PM ET (02:19 GMT) in early morning trade as the positive economic data out of China overshadowed the return of protesters to the streets of Hong Kong after two weeks of relative calm.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.49% to 2,886 while the SZSE Component rose 0.51% to 9,631.
Still, markets remain wary of any faltering in trade negotiations between the US and China. Over the weekend, the nationalist Global Times tabloid tweeted that any phase one deal would have to be tied to a rollback in US tariffs on Chinese goods. As things stand today, the next batch of tariff increases will take effect on Dec. 15.
In October, US President Donald Trump suggested a phase one deal was basically in place but nothing has been signed yet.

655,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 01, 2019 09:33PM ET</span>",Yes Bank Gets $2 Billion Pledge From Little-Known Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- Yes Bank Ltd., an Indian lender caught in the country’s deepening shadow banking crisis, boosted its target for a capital raising to $2 billion after receiving commitments from new investors.
The nation’s fourth-largest private lender said its board signed off on the capital increase, which is higher than the previous figure of $1.2 billion, at a meeting on Friday. Investors including Canada’s Erwin Singh Braich, SPGP Holdings and Citax Holdings Ltd. “individually expressed their agreement/willingness to subscribe to equity shares,” according to a stock exchange filing.
The board will meet again on Dec. 10 to approve a preferential allotment of shares to investors, none of which will receive more than a 25% stake in the bank.
Yes Bank needs to raise new capital after being forced to step up provisioning against bad loans, including to some of the non-bank lenders caught up in the country’s shadow banking crisis. The lender’s core equity capital is 8.70%, barely above the regulatory minimum of about 8%.
There was some disappointment about the lack of a heavyweight international investor among the firms and individuals announced on Friday.
“The market was expecting strong and marquee global names and they are all missing,” said Siddharth Purohit an analyst with SMC Global Securities.
Braich and SPGP Holdings together committed $1.2 billion to the capital increase, the largest single amount, followed by Citax with $500 million, the filing said. The bank will this week disclose the name of a “top tier U.S. fund house” which committed $120 million, it added.
The new shares will be priced at around 78 rupees ($1.09) each based on the average over the past six months, Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill said in an interview with CNBC-TV18 on Sunday. That would represent a 14% premium to Yes Bank’s closing price of 68.30 rupees on Friday.
India’s preferential allotment rules bar investors from participating if they have sold the shares during the past six months. That excluded several potential candidates because of the wholesale selling of Yes Bank shares during 2019 -- they are down over 60% from the start of the year.
Yes Bank’s discussions with Erwin Braich and SPGP are ongoing and are “expected to be concluded shortly,” the filing said. In the meantime a binding term sheet has been extended until the end of the year, it added.
Erwin Braich
Braich is the son of the late Herman Singh Braich, Canadian court documents show. The father emigrated to Canada from Punjab at the age of 14 and founded a flourishing sawmill business in the 1950s, and his family became a pillar of a growing Canadian-Indian community, according to a family history recounted by a local museum.
Since the patriarch’s death in 1976, Braich has battled members of his family and creditors in numerous lawsuits, according to Canadian court records.
In 1999, Braich was petitioned into bankruptcy by unidentified creditors and declared zero assets, according to bankruptcy records. KPMG, the trustee, estimated his liabilities at more than C$20 million ($15.1 million), a figure Braich has hotly contested, court documents show. It took four years for creditors to recover C$60,000 in cash and shares, and a decade to discharge the bankruptcy, according to court filings and bankruptcy records.
Braich couldn’t be reached for comment.
Citax Holdings had shareholder funds of 20,107 pounds ($26,000) as of June 30, 2018, according to the last balance sheet filed with U.K. Companies House. Srinavasan Solaraj and Srinavasan Gopala Solaraj are listed as “persons with significant control” over Citax Holdings, but the filing doesn’t provide any contact information.
Approval from the Reserve Bank of India is required for stake purchases in Indian banks of more than 5%. Any non-financial entity can buy up to 10% of a lender, and for a financial entity the cap is 15%. In general the central bank is reluctant to allow larger stakes, though there’s a provision to allow a single investor to pick up 40% or more under special circumstances.
A notable such exception came three years ago when Canada’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. was allowed to buy a 51% stake in CSB Bank Ltd., then known as Catholic Syrian Bank Ltd. That marked the first time the central bank let a foreign firm take a majority interest in a local lender.
If Braich, SPGP and Citax don’t get clearance from the RBI to invest in Yes Bank, “it may face a tough time maintaining regulatory capital ratios going forward,” Jefferies analysts Nilanjan Karfa and Harshit Toshniwal wrote in a note.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union on Saturday announced a tentative agreement for a four-year labor contract, a boost for the automaker as it works to merge with France's Groupe PSA.
Italian-American Fiat Chrysler and PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen, last month announced a planned $50 billion merger to create the world's fourth-largest automaker.
The tentative agreement with Fiat Chrysler, which is subject to ratification by the union members, follows contracts that the UAW already concluded with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
The deal with GM followed a 40-day strike in the United States that virtually shuttered GM's North American operations and cost the automaker $3 billion.
The UAW on Saturday said the contract with Fiat Chrysler included a commitment from FCA to invest $9 billion, creating 7,900 new jobs over the course of the four-year contract. Of the $9 billion, $4.5 billion was announced earlier this year, to be invested in five plants and creating 6,500 jobs. 
Detailed terms of the tentative agreement were not released, but they are expected to echo those under the new contracts with GM and Ford, as the UAW typically uses the first deal as a pattern for the others.
""FCA has been a great American success story thanks to the hard work of our members,"" UAW acting President Rory Gamble said in a statement. ""We have achieved substantial gains and job security provisions for the fastest growing auto company in the United States.""
Ratification is not a sure thing. Rank-and-file UAW members at FCA in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract. In addition, a lawsuit related to a federal corruption probe could also raise doubts among union members about the terms agreed. 
The federal corruption led GM to file a racketeering lawsuit against FCA, alleging that its rival bribed union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. FCA has brushed off the lawsuit as groundless.
Under the UAW's deal with GM, the automaker agreed to invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 billion directly in its plants, and to create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs. 
Ford's contract included commitments to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. plants and to create or retain more than 8,500 UAW jobs.
The deals with GM and Ford also created a pathway to full-time employment for temporary workers and left healthcare insurance coverage unchanged.

Both automakers also agreed to signing bonuses, with $9,000 for full-time Ford workers and $11,000 for workers at GM.

A document seen by Reuters shows the EU's focus is on data related to local search services, online advertising, online ad targeting services, login services, web browsers and others.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has handed down fines totalling more than 8 billion euros to Google in the last two years and ordered it to change its business practices.
Google has said it uses data to better its services and that users can manage, delete and transfer their data at any time.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>","Black Friday shoppers stay away from stores, make $7 billion-plus splurge online","By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. shoppers made more purchases online on Black Friday than in the mall - hurting traffic and sales at brick-and-mortar stores, according to data that offered a glimpse into what is still one of the busiest shopping days of the year.
For the first time in several years, however, store traffic on Thanksgiving evening grew - indicating a shift in when consumers are leaving their homes to shop. It is also a sign of how Thursday evening store openings have continued to hurt what has traditionally been a day that kicked off the U.S. holiday season.
The importance on the shopping calendar of Black Friday, or the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday, has waned in recent years. This is due to the choice by many retailers to open their stores on Thursday evening, as well as to early holiday promotions and year-round discounts. However, it is increasingly turning into a day when shoppers do not necessarily flock to stores but spend heavily online.
Also, for most retail chains, Black Friday store traffic and sales data is not necessarily grim as consumers continue to spend, consultants said. Winning the transaction, whether online or in-store, has now become more important for retailers than where it occurs.
Top brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and  Best Buy  (N:BBY) have continued to spend billions of dollars trying to expand their e-commerce operations to capture that growing online revenue.
Also, spending patterns over the weekend are not as indicative of the entire holiday shopping season as they were a few years ago, with purchases spread over November and December.
Online sales rose more than 19.6%, reaching $7.4 billion on Black Friday, slightly shy of estimates of $7.6 billion, according to data from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics, which tracks transactions at 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers. On Thanksgiving, it estimated sales grew 14.5% to $4.2 billion.
Numbers from ShopperTrak, which is part of retail data firm Sensormatic Solutions, showed that visits to stores fell a combined 3% during Thanksgiving and Black Friday compared with the same days in 2018.
Shopper traffic on Thanksgiving evening increased by 2.3%year-over-year but was dragged down by Black Friday, which fell 6.2% from a year ago.
Brian Field, senior director of global retail consulting for ShopperTrak, said the traditional pattern of shoppers visiting stores has been disrupted not only by online shopping but by offerings like ""buy online and pick up in store,"" a growing category, which is not included in store traffic count on Black Friday.
""What all of this really boils down to is the customer journey has changed, now it can start anywhere online, in-store and end anywhere ... and it is about making sure the customer makes the purchase and stays loyal to the brands more than where it happens,"" he said.
Preliminary data from analytics firm RetailNext showed net sales at brick-and-mortar stores on Black Friday fell 1.6%, which the firm said is slower than in previous years. No data was yet available for actual spending in stores.
The National Retail Federation had forecast U.S. holiday retail sales over the two months in 2019 will increase between 3.8% and 4.2% from a year ago, for a total of $727.9 billion to $730.7 billion. That compares with an average annual increase of 3.7% over the past five years."
664,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2019 04:44AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here are three things that flew under the radar this week

1. Debate Breaks out on Wall Street as VIX Hits Lows
For anyone looking to gauge how deep fear runs in markets, look no further than the VIX index or the “fear gauge.” In the current good times of record high equity markets, the fear gauge plummeted to more-than-one-year lows earlier this week, prompting debate on whether investors lack vigilance.
“The developments over the past weeks might support the usual narrative that investors are being complacent, and the idea that we could be in for another equity selloff,” said Hubert de Barochez, markets economist at Capital Economics, in a research note.

The CBOE Volatility Index closed at 11.54 on Tuesday. Its lowest level since Aug. 9, 2018.

The ongoing plunge in the VIX has recently stirred up debate on the next big move in markets.
Some say the fear gauge is likely to continue its decline and pave the way to yet more record highs in equities. But others see eerily similarities to a trend that unfolded last year that led to a major selloff.

At the end of September last year, stocks were flirting with highs. The VIX was toying with lows. And the good cheer on Wall Street was palpable.

But the VIX bottomed soon after. A jolt in volatility pierced through markets, and stocks suffered their biggest correction since the Financial Crisis.
With expectations growing that volatility may be on the cusp of getting a second lease of life, Evercore ISI strategist Dennis DeBusschere suggested it may be time for investors to seek shelter.
“Since the S&P is making new all-time highs, now is an opportune time to hedge,” DeBusschere said.
But some disagree.

Greg Boutle, U.S. head of equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas, told Bloomberg in an interview this week that he sees further signs of upside in the market as traders continue to bet on a further decline in VIX.

""We've seen the VIX break down on the downside through the 12 level and in terms of positioning, the number of people shorting the VIX is at a record, so the market is positioning for a risk-on move,"" Boutle said.
2. Competition Limits Price Hikes to Combat Tariffs
One question on the minds of many investors is how, with the current U.S. economic expansion, has inflation remained very tame.

And the regional reports in the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book show that businesses are finding themselves in an increasingly tricky situation on prices and rising input costs, especially on the retail side.
“Despite the reported softness in prices charged to consumers, firms' input costs continued to increase at a moderate rate,” the St. Louis Fed reported. “On net, 32% of business contacts reported higher nonlabor costs, the same share as in the previous quarter. Business contacts in retail and manufacturing reported facing increased price pressures due to tariffs.”
In the Atlanta Fed region “firms most affected by tariffs indicated they were more likely to pass along cost increases to customer.”
But whether companies were actually able to boost prices varied.
“On the consumer side, a clothing retailer reduced the use of price discounting to offset higher costs resulting from tariffs,” the Cleveland Fed said. “By contrast, a food retailer said that while tariffs had increased costs, the company ‘cannot raise prices on a whim’ because of fierce competition.”
Retail prices increased “modestly” in the Chicago Fed region.
“One contact said that food, home goods, and apparel retailers were struggling to pass on higher costs; in contrast, another contact noted that retailers continued to raise prices to reflect higher potential and realized tariffs,” it said.
On perk for tourist in New York for the Thanksgiving festivities – Broadway show ticket prices had declined modestly.
3. Silver Price Estimates Reined In

Silver prices will see a solid rise next year, but the gains won’t be as strong as originally thought, according to J.P. Morgan.

The investment bank sees a 10% year-over-year rise in silver for 2020, but that’s about 15% lower than its previous estimates as it become more optimistic on the global economy.

“On a quarterly basis, we now see silver prices peaking in 2Q20 at a quarterly average of around ($18.70)/oz before selling off lower towards a 4Q20 average around $17.1/oz, as the U.S. economy likely finds more solid footing later in the year,” J.P. Morgan said in its quarterly metals report, released this week.

Looking at supply and demand fundamentals, with J.P. Morgan’s “more constructive economic view for 2020,” it now sees industrial fabrication rising 1.5% year over year.
But “(e)ven with this relatively more optimistic industrial use view, we still see total fabrication demand largely remaining flat as the jewelry, silverware and photography segments all come under pressure next year,” it said.
“(W)e continue to think silver’s appeal as an alternative precious metal to gold will still be the major price driver, likely boosting silver prices in 1H20 before the precious fervor eases somewhat in 2H20,” J.P. Morgan added."

MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's  Yes Bank  Ltd (NS:YESB) aims to raise up to $2 billion in a massive issue of new shares to institutional investors and wealth managers as it soaks up the impact of bad loans in the country's crisis-hit shadow banking and real estate sectors.
The plan, announced late on Friday, would see the country's fifth-largest private sector bank by assets seek to sell new stock worth close to its existing market capitalization of $2.4 billion at the close of trading on Friday.
As a major part of the plan, Yes Bank said it is in talks on a deal to sell shares worth $1.2 billion to Canadian billionaire Erwin Singh Braich and Hong Kong-based SPGP Holdings, which he backs. The bank said it expected those talks to close shortly.
SPGP Holdings did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shares of the Mumbai-based Yes Bank closed 2.5% lower ahead of the announcement on Friday. Its stock has risen about 20% since it said late in October it got a binding offer to buy shares of $1.2 billion from an unidentified global investor.
In its announcement, Yes Bank said other investors who have committed to buying shares include Discovery Capital, Aditya Birla Family Office from India and Citax Holdings Ltd & Citax Investment Group.
Discovery did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Aditya Birla Family Office and Citax weren't immediately reachable.
It also said a leading U.S. fund house would subscribe, saying the name of the investor would be disclosed early next week.
Yes Bank's board of directors will meet on Dec. 10 to ""finalize and approve the details of the preferential allotment and convene an extraordinary general meeting subsequently, to obtain the approval of the shareholders,"" it said.
The preferential allotment will also be subject to regulatory clearance. The approval of the Reserve Bank of India is needed to buy a stake of more than 5% in domestic banks.
Banking analysts say most of the funds raised by Yes Bank will be used to provide for bad loans. The lender's gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans - a measure of asset quality - spiked to 7.39% in last quarter."

Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment.
Apollo Global Management Inc agreed on Wednesday to pay $145 per share for Tech Data, sweetening its original $130 per share bid after a public company made a better offer.
Citing Buffett, CNBC said that company was Berkshire, which offered $140 per share last week, and did not intend to go higher.
In a regulatory filing on Friday, Tech Data confirmed that on Nov. 24 it had accepted a takeover by an unnamed public company, only to later accept the higher Apollo bid.
Buffett, who is Berkshire's chairman and chief executive, has struggled to invest Berkshire's cash because companies and stocks look pricey, and private equity firms have increased competition for acquisitions.
Buffett does not engage in bidding wars for whole companies, preferring to make a single offer that a target can accept or reject, though he may try to outbid other suitors.
Apollo's original offer for Tech Data had a go-shop provision.
Buffett agreed to make a bid after Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) told him on Nov. 19 that Tech Data was for sale, sent Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel to meet with the company's management, and made a formal offer with other contractual changes that would have benefited Tech Data, CNBC said.
Tech Data approved Berkshire's offer on Nov. 24, CNBC said, but accepted Apollo's higher bid three days later."

(Reuters) - The cost of cars equipped with ultra-fast 5G wireless technology is likely to go up if microchip supplier Qualcomm Inc's (O:QCOM) patent licensing practices fail to change, a trade group representing major automakers and two leading automotive suppliers said in court filings on Friday.
Qualcomm is seeking to overturn a sweeping antitrust decision requiring it to renegotiate its licensing agreements at reasonable prices. Appeal proceedings in the case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission are expected to begin in January, but Qualcomm's opponents are weighing in early to argue that the anti-trust decision should be allowed to stand.
Trade groups representing the U.S. units of BMW (DE:BMWG),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), General Motors Co (N:GM) and Toyota Motor Co (T:7203), among others, made various claims about adverse effects of Qualcomm's licensing practices in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Also filing was a unit of German supplier  Continental AG  (DE:CONG) and Japan-based Denso Corp (T:6902), both makers of ""infotainment"" and location-tracking car technology.
Qualcomm declined to comment.
Qualcomm has denied the FTC's anti-trust accusations and the court agreed to pause the decision after some government officials asked it to do so.
Continental said it gave up working with Qualcomm's chip rivals  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and MediaTek Inc (TW:2454) because the licensing practices created too many legal risks. Continental and Denso said Qualcomm and other patent holders were refusing to license their technology to chipmakers that charge only a few dollars per chip, seeking instead to sign licenses only with carmakers whose vehicles cost tens of thousands of dollars and are ""less motivated to fight for every dollar"" in license fees.
""The resulting inefficiency is ultimately borne by consumers in the form of higher prices,"" the auto suppliers wrote in their complaint.
The trade groups representing automakers argued in a court filing that Qualcomm should negotiate directly with the suppliers, to avoid ""unnecessary, costly, and inefficient licensing negotiations"" with the carmakers themselves.
""The suppliers that incorporate chips into their products likely are ready to negotiate with Qualcomm,"" the groups wrote.

Rival chipmakers also weighed in against Qualcomm on Friday with  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) saying it sold its smartphone modem chip business to Apple Inc (O:AAPL) at ""a multi-billion dollar loss"" after Qualcomm forced it out of the market with what it described as illegal licensing practices.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nokia (HE:NOKIA) said on Friday it was working to end a row with Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and other firms which have complained to the EU antitrust regulators about the level of fees charged for technology patents from the Finnish company.
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters the Finnish telecoms equipment maker had submitted a proposal for resolving the patent licensing fee row, but did not give details.
The offer could pre-empt any move by the European Commission to open an investigation and remove the threat of fines if the firm was found to be abusing its position. One source said the commission has indicated in October it could launch a probe.
Tech companies and the car industry have been at loggerheads over royalties paid on technologies used in navigation systems, vehicle-to-vehicle communication and self-driving cars, areas increasingly in focus with the development of electric vehicles.
Daimler, German electronics firm Bury Technologies, German car parts maker Continental (DE:CONG), France's  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and chipmaker  Gemalto  (AS:GTO), now part of  Thales  (PA:TCFP), have complained to the Commission about the fees demanded by Nokia for patents that are essential to car communications.
""Nokia continues to work toward constructive ways to resolve commercial disputes related to licensing of our standardized cellular technologies,"" Nokia said in a statement, without mentioning any specific proposal to end the row.
""Our goal is for those technologies to be widely adopted across many different industries, to benefit consumers and customers around the world,"" it said in an email to Reuters.
Daimler declined to comment specifically on Nokia's proposal but a spokeswoman said: ""We want clarification on how essential patents for telecommunications standards are to be licensed in the automotive industry. Nokia so far refused to comprehensively and directly license our suppliers.""
""Fair and non-discriminatory access to these standards for all users of the essential patents for telecommunications standards is a key prerequisite for the development of new products and services for connected driving,"" she said.
The Commission declined to comment."
669,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 02:02PM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Slips on China Fears, Holiday Lethargy","Investing.com – Stocks fell Friday on a holiday-shortened trading day ostensibly because of new worries about the long-awaited phase one U.S.-China trade deal.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials fell 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.46%. The Nasdaq 100 dropped about 0.5%.
U.S. markets were closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
The China issue was that President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and the Beijing was unhappy about it and threatened unspecified retaliation. The noise pressured stocks and sent gold up $11.90 in New York to $1,472.70 an ounce.
Wall Street reacted unhappily, along with markets around much of the world. But the China stress didn't set off a lot of panic. Rather, the mood seemed to be more of the same in a long negotiation, with regular eruptions of anger from both sides, and that a phase one trade deal is still coming.
The larger issue was an absence of demand to buy stocks because many investors are comfortable with the stock market's current state. 
In a holiday-shortened week, the S&P 500 managed to add nearly 1%. The Dow rose 0.6%, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.71%.
Stocks enjoyed their best month November since June. The S&P 500 finished 3.4% higher for the month, with the Dow up 3.72% and the Nasdaq up 4.5%.
For the year, the S&P 500 is up 25.3%, with the Dow up 20.3% and the Nasdaq up 30.6%.
If stocks are flat in December, the market will have its best gains since 2013. 
But the euphoria must be tempered by the 2018 fourth-quarter slump, when the S&P 500 fell 14%, the Dow dropped 11.8% and the Nasdaq tumbled 17.5%. 
On the Friday after Thanksgiving in 2018, the fourth-quarter market swoon was erupting in a big way, leading to a decline of 9% for the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq in December 2018
Early notes this year suggested the big Black Friday holiday shopping spree was going well, if not gangbusters. But some noted that there were pre-holiday sales appearing regularly across the country.
All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were lower on the day.
Financial stocks were least affected by the selling. But energy stocks were the weak link as oil prices moved lower. The selling was due in part because of worries next week's OPEC meeting won't produce meaningful action to reduce output among OPEC members. In addition, the United States proved a net exporter of crude oil for the first time since records were kept.
  IBM   (NYSE:IBM) was the top Dow stock. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) was up slightly. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit a 52-week high but then fell back.
Interest rates were higher as the United States 10-Year Treasury yield bumped up to 1.778% from Wednesday's 1.767%.
West Texas Intermediate crude was off more than 5% to $55.17 a barrel. The February contract for Brent t crude, the global benchmark, was down 3.8% to $60.78 a barrel.
Electric-utility giant NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG), personal-computer company HP (NYSE:HPQ), fertilizer maker CF Industries (NYSE:CF) and information tech company DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC) were the top performers among S&P 500 stocks. 
Oil-and-gas companies Apache (NYSE:APA), TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI),   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN) and retailer Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) were the weakest S&P 500 performers. "
670,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 01:58PM ET</span>",Musk's defamation trial over 'pedo guy' tweet is narrowed,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - The British cave explorer who sued Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Elon Musk for branding him ""pedo guy"" in a tweet has narrowed his defamation case against the electric car maker's chief executive, and is no longer seeking damages for an emailed suggestion he might be a child rapist.
Vernon Unsworth, who has denied the allegations, chose to pursue liability and damages claims at a scheduled Dec. 3 negligence trial only for Musk's tweets allegedly calling him a pedophile, U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson said in a Wednesday order.
The judge also decided not to split up the trial to assess liability and punitive damages separately because evidence of Musk's ""state of mind"" would be similar on both issues, and Musk refused to concede he did not use reasonable care in criticizing Unsworth.
Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, declined to comment on Friday. Unsworth's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Wilson issued his order after hearings this week in Los Angeles. Musk is expected to testify at trial.
The case arose after Unsworth and his diving team gained international renown in July 2018 by rescuing 12 boys and their soccer coach from a Thailand cave.
Unsworth criticized Musk's offering a mini-submarine from his SpaceX rocket company to help with the rescue, telling CNN it was a ""PR stunt"" and that Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurts.""
But he said that did not justify Musk's July 15, 2018 tweets that he ""never saw this British expat guy,"" followed by ""Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it"" and, in an alleged clarification, ""Bet ya a signed dollar it's true.""
Wilson said Unsworth chose not to pursue damages claims over later emails by Musk to BuzzFeed News, including that a reporter ""stop defending child rapists.""
The judge said Unsworth can use those emails to show Musk's state of mind behind the July 15 tweets. Musk has apologized for the ""pedo guy"" comment.
To win, Unsworth must show the tweets were false, Musk did not use reasonable care to determine their truth, and people reasonably understood them to mean Unsworth was a pedophile.
Wilson said he will admit evidence suggesting that Musk might have leaked damaging information about Unsworth to the press, and Unsworth might have sued to capitalize on his fame.
Evidence of Musk's $20 million civil settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 after he tweeted that Tesla had ""funding secured"" to go private was excluded because it might confuse jurors."
671,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 01:53PM ET</span>","Wall Street slips as U.S.-China tensions weigh, investors watch retail","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes ended Friday's shorter session lower as U.S.-China discord over Hong Kong fueled investor anxiety about trade talks and retail stocks dipped as in-store Black Friday sales appeared to draw smaller crowds.
China on Thursday threatened to retaliate against a U.S. law backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong with potential measures including barring drafters of the legislation from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, the editor of China's state-backed Global Times tabloid said in a tweet.
And on Friday a Reuters report cited two sources saying the U.S. government may expand its power to stop more foreign shipments of products with U.S. technology to China's Huawei, due to frustration that a blacklisting failed to end supplies to the world's largest telecoms equipment maker.
While the S&P closed above its session low, selling intensified in the last hour of trading after the report on Huawei. 
All three of Wall Street's major indexes had registered record highs earlier in the week when hopes were higher for an imminent ""phase one"" U.S.-China trade deal. The trade-sensitive Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) fell 1.1%. 
For the month preliminary Refinitiv data showed that the S&P rose 3.4% while the Dow gained 3.7% and Nasdaq climbed 4.5%. It was the the biggest monthly gain for all three major indexes since June. 
The U.S.-China news gave ""a little bit of a weaker tone"" to Friday's market, Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio manager and strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions in Boston. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 112.59 points, or 0.4%, to 28,051.41, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 12.65 points, or 0.40%, to 3,140.98 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 39.70 points, or 0.46%, to 8,665.47.
While many traders took the day off after Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, Janasiewicz said others were likely on the sidelines as they waited for economic data including the jobs report due out next week and any retailer comments about initial numbers for the year-end holiday shopping season. 
""We've got a good slate of data coming next week that'll give us a better indication where we are in the cycle and people are going to want to know how did today's retail sales go,"" he said.
Spot check reports on retailers around the country showed fewer people than in past years lining up outside stores at the start of Black Friday, suggesting that online buying may have taken the shine off America's biggest shopping day.
""Looking at foot traffic volume is not quite as telling any more. It's going to be online shopping as well. That's going to be the bigger one,"" said Janasiewicz.
""Are people getting up, getting dressed and going out and shopping physically or are they just getting dressed, moving to the couch and turning on their computer and ordering online."" 
The S&P 500 retail sector <.SPXRT> fell 0.8%, with Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) dropping 2.7% and Gap (N:GPS) falling 1.8%. Top retailer Walmart Inc (N:WMT) rose 0.3% while Costco (O:COST) fell 0.3% and electronics retailer  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) also dipped.
Shares of  Tech Data Corp  (O:TECD) jumped 12.3% as private equity firm Apollo Global Management (N:APO) raised its bid for the U.S. information technology equipment distributor to about $5.14 billion.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 75 new highs and 28 new lows. 

Trading volume was light in the truncated session with 3.55 billion shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 6.86 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

672,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>",Dennis Gartman Calls Time on Newsletter After More Than 30 Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Dennis Gartman plans to halt publication of “The Gartman Letter” after more than three decades of producing his daily investor report.
“There comes a time when retirement calls,” Gartman wrote in Friday’s edition of the newsletter. “The simple sums of information available to everyone have made our efforts difficult and yet easier at the same time. Add to this the increased tax and regulation requirements and we’ve chosen to stop doing business as we have in the past.”
Gartman said he won’t give up TV, radio or print interviews and that a bi-weekly bulletin and podcasts are among the options being considered “to make certain that we are not immediately forgotten.”
Gartman got his start in the early 1970s as an economist at Cotton Inc. before he moved on to roles at NCNB National Bank in Charlotte, North Carolina, and A.G. Becker & Co. in Chicago, according to a bio on the CNBC website. He moved to Virginia in the early 1980s where he ran the futures brokerage operation for Sovran Bank before starting his eponymous newsletter in 1987.
“The Gartman Letter” addressed economic, political and technical trends. Its subscribers include hedge funds, banks, brokerage firms and mutual funds, among others.
“Dennis cut his teeth in the commodity markets. While I was learning the business back in the ‘90s, he was always a fantastic read to understand what was going on outside the equity markets,” said Dave Lutz, a managing director and head of ETF trading at JonesTrading in Annapolis, Maryland. “His letter was always insightful, full of insider knowledge.”
Like everyone making predictions about markets, Gartman made calls that didn’t always pan out, and he has taken more than his share of social media lumps for wrong-way forecasts. In February 2018, he lamented putting the volatile stock Riot Blockchain Inc. into his retirement account -- just a couple months after saying on CNBC that Bitcoin was nonsense and he wouldn’t buy or sell any. Emails and calls to Gartman went unanswered Friday.
On the other hand, his prediction in July 2018 that the then-struggling Dow Jones Industrial Average was merely in a consolidation phase on the way to 30,000 amid an ongoing bull market doesn’t look so bad, with the gauge currently above 28,000."

675,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 12:56PM ET</span>",That frenzied Black Friday crush? Not this year,"By Melissa Fares and Nandita Bose
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The frenzy associated with Black Friday shopping was missing this year as U.S. retailers offered earlier discounts and more consumers shopped online, though spot checks around the country showed traffic picked up after a sluggish morning.
“It’s slow now because we had a big, big rush last night,” said  Target  electronics salesman Evan Houser, 22, in Chicago.
Black Friday remains important for holiday shopping but its relevance is fading amid early promotions, with six fewer sales days between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
That has pulled spending forward. More than half of consumers polled by the National Retail Federation (NRF) in the first week of November had begun making purchases.
""We've seen many merchants start their promotions pretty much right after the trick-or-treaters have gone to bed,"" said Lauren Bitar, head of retail consulting at analytics firm RetailNext.
Visits to retailers showed more shoppers after a sluggish start Friday - but frantic crowds were nowhere to be seen.
""We tend to have more deals in-store so people come in rather than go online ... the only problem today is we didn’t expect how slow it would be,"" said Mariah Berry, 22, a trainee supervisor at a Chicago Uniqlo.
While store traffic still remains an important indicator, a lot of Black Friday shopping now happens online. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics, which measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 U.S. online retailers, estimates $7.5 billion in online sales for Black Friday, up 20.5% year-over-year.
U.S. online sales on Thanksgiving Day jumped 17% to $4.1 billion, according to Salesforce. Global online revenue rose ever faster.
Walmart Inc (N:WMT), Target Corp (N:TGT), Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) and  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) have bulked up their online presence, deliveries and in-store pickups.
Some shoppers worried that tariffs on Chinese imports would make holiday shopping more expensive, though many large retailers have not raised prices to protect margins.
""There were definitely some concerns about prices due to what we see in the news about the trade war, but I haven't seen the impact yet,"" said Jay Smith, 28, who was shopping for clothes and toys at a Macy's (N:M) in Pentagon City, Virginia.
To keep foot traffic flowing, retailers at Hudson Yards in New York are offering ""doorbuster"" deals, said Marie Driscoll, managing director of luxury and fashion at Coresight Research. At Tapestry's (N:TPR)  Coach , a $300 handbag was $99 until noon.
Other shoppers were skeptical about how good the deals really are.
""I will come to the mall, look at prices and go back and check them online,"" said Dick Doyle, 76, who was at a Modell's Sporting Goods in Virginia, while his wife was next door at Nordstrom Rack (N:JWN)."
676,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 12:56PM ET</span>",PG&E says its distribution lines caused no deadly fires in 2019,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp (N:PCG) has determined there were no lives or structures lost in 2019 wildfires that may have been caused by its distribution lines, according to a Friday court filing.
The company also said it found 218 instances of damage from wind or falling vegetation that could have caused wildfires if it had not taken the controversial step of shutting power to millions of customers during high winds in late October.
The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January to deal with $30 billion of liability from wildfires linked to its equipment in 2017 and 2018. 
On Wednesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali ruled PG&E is subject to the legal doctrine of inverse condemnation, which holds the company strictly liable for fires tied to its equipment, even if the utility was not negligent.
The ruling was a victory for wildfire victims who are pursuing PG&E for compensation, and the company's stock fell around 5% in early Friday trading, before recovering most losses. 
To try to prevent fires, PG&E has been using the mass blackouts during high winds and low humidity. Six of the 10 most destructive wildfires in California history have been caused by electrical equipment or power lines.
The company also said in Friday's filing with the U.S. District Court in San Francisco that a broken PG&E cable reported in the area of Northern California's massive Kincade Fire last month was last inspected on July 19. 
Fire officials in California have not determined the cause of the Kincade Fire, which raced through Sonoma County wine country, charring more than 75,000 acres (30,351 hectares), destroying hundreds of structures and forcing thousands to flee.
PG&E was responding on Friday to questions from Judge William Alsup about late October fires to determine if the company has complied with terms of its probation imposed after a felony conviction over a 2010 pipeline explosion.
Alsup has ordered the company to adopt wildfire safety measures and to appoint a board of directors committee to be responsible for implementing those steps. He barred the company from issuing dividends until it is in compliance.
The company has been accused of cutting corners on maintenance, including on equipment blamed for last year's Camp Fire, the most expensive in California history, which killed more than 80 people and destroyed the town of Paradise.

PG&E has said it strongly disagrees with allegations it failed to perform necessary upgrades.

The U.S. government is considering measures to stop foreign companies from supplying equipment to Huawei – an important customer for a number of U.S. semiconductor companies – amid concerns the current blacklisting has failed to cut off supplies to the Chinese telecom giant, Reuters reported, citing two sources.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was down nearly 1%, with Huawei-sensitive companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) down about 0.7% and 1.4% respectively.
The news offset some of the optimism seen last week, when the Trump Administration agreed to grant some reprieves to Huawei, extending a temporary general license for 90 days. The temporary general license, granted in September, lifted the ban on U.S. companies from selling or transferring technology to Huawei.
Semis started the day on the back foot after sentiment on U.S. and China trade relations soured as Beijing vowed to retaliate against the U.S. after President Donald Trump signed two bills into law in support of Hong Kong protesters."

MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - An Italian judge will decide on Vivendi's (PA:VIV) request to block Mediaset's (MI:MS) pan-European television project after the two groups failed to settle their long-running dispute, a legal source said on Friday.
The case has become a tussle between billionaires over the future of European TV as competition grows from streaming services from the likes of Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN).
 Mediaset  is backed by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi while its 29% shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) is led by Vincent Bollore.
The two groups, locked in a whole series of legal arguments, have clashed over the Italian group's plans to create a pan-European TV champion through Dutch-based holding MediaForEurope (MFE).
Mediaset aims to use the MFE platform to build TV alliances in Europe to help it compete with streaming services and has built a 15% stake in Germany's ProSiebenSat.1 (DE:PSMGn).
Vivendi, which has its owns plans to create a southern European media force, says governance plans at MFE would give Berlusconi too much power and hurt minority shareholders.
A deal between the two sides would free Mediaset's hand to press ahead with merging its Italian and Spanish units, folding them into the Dutch holding.
POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT
A Milan judge earlier this month gave the companies until Nov. 29 to settle their disagreements over MFE after earlier attempts to reach an accord failed.
However, overnight talks did not produce a breakthrough and the two sides faced off in court. The judge must now set a date for a new hearing to discuss Vivendi's request to suspend the MFE operation.
""Despite strenuous efforts, attempts at conciliation promoted by the Court of Milan...have failed,"" Mediaset said in a statement. Vivendi declined to comment.
The two sides have been holding talks to try to find a way to settle not just the MFE case but all their outstanding issues.
According to sources, a deal being worked on between the two could see Vivendi sell around two thirds of its stake in Mediaset to MFE but differences over price and other terms such as a standstill agreement that would have prevented Vivendi from buying back MFE shares have held things up.
Negotiations could resume but the talks have been hampered by a deep mistrust between the two sides.
Mediaset and Vivendi, owner of pay TV group Canal+ and Universal Music Group, have been embroiled in a protracted dispute since a failed pay TV deal in 2016.
Vivendi is also the top shareholder in Italian phone incumbent  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT)."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - China's new ambassador to Canada visited a senior Huawei Technologies Co Ltd official who is fighting extradition to the United States and urged Ottawa to release her, the embassy said on Friday.
Relations between Canada and China turned icy a year ago, after Vancouver police detained Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. arrest warrant. She is currently out on bail and awaiting court hearings due to start next year.
Ambassador Cong Peiwu, who took up his post earlier this month, on Thursday extended his warm regards to Meng and said Beijing ""will continue to urge the Canadian side to correct its mistake"" and release her immediately, the embassy said in a statement.
""The great motherland and nearly 1.4 billion Chinese people are your staunchest supporters. We expect you to go back to China safe and sound at an early date,"" it quoted Cong as telling Meng.
Shortly after Meng's arrest, China picked up two Canadian citizens who now face state security charges. It also blocked imports of Canadian canola seed.

The office of Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was not immediately available for comment. Champagne said last week he had pressed his Chinese counterpart on the case of the two detainees.

681,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 12:16PM ET</span>",South African Airways shunned by insurers as financial doubts grow,"By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Two big travel insurance companies in South Africa have stopped covering tickets issued by South African Airways (SAA) against insolvency as doubts grow about whether the struggling state-owned airline can survive.
While the move is unlikely to push SAA into liquidation by itself, it will hurt ticket sales and exacerbate a cash crunch that left the airline unable to pay salaries on time this month, analysts said.
SAA has not made a profit since 2011 and has been struggling with an unprofitable network, inefficient planes and a bloated workforce, despite bailouts of more than 20 billion rand ($1.4 billion) over the past three years.
Its financial position worsened dramatically after Nov. 15, when two of its largest unions began an eight-day strike over pay that forced SAA to cancel hundreds of flights.
Banks want additional guarantees from the state before they lend SAA more money but Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has refused, leaving the airline's finances on a knife edge.
Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan still wants to save SAA, which says it needs to more than 2 billion rand ($136 million) quickly to stay afloat.
President Cyril Ramaphosa has stayed out of the tussle so far but the longer Mboweni refuses to sign off on guarantees, the more likely it is that SAA will shut down - an outcome an SAA board member said last week was a possibility.
Santam's (J:SNTJ) Travel Insurance Consultants (TIC) said this week it had stopped its travel supplier insolvency benefit for SAA flights then Australian agency  Flight Centre  Travel Group (AX:FLT) said it would stop selling SAA tickets.
The company that administers Hollard Travel Insurance told Reuters on Friday it had also excluded SAA from its travel supplier insolvency coverage, citing the airline's finances.
Bryte Insurance's head of travel Anrieth Symon said on Friday it had reversed its position on SAA and would cover its flights against insolvency.
SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali declined to comment when called by Reuters on Friday and did not respond to emailed questions.
Neither Mboweni's spokeswoman nor Gordhan's spokesman answered their phones when called by Reuters.
'ALL OPTIONS'
SAA said in a memo to staff on Friday seen by Reuters that its board and executives were in intense discussions with the government and that the airline's leaders were exploring ""all options regarding SAA's future"".
Guy Leitch, an aviation analyst who edits the SA Flyer magazine, said the decisions by the insurers and Flight Centre to drop the airline were hugely significant.
""No one managing SAA, from Minister Gordhan downwards, anticipated the flight of confidence that the strike would have,"" Leitch said.
In a letter to clients dated Nov. 28, Flight Centre said its preferred travel insurance provider was no longer willing to cover SAA due to doubts about its long-term viability.
TIC said its reinsurers had instructed it to exclude SAA from its insolvency coverage. It did not disclose the names of its reinsurers.
Ramaphosa's government has taken a harder line on SAA recently, saying repeated bailouts must come to an end. He is trying to preserve the country's last investment-grade credit rating and revive growth in Africa's second-biggest economy.
South Africa's sovereign debt is rated ""junk"" by S&P Global and Fitch Ratings but Moody's still ranks it as investment grade, helping to prevent a spike in borrowing costs typically sparked by a downgrade from all three agencies.
Leitch said SAA's liabilities exceeded its assets by a huge amount and the recent loss of confidence in the airline would force the government to decide whether to rescue it.
""This is a high-stakes game."""
682,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 12:13PM ET</span>","IPhones, Kindles at Top of Shoppers’ Lists: Black Friday Update","(Bloomberg) -- From toy stores to electronics outlets, it’s the moment retailers have been preparing for all year. And so far, it’s off with a bang.
As Black Friday kicks off the traditional holiday shopping season, there’s a lot on the line. For a department store like Macy’s Inc. or Kohl’s Corp., a third or more of annual revenue is captured in the fourth quarter.
Early November results bode well: Comparable-store retail sales gained 1.3% in the first two weeks of the month, according to Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), a major U.S. processor of credit-card transactions. Cooler weather likely spurred apparel growth for warmer, seasonal clothing, particularly at teen and family retailers, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal.
Now the big money comes out. After weeks of slow and steady buying, consumers could come out in droves this weekend -- giving investors a sneak peek at the likely winners and losers of the holiday shopping season. Here’s a look at the latest information available, with all time stamps reflecting the U.S. East Coast:
Salesforce Sees $7.4 Billion of Black Friday Online Sales (10:15 a.m.)
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), a digital services provider, projected e-commerce spending reaching $7.4 billion in the U.S. on Black Friday -- 16% higher than a year earlier.
Gadgets were getting the most attention, according to Salesforce, with the most talked-about products on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) being the Nintendo Switch, iPhone 11, iPad, Kindle and Samsung (KS:005930) Galaxy S10. The complex nature of gadgets lends themselves to online discussion, since shoppers take to social media to research and ask questions about them.
“It speaks to the fact that we’re amidst this digital transformation that’s happening for both the consumers and the retailers,” Rob Garf, vice president of industry strategy and insights at Salesforce, said in an interview.
Amazon, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Best Buy  were the most mentioned retailers, according to Salesforce data. Many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have flagged that the shorter holiday season, with Thanksgiving at the very end of November this year, could impact shopper behavior -- but there is some upside for some companies with this condensed calendar.
Garf predicted the “big winners” of the holiday season will be the retailers that offer in-store pickup for online orders. The right use of this option “extends the holiday shopping window by nearly a week,” he said.
Companies including Walmart and  Target  have invested heavily to improve their capabilities in this area in recent years.
Millennial, Gen Z Shoppers Head to the Malls Early (9:30 a.m.)
Young Americans may have a reputation for being glued to their phones, but they were the ones swarming stores -- in person -- when the doors opened this morning at King of Prussia mall near Philadelphia. At the shopping center, which houses more than 400 stores, Gen Z and young millennial shoppers started gathering at a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) at 5:30 a.m. to plot their mall paths before many of the stores opened half an hour later, according to Bill Park, a partner at Deloitte on the ground doing store checks.
Park said chains that catered to the younger generations were packed from the start, with some teen and college-aged shoppers even running through the doors in homage to the crazy Black Friday days of a decade prior. Teen-focused stores like Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN), Lululemon and American Eagle pulsed with energy, and a line of young men wrapped outside Champs Sports as buyers tried to get their hands on Kanye West’s newest Yeezy kicks.
The same dynamic wasn’t palpable at anchor stores including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Lord & Taylor and Macy’s, Park said. “I would say that demographic tends to be a bit older. I’m not seeing the foot traffic in those stores as heavy as some of the specialty retailers that cater to the younger folks,” he said.
Not all malls saw the same activity. At Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey, the parking lot was more than half empty as of 9:30 a.m., even though it also opened at 6 a.m.
Online Surge Brings in Dollars But Also Stresses Systems (8:00 a.m.)
Digital shoppers hoping retailers learned their lessons after last year and beefed up their online systems to avoid another holiday of glitches and crashes may find themselves sorely disappointed in the days ahead.
Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST)., which saw its website crash on Thursday, announced on Friday said it was extending all of its Thanksgiving Day-only promotions for an extra day to make up for the error. Shoppers had taken to Twitter to complain about the Costco outage, plus similar delays on other retailers’ sites, including Nordstrom Rack. The discount arm of  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN). said on Thanksgiving that it was working to fix the issue.
Representatives at Issaquah, Washington-based Costco and Seattle-based Nordstrom couldn’t be reached for comment early on Black Friday. As of 8 a.m. in New York, Costco’s website warned that it was still experiencing longer than normal response times.
At Swedish Malls, DJ Creates Calming Playlists (6:15 a.m.)
In Sweden, retailers concerned about shoppers’ stress levels while hunting for Black Friday deals have turned to a disc jockey to help compile calming music to play in stores. Auntie Flo, whose real name is Brian d’Souza, has worked with Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, one of the world’s largest shopping mall developers, to provide playlists for all Westfield shopping centers across Sweden. Last year he also curated Black Friday playlists for Selfridges, the U.K. department store.
D’Souza, who hails from Glasgow, Scotland, focuses on using a form of sound therapy called binaural beats, where different pure-tone sounds are combined to create a relaxing, calming effect. That may not be the best strategy on Black Friday, according to Phil Dorrell from the consultancy group Retail Remedy.
“Retailers want shoppers to celebrate, think of the good times coming with Christmas and get in the party mood,” Dorrell said. “It’s not about trying to calm them down.”
Target Staff Get Fired Up With Karaoke (4:30 a.m.)
At the Target store in Elmhurst, New York, manager Kelly McGarrity and her employees belted out karaoke to get fired up before the doors opened at 5 p.m. Thanksgiving Day. Crowds were on par with past years, she said, and early-bird shoppers snapped up deals on 65-inch 4K televisions, pressure cookers and merchandise from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.’s Frozen movie sequel.
Buying online and picking up in the store was a popular option as well, and 106 staffers were on hand to pack and prep online orders, up from 70 last year. Those waiting in line for their web orders grabbed inexpensive impulse items as well, McGarrity said. Christmas trees were a hot item online, with orders for more than 100 coming in on Thursday alone.
“Seasonal items did very well,” she said.
Shopping Takes More Time From Feasting: Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) (4 a.m.)
Sales on Thanksgiving itself are on the rise in the U.S., according to Adobe Analytics, which forecast 2019 as the first year that online sales surpass $4 billion on the holiday. A larger portion of these transactions are being made on smartphones, Adobe said in a report on U.S. e-commerce activity.
Consumer online spending is projected at $57.5 billion so far in the season -- or 16% higher than a year earlier. Adobe sees e-commerce sales reaching $7.5 billion on Black Friday and $9.4 billion on Cyber Monday -- both about 20% higher than in 2018. The company will provide ongoing analysis of spending through the holiday weekend.
“It’s clear that shoppers are devoting more time to shopping on Thanksgiving than ever,” said Vivek Pandya, lead digital analyst at Adobe. She said sales would surge in the afternoon and evening as consumers “step away from their dinner tables and divert more attention to shopping for the best deals.”
Consumers Ready to Go Shopping (12:01 a.m.)
A survey from Deloitte shows that 79% of U.S. respondents plan to go shopping over the five-day holiday weekend, which is higher than last year. The estimated spending of $415 per household is similar to last year’s pre-holiday estimate.
The trend of brick-and-mortar losing ground to e-commerce is also expected to continue, with participants planning about 53% of their spending via online sources and 43% in stores.
A majority of those surveyed -- 64% -- plan to shop at mass merchants like Target Corp. (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart Inc., while 54% plan to shop at online retailers. Some 32% plan to go to traditional department stores.
A separate study from the National Retail Federation puts expected outlays for the entire season at almost $1,050 per consumer.
Short Season Isn’t Stopping Spenders (12:01 a.m.)
Black Friday is always a critical day for retailers, but the stakes may feel even higher this year, and the calendar is to blame. With Thanksgiving falling on its latest possible date, there are only 26 shopping days between your turkey dinner and Christmas -- compared to 32 last year. That has some companies in a panic, and it means physical stores could feel more crowded than normal in the coming weeks as buyers try to cram all their shopping into a shorter window.
Still, the six “lost days” this season shouldn’t hit overall spending. Promotions began way back in October for some retailers, and shoppers are going to buy the same number of presents for the people on their list regardless of when Thanksgiving falls. “There’s a number of gifts you’re going to buy, and you’re going to buy them,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Goyal said.
Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners LLC, agreed that the briefer window shouldn’t alter the total dollars spent. “Statistically, the holiday shopping season is November and December, and unless I’m mistaken, that means it’s 61 days every year,” he said in the weeks leading up to the event. So when retailers bemoan a shortened holiday, “they’re using it as an excuse.”
Walmart, Amazon Are Early Winners, Study Shows (12:01 a.m.)
The biggest players are going into the holiday period with momentum, early data indicate. Walmart and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). saw the biggest jumps in online consumer spending in the run-up to Thanksgiving compared with a year earlier, according to a report from Edison Trends, an e-commerce research company.
Walmart saw a 53% in increase in web spending, while Amazon had a 37% increase and Nordstrom Inc. climbed 35%, according to the study. Best Buy Co (NYSE:BBY)., Target, Etsy Inc. and Macy’s also registered higher spending. On the other end of the spectrum, Kohl’s, EBay Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. all registered negative numbers from a year earlier.
Edison Trends based its analysis on more than 700,000 transactions."

A Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). survey of 12 South African fund managers found that one-third of them see local equities as undervalued, the most since 2011, while a similar proportion regard the country’s bonds as cheap, the most since 2013.
Most of local investors expect economic conditions in the country to improve, though they are frustrated with the slow pace of reform, the survey shows. Foreign investors have a similar attitude, analysts from the bank said at a presentation in Johannesburg on Friday.
“Foreign investors are lightly positioned and this could be an opportunity if things fall into place,” said David Hauner, the bank’s head of Emerging Market Cross-Asset Research and Economics. “The bar for positive surprises is low.”
For now, the slow progress the government is making in getting its strained finances in order and igniting growth is keeping foreign investors on the sidelines.
“They are saying, why are things taking so long,” said John Morris, the bank’s South Africa strategist. “It’s an opportunity cost. The foreigners are in limbo. It’s wait and see while focusing on other countries.”
Among equities, platinum, beverages and tobacco are the most favored while fund managers are also buying more general miners and retailers, the survey shows.
While South Africa’s credit rating is expected to be cut to junk by Moody’s Investors Service next year, meaning that government bonds would fall out of key indexes, the market has already anticipated this, according to the analysts."
684,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 11:52AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. weighs new regulations to further restrict Huawei suppliers - sources,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government may expand its power to stop more foreign shipments of products with U.S. technology to China's Huawei, amid frustration the company's blacklisting has failed to cut off supplies to the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, two sources said.
The U.S. Commerce Department in May placed Huawei Technologies on a trade blacklist, citing national security concerns. Putting Huawei on the entity list, as it is known, allowed the U.S. government to restrict sales of U.S.-made goods to the company, and some more limited items made abroad that contain U.S. technology.
But under current regulations, key foreign supply chains remain beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, prompting inter-agency discussions within the administration of President Donald Trump about possible changes to two key rules that could expand U.S. authority to block more foreign shipments to the company, giving more teeth to Huawei’s blacklisting, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The expansion of the rules is being considered even though the Trump Administration last week agreed to grant some reprieves on the existing ban and continues to seek a deal to de-escalate a bitter trade war.
If the Commerce Department makes the proposed rule changes, it will allow U.S. authorities to regulate sales of non-sensitive items, such as standard cell phone chips, made abroad with U.S.-origin technology, software, or components to Huawei, which is the world's second largest smartphone maker. 
Huawei and the Commerce department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The changes would represent ""a major expansion of the reach of U.S. export controls and would be poorly received by U.S. allies and U.S. companies,"" said Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson. 
He predicted the actions would upset supply chains but that ultimately Huawei would find other companies to fill the gaps. 
One rule the Commerce Department and sister agencies are focused on broadening is known as the De minimis Rule, which dictates whether U.S. content in a foreign-made product gives the U.S. government authority to block an export, the people said. 
Officials also may expand the so-called Direct Product Rule, which subjects foreign-made goods that are based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. regulations.
It is not clear how close the administration is to making a decision about the changes, nor whether they would be introduced gradually or suddenly. It also was not immediately clear how the rule-making might take place, though sources said the changes would likely affect only Huawei.
Some China hawks within the administration are hoping for swift results, the people said. 
In the months after Huawei was added to the entity list, suppliers such as  Intel Corp  (O:INTC),  Xilinx Inc  (O:XLNX) and Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) resumed some shipments to the Chinese company after conducting internal reviews to assess what products were not subject to the ban. 
Xilinx Chief Executive Victor Peng, for example, told Reuters in July that the company determined that its older, 28-nanometer chips and some chips not designed for 5G gear could legally could be sold to Huawei without a special license. To sell to a blacklisted company, suppliers subject to U.S. rules generally need to apply for and receive a special license.  
Xilinx and the other companies did not explain why they decided they did not fall under the entity list ban. 
The new rule considerations come just days after the Commerce Department gave two important wins to the blacklisted company, whose suppliers need special licenses to sell Huawei U.S. manufactured products. 
Last week, the agency renewed the so-called temporary general license for Huawei for a third time, extending permission for it to engage in limited transactions to maintain U.S. rural network operators. 

And on Wednesday, the Trump administration issued a batch of some 75 licenses to allow some suppliers to restart sales to the company after Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist six months ago.

Norway's white-collar crime unit late on Thursday said it would look into transactions made by fisheries company Samherji via DNB.
Samherji and DNB have both denied wrongdoing.
The investigation follows a report by Iceland's public broadcaster this month that said the Icelandic company had made illicit payments worth millions of dollars to secure fishing quotas in Namibia.
The case has also led to the arrest of Namibia's former justice minister and cast a shadow over the country's ruling party as it contests an election.
On Friday a Namibian magistrate ruled that ex-justice minister Sakeus Shanghala and his fisheries ministry counterpart Bernardt Esau, arrested on Wednesday over the scandal along with four others, would spend the weekend in jail and have their bail application heard on Monday.
The six accused are charged with money laundering, fraud and corruptly using state office to obtain gratifications.

Long regarded as only a minor risk issue for Nordic banks, economic crime has become a major concern over the past two years after money laundering scandals at  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) and  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa).
But while the shares of Danske and Swedbank have plunged since 2017, falling by 65% and 47% respectively, DNB has traded near record highs in recent months and is still only off about 11% from a 2019 peak hit in late October.
The investigation is still in an early phase, the police said.
The International Monetary Fund will examine efforts by banks and regulators to stop money laundering in Nordic and Baltic countries, Sweden's central bank said on Thursday."

RIYADH/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's initial public offering (IPO) was on course to be oversubscribed but not by a huge margin, according to figures released so far by the lead manager before a Dec. 4 close for institutional investors to submit offers.
Bids received by Friday from institutional and retail investors totaled $44.3 billion, lead manager Samba Capital said, about 1.7 times the value Saudi Arabia aims to raise from selling a 1.5% stake in the state-owned oil giant.
Although the IPO has received more than enough bids, the level of interest is relatively muted compared to other emerging market IPOs and subdued even when compared to the listing of a top Saudi bank in 2014 that was oversubscribed many times over.
If Riyadh hits its target of raising 96 billion riyals ($25.6 billion) or more it would still be a world record IPO, valuing the company at about $1.7 trillion.
But this is lower than the $2 trillion valuation originally touted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has put the sale at the heart of his program to raise cash for ambitious plans to diversify the kingdom's oil-reliant economy.
Riyadh scaled back its original IPO plans, scrapping an international roadshow to focus instead on pushing the offering among wealthy Gulf Arab allies. It has stayed quiet on when or where it might list the stock abroad, which had been central to the plans that were first announced in 2016.
Bankers said roadshows in New York and London were canceled after international investors baulked at the proposed valuation.
ATTRACTING ALLIES
In the first update on institutional interest, Samba said the value of bids had reached 118.86 billion riyals ($31.7 billion), with the bulk coming from Saudi companies and funds, while foreign investors accounted for just 10.5% of offers.
Sources told Reuters this week the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Kuwait, both OPEC oil producers like Saudi Arabia and close political allies, planned to invest.
The retail tranche, which closed to subscribers on Thursday, attracted bids worth 47.4 billion riyals ($12.64 billion), around 1.5 times the amount of shares offered to them.
The level of interest is relatively modest when compared to the listing of Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank in 2014 when the retail portion was 23 times oversubscribed.
Alibaba's listing in Hong Kong this month had bids for 40 times as many shares to those on offer.
Saudi banks have been offering citizens easy loans to bid for shares in Aramco, the crown jewel of the Saudi economy and the world's most profitable company.
Some financial institutions offered loans four times their usual limits and others set no ceiling on the amount clients deemed creditworthy could borrow, two financial sources told Reuters.
The government had been encouraging rich Saudis to invest, promoting such investment as a patriotic duty, particularly after Aramco's oil facilities were attacked in September. Riyadh and Washington blamed Iran, although Tehran denied the charge."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian companies are set to increase their borrowings via rouble bonds next year from $200 billion currently outstanding on the market, benefiting from aggressive rate cuts by the central bank, bankers and analysts say.
Reacting to slowing inflation, Russia's central bank last month carried out its largest rate cut in two years, trimming the key rate to 6.50% from 7%, and did not rule out it could slash rates again at its board meeting on Dec. 13.
Lower rates have made it cheaper for companies to borrow to finance their operations, which are largely carried out in rubles. This has spurred growth on the local bond market, which since 2014 has benefited from external markets being largely inaccessible because of Western sanctions against Moscow.
Since then, the Russian domestic corporate bond market has more than doubled in size.
Foreigners have been traditionally attracted to Russia's OFZ treasury rouble bonds, which are auctioned weekly by the Finance Ministry and provide healthy returns comparing to Western markets. But as corporate bond yields are on average higher than those of OFZs, corporate rouble bonds could give investors, including from abroad, more attractive returns.
Alaa Bushehri, portfolio manager at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, said that corporate rouble bonds earlier this year offered valuations of 150 basis points over OFZ bonds.
In October, Russian companies issued 60 new rouble-denominated bond issues, the highest volume since early 2015, according to Sberbank. As of Oct. 1, corporate bonds worth 13 trillion rubles ($200 billion) were being traded on the market, the central bank said.
""We expect an increase in corporate (rouble bond) market next year, mostly thanks to new players, as the bond market has for a long time proven to be a key source of financing for real sector companies,"" said Eduard Dzhabarov, co-head of the debt capital markets department at Sberbank.
Dzhabarov pointed to the firmer the rouble, which has strengthened nearly 9% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year, and the rate cut by the central bank, as key reasons behind record volumes in October.
Alexei Konochkin, deputy head of the debt capital markets department of VTB Capital, said new corporate bond issues could increase 25% in year-on-year terms to reach 2 trillion rubles in 2019, and that their outlook remained positive for 2020.
SUPPORT FROM BANKS
After the global financial crisis of 2008, which seriously affected Russia, the central bank created what it calls a central counterparty, a special entity tasked with mitigating risks on the domestic equity, debt and financial markets.
Russia's domestic bond market has so far not been subject to any major shocks, in part because the biggest borrowers are large, state-controlled firms in the energy, transportation and banking sectors, according to data from Russia's ACRA ratings agency.
Banks, which are the main purchasers of these bonds, have also helped the corporate bond market. The central bank expects banks' excess liquidity to increase to up to 4.6 trillion rubles next year, which could help them further support the market.
Rosneft, Russia's top oil company, has been the most active issuer in terms of the volume of outstanding rouble bonds.
As of January, it had more than $44.5 billion worth of rouble bonds outstanding because it needed to finance its capital expenditure program in the absence of access to external markets since 2014.
In the first six months of the year, Sberbank, the country's largest bank, was the most active borrower, raising almost 96 billion rubles."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds recommended switching cash back into equities in November as stocks worldwide rose to near record highs despite a lack of clarity over how, when, or if a truce will be called on the damaging U.S.-China trade war, a Reuters poll showed.
Stock markets had risen through October, and in November began to price in expectations of an initial deal as investors were betting it ultimately remains in the interest of both Washington and Beijing to move forward to get a trade deal.
That buoyancy in stocks pushed fund managers and chief investment officers in the U.S., Europe, Britain and Japan in the latest Reuters asset allocation poll taken Nov. 13-28 to suggest an increase in equities allocations for the second month in a row, at the expense of cash.
Stocks allocations accounted for an average 47.5% in November of their model global portfolio, the highest since March, from 46.2% in October. The cash buffer was cut to the lowest since April last year of 4.6% after peaking at 7.7% in August, which was the highest since early 2013.
Recommended bond holdings accounted for 41.8% compared to 41.9% the previous month.
""While many uncertainties remain regarding the outlook, we believe much, if not most, of the potential risk has been priced into the market, and we have begun gradually putting cash back to work in equities,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management.
The latest recommended allocations are likely to hold until early 2020, barring any major surprises, as most funds tend not to shift their global recommendations much in December.
While fears of a deeper global economic slowdown still remain, easy monetary policy has lifted most world indexes to double-digit gains this year. That run in world stocks was expected to continue through next year, according to a majority of fund managers who answered an additional question.
That lines up with a separate Reuters poll of stock brokers and strategists published earlier this week, which showed a majority of the indexes covered had either breached their end-2019 predictions from a poll taken a year ago or were within striking distance before the year ends.
""Global monetary policy has eased and growth is showing signs of picking up. This creates a supportive environment for global equities into 2020,"" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management.
""However, stock markets may be prone to short-term corrections as the geopolitical background remains uncertain - Brexit, Hong Kong tensions, the trade war, 2020 U.S. elections. We would be looking for opportunities to buy on dips, should we view the market as overly pessimistic.""
But funds were skeptical on the strong performance in world stocks and a majority of them said over the next six months, they would roughly maintain the current risk position driven more by developments in the trade war.
""The recent policy shift by central bankers, combined with a modest uptick in data, has averted a 'mini crisis'. Since that point we have seen credit conditions improve (and) recessionary warnings subside,"" said Rory McPherson, Head of Investment Strategy at Psigma Investment Management.
""This should all be supportive for stocks, but we note the delicate path which stocks tread. Whilst conditions are supportive, they could flip very quickly. The biggest risk here likely revolves around global trade with the U.S. and China being the most obvious source of disruption.""
A majority of fund managers have also shifted their view that monetary policy and economic developments outside of the U.S. were expected to drive asset strategy over the next six months compared to the Federal Reserve's policy path, which was predicted previously.
""The Fed and other major central banks will likely remain on hold with minor tweaks to their already accommodative monetary policy stance and the U.S. and China will probably agree to a phase-one deal without much additional progress,"" said Benjamin Suess, director at UBS Asset Management.
""Therefore, focus will shift to the ongoing recovery in manufacturing activity and corporate earnings. The market does expect a bounce and if it does not happen, equities are vulnerable to the downside.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler said on Friday it will cut at least 10,000 jobs worldwide over the next three years, following others in the industry as they cut costs to invest in electric vehicles while grappling with weakening sales.
It marks the third announcement on cost cuts this week by a major German car company as automakers seek to fund huge investments into cleaner and self-driving technologies while demand in China, their biggest market, is falling and a trade war between Washington and Beijing is curbing economic growth.
""The automotive industry is in the middle of the biggest transformation in its history,"" Daimler said in a statement.
Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, revealed the 3% cut in its workforce after reaching an agreement on its plans with labor unions.
They have agreed on a variety of measures to cut costs and jobs, including expanding part-time retirement and a severance program to be offered in Germany. The company is also cutting 10% of worldwide management positions. 
Staff reductions would be in the low five-digits, or at least 10,000 people, according to Wilfried Porth, a board member in charge of human resources. The company employed 304,680 staff at the end of the third quarter. 
Plans laid out by Daimler in November showed the company aimed to cut staff costs by around 1.4 billion euros ($1.54 billion) by the end of 2022.
The announcement comes days after Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) luxury car unit Audi said it would cut up to 9,500 jobs or one in ten staff by 2025, freeing up billions of euros to fund its shift toward electric vehicle production.
Also this week, BMW said that its management and labor had reached an agreement on measures to reduce bonus and other pay schemes for staff to cut costs.
Car suppliers Continental and Osram have also announced staff and cost cuts.
Daimler has repeatedly cut its profit outlook over recent months, partly to cover a regulatory crackdown on diesel emissions but also because of a slowing auto market.
Group operating profit will be ""significantly lower"" than a year ago, the company said last month.
Other measures to reduce staffing costs include offering shorter working weeks. 
Agreements in place to prevent forced redundancies in Germany until 2029 will remain in place, Daimler said.
The workforce needs a clear strategy for the future, said Michael Brecht, chairman of Daimler's works council. ""A reduction in capacity must not be carried out on the backs of the employees,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's six biggest retail energy suppliers, known as the Big Six, are about to become five with the restructuring of Npower by its German owner E.ON (DE:EONGn).
Below are details about the market and factors driving change:
WHO ARE THE BIG SIX?
Alongside Npower, the Big Six, which control about 70% of Britain's retail energy market, are Centrica's British Gas (L:CNA), SSE (L:SSE), EDF Energy (PA:EDF), Iberdrola's Scottish Power (MC:IBE) and another E.ON-owned supplier operating under the E.ON brand.
British Gas dominates with about 24 million customers.
WHAT IS CHANGING AMONG THE MAIN SUPPLIERS?
E.ON said on Friday it planned to break up Npower under a 500 million pound ($642 million) restructuring, which a union said could put up to 4,500 jobs at risk. Npower's customers are expected to migrate to the E.ON branded business.
Relative newcomer OVO Energy will become one of the main suppliers with its deal buy the retail arm of SSE. The acquisition is being examined by the competition regulator. Both firms expect it to be completed in early 2020.
SSE had sought a buyer after a plan to merge with Npower collapsed because the two sides could not agree commercial terms following the government's move to cap energy bills.
WHO COMPETES WITH THE BIG SIX?
Smaller, nimbler rivals have been challenging the Big Six, relying on lower overheads to offer households cheaper supplies of electricity and gas.
There are more than 50 of these smaller suppliers, even after many start-ups shut in recent years. Some operate nationwide, while others offer regional services.
The challengers, which include Bulb and Octopus Energy, have grown rapidly and control about 30% of the market, up from 1% a decade ago.
WHY WAS A PRICE CAP IMPOSED?
The regulator Ofgem imposed a price cap on standard energy bills at the start of 2019 under a policy introduced by former Prime Minister Theresa May, who had described prices being offered consumers as a ""rip off"".
The initiative capped the most widely used tariffs. It was set below the level charged by the Big Six on the bulk of their supplies.
In August, Ofgem said the cap would be 1,179 pounds ($1,430) a year for average energy use, 6% below a previous level set in April, reflecting a fall in wholesale energy prices.
COULD BRITAIN'S ELECTION BRING MORE CHANGE?
Britain's opposition Labour Party, which is trailing in the opinion polls, has promised to bring the Big Six into public ownership if it wins the Dec. 12 parliamentary election."

Now, Riyadh’s had enough.
Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who took over from Khalid Al-Falih in September, will likely use his first OPEC meeting as Saudi oil minister next week to signal OPEC’s dominant producer is no longer willing to compensate for other members’ non-compliance, according to people familiar with the kingdom’s thinking. OPEC meets in Vienna on Dec. 5, followed by the larger OPEC+ alliance, which includes Russia, the next day.
“Saudi Arabia is taking a harder line than in the past,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. in London. “Riyadh is making very clear that they don’t want to shoulder all the cuts alone.”
The willingness to tolerate cheating was a key part of the “whatever it takes” policy to support oil prices that Al-Falih set out in late 2016, borrowing a line from central banker Mario Draghi.
Al-Falih paid lip service to dealing with the cheating, trying to cajole OPEC+ nations to cut output as much as they had promised. But when his admonitions failed and oil prices faltered, endangering the initial public offering of state oil producer Saudi Aramco, he simply decided to bear the burden. Earlier this year, in an abrupt change to decades of Saudi oil policy, Riyadh cut production far below their agreed target.
Whether the new policy simply represents a shift in tone, or a more meaningful change isn’t yet clear. Saudi officials privately say Prince Abdulaziz will simply reiterate the decades-long Saudi mantra that everyone needs to contribute to make the production cuts successful. During the tenure of Ali Al-Naimi, oil minister from 1995 to 2016, Riyadh resolutely refused to cut its production deeper than it had agreed at OPEC meetings.
The prince already made the point when he attended an OPEC+ committee meeting in Abu Dhabi in September.
“Every country counts regardless of its size,” he said at the opening session of the meeting.
The cheating has been widespread. Iraq, for example, should be pumping no more than 4.51 million barrels a day; but in some months it produced nearly 4.8 million barrels a day. Kazakhstan accepted a limit of 1.86 million barrels a day, however, it has produced closer to 1.95 million barrels. Nigeria agreed a quota of 1.68 million barrels a day, but has regularly pumped more than 1.8 million barrels a day.
Russia has pumped more oil than allowed by the OPEC+ deal in eight months this year. It has complied with the agreement in only three months of this year -- May, June and July -- when disruption to the key Druzhba oil pipeline pushed production below its OPEC+ target.
Al-Falih was forced to act partly because the kingdom needed a higher oil price to push ahead with the Aramco IPO. But Prince Abdulaziz probably won’t be so constrained once Aramco prices its share sale on Dec. 5, the same day as OPEC’s meeting.
The policy of accommodating cheating has been costly for the kingdom. Riyadh was forced to reduce its own production as much as 700,000 barrels a day below its own OPEC+ quota to prevent oil prices from falling.
In December 2018, Saudi Arabia agreed a production limit of 10.31 million barrels a day through this year. But it reduced production unilaterally earlier this year, reaching a low of 9.58 million barrels a day in July.
As Saudi Arabia had to cut production deeper than others, it’s reaped fewer rewards from the recovery in oil prices. Russia, for example, is earning about $170 million a day more than it did in the final quarter of 2016 when the OPEC+ cuts were first agreed, according to the International Energy Agency. Saudi Arabia is earning just $125 million more.
For OPEC watchers, the test of how far Saudi Arabia is ready to get tough with cheaters is whether the kingdom brings production back to its official OPEC+ quota of 10.31 million barrels a day and sustains it for several months.
The production picture is clouded by the impact of the September attack against two key Saudi production facilities called Abqaiq and Khurais. The kingdom depleted its inventories in the days after the attack to sustain exports and Riyadh has subsequently lifted production to re-fill them. In November, the kingdom has pumped 10.23 million barrels a day, a slight reduction from October but significantly above the year-to-date average of 9.8 million, according to Vienna-based consultant JBC Energy GmbH."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai court fined the local unit of Philip Morris (N:PM) 1.2 billion baht ($40 million) for customs violations on cigarette imports on Friday, while dropping criminal charges against seven of its employees.
The Thai public prosecutor filed charges in 2016 against Philip Morris Thailand and seven of its Thai employees, alleging under-reporting of the value of more than 270 entries of imported cigarettes from the Philippines between 2003 and 2006 which led to a revenue losses of more than 306 million baht.
""I'm very happy for the employees that were completely acquitted in this case,"" said Gerald Margolis, branch manager of Philip Morris Thailand.
""However, we strongly but respectfully disagree with this decision and we'll promptly appeal,"" he said, adding that the company has complied with local laws and World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
The Philippines went to the WTO in 2008 to complain that Thailand was illegally discriminating against imports to protect its state-controlled Thailand Tobacco Monopoly.
A 2010 WTO said that Thailand had no grounds to reject the import price of cigarettes from the Philippines.
The Philippines has said that a series of domestic taxation and customs valuations by Thailand that started in 2006 undermined the competitiveness of its cigarettes against those produced by the state-controlled Thailand Tobacco Monopoly."

Altmaier presented his new industrial strategy on Friday, including plans to set up a standing committee which, as a last resort, could decide to take stakes in German companies that produce sensitive or security relevant technologies.
The stakes, which would be acquired by Germany's KfW state development bank, would be held temporarily. This can already be done in some cases under German law, but Altmaier said the process was too slow.
""Structures have to be created to take the necessary decisions faster and more efficiently than has been the case thus far,"" he said in his ""Industry Strategy 2030"".
Under the plans, Germany also aims to step up screening of non-European investors that want to buy into firms in key sectors, in a move widely seen as targeting Chinese state-backed investors.
The plans come at a time when the European Union as a whole is reconsidering its industrial strategy and relations to China in the face of increased investment in critical sectors by Chinese state-owned enterprises.
German officials have described the Chinese takeover in 2016 of Bavarian robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) as a wake-up call that underlined the need to shield strategic parts of the economy.
An attempt by China's State Grid in 2018 to buy a stake in power grid operator 50Hertz also focused German minds. After Berlin failed to find an alternative private investor in Europe, German state-owned bank KfW stepped in to keep the Chinese out."

France's Renault is trying to repair relations with its Japanese partners after they were shaken by Ghosn's arrest in Tokyo a year ago on financial misconduct charges, which the alliance's founder denies. 
The scandal disrupted efforts to roll out industrial projects together and find cost savings - increasingly vital as global auto demand falters - as Renault and Nissan shook up their teams in an effort to stabilize their business.

704,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 05:26AM ET</span>",StockBeat: E.On Rewarded for Tackling npower Woes,"Investing.com -- German-based utility E.ON (DE:EONGn) is taking the ax to the U.K. power business it bought from rival RWE (DE:RWEG_p) last year, as it tries to turn round a business hobbled by capped prices and a swarm of low-cost competitors.
 E.On  said it would take a 500 million-pound ($642 million) hit from restructuring the struggling npower business, but said it expected npower to generate at least 100 million pounds a year in earnings before interest and taxes from 2022 onward. It said it has stabilized customer numbers since switching to an exclusively green energy offer earlier this year.
The market has given its approval, pushing the stock up by 1.6% on a day when pretty much everything else is falling after confidence in an imminent U.S.-China trade deal was hit by the U.S.’s enacting of legislation supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
E.On’s stock is now up over 12% from its 2019 low three months ago but is still essentially stuck in the same rut it has been in since late 2017. That's a reflection of how little the radical asset swap with RWE has done to actually unlock shareholder value, and also a stark illustration of the side-effects of Germany's much-touted 'Energiewende' policy, which has driven up consumer bills while doing little or nothing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power stations.
By 5 AM ET (1000 GMT), the German DAX index was down 0.2%, recovering slightly after the country’s jobless rolls fell surprisingly in November, allaying concerns about the slowdown that has hit German manufacturing so hard this year.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 slipped 0.1% to 408.70, under the influence of an earlier and sharper fall in Asian markets, especially Hong Kong. The U.K. FTSE 100, meanwhile, also edged 0.1% lower after a survey showing consumer confidence at its lowest since 2013 – something that appears out of kilter with polls showing a commanding lead for the ruling party in the current election campaign.
Other data showed U.K. consumer borrowing rising for the first time since June last year, although a more worrying development saw foreign investors dump U.K. government bonds at the fastest rate since February in October. That was ahead of what was supposed to be the U.K. ‘s exit from the European Union at the end of last month.
Elsewhere in stock markets, the standout performer was U.K. online grocery specialist Ocado (LON:OCDO), which soared some 15% after announcing a long-term strategic partnership with Japan’s largest food retailer Aeon."

EON and Innogy will consult and work with trade Unions and employee representatives on the plan and are committed to mitigating the impact on employees, they said in a statement on Friday. But the merger of customers could put as many as 4,500 job cuts and the closure of many of Npower’s sites in the U.K., according to Unison, one of the nation’s biggest unions.
Npower has been bleeding money for years. The energy retail market has traditionally been dominated by the six big utilities, but their share is shrinking with smaller and more nimble rivals undercutting prices. In a far cry from Margaret Thatcher’s liberalization drive decades ago, lawmakers from all parties have turned against the traditional suppliers, with former Prime Minister Theresa May introducing a price cap to stop what she called “rip off” contracts.
“The U.K. market is currently particularly challenging. We’ve emphasized repeatedly that we’ll take all necessary action to return our business there to consistent profitability,” EON Chief Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen said. “For this purpose, we’ve put together proposals and already begun discussing them with British unions.”
EON took over Innogy as part of an asset swap with RWE AG (DE:RWEG_p) that was completed earlier this year. The German utilities in the early 2000s flocked to the U.K market where light-touch regulation and low business rates offered a profitable alternative to increasing competition and higher taxes in Germany.
Innogy isn’t providing any numbers regarding how many job are at risk.
“It is inevitable that a transformation of this scale will have an impact on the workforce,” the company said.
Workers will be given details at briefings later on Friday.
Npower’s market share for electricity has fallen from 15% in 2004 to 8% in the second quarter of 2019, according to regulator Ofgem. The company had 4.2 million retail customers by the end of 2018, according to the company."

HARBIN, China/SINGAPORE/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Across China's coal-burning northeastern provinces, pipelines are being laid, contracts signed and coal-fired boilers ripped out ahead of the arrival next week of the country's first piped natural gas from Russia.
The 'Power of Siberia' pipeline, due to open on Dec. 2, will pipe natural gas around 3,000 km (1,865 miles) from Russia's Siberian fields to the fading industrial region, which has lagged the push to gas in China's south and east.
The pipeline - which will deliver gas under a 30-year, $400 billion deal signed in 2014 - has the potential to transform northeast China's energy landscape and even slow the country's surging imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
It will also make Russia a key supplier to China, to rival Turkmenistan and Australia, boosting ties amid Beijing's trade war with the United States.
More immediately, it poses a challenge for the sole marketer of the gas, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), or PetroChina, as it looks to drum up demand in the relatively sparsely populated region that has relied on coal for heating during sub-zero winters.
The pipeline will emerge in Heilongjiang, which borders Russia, and feed on to Jilin and Liaoning, China's top grain hub, where rust belt industries have long been overshadowed elsewhere.
The region's industry and 68 million city dwellers consume just 14 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas a year, well below the 38 bcm the pipeline will deliver at full capacity by 2025. 
Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) has said it expects to supply 4.6 bcm in 2020, rising to 10 bcm in 2021, 16 bcm in 2022, 21 bcm in 2023 and 25 bcm in 2024.
(GRAPHIC: Map of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline through China - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7522/7504/PowerSiberiaMapthroughChina.png) 
With local power prices capped by authorities to support manufacturing, and cheaper imported coal available via Liaoning's Dalian port, CNPC faces a tough task to sell gas.
""It will take a long time to nurture a market in the northeast where gas-fired power generation barely exists and the industrial sector is weak,"" said Li Yao, chief executive of consultancy SIA Energy.
""With no take-or-pay contracts in place (domestically), CNPC shoulders most of the marketing risk.""
PRICE TAKER, LOSS MAKER
Neither PetroChina nor Gazprom has revealed the gas pricing terms, but Beijing-based analysts said the price is linked to crude oil or a basket of competing fuels.
Ling Xiao, a PetroChina vice president in charge of gas marketing, said last month Siberian supplies would be priced ""slightly lower"" than piped imports from Turkmenistan, but the company ""will still be making a loss as (the price) exceeds that of domestic city-gate benchmark rates.""
Several Russian gas industry sources said the pricing could be revised down as volumes increase due to a fall in global oil prices from around $100 a barrel when the deal was signed to around $60 now. 
However, the pricing formula remains known by only a few due to its commercial sensitivity, according to one source. Gazprom said it will not comment on pricing.
PetroChina declined to comment on the pipeline or its plans to boost gas take-up. 
However the company, which supplies 70% of China's gas, has been working for the past five years to put distribution infrastructure in place.
A 3,371 km (2,095 mile) trunkline linking the arrival point in Heihe to Shanghai is being laid in phases and slated for completion by 2024, state media reported. 
PetroChina completed a 728 km (452 mile) section to Changling in Jilin province in July, and slashed construction time on a short leg that will ensure gas to parts of north China this winter. A 1,100 km extension to Yongqing in Hebei province is due by end-2020. 
PetroChina has also made its first foray into regional midstream delivery - between national pipelines and city networks - building part of a planned Heilongjiang grid connecting a dozen key cities, Caixin reported in November.
And the firm plans 5-6 bcm of underground storage, to be built in depleted gas wells in Daqing, Liaohe and Jilin to cope with the off-season demand trough, said Ding Guosheng, a gas storage expert with the company.
CLOSER TIES 
The pipeline will cement China's spot as Russia's top export market and give Russia a potentially enormous new market outside Europe.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said trade between the neighbors would reach a record $100 billion this year, up from $87 billion in 2018. Moscow sees that figure rising to $200 billion by 2024 thanks in part to gas.
""Russia is leveraging well on (China's) trade war ... In the aftermath of western sanctions, Russia has turned to China and won investment, markets and technology,"" said Professor Feng Yujun, director of Russia and Central Asia Research at Fudan University. 
As Beijing battles air pollution, analysts at IHS market say China's gas demand is poised to surge by half between 2018 and 2025, at which point Siberian gas is slated to supply a tenth of China's total gas demand.
(GRAPHIC: Russia trade balance with China hits 13-year high as crude shipments scale new record - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/7527/7509/RussiaChinaCrudeFlowsandTradeBalance.png) 
If the northeast region is unable to absorb the full 38 bcm gas by 2025, some fuel will be diverted to north China, where it could likely compete on cost against imported LNG, said Jenny Yang of IHS Markit. 
RETAIL JOSTLING 
Meanwhile, city gas distributors in Heilongjiang such as China Gas Holdings and Hongkong and China Gas Co. Ltd that provide ""last-mile"" connections to users are eyeing a potential boon.
""China Gas has over the past 10 years spent more than 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) winning distribution licenses and laying pipelines in northeast region,"" Frank Li, assistant to president of China Gas Holdings, told Reuters. ""Now it's time to reap the fruits.""
In Heilongjiang's capital Harbin, the firm, together with PetroChina's Kunlun Energy, is converting hundreds of heating stations - centers that pipe hot water to nearby residents - from coal to gas.
Recent heavy snow pushed temperatures below freezing, but workers are still racing to get ready for Russian gas. 

""The pipelines are all settled and we are just waiting to connect them into our boilers,"" said a worker at a Harbin heating station.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 03:07AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Brazil, China, UAE firms in second round of bids for Petrobras refineries - sources","By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) has selected four groups for the second round of bidding for four refineries up for sale, including China's Sinopec, Abu Dhabi's state investor and two Brazilian firms, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.
Sinopec, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co and Brazil's Ultrapar Participações SA (SA:UGPA3) and Raizen were chosen to go through to the next phase, they said. Brazil's Raizen is a joint venture between Cosan SA (SA:CSAN3) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa).
Petrobras, as the oil company is known, received non- binding offers in early November for the first block of refineries it plans to sell. It selected the groups that will progress to the second round last week, the sources added, declining to be named as the details are confidential.
The binding offers are expected to be delivered by mid-January, two of the sources said. The first block of refineries is the largest one, with a combined capacity of 961,000 oil barrels per day, or 40% of Brazil's total refining capacity.
Ultrapar, Raízen and Mubadala declined to comment. Petrobras and Sinopec did not immediately comment on the matter.
According to the sources, Ultrapar and Raízen may deliver bids for the two refineries in the southern region, REFAP and REPAR, and for RNEST, in the northeastern state of Pernambuco.
China's Sinopec and Mubadala plan to bid for RLAM, Brazil's oldest refinery, in the northeastern state of Bahia, the people said. RLAM needs significant renovations, and Sinopec is interested in forming a consortium with a Chinese construction company. Mubadala is expected to structure a deal involving Spanish oil company Cepsa, which has Mubadala and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) as investors, two of the sources said.
According to rules set forth by Brazil's antitrust watchdog Cade, bidders can only acquire one refinery in each region.
CONSORTIA
The sources said companies approved for the second round are in talks to create consortia with commodity traders such as  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and Vitol, that signed non disclosure agreements at the start of the process and are allowed to join the groups in the binding phase. Vitol and Glencore declined to comment.
Operators of natural gas pipelines are also in talks to potentially join groups to operate the logistics assets that Petrobras will sell with each refinery, such as terminals and oil and fuel pipelines, they added.
Among these groups are Canada's Brookfield, which owns gas pipeline network company NTS, previously sold by Petrobras, the sources said. Brookfield declined to comment.
Financial firms such as Canadian pension funds CPPIB and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ), besides Singapore's GIC, could also join, they said. The companies did not immediately comment.
Oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, which had signed a non disclosure agreement, dropped out of the process, the sources said.
Brazil's history of imposing fuel price controls and a privatization model that will leave Petrobras with a strong presence in Brazil's richest region, the southeast, have reduced the expected competition for the refineries.
Initial estimates that the oil company could fetch up to $18 billion for the refineries have been reduced to around $10 billion.
SECOND BLOCK
A second block of four refineries, which is expected to be put up for sale next year, is much smaller than the first, with a total capacity of roughly 200,000 barrels per day.
REMAN, in the state of Amazonas, has attracted the interest of regional fuel distributor Atem Distribuição de Petroleo, one of the sources said.
India's conglomerate Essar, which has exploration operations in India and refining and fuel distribution assets in Britain, could also bid for one of the units in the second block, the sources added.
EIG Global Energy Partners is also said to be eyeing REGAP, in Minas Gerais, according to one source.
Atem, Essar and EIG did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

Ocado (LON:OCDO) said it signed up a big new international customer for its Ocado Smart Platform technology.
It’s agreed a strategic partnership with Aeon, Japan’s largest retailer, to develop the latter’s online grocery business in Japan. It intends to build a network of fulfilment and service centers with a sales capacity around 600 billion yen ($5.5 billion) by 2030, growing to approximately 1 trillion yen by 2035.
Aeon will pay Ocado (LON:OCDO) certain upfront fees upon signing and during the development phase, then ongoing fees linked to both sales achieved and installed capacity within each new fulfilment center and service criteria.
The company expects some 25 million pounds in additional operating costs and “minimal” additional capital spending next year as a result, with most of the associated capex coming in the 18 months leading up to the opening of each fulfilment center.
Estate agent Countrywide (LON:CWD) said it had agreed to sell its commercial business Lambert Smith Hamption for 38 million pounds, a deal it said that will sharpen its focus on the core residential business and “materially” reduce its net debt.

  Investec   (LON:INVP) said it expects its common equity tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial strength, to rise by around 1.3 percentage points to 12.0% as a result of spinning off its asset management division.
The spin-off is expected to happen in March 2020, with the new company trading under the name of Ninety One on both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges.
Investec PLC shareholders will receive 55.9% of the total issued share capital of Ninety One PLC, while up to 8.3% will be placed with news investors in a secondary offering on the same day as the listing, with Investec pocketing the proceeds. Investec itself intends to retain some 15.8% of Ninety One.

  Future PLC   (LON:FUTR) said it had issued 686,497 shares to fund the acquisition of Barcroft Studios that it announced earlier this month. That represents some 0.7% of the expanded capital base.
IG Group (LON:IGG) said it has reappointed PriceWaterhouseCoopers as its auditor."

European stocks look set to start Friday lower with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) down 0.3% in early trade, following a bleak Asian morning session.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell more than 1%. Hong Kong (HSI) led the dip with losses of 2%. South Korean shares (KS11) lost 1.4% and Japan's Nikkei (N225) eased 0.5%.
China's blue-chips (CSI300) gave up 1.3% a day before the country reports manufacturing activity, which analysts polled by Reuters expect to have shrunk for seventh straight month in November.
Markets were sold off due to uncertainty over how U.S. markets will perceive the latest clash between Washington and Beijing over Hong Kong.
Traders on Wall Street will commence a half-day session on Friday following Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. S&P 500 mini futures (ESc1) were down 0.3%.
China warned the United States on Thursday it would take ""firm counter measures"" in response to U.S. legislation backing anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.
Anthony Chan, chief Asia investment strategist at Union Bancaire Privée in Hong Kong, said the market is still erring on the side of caution especially as the year-end approaches.
""There is still downward pressure on earnings. That's why when there is (negative) geopolitical news, some funds might want to sell and lock in their performance,"" he said.
But on the whole, investors are now betting that while the U.S. legislation spoils the mood, ultimately it remained in the interest of both Washington and Beijing to move forward with talks to get a trade deal.
""The working assumption for most investors is that this will not derail the trade talks, given China is suffering from an economic slowdown,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.

PARIS/BEIJING (Reuters) -  Peugeot  maker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) said it is preparing to sell its 50% stake in an eight-year-old joint venture with Chinese partner Chongqing Changan Automotive (SZ:000625) which has struggled with falling sales.
The announcement in Paris on Thursday came after Changan also signaled in regulatory filings earlier this month that it was seeking a buyer for its half of the Shenzhen-based venture known as CAPSA, which builds cars under PSA's premium DS brand. 
PSA's move highlights how global car manufacturers are struggling in the world's biggest auto market, where sales contracted last year for the first time since the 1990s.
It also plans to cut jobs and drop two of the four assembly plants it shares in a larger join venture with China's Dongfeng Group (HK:0489), which builds Peugeot and Citroen cars, Reuters reported in August.
A PSA spokesman said the French company still hoped to roll out DS cars in China and a ""new strategic plan"" would be presented in the coming weeks or months.
The partners planned to continue building DS-branded cars at the Shenzhen plant, a China-based PSA spokesman said on Friday.
PSA's sale plan would be presented to French unions on Friday, a source familiar with the matter said. 
PSA's sales in China fell in 2018 by 32% to 262,583 vehicles, a long way off the 1 million-a-year target it had set itself a few years ago.

717,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 12:14AM ET</span>",India Stocks Retreat From Record Ahead of Economic Growth Report,"(Bloomberg) -- India stocks fell, retreating from a third record-high close this week, ahead of a report due later Friday that’s expected to show the economy expanded at the slowest pace in more than six years.
The S&P BSE Sensex Index declined 0.5% to 40,928.90 as of 9:56 a.m. in Mumbai. The measure is set for a third straight month of gains, the longest such streak since May. The NSE Nifty 50 Index also lost 0.5% Friday.
Asia’s third-biggest economy probably grew 4.5% in the three months through September, according to economists in a Bloomberg survey. The report is due after market hours. Among measures in recent months aimed at reversing the slowdown, the government has cut taxes and plans to set aside funds to help troubled industries, while the central bank is expected to deliver another rate cut on Dec. 5 to help bolster liquidity.
Strategist View
“Stocks could fall if GDP growth comes in below 5%,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, an analyst at IIFL Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “The series of new highs that have been set recently mean that investors will buy into any decline very quickly.”
The Numbers
Ten of 19 sector sub-indexes compiled by BSE Ltd. fell, led by a gauge of metal companies.Twenty-three of 31 Sensex shares fell, while eight gained.Reliance Industries Ltd. contributed the most to the index decline, with a 0.8% fall; Tata Steel Ltd. was the biggest loser, slipping 1.4%; Bharti Airtel Ltd. added 1.4% and was the biggest boost; Yes Bank Ltd.’s 4.4% gain was the biggest; the lender is poised to outline fund-raising plans.Related Stories

718,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 12:11AM ET</span>","French banks, insurers must cut coal exposure - central bank","PARIS (Reuters) - French banks and insurers need to cut their exposure to the coal industry, French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in a newspaper interview published on Friday.
Investors are increasingly putting pressure on companies to make concrete steps to helping implement the United Nations-backed 2015 Paris Agreement to avert catastrophic global warming.
In France, banks and insurers - which have been required by law to disclose climate risks since 2016 - are also facing pressure from regulators.
""It is absolutely necessary that the risk of financing coal plants is quickly reduced on French banks' balance sheets,"" Villeroy told newspaper La Croix.
French bank  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and French insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) said this week they would exit the coal sector by 2030 in OECD countries and by 2040 for the rest the world.
French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said last week that it would stop financing the thermal coal sector by 2030 in the European Union and 2040 worldwide."

The airline said its revenue dropped “significantly” in November and impacted the monthly payroll. It is the first time it has to hold back salaries because of a cash flow problem, according to Bloomberg. 
The civil unrest in Hong Kong, which began in June, saw transport networks disrupted and the airport paralyzed in two occasions in August. Hong Kong Airlines said at the time that it would adjust services. Cathay Pacific Airways Limited (HK:0293) issued profit warnings and saw its share prices slump 25% from an April peak, while other airlines including Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL), China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd (HK:0670) and   Virgin Australia   Holdings Ltd (ASX:VAH) have all cut flights to Hong Kong. 
The protests received more attention this week as U.S. President Donald Trump this week signed two bills that support Hong Kong protestors. China has vowed to retaliate but has so far taken no action. 
In 2018, Hong Kong Airlines was reportedly considering an IPO in the “short to medium term” last year, according to a document reviewed by Reuters. The company also wanted to raise up to $550 million via convertible bonds or tradable bonds before the listing, the document showed."

The comment indicates the close regulatory scrutiny ride-hailing firms continue to be under, particularly since the two incidents in which Hitch drivers killed passengers.
Hitch allows users to hail a car via smartphone and share a ride with someone heading in a similar direction at low cost. On its relaunch, Didi said it had improved safety features, limited number of daily rides and established more rigorous driver and passenger verification mechanisms.
""According to local regulations, car-pooling services should have a certain limit on the number of rides each car can offer,"" Xu Yahua, director of the ministry's transportation services department, said at a press briefing on Thursday in response to a question about Hitch's relaunch.
""There have also been terrible cases that have happened on ride-hailing services so we hope each platform can take in lessons and strengthen safety management measures,"" Xu said, according to a transcript of his comments.
A Didi Chuxing representative told Reuters via text message on Friday that the market leader will limit the daily number of rides drivers can offer on Hitch according to guidelines of cities where the service operates."

The Hang Seng Index slumped 2% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT) as tensions over Hong Kong escalated. The city has been rocked by months of political unrest that was sparked by a since-withdrawn extradition bill. 
U.S. President Donald Trump signed two bills that supports anti-government protestors in Hong Kong. 
China condemned the action and warned the U.S. that it would take ""firm counter measures"". and said attempts to interfere in the Chinese-ruled city were “doomed to fail.”
Traders continued to evaluate the impact of the signing of bills. While Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping both expressed a desire to sign n a “phase one” trade deal, reports suggested that the signing might not happen before the end of this year. 
The next batch of American tariffs on Chinese goods are due to begin on Dec. 15. 
Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, told CNBC in an interview today that Hong Kong is the “biggest geopolitical risk out there for markets” at the moment. 
“If the situation in Hong Kong escalates badly, if we get a Chinese heavy-handed military intervention, then it would be nearly impossible for the U.S. to conclude a trade deal with China — even a stage one deal — it would be nearly impossible for the EU to do that, so that would prolong the global industrial downturn which is caused by trade tensions,” said Schmieding.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component both dropped 0.6%. 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2%. Data showed today that the country’s industrial output fell 4.2% in October from the previous month, compared with the median market forecast for a 2.1% fall. 
Another report showed that retail sales fell 7.1% during the month, its sharpest fall since 2015. A rise in nationwide sales tax to 10% from 8% that began on Oct. 1 was cited as the reason for the fall. 
Meanwhile, the jobless rate came in at 2.4% in October, unchanged from last month’s figure.

(Reuters) - A major fire at a Texas petrochemical plant continued to burn for a second day on Thursday, with the 60,000 people forced to evacuate still uncertain as to whether they could return home in time to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday.
The fiery blast inside a distillation column at the Port Neches, Texas, TPC Group facility on Wednesday injured three workers, blew locked doors off their hinges and spewed a plume of toxic chemicals for miles (kilometers).
The plant manufactures petrochemicals used to make rubber and resins, and the volatile organic compounds in the explosion's smoke can lead to eye, nose and throat irritation, shortness of breath, headaches and nausea, the pollution regulator Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) said. No impact to water was reported.
The plant, 90 miles (145 km) east of Houston, has a long history of environmental violations and has been out of compliance with federal clean air laws for years, according to the Texas Tribune and state records; it was also declared a high priority violator by the Environmental Protection Agency.
State agencies are monitoring air quality. Police are patrolling the evacuated communities to prevent looting.
TPC spokesperson Sara Cronin said that it was uncertain when the fire would be extinguished or the chemicals burned off but pointed the public to the company's emergency response website at www.portnechesresponse.com.
The explosion was the fourth major petrochemical fire in the region this year.
Early on Wednesday morning, people more than 30 miles (48 km) away from the complex were shaken awake by the 1 a.m. CT (0700 GMT) blast, sources familiar with the fire-fighting and rescue operations said.
The blast collapsed a roof over the plant's control room, sending workers fleeing, and damaged its fire-fighting system.
Some homes close to the plant also sustained heavy damage, and police went door-to-door early in the morning to check if residents were injured, said the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled lender Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3) sees its profits likely growing 10% in 2020 from this year, its Chief Financial Officer Carlos Hamilton Araujo said on Thursday in a meeting with analysts.
Banco do Brasil's 2019 profit should reach up to 18.5 billion reais, according to targets set earlier this year.
Next year, net income will be boosted by consumer lending and lower loan loss provision expenses, while fee income will rise in line with inflation, Chief Executive Rubem Novaes said at the same event.
Still, its total loan book is likely to present sluggish growth as corporate loans should decline for another year, as Banco do Brasil sees large companies raising money in capital markets.
Banco do Brasil recently announced a joint-venture with UBS in investment banking, with Rubens saying on Thursday it is likely to start serving customers by June.
Novaes said the central bank's capping of interest rates on overdraft credit at 8% annually will have a negative impact on the bank's profit, but it should not be ""that big.""
On Wednesday, Brazil capped interest rates on overdraft lines, but allowed banks to charge monthly fees for limits extended. 
PAYMENTS PROCESSOR
Banco do Brasil is mulling hiring a consulting firm to review its strategy in the card processing business, which includes a stake in Cielo SA (SA:CIEL3).
Novaes said the bank is not eyeing a sale of its stake in Cielo for now, but that he was not sure if Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4), its partner in Cielo, has the same long-term strategic view for the card processor as it has.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 01:56PM ET</span>",World stocks stall as U.S.-China tensions flare again,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - A four-day rally that had lifted world stocks to near-record highs stalled on Thursday after China said it would retaliate for U.S. legislation backing Hong Kong's protesters, leaving investors concerned as to the extent of the Chinese response.
Fading hopes of a rapprochement between the world's two biggest economies before additional, potentially damaging tariff hikes kick in has lowered risk appetite, pushing the benchmark German 10-year government yield to its lowest since Nov. 1 (DE10YT=RR).
The yen - perceived as a safe-haven currency - ticked up from six-month lows against the U.S. dollar .
A pan-European stocks index retreated from four-year peaks hit earlier in the week, ending 0.1% lower (STOXX), led by the trade-sensitive auto sector, down 0.8% (SXAP) for its worst day in more than a week. 
The U.S. legislation, which threatens sanctions for human rights violations and seeks to safeguard Hong Kong's autonomy, prompted China to warn of ""firm counter measures"".
But fears as to the extent of Chinese retaliation eased during London trading.
""The market is reacting in a cautiously positive way to the fact that we don't have any details of (China's) retaliation,"" said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index in London. 
""I think we'll know more in the coming days and the market is keeping its powder dry for that.""
Meanwhile, China's state council said that it would step up punishment for intellectual property violations - a key sticking point in the U.S.-China conflict - and that it would lower non-tariff trade barriers.
Wall Street's main indexes closed at record levels for a third straight day on Wednesday, albeit in thin liquidity before the Thanksgiving holiday, after data showed U.S. economic growth had picked up in the third quarter and consumer spending had increased. 
Elsewhere, though, the outlook for growth looks less rosy. Japanese retail figures slumped the most since 2015 as a sales tax hike dragged on the economy, exacerbating a slowdown caused by slowing exports and manufacturing.
That took Asian shares excluding Japan down 0.2% (MIAPJ0000PUS). Japan's Nikkei (N225), Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) and Shanghai blue chips <.CSI200> all closed weaker. 
MSCI's world equity was index flat, after it approached the record reached in January 2018. However, the index is up almost 3% so far in November and is on track for the best month since June as investors flit in and out depending on trade war headlines (MIWD00000PUS).
""People don't want to be caught on the wrong side,"" said Geoff Yu, head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management. ""It does reflect there's cash on the sidelines. If you can stretch the positive narrative, if the trade issue is out of the way for the time being, we might actually see a demand pick up.""
U.S. markets are closed for Thanksgiving, but equity futures for all three major indexes were down around 0.1%, having clawed back some earlier losses (ESc1)  (NQc1).
EUROPE AND BRITAIN
Markets' mood improved also after data showed euro zone economic sentiment rebounded more than expected in November. Sentiment in industry, among consumers, and in industry all improved but remain below zero. The euro was little changed by the news.
Data released on Thursday also showed that bank lending to euro zone companies rebounded in October.
The British pound  slipped however, after rising on Wednesday when a model for pollsters YouGov, which accurately predicted the 2017 election, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on course to win a majority in parliament at the Dec. 12 election. 
The pound eased 0.1% to $1.2909 and against the euro it weakened 0.25%, retreating from a near seven-month high at 85 pence (EURGBP=D3).
Implementing Brexit by the end of January, as Johnson promises, would leave him a ""miniscule"" 11 months to agree a trade deal with the European Union, analysts at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) told clients.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies - a British think tank - said that neither of the UK's major parties have credible plans to manage Britain's public finances.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>",Hedge funds control 35-45% of Osram shares in headache for suitor AMS: source,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Hedge funds control 35-45% of the shares of German lighting group Osram (DE:OSRn), posing a headache for Austrian suitor  AMS  (VI:AMS) as the investors may press for the $5 billion offer to be sweetened, a person close to the matter said on Thursday.
An initial bid by AMS to create a global leader in sensors and lights stumbled last month when it fell short of the necessary shareholder backing. Since then AMS has lowered the acceptance threshold to 55% to try to get the deal over the line, while keeping the offer price at 41 euros a share.
Osram Chief Executive Olaf Berlien told German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung that some investors seem to have no intention of tendering their shares by the Dec. 5 deadline.
""It appears that a number of hedge funds have acquired shares with the aim of selling them at a later date and at a higher price,"" he told the newspaper, which first reported the stakes held by hedge funds.
German law allows for courts to determine that minority investors be compensated at a higher price for their shares when an acquirer and a target company strike a so-called domination agreement, which regularly prompts hedge funds to hold back shares aiming to benefit from a deferred sale.
However, if too many speculative investors decide to hold back shares that can lead to deals falling apart, as seen in initial failed attempts for a leveraged buyout of generics firm Stada. That deal eventually went through in 2017 after the offer price was bumped up.
AMS - which already controls 20% of Osram - said on Wednesday that 3.3% of Osram shares have been tendered so far.
On Oct 31, hedge fund Sand Grove Capital Management disclosed a 5.75% Osram stake.
Around 10% of Osram shares are held by exchange-traded funds, which according to German law, are not allowed to sell their stake as long as the takeover is not completed, banking sources have said.
Retail investors, which often ignore tender offers, hold 20%-25%, the sources have said."
726,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 01:47PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Big four auditors face investor calls for tougher climate scrutiny,"By Matthew Green and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - European investors managing assets worth more than 1 trillion pounds ($1.28 trillion) are pressing top auditors to take urgent action on climate-related risks, warning that failure to do so could do more damage than the financial crisis.
The case for tighter auditing has been bolstered by public statements from regulators and accounting watchdogs highlighting the potentially systemic risks that climate change could pose.
In a letter sent in January to the so-called Big Four -- EY, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC -- the investors said they were concerned that climate change was being ""ignored"" in accounting and audits. The letter was seen by Reuters and its contents are being made public for the first time. 
""The overarching thing is that we don't want another financial crisis, and this could be a lot worse,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at asset manager Sarasin & Partners, which is spearheading the campaign by 29 investors.
Auditors are not giving enough weight to a potentially rapid transition towards a low-carbon future as governments implement the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate change, they said.
The investors said they had decided to release the letter as they prepared to broaden their campaign by writing directly to the audit committees of leading oil and gas companies to demand they also take a more robust approach to climate risk.
They want auditors to challenge assumptions about long-term prices for oil and gas, which underpin shareholder returns.
""This time around, we need our auditors to be on the front foot and raise the alarm where executives fail to reflect foreseeable losses or liabilities,"" Landell-Mills told Reuters.
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) said on Thursday that its IFRS standards do address issues related to climate change risk, even if they are not addressed explicitly.
""We would expect management to report on environmental and societal issues to the extent necessary for primary users of financial statements to form their own assessment of the company's longer-term prospects and management's stewardship of the business,"" IASB board member Nick Anderson said.
EY said it was ""committed to ensuring that the audit profession is able to continue to serve the evolving needs of investors, business, and the public interest"".
A spokesperson for Deloitte said it recognized that climate change posed a significant risk for clients and had given all its auditors training this year on how to factor it in.
As well as engaging with stakeholders, Deloitte has launched a climate change website and, with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, a program to educate ICAEW members, finance professionals and non-executive directors.
KPMG and PwC did not respond to emailed requests for comment from Reuters on the letter.
KEY LINES OF DEFENSE
The increased investor scrutiny comes as the role and structure of accountants is reviewed after several collapses, including travel operator Thomas Cook and outsourcer Carillion.
""Auditors are one of the key lines of defense against the risks of capital misallocation, stranded assets and corporate failure,"" Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners for England, said.
For Lara Blecher, of Britain's Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, which signed the letter, audits are still not taking adequate account of climate risk.
""It doesn't bode well if we as investors don't have accurate information on which to act,"" Blecher said.
Deloitte added that companies should be transparent about how climate change was already affecting their businesses and explain how management was taking the potential long-term implications into account in their financial statements.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned in April that markets risked a sudden drop in asset prices if investors failed to take proper account of climate risk, reiterating his concern at a United Nations climate summit in September.
The BoE is also midway through a ""stress test"" on the ability of banks and insurers to withstand the balance sheet impact of rapid climate change.
And Britain's Financial Reporting Council is pushing companies and investors to better reflect climate risk in their accounts and investment decision making.
Ingrid Holmes, head of policy and advocacy at Hermes Investment Management, told Reuters the Big Four accountancy firms needed ""to play their role in helping us to shift the economy onto a more sustainable footing"".

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. apparel and footwear conglomerate VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) and buyout funds Permira and Advent are lining up indicative offers for Italian shoe brand Golden Goose ahead of a mid December deadline, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Golden Goose, owned by private equity fund Carlyle (O:CG), makes luxury sneakers priced at roughly 400 euros ($440) a pair and is being sold as part of an auction process led by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The Venice-based firm, founded in 2000 by designers Francesca Rinaldo and Alessandro Gallo, is valued at up to 1.4 billion euros and has drawn interest from financial investors and some U.S. fashion groups, the sources said.
Owner Carlyle has invited a small group of bidders to submit non-binding offers in mid December - the first step of an auction which is expected to wrap up early next year, the sources said.
A spokesman at Carlyle declined to comment.
Carlyle, which also owns fashion brand Twin Set, wants to ensure the new investor will be able to grow the business despite a poor outlook for luxury companies given the trade war between the United States and China and unrest in Hong Kong causing a slowdown in consumer spending, one of the sources said.
The Washington-based buyout fund aims to receive offers valuing Golden Goose at no less than 1.2 billion euros, representing a multiple of 15 times its core earnings of roughly 80 million euros, a second source said.
Dr Martens owner Permira is seen as a strong contender for the asset given its expertise with luxury brands including Valentino and Hugo Boss which used to be part of its investment portfolio, several sources said.
London-based Permira faces competition from rival investor Advent and a handful of industry players including apparel giant VF Corporation which controls North face, Eastpak, Timberland and Vans among other brands, another source said.
Two other U.S. conglomerates, PVH Corp (N:PVH) and Tapestry (N:TPR), may also decide to enter the bidding race, a fourth source said, cautioning that no deal was certain.
PVH owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger while Tapestry is better known for being the owner of  Coach  and Kate Spade.
Permira declined to comment while Advent, VF Corporation, PVH Corp and Tapestry were not immediately available for comment.
Carlyle bought Golden Goose in 2017 from mid-market investment firm Ergon Capital and went on shaking up its management team and ramping up its presence in the United States and Asia with flagship stores in New York, Tokyo and Beijing.
Led by Chief Executive Silvio Campara, Golden Goose has also expanded its portfolio to include clothing and accessories with a focus on leather goods.

The company, created in 2008 as one founder wanted to give away surplus clothes after moving to a new house, is growing rapidly as the fashion industry comes under growing scrutiny for fuelling a throwaway culture.
In a sign of the times, Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue and one of the most powerful voices in fashion, told Reuters the industry needed to pursue more sustainability and that fashionistas should care for their clothes and pass them on.
Vinted said nearly 1.3 billion euros worth of reused clothing would change hands on its platform this year.
""We are approaching an inflection point in the market for second-hand fashion. Consumers around the world are becoming increasingly conscious of their buying choices,"" Chief Executive Thomas Plantenga said.
Vinted said on Thursday latest funding round had raised 128 million euros, valuing the company at more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). The latest investment was well above the 50 million euros raised in a previous round in August 2018.
U.S.-based venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round, with participation from existing backers such as Sprints Capital, Insight Venture Partners, Accel and Burda Principal Investments.
The funds will be used for further expansion in Europe, as well as for doubling its product and technology teams to 600 people, the company said. It now has 25 million users in 11 European countries including France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands, as well as in the United States.
With Vinted, the Baltic states region of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have spawned a third of all tech unicorns ever created in central and eastern Europe, such as ride-sharing service Bolt and money transfer company TransferWise, according to a November 2019 report by investment tracking firm Dealroom.co.

LONDON (Reuters) - Up to five companies active in the cannabis industry could go public in 2020 in Europe, a continent whose stock markets have largely missed out on the North-American ""pot stocks"" frenzy, a leading industry analyst said on Thursday.
The legalization of cannabis, including for recreational use in Canada and a number of U.S. states, fueled a speculative ""green rush"" on Toronto and New York stock markets in early 2019, but this has faltered due to oversupply fears and uncertainties on U.S. regulations.
Shares in the sector are down more than 50% from their March highs, according to the alternative harvest ETF fund (P:MJ), which tracks cannabis-related stocks. 
""I think there will be 4 or 5 companies quoted in twelve months time"", Nikolaas Faes, an analysts for Bryan Garnier told Reuters on the sidelines of a cannabis industry conference.
Bryan Garnier and its competitor Canaccord Genuity are among the few investment houses actively seeking to become key players in the fast-growing industry and win mandates to advise on merger and acquisitions or rights issues. 
There has been speculation that London-based medicinal cannabis company Emmac could go public. In 2019, Emmac took over GreenLeaf, a French hemp-based and cannabis healthcare company and Swiss cannabis-based health company Blossom.
A spokesman for Emmac said an IPO remained an option but no longer for the current calendar year.
Listings of cannabis firms in Europe are very rare and currently limited to the small capitalization segment. 
Public offerings are made difficult due to a patchwork of regulations and policies regarding the medical and recreational use of cannabis, including CBD, a derivative of the plant reputed to ease anxiety without the high associated with THC, the main psychoactive agent in marijuana. 
Faes argues that London's lightly regulated AIM is a market place of choice for such listings. 
""I think that AIM is doing great efforts to attract some of those companies"", he said. 

AIM declined to comment.

The measures, outlined in a document seen by Reuters, are part of a new industrial strategy due to be announced by Economy Minister Peter Altmaier on Friday.
While China is not mentioned in the document, German and European Union officials have repeatedly said they want a fair playing field with China, which they accuse of shielding its own companies from foreign investors.
""The economy ministry has worked out a further amendment to the law under which we will extend the screening possibilities and define a catalogue of critical technologies,"" the document seen by Reuters said.
""The government must be able to take a closer look, for example, if national security interests are affected by foreign investments,"" the paper said.
Under the new rules, investors in sectors including artificial intelligence, robotics, semi-conductors, biotechnology and quantum technology would have to make public any purchases of 10% or more and allow Germany to check them.
Previously, only investments in critical infrastructure, such as energy, water, telecommunications and defense could be screened. Last year, the government dropped the investment threshold for those sectors to 10% from 25%.
The German move comes at a time the EU as a whole is reconsidering the bloc's industrial strategy and relations to China in the face of increased investment in critical sectors by Chinese state-owned enterprises.
German officials have described the Chinese takeover in 2016 of Bavarian robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) as a wake-up call that underlined the need to shield strategic parts of the economy.
An attempt by China's State Grid in 2018 to buy a stake in power grid operator 50Hertz also focused German minds. After Berlin failed to find an alternative private investor in Europe, German state-owned bank KfW stepped in to keep the Chinese out."

SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) - Louis Dreyfus Company is making sweeping cost cuts, starting with travel, entertainment, hiring and salaries, as the 168-year-old agricultural commodities firm tries to revive dwindling profits.
Global trade tensions and the African Swine Fever epidemic in Asia have piled pressure on grain trading firms as they try to emerge from a period of falling margins. Family-owned LDC, known as Dreyfus, is the ""D"" of the ‘ABCD’ quartet of global traders that also includes Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM),  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) and Cargill Inc. 
LDC said an in an internal memo seen by Reuters that five senior executives would lead a review to achieve ""cost and productivity gains"".
The group is also introducing temporary ""measures on travel and entertainment, hiring and salary restrictions"", the memo, which was sent to employees on Wednesday, said.
A spokeswoman confirmed the plan in an email, saying LDC aimed to optimize its cost base in a challenging external environment. 
LDC said last month that international trade tensions and the spread of a deadly pig disease in China would continue to weigh on profit. It paid out a $428 million dividend- the highest since 2014 - even as first-half earnings slid. 
Losses at Brazilian sugar and ethanol unit Biosev SA (SA:BSEV3) and an acrimonious buyout of minority family interests by its main shareholder and chairwoman Margarita Louis-Dreyfus have taken their toll on LDC.
The company said this year it may look at selling a stake to a regional player, adding to speculation about consolidation after takeover approaches for U.S.-based Bunge.
Diversified commodity group  Glencore  (L:GLEN) made an approach for Bunge two years ago and has said the sector needs consolidating.
COFCO International, the trading arm of Chinese-owned food group COFCO, has also been seen as a potential bidder for other trading firms as it seeks to continue expanding overseas.
LDC has been subject to speculation since Louis-Dreyfus took control in 2009, with the chairwoman at times raising the possibility of a merger or a market listing.
MANAGEMENT RESHUFFLE
Like its peers, LDC has restructured operations, exiting activities including dairy and metals trading while focusing more on food processing, notably in Asia. 
The firm has awarded dividends of up to 50% of net profits as Russian-born Louis-Dreyfus has taken on additional debt to acquire minority shares for more than $800 million and support a $1 billion rescue plan for Biosev. 
LDC has also been through a series of CEO changes and other management reshuffles since Louis-Dreyfus assumed control of the group following the death of her late husband Robert, whose family founded the company.
This month LDC appointed former head of coffee Michael Gelchie as its new chief operating officer, while promoting Ben Clarkson to be its new coffee head. 
LDC has also changed the roles of two other senior executives, its website showed. 
Anthony Tancredi, formerly in charge of grains and co-head of the recently merged grain and oilseeds division, has been named to a new position of senior advisor.
Andre Roth has taken sole responsibility for grains and oilseeds after previously heading the oilseed side. 
Gelchie and Roth are part of the five-strong group leading the cost review and signed the memo to staff, which said LDC's strategy would not change as it ""aims to increase revenue today and for the future"".

The other participants are Chief Financial Officer Federico Cerisoli, Global Head of Risk and Compliance Nigel Mamalis, and Murilo Parada, who heads the juice division and North Latin America zone.

The Florence-based group, founded by designer Roberto Cavalli in the early 1970s and famed for its animal prints, had been struggling for years to relaunch its sales and gain visibility in an industry that is increasingly dominated by large cash-rich conglomerates.
Damac's Sajwani bought Cavalli through his private investment company Vision Investments, part of the DICO Group, which owns luxury resorts and hotels and shopping malls, a statement said.
DICO Group said the deal was a significant step in the group's strategy and was an evolution of a partnership signed back in 2017, under which Cavalli would develop the interiors for some luxury hotels.
DICO said it would ensure the stability of Cavalli's management.
Italian private equity firm Clessidra took over Cavalli in 2015 in a bid to turn it around, but after two years started looking for a new investor as the fund holding the stake was close to its statutory investment limit and there was no sign of a recovery by the group, sources said at the time.
In March, the fashion house asked for creditor protection in order to make the sale process easier and it later entered a debt restructuring agreement.
In June, five potential investors emerged to rescue the fashion house, including Dubai's Damac, Italy's Diesel-owner OTB and U.S. brand management company Bluestar Alliance, sources said."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis's (S:NOVN) new $90 million cell and gene therapy factory in northern Switzerland is on track to begin commercial production of treatments, including Kymriah for cancer and Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy, in 2020.
The new gene and cell therapy factory, expected to employ 450 people, will allow the drugmaker to make its Kymriah treatment for European patients without first having to fly their immune cells across the Atlantic Ocean.
The Swiss factory, as well as a separate French site also being expanded, are central to Novartis's plans to transform Kymriah from a modest $250 million-per-year seller into a $1 billion blockbuster as European demand rises.
""We have already started to produce clinical batches at both sites and are on track to begin producing commercial product in 2020,""  Novartis  said.
Basel-based Novartis sees cell and gene therapies eventually contributing about 15% of its revenue.
T cells currently harvested from Europeans getting the $400,000-per-patient Kymriah blood cancer therapy currently must be sent to a U.S. laboratory for re-engineering. Analysts have called the lack of manufacturing capacity a ""major bottleneck"".
Novartis is investing some $500 million in new facilities around the world to address production bottlenecks and drug companies including Novartis,  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and others, have plans to spend $2 billion building out gene and cell therapy manufacturing after rapid expansion into these treatments.
Novartis will also make Zolgensma at the Swiss and French factories, a $2.1 million-per-patient spinal muscular atrophy gene therapy awaiting European and Japanese approval.
Kymriah's global rollout in 20 countries, plus Novartis's efforts to expand the therapy's indications, make adding commercial production a priority, including in China and Japan.
Kymriah's 2018 approval was hailed as a breakthrough as a last-ditch treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. T-cells are extracted from patients, modified to attack their cancer, then re-infused in the hope they work where other treatments failed.
But its complex production, tailor-made for each patient, poses logistical challenges compared to off-the-shelf treatments, especially in Europe where Novartis lacked commercial manufacturing.
""The key factor in bringing local manufacturing to each region is to make Kymriah available as quickly as possible,"" Novartis said."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. holiday shopping period kicking off on Friday may heighten Wall Street's perception of a growing divide between retailers adapting to online sales and those unable to shake their reliance on dwindling shopping mall traffic.
On one side are companies including  Target  (N:TGT), Costco (O:COST) and  Best Buy  (N:BBY), which have bulked up their online presence, deliveries and fast in-store pickups attractive to customers and have seen their stocks outperform. Also among the winners are shares of Ross Stores (O:ROST) and TJX Companies (N:TJX) - apparel discounters offering consumers attractive value.
At the other end of the divide, GAP (N:GPS), Victoria Secret-owner L Brands (N:LB) and department stores Macy's (N:M) and Kohl's (N:KSS) have slumped as those one-time mall powerhouses struggle to successfully revamp their products and locations and keep customers visiting.
The first weekend after Thanksgiving can be make-or-break for retailers strategizing over how much and when to discount their products throughout a hyper-competitive month-long shopping season.
Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea offers advice for investors visiting malls in the week following Thanksgiving to look for potential winners and losers.
""Promotions on Tuesday are a sign of desperation,"" O'Shea said. ""It means somebody missed the weekend, they have to clear stuff out, and their cadence is off. And if they go the other way, it means they had a good weekend and they can take their foot off the gas.""
Supported by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, consumer spending has helped insulate the economy from the White House's 16-month trade war with China. But the Commerce Department's report on October retail sales suggests consumer spending is slowing faster than economists expected.
Weaker spending could mean less of a cushion to retailers, which would particularly hurt those stores that are already struggling.
Adding to difficulties, retailers have been scrambling to cut costs and find ways to minimize the damage to their bottom lines from tariffs already levied on $250 billion Chinese imports and upcoming tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese imports.
""The stores that are not going to do so well are the ones with a middle of the road proposition. The ones that aren't overly expensive but are also not great value."" warned Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail.
Such stores at risk include GAP Inc, Macy's, JC Penney (N:JCP) and  Express Inc  (K:EXPR), Saunders said.
Shares of Nordstrom (N:JWN), GAP and Kohl's are down by between 18% and 35% in 2019 as they fight to compete against big-box rivals and Amazon.com.
Quarterly reports last week underscored the retail industry's haves and have-nots, with Target surging record highs after it raised its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday, and department stores Macy's and Kohl's cutting their outlooks ahead of the holiday season.
Recent quarterly reports show ""mall-based"" retailers' earnings tumbling 17%, with ""off-mall"" retailers increasing their earnings by 7%, Retail Metrics said in a recent report.
""Size and scale matter to drive crucial investments in store remodels, digital channel upgrades, supply chain, and next-day, same-day delivery capabilities,"" according to Retail Metrics.     
Macy's has lost half of its value this year, the poorest performance among S&P 500 retailers. Showing how little investors expect Macy's to recover, its stock last month traded at as low as 5.6 times expected earnings, its lowest earnings multiple ever, according to Refinitiv.
However, overall stock performance for the retail sector has almost kept up with the broader market's rally, even as investors worry that the cost of increasingly generous shipping offers from Walmart (N:WMT), Amazon (O:AMZN), Target, Best Buy and others will eat into their profits.
The S&P 500 Retailing index is up 20% for the year, compared to the S&P 500's 24% rise. Meanwhile, investors betting Amazon's domination of the retail industry would completely devastate its competitors have been burned. The ProShares Decline of the Retail Store ETF (K:EMTY), which shorts an index of brick-and-mortar store chains, has lost 3% this year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is not liable for unwittingly stocking trade mark infringing goods for third-party sellers, but should be diligent in checking whether products are legal, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday.
The adviser was giving his opinion on a case that pits Amazon against U.S. cosmetics company Coty.
The dispute is one of the many battles between luxury goods companies seeking to preserve their exclusivity and branding and online platforms such as Amazon and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) fighting against online sales curbs.
It also raises the question of the scope of online platforms' responsibility for products sold, or content transmitted, on their sites.
The opinion from Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), came in a case involving Coty's German subsidiary, which took Amazon to a German court for stocking Coty's Davidoff perfume for third party sellers.
Coty said such practices violate its trade mark rights and that Amazon should be liable for stocking trade mark infringing goods. The German court subsequently sought guidance from the CJEU.
Companies which are not aware of trade mark infringements cannot be held responsible for storing such products for third party sellers, Campos Sanchez-Bordona said.
However, if they are actively involved in distributing the goods and if they operate a scheme like Amazon's, then they should show diligence in checking the legality of goods sold on their platforms, he said. 
Under a scheme called ""Fulfilled by Amazon"", the U.S. online retail giant stores and delivers goods for third-party sellers, one of the key features of its business model. 
Companies cannot simply absolve themselves of responsibility and should be aware that without this control, they can serve as a channel for the sale of illegal, counterfeit, stolen or unethical products, Campos Sanchez-Bordona said.
Amazon said it took steps to combat illegal products on its platform.
""Amazon continues to invest heavily in fighting bad actors on our store and is committed to driving counterfeits to zero. Courts have ruled in our favor in the first two instances of this proceeding, and we are now awaiting preliminary legal clarification from the CJEU,"" the company said.
The Luxembourg-based court, which follows such non-binding recommendations in the majority of cases, would normally give a ruling in the next two to four months. 
Coty did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The case is C-567/18 Coty Germany.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong is set to welcome its first listing of a real estate investment trust in five years, with the China Merchants Commercial REIT seeking to raise up to $400 million.
The REIT, which owns five commercial and office properties in Shenzhen, wants to expand in the Greater Bay Area which has a population of about 70 million and includes Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong province.
It plans to issue 750 million units priced between HK$3.42 and HK$4 each, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters. That would raise $330 million to $380 million.
A greenshoe option of 5% of units outstanding could lift the deal value to $400 million. At the top end of the range and including the greenshoe, the REIT would have a market value of around $575 million.
Singapore has long been seen the Asian hub for REITs, and Hong Kong has just 11 listed. The last Hong Kong REIT listing was December 2014, when Dalian Wanda raised $4 billion which was the largest on record for the city, according to data from Refinitiv.
China Merchants Commercial REIT executives started briefing investors in Hong Kong on Thursday and will shift to Singapore on Friday ahead of the deal progressing next week.
Sumeet Singh, head of research and IPOs at research firm Aequitas, also said Hong Kong investors tended to prefer bigger fry.
""Hong Kong has always been a growth market, with investors looking for the next Tencent, Meituan or now even  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA). A REIT is just not as exciting in terms of future prospects,"" he said in research published on the Smartkarma platform.
The China Merchants REIT bookbuild started on Thursday and the units are expected to be priced on Tuesday, with trade due to start on Dec. 10. The deal was first proposed in September and put on hold while financial market sentiment improved.
Hong Kong's IPO market has seen $21.8 billion raised so far this year, on par with the New York Stock Exchange and just behind the Nasdaq's $23.6 billion.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) is leading the deal as the sole listing agent and is the joint global co-ordinator alongside China Merchant Securities and DBS."

The state oil giant plans to sell a 1.5% stake, or about 3 billion shares, and has said at least one-third of the sale is expected to be covered by retail investors, who have until Thursday to sign up.
With an indicative price of 30-32 riyals, the IPO is valued at as much as 96 billion riyals ($25.6 billion) and gives the firm a market value of $1.6-$1.7 trillion.
It will be the world's biggest IPO if it tops the $25 billion set by China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in 2014.
Around 4.17 million retail investors had subscribed to 1.19 billion shares by 12 p.m. on Thursday, injecting 6.13 billion riyals above the amount needed for full coverage, Samba said.
Subscription will continue until midnight on Thursday and final results will be announced on Friday, it said in a statement.
The IPO is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from its reliance on oil.
Aramco is the crown jewel of the economy and the world's most profitable company.
It is relying on local and regional demand to pull off the deal, after cancelling marketing roadshows outside the Gulf region due to a lack of interest from foreign institutional investors.
Sources told Reuters this week that the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Kuwait plan to invest.
Saudis have been eager to buy shares, with many seeking to invest on behalf of their dependents to increase the number of shares they can buy.
The government has encouraged rich Saudis to invest, with many viewing it as an opportunity to show their patriotism after a September attack on Aramco facilities that struck at the heart of the kingdom's energy industry.
Washington and Riyadh blamed regional rival Iran for the attacks, which temporarily cut more than 5% of global oil supply. Tehran denied any involvement."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Axel Springer's (DE:SPRGn) price-comparison shopping service Idealo and 40 other European peers have accused Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) of tilting the playing field in its favor and urged EU antitrust regulators to enforce a ruling against the company. 
The joint call by the group ratchets up pressure on European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to take further action against Google, the world's most popular internet search engine, two years after she ordered it to stop favoring its own price comparison shopping service (CSS).
The companies, the largest group to take a stand against Google to date, in a joint letter to Vestager seen by Reuters on Thursday said that the U.S. web giant had yet to comply with the 2017 order. Google was also fined 2.4 billion euros ($2.65 billion) at the time.
The signatories to the letter are from 21 EU countries and include Idealo, Europe's second largest price comparison shopping service, Polish No. 1 Ceneo, Britain's Kelkoo, and Foundem and Heureka in the Czech Republic.
""We are approaching you (Vestager) because companies like ours are endangered by Google, which is artfully avoiding compliance with the law,"" the companies wrote.
They said Google's proposal to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page had not boosted traffic to their sites. 
""As a result, more and more CSS' have been or will be forced by Google to exit the market.""
Google said it was seeing positive results from its ""shopping remedies"" and more merchants were gaining traffic.
""Over 28,000 merchants in Europe are currently placing shopping ads through these third-party Comparison Shopping Services, leading to more choice for merchants and consumers,"" Google said. 
The European Commission confirmed receipt of the letter, which did not mention any specific solutions sought by the group, and said it was monitoring the situation.
Some 600 companies now take part in auctions for search page advertising space, Google senior executive Oliver Bethell told an Informa conference earlier this week, saying it proved the auctions had boosted competition.
Thomas Hoppner, a lawyer for Idealo said most of the signatories were voicing their frustrations for the first time.
""The letter demonstrates a united front of genuine comparison shopping services against Google's attempt to present measures as a ""compliance mechanism"","" he said.

Earlier this month, Vestager voiced concerns about the lack of significant traffic to Google's competitors, rowing back on previous comments about the positive impact of the auctions.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Luxury brands are likely to retreat from Hong Kong as the city is wracked by protests at a time when wealthy Chinese shoppers are staying on the mainland, consultancy Bain said on Thursday, highlighting a shift that is reshaping the global industry.
Sales growth for companies making goods like jewelry, high-end fashion or handbags would come in at the low end of its expectations in 2019 due to the Hong Kong turmoil, according to Bain, which produces closely-followed forecasts for the sector.
Global luxury goods sales were on course to expand to 281 billion euros ($310 billion) in 2019, its study showed, growing 4% at constant currencies, at the bottom end of its previous 4% to 6% forecast and down from 6% growth last year.
The Hong Kong pro-democracy protests weighed on third-quarter sales growth at firms from Cartier owner  Richemont  (S:CFR) to Germany's  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn), as the flow of visitors dwindled and retailers closed shop temporarily.
Luxury brands, which have around 1,000 stores in the Asian shopping hub, are likely to start shutting some permanently, Bain said.
""Local customers cannot sustain the 1,000 stores in the mid-term,"" said Federica Levato, a partner at Bain in Milan.
Luxury sales in Hong Kong, which hit a peak of 10 billion euros in 2013, are likely to drop to 6 billion in 2019, Bain said. This would mean the city that once accounted for around 5% of global sales is now closer to 2%.
And while the demonstrations might be a temporary disruption, a more structural shift is at play in the shopping habits of well-off customers from the Chinese mainland whose Hong Kong spending have long been buttressed sector sales.
Despite China's economic slowdown, shoppers are continuing to spend heavily on luxury - but they are increasingly staying at home because of a weaker yuan currency that has blunted their overseas firepower. Meanwhile Beijing has cut import duties and sales tax, eroding the competitive price advantage of foreign destinations like Hong Kong, London and New York.
Chinese shoppers now making up 35% of all industry sales - and they are on course to account for 90% of growth in the market this year, Bain said.
""They are willing to go on credit to buy luxury goods,"" said Levato. ""For the moment we don't see a true economic risk linked to China.""
In another significant trend for global luxury, Bain said jewelry sales were on track to grow by 9% at constant currencies in 2019, making this one of the fastest-growing pockets of the industry - and highlighting a major driver for LVMH's $16.2 billion takeover of Tiffany. "

LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (L:BARC) is planning to cut the 396,000 pounds ($508,068) pension allowance it pays Chief Executive Jes Staley by around half, echoing moves by rivals who have pledged to rein in executive pension perks following a campaign by investors.
The British lender is consulting shareholders on the proposal in a review of its remuneration policy to be voted on at the bank's annual meeting next year, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
The possible changes follow protests from investors and employee unions over the disparity between pension payouts offered to Britain's top bank bosses and their staff.
HSBC (L:HSBA) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) have pledged to set pension contributions paid to their CEOs at 10% of base salary, matching those paid to their wider workforces.
Barclays is looking to boost typical pension contributions paid to employees from 10% to 12.5%, the source added.
But Staley's new cash payment would equate to around 17% of the 1.18 million pound annual salary he was paid last year, suggesting Barclays is stopping short of full harmonization, risking further investor dissent and scrutiny from policymakers.
""It's a start but these cuts do not really go far enough. There's no real reason why CEO pension payments shouldn't be completely in line with other staff,"" Peter Parry, policy director at investor group ShareSoc told Reuters.
""There is always a worry that when companies rein in pay in one area, they compensate for it in another area. The sad thing is that executive pay is now out of control,"" he said.
 Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) still plans to pay its top two executives double the pension benefits it pays to general staff.
Earlier this month it said it would reduce the payouts to CEO Bill Winters and Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford from 20% to 10% of total salary, which includes both base pay and a fixed pay allowance paid in shares.
But as a proportion of base salary alone, the benefit falls from 40% to 20%, compared with 10% for its staff.
The changes mean that Winters' pension allowance in 2020 will drop to 237,000 pounds and Halford's to 147,000 pounds.
Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) plans to cut the pension allowance paid to its Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio by 228,000 pounds, a source familiar with the situation said.
Horta-Osorio, the longest-serving of Britain's top banking bosses, pocketed a contribution of around 419,000 pounds this year, equating to 33% of his 1.27 million pounds base salary.
The cut would see his allowance as a percentage of base salary drop to 15%, in line with the maximum contribution the bank plans to offer other staff from 2020.
Horta-Osorio was the sector's best-paid CEO in 2018, earning a 6.3 million pounds compensation package.
Santander (MC:SAN) UK is now the only major UK lender yet to reform its generous executive pension arrangements.
Its Chief Executive Nathan Bostock takes home a pension allowance equivalent to 35% of his base pay. The arrangements are under review, a source close to the matter said.
At 3.4 million pounds, Staley's total remuneration package at Barclays for 2018 - which also included a share-based payment of 1.2 million pounds and a 1.1 million pounds bonus - was the lowest among Britain's bank bosses.
Staley's proposed pension allowance cut was first reported by the Financial Times."

The sale is part of Panasonic's plans to cut fixed costs by 100 billion yen ($920 million) by the year ending in March 2022 by consolidating production sites and overhauling loss-making businesses.
Panasonic has already divested most of its chip business as it lost to more nimble Korean and Taiwanese rivals, and has shut down or shifted its manufacturing facilities to its joint venture (JV) with Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TA:TSEM).
Its semiconductor unit currently focuses on designing power-management chips and sensors for smartphones, cars and security cameras. It sold part of the power management chip business to Japan's Rohm Co (T:6963) this month.
The latest deal includes the sale of the entire JV, which is owned 51% by Tower and 49% by the Panasonic chip unit. The JV operates three Japanese chipmaking facilities. 
Panasonic said the sale will not have any significant impact on its earnings. The value of the deal that Panasonic has announced excludes the amount Nuvoton would pay for Tower Semiconductor's stake in the joint venture.
Nuvoton said in a statement the all-cash transaction was expected to close by June 2020, and would ""increase Nuvoton's presence in the global semiconductor industry through greater scale and volume of semiconductor solutions"".
Nuvoton, which was spun off from  Winbond  Electronics Corp (TW:2344) in 2008, supplies chips for electronic devices including computers and audio products.
Panasonic has turned its focus away from low-margin consumer electronics and bet on businesses that sell to automakers, as well as to corporations such as factory-owners and firms that automate processes.

But the shift has failed to lift profit at a time when the U.S.-China trade war has hit industrial purchases and output, and the global car market is contracting.

Investing.com -- It’s four and a half years since the Euro Stoxx 600 index hit its all-time high of 415.81. In that time, the U.S. S&P 500 has risen over 50%, despite the ups and downs of the trade war with China. The Stoxx 600 has largely missed out on the rallies but always participated wholeheartedly in the sell-offs.
Even now, those waiting for a new all-time high are probably going to have to wait at least until the weekend.
Europe’s benchmark index closed within 1% of a new ATH on Wednesday but slipped 0.2% to 408.92 by 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT) on Thursday, after the latest twist in U.S.-China relations that once again underlined how much in thrall European markets are to developments outside their control.
Trump signed into law the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on Wednesday at a moment when the U.S. public’s attention was firmly on the approaching Thanksgiving holiday. However, it didn’t escape Beijing’s attention, and the Chinese government renewed their condemnation of a bill that uses the threat of trade measures to ensure Beijing upholds the political autonomy of Hong Kong.
Beijing also promised countermeasures of its own, but took no immediate action, nor did it give it any details of what it is considering.
This week’s data have suggested that the U.S. is coping with the strain of the trade war better than China: durable goods orders, jobless claims and a revised estimate for third-quarter GDP were all stronger than expected on Wednesday, while China reported that industrial profits fell 9.9% on the year – the sharpest decline since it started compiling that data series in 2011. The overall picture masked an even steeper decline at trade-sensitive sectors such as textiles and chemicals.
  Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) strategist Ulrich Stephan said Wednesday’s rise in bond yields and cyclical stocks was “a development that can quite easily continue.”
By 1120 GMT, all of Europe’s major markets were down. The midcap FTSE 250 stood out with a 0.2% gain after an opinion poll predicting a healthy majority for the Conservative Party at next month’s election lifted the index’s mainly domestic-focused stocks. Among the FTSE 100, asset managers St. James’s Place (LON:SJP) and   Hargreaves   Lansdown (LON:HRGV) led gains, anticipating a big increase in U.K. investor confidence next year.
The FTSE 100’s international earners suffered due to the accompanying rise in sterling. Worst hit of all was   Vodafone   (LON:VOD), after the Indian Supreme Court ruled it must pay $3.9 billion more in network fees to the government. The ruling will make it hard both for Vodafone and its competitors to survive in India without government relief."

The subscription reached 32.6 billion riyals ($8.7 billion), lead manager Samba Capital said in statement. A third of what’s likely to be the world’s largest share sale has been reserved for retail investors, who’ve been targeted by a country-wide advertising campaign and offered larger-than usual loans to finance purchases.
There may be a last-minute surge before today’s final deadline for applications, but so far the share sale hasn’t been as well subscribed as some other IPOs in the counrty. The book for National Commercial Bank’s 2014 Initial public offering was covered 23 times over. In 2006, 10 million Saudis, about half the kingdom’s adult population, applied to buy shares in the local unit of the Middle East’s biggest property develop, Emaar Properties PJSC.
The Saudi government plans to raise more than $25 billion by selling a 1.5% stake in the company at a valuation of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion. Of that, 1% is earmarked for institutional investors and the rest for Saudi retail buyers.
The Aramco IPO, a central element in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman‘s plan to modernize the kingdom’s economy, will rely almost exclusively on local money after international investors balked at the valuation. Many of the richest Saudi families have been pressed to invest, including some who had members held in the Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel during the corruption crackdown in 2017.
Aramco is still seeking to drum up support from institutional investors in the region, making pitches in Dubai and Abu Dhabi this week. Abu Dhabi plans to put as much as $1.5 billion into the offering, while the Kuwait Investment Authority is considering a potential investment, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Institutional book-building closes on Dec. 4, before the IPO’s final pricing the next day.
Earlier this week, Samba said the institutional tranche of the IPO was already 90% covered.
The banking system is also being used to boost demand. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority is allowing smaller retail investors to borrow twice their cash investment, double the leverage limits the regulator normally permits for IPOs. Some Saudi companies paid employees early to free up cash to spend on shares.​
Some retails investors may end up investing in the institutional offering through the special purpose vehicles offered by local banks, according to people familiar with the matter, asking not be identified before the deal is completed.
Proceeds from the sale will be transferred to the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, which has been making a number of a bold investments, plowing $45 billion into SoftBank Corp.’s Vision Fund, taking a $3.5 billion stake in Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and planning a $500 billion futuristic city.

755,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 03:41AM ET</span>","After $13 billion levy ruling, future of India's tattered telecom sector hinges on government aid","By Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government's win of a long-contested dispute over telecom fees could end up a Pyrrhic victory, as the billions of dollars in levies now owed are seen as burdens too big to bear for two of the country's three main carriers.
 Vodafone  Idea Ltd (NS:VODA), India's biggest carrier by user numbers, is widely regarded as most on the ropes, with parent Vodafone Group (L:VOD) calling the situation ""critical"" after the unit was saddled with about $3.9 billion in fresh payments due.
That is the biggest portion of the $13 billion incurred by the sector after India's Supreme Court last month sided with the government in how spectrum usage and license fees are calculated.
 Bharti Airtel  (NS:BRTI), the No. 3 provider which must pay roughly $3 billion under the ruling, has also flagged distress, saying the decision casts much doubt on ""its ability to continue as a going concern."" 
To industry executives and analysts alike, there's only one solution for the sector which was even before the current crisis debt-ridden and battered by a brutal price war: significant government financial support.
Hopes have been raised after the government deferred upcoming spectrum payments for the next two financial years until March 2022. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also said this month that relief is under consideration although no final call had been made.
""If the government does provide some measures, there is still some chance for (Vodafone Idea) to continue as a going concern. It all depends on what kind of relief measures the company will get,"" said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities.
He said he expects the company to survive as it is in the government's interest to have three main players to ensure sufficient competition in the sector.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel did not respond to requests for comment. Vodafone Group declined to comment.
ENTREATIES MADE
Vodafone Idea this month booked a $7 billion quarterly loss, the biggest in Indian corporate history, in large part due to provisions for payments owed. Parent Vodafone has also laid its case on the line: writing down the value of its 44% stake in the unit to zero and vowing it will not commit more equity to India.
In addition to the two-year moratorium, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel are asking the government for cuts to license fees and taxes, as well as waivers for interest and penalties.
Mobile carriers have also petitioned the Supreme Court to review its ruling, although lawyers say chances of that happening are slim.
But even if the government obliges with generous financial waivers, analysts note Vodafone Idea would still be deeply troubled.
Hurt by the price war that began with the 2016 entry into the market of Jio, a unit of deep-pocketed  Reliance Industries  Ltd (NS:RELI), Vodafone Idea has net debt of $14.2 billion, six times its market capitalization and four times its cash holdings. 
While the price war appears to have ended with all three main carriers - who serve 90% of the market - planning to lift user fees next month, Vodafone Idea has not yet stopped losing subscribers. The latest data, for September, showed a net loss of 2.6 million customers.
""If Vodafone Idea doesn't have enough customers left, it is going to be very difficult for it to remain solvent,"" said Vivekanand Subbaraman, an analyst at Ambit Capital.
Bharti Airtel has more debt, with net levels at around $16 billion. But unlike Vodafone Idea, analysts say if push came to shove, the company could consider selling assets to meet its obligations as it controls telecom tower firm Bharti Infratel (NS:BHRI).
DUOPOLY DANGER
If in a worse case scenario Vodafone Idea were to fail, customer options would dramatically shrink and the networks of the two remaining major carriers would be further overloaded, exacerbating patchy coverage and call drops common in India.
""There's bound to be more congestion, there is going to be further deterioration in quality,"" said T.V. Ramachandran, president of Broadband India Forum.
It would also represent a huge setback to India's push to make government services accessible to hundreds of millions of Indians via the internet.
Any exit would hurt telecom gear makers such as Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA), Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and China's Huawei Technologies and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063), industry executives said.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea use equipment and services from all of these vendors, unlike Reliance's Jio, whose network has been built largely by a unit of South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
The current turmoil in the sector is also likely to further dampen interest in an auction of 5G airwaves expected before end-March. All three firms have warned the base price set by the government is too high given that India's user fees are among the cheapest in the world.
""Even otherwise, the 5G auction did not look very bright,"" said Broadband India Forum's Ramachandran.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Business owners and major shareholders are selling down their stakes in listed companies, producing a glut of shares in a market already under pressure from a slowing economy and the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
The new supply comes as the three-year mandatory lock-in after an initial listing expires for scores of companies that had initial public offerings (IPO) in 2016 and 2017, freeing promoters to reduce their holdings.
Analysts estimate that these major shareholders would collectively sell a net of about 240 billion yuan ($34.10 billion) worth of A-shares in 2019.
That's just short of the 270 billion yuan foreign investors have spent so far this year purchasing shares via the Stock Connect scheme, the main channel for foreign investors participating in the country's 55 trillion yuan equity market.

The increase in selldowns is due to the huge number of IPOs three years ago, right after a four-month ban on new stock market listings China imposed in order to stem a chaotic slide during the market crash in 2015.

An average of 300 billion yuan worth of A-shares came onto the market each month since April as lock-up periods expired, up substantially from 170 billion yuan monthly average seen between August 2018 and March 2019, according to a report by research firm Caixin Insight CEBM.
The lifting of the three-year lock-up period is expected to bring the A-share market under increasing pressure as more stock hits the market.
The retreat by key shareholders comes as Beijing further opens its financial markets and international index providers lift weightings of China's onshore equity market, prompting foreign investors to boost their China investments. 
Those divestments by investors and founding sponsors that have intimate knowledge of the listed businesses have already started to put a dent on stock prices of market bellwethers. 
Shares in Shenzhen Goodix Technology (SS:603160), a supplier to both Chinese tech giant Huawei [HWT.UL] and Apple (O:AAPL), plummeted 9.9% on Monday as its second largest shareholder announced a share cut. The firm's second-largest shareholder, which had already lowered its holdings to 11.85% in November from 15.30% at end-2018, said last week it could unload as much as 5% more within 6 months.
​Stake sales also appeared to have thwarted a robust rally in  WuXi AppTec  (SS:603259), a leading Chinese medical tech platform with heavy foreign holdings.

759,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 02:13AM ET</span>",Drugmakers slash prices in China to get on reimbursement list,"By Roxanne Liu and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Drugmakers including Roche (S:ROG) and Novartis' (S:NOVN) have agreed to cut the prices of some of their newest drugs by an average of 61% in China in order to get on a national reimbursement scheme list, regulators said.
Addition to the list is likely to boost sales volume by opening up markets in smaller and less-affluent Chinese cities, but some industry insiders have cautioned that only offering deep price cuts in China could spark criticism of the drugmakers in other markets.
Seventy new drugs such as Roche's (S:ROG) breast cancer treatment Pertuzumab, sold under the trade name Perjeta, Novartis's (S:NOVN) dermatitis treatment Omalizumab, branded as Xolair, will be added to the list, the National Healthcare Security Administration said on its website on Thursday.
Chinese patients are allowed to use their state medical insurance to cover a significant portion of the cost of drugs named on the list.
Almost all the imported drugs added to the list in the latest update had the ""lowest prices globally"", the NHSA said in its statement.
""China is and will be the ultimate high-volume, low-price market, and so international companies feel that they'll have to take a big pay cut but make up for the volume,"" Brad Loncar, chief executive of biopharma sector-dedicated Loncar Investments, told Reuters.
Tumor and diabetes medicines saw an average price cut of about 65%, according to the NHSA.
Other drugs added included Adalimumab, an arthritis treatment which AbbVie (N:ABBV) sells as Humira, one the top-selling drugs in the world.
Also included was cancer treatment Tyvyt, or Sintilimab, co-developed by Chinese drugmaker Innovent Biologics (HK:1801) and Eli Lilly (N:LLY). It is considered to be a PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, a category of novel drugs that work on the immune system to fight cancer cells.
China has already approved five PD-1/PD-L1 treatments, including two top-selling global blockbusters made by foreign firms Bristol-Myers Squibb (N:BMY) and Merck (N:MRK). However neither have been added to the list.
Analysts say domestically developed Tyvyt's early inclusion could give it an advantage over its foreign rivals.
""Maybe (Chinese PD-1/PD-L1 products) don't come in and compete on day one with international (pharmas) in all indications, but just getting a foot in the door might already be a big step for them,"" UBS analyst Michael Leuchten told Reuters before the NHSA announcement."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC is looking to raise up to $1.5 billion for its first fund targeting deals in India, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, betting on a surge in investment opportunities in Asia's third-largest economy.
Warburg plans finish fundraising on its India-focused fund, which will target industrial sectors such as financial, manufacturing and consumer, by the first half of next year, said one of the people.
Launches of India-focused private equity funds are rare, and big global buyout firms such as KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR), Bain Capital and Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) typically invest in a country mainly from their regional funds.
Warburg declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the firm's plans are not public yet.
Private equity investments are expected to pick up in India as some companies look to sell shares to fund growth, while some family-owned firms explore selling controlling stakes to pay off debt, bankers said.
Lower valuations, a rapidly growing middle class and reforms such as bankruptcy resolution rules are also enticing global private equity firms to invest in India.
Private equity-backed deals in India have risen to a record $16.8 billion so far this year, rising up from the previous high of $12.4 billion last year, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.
The news of Warburg's India fundraising plan comes as rival KKR is looking to raise a record $15 billion in 2020 for its latest Asia-focused buyout fund, which will include India investments.
Warburg has not finalised the size or launch timing of the fund, which depend on market conditions, said one of the people.
Warburg has a 21-person investment team in Mumbai, according to its website. It was Indian telecom company Bharti Airtel's (NS:BRTI) first marquee investor in the early 1990s and has recently invested in its digital TV and African arms.
The private equity firm also holds stakes in local insurer IndiaFirst, retail real estate platform Virgo Retail Ventures, and education financing provider Avanse Financial Services, according to its website.
In June, the U.S.-based firm closed a $4.25 billion private equity fund focusing on Chinese and Southeast Asian investments after launching the exercise in January with a target to raise $3.5 billion.
That fund, China-Southeast Asia II, will focus on investing across consumer and services, healthcare, real estate, financial services, and technology, media and telecommunications, Warburg had said in June.  "

The stock currently trades at HK$199.30 by 11:51 PM ET (03:51 GMT), up 3.2% since yesterday’s close. It surged 6.6% on Tuesday and 2.9% on Wednesday. 
 
Alibaba’s secondary listing in Hong Kong became the world’s largest offering so far this year. However, it is expected to be beaten to the title by Saudi Aramco’s anticipated listing in December. 
 
It is a homecoming of sorts for the company, as it launched its IPO five years in New York and dealt a blow to Hong Kong’s ambitions.
 
James Gerrish, portfolio manager at Shaw and Partners, said in an interview with CNBC that traders are “jumping all over it in Hong Kong.” 
 
“I think it’s a natural progression for that company to list over in Hong Kong,” he said, noting that the firm has a “strong runway for growth” in the next few years. "

Chinese stocks fell after U.S. President Donald Trump signed two bills backing Hong Kong protesters into law. 
 
“I signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong. They are being enacted in the hope that Leaders and Representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all,” Trump said overnight in a statement released by the White House.
 
The first bill would require the State Department to review once a year that Hong Kong is autonomous enough to retain its special U.S. trading status. The second measure prohibit the sale of munitions such as tear gas and rubber bullets to Hong Kong police.
 
The move is likely to complicate trade talks with Beijing, which has repeatedly criticized the U.S. for meddling in its domestic affairs. In a statement released hours after Trump signed the bill, China said the move highlighted the “sinister intentions and hegemonic nature of the United States.”
 
The two nations were reportedly getting close to signing a phase one trade deal. Trump said earlier this week that they were in the “final throes” of the deal. 
 
Hong Kong’s government also released a statement on Thursday morning local time, saying that it “expressed strong opposition” to the bills becoming law and said it “extremely regrets the U.S. repeatedly ignoring Hong Kong’s concern regarding the two bills,”
 
The signing of the two bills are “unnecessary and without grounds,” the statement said. “They will also harm the relationship and interests between Hong Kong and the U.S.”
 
Following the news, the Shanghai Composite lost 0.3% by 10:35 PM ET (02:35 GMT). The Shenzhen Component slipped 0.1%. The Hang Seng Index also inched down 0.1%.

The cancellation price was HK$4.25, the trading arm of Chinese state-owned food group COFCO said, which is 34.1% higher than the last closing price.
Shares of the company opened up 27% after they resumed trading on Thursday. They have been suspended since Monday.
If no outstanding share options were exercised, the deal size would be lowered to HK$8.9 billion, the filing said.
The reason for the privatization was that the underperformance of the company's share price had restricted its ability to raise funds from the capital market to finance its business development.
The underperformance was due to uncertainty over the company's development brought about by the slowdown of global economic growth, trade tensions and heightening of geopolitical risks.
China Agri-Industries's parent said it intended to finance the entire take-private plan with either internal cash resources or other financing, or a combination of both.

In a letter to the GSM Association, which sets standards on eSIM mobile technology and includes the four major U.S. carriers, the Justice Department said it was pleased that the group ""is ready to use its standard-setting process to create a more consumer-friendly eSIM standard.""
The technology called eSIM allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card, an identifying microchip. That makes it easier to compare wireless networks and easily select a new service when desired.
Previously, there had been allegations that the standard was set in a way that made it harder to switch carriers and to make it harder for new wireless companies to enter the market.
The Justice Department did not say in its letters which carriers were included in its probe. In April 2018, Reuters and others reported that the department was probing alleged coordination by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T),  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) as well as the trade group. T-Mobile and Sprint are also part of the organization.
Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint did not respond to requests for comment. AT&T declined comment.
GSMA said in a statement that the department had looked at ""millions of documents."" ""Its Business Review Letter is conclusive that the agency found no violation of antitrust laws,” the trade group said.
In its letter, the Justice Department said that it was closing the probe because the GSMA agreed to change some of its procedures.
""As a result of that investigation, the Department developed significant concerns that GSMA's process was deeply flawed and enabled competitors to coordinate anticompetitively,"" the department said, without naming the competitors.
The department further said it had ""no present intention"" to pursue an antitrust enforcement action against GSMA's conduct.

Gigi Sohn, a consumer advocate and telecommunications expert, said the letter was a ""slap on the wrist"" because the Justice Department Antitrust Division did nothing more than force a change in anti-competitive behavior.

768,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 05:05PM ET</span>",Stocks - Big Indexes Hit New Highs Ahead of Holiday,"Investing.com – On Thanksgiving Day, bulls will surely be thankful for a decent economy and low interest rates that have combined to push stocks to new highs.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrials, Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 hit all-time highs and closing highs on a quiet day of trading.
U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for the holiday.

The S&P 500 was up 0.42%, with the Dow up 0.15%. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes were up 0.66% and 0.70%, respectively, based in part on a strong performance from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), up as investors predict a strong Black Friday sales performance.
The Russell 2000 index, up 0.56%, hit a 15-month high. 

So far this year, the S&P 500 is up 25.8%, with the Nasdaq up 31.2% and the Nasdaq 100 up 33.4%.

The Dow is up a more modest 20.7% and its gain on Wednesday was muted by weakness from Boeing (NYSE:BA), down 1.48%. The loss cut about 38 points from the index.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) had two issues. First, the Federal Aviation Administration told the company its inspectors would inspect all the 737 Max planes being shipped to customers or recertified with modifications. That will delay recertification and return to service of the troubled plane until probably after Jan. 1.
The other issue was a Seattle Times report showing a September stress test of the 777 X plane that caused fuselage damage that will require some redesign work.
Helping the market was the Federal Reserve's newest Beige Book report, an anecdotal look at the economy. It showed modest to moderate growth, low inflation, but some wage pressures.

The market also took a cue to move higher from statements from the Trump Administration that U.S.-China trade talks are progressing. It's not clear when a deal will be ready to sign.
While the economy looks stable for the foreseeable future (absent a breakdown of trade talks), the market has been showing signs of frothiness. 
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both ended the day with relative strength indexes approaching 76. The Dow's RSI is just under 72. Relative strength indices are widely watched because they can give off buy-and-sell signals. In this case, a reading above 70 is a warning that stocks are getting ahead of themselves. Above 75 is a sell signal.
If many market bulls are correct stocks could continue to rise into the year, the RSIs for the major averages could top 80, making the market vulnerable to a sizable pullback.
While Boeing was the Dow laggard, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 1.34%, was the Dow's biggest percentage gainer and added 24 points to the index. Apple also added 13.5 points to the Nasdaq 100 index. Apple, Amazon and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) contributed nearly half the Nasdaq 100's 59-point gain.

Crude oil and gold prices moved lower. Interest rates were a touch higher, with the United States 10-Year yield up to 1.771% from 1.74% on Tuesday.
Contract oil-and-gas driller Helmerich and Payne (NYSE:HP), Under Armour (NYSE:UA), software company Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) and chipmaker   Western Digital   (NASDAQ:WDC) were the S&P 500's best performers Wednesday.

Farm-equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE), apparel-maker PVH (NYSE:PVH), financial services giant CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) and discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) were the weakest S&P 500 performers."

770,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 04:23PM ET</span>","Solid data, trade hopes lift Wall Street to records","(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed at record levels for a third straight day in a muted volume session on Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, as fresh data pointed to an economy on solid footing, while investors remained cautiously optimistic about a resolution to U.S.-China trade tensions.
U.S. economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter, rather than slowing as first reported, and a steady increase in consumer spending in October indicated the economy will probably maintain its moderate pace of growth in the fourth quarter.
""From a macro perspective it really sits with the narrative of this growing but continue to slow environment,"" said Bill Northey senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
""It averted some of the greater concerns that this might be something more than just a slowdown to trend that we’ve been facing over the past quarter."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 42.32 points, or 0.15%, to 28,164, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 13.13 points, or 0.42%, to 3,153.65 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 57.24 points, or 0.66%, to 8,705.18.
Consumer discretionary stocks (SPLRCD) rose 0.83 to lead all sectors.
Data also showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased by the most in nine months in October.
President Donald Trump's comments on Tuesday that the United States was in the ""final throes"" of work on an agreement with China added to optimism.
The main indexes have repeatedly scaled to record levels this month on trade truce hopes, a third-quarter earnings season that topped lowered expectations and a dovish Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 has now closed at a record level in five of the past nine sessions. 
Trading volumes were among the lowest of the year for a full-day session ahead of the Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday. The stock market will close early on Friday.
Capping gains on the Dow was a 1.48% drop in shares of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) after the Federal Aviation Administration said it would be the only issuer of airworthiness certificates for new 737 MAX jets, the latest hurdle in the planemaker's bid to get the plane back in the air.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>","Tata Steel locks horns with union over 3,000 job cuts","LONDON (Reuters) -  Tata Steel  Europe (NS:TISC) said on Wednesday it had begun talks with its workers on a ""transformation program"" that involves up to 3,000 job cuts, prompting an angry response from union leaders who said the plan needed to be revised.
Indian-owned Tata Steel, which announced restructuring plans on Nov. 18 in a bid to boost profitability, added the further detail on Wednesday that up to 1,600 cuts were expected in the Netherlands, 1,000 in Britain and 350 elsewhere. 
About two-thirds of job losses are expected to be management and office-based roles, it said.
The restructuring follows a decision by competition regulators in June to block a joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG).
Unions in Britain and the Netherlands said that after that deal collapsed, they were given a jobs guarantee until 2021, and they would expect the company to stick to that.
Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the British steelworkers’ union Community, said unionists attending Tata's talks with its European Works Council had told the company their plans were ""ill-thought out, badly conceived and need to be revisited"".
Tata has said their proposals are designed to ensure a long-term future, but the unions say a vision that includes plans for investment has been consistently lacking.
""It feels like the company is just managing decline and we need a significant change of direction that can inspire the workforce that they have a future,"" Rickhuss said in an emailed statement.
Further talks are planned over the coming weeks.
The steel sector across Europe is battling surplus capacity and high costs. 
ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), the world's biggest steelmaker, has idled a series of plants across Europe. It is also in conflict with the Italian government over its attempt to walk away from a 2018 deal to buy Ilva, Europe's largest steel plant.

Britain's biggest steel factory, British Steel, went into compulsory liquidation in May and is subject to a provisional agreement to be sold to Chinese steelmaker Jingye, which requires regulatory approvals if it is to go ahead.

772,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 02:55PM ET</span>",Boeing 777X fuselage split during September stress test,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - The fuselage of Boeing Co's (N:BA) upcoming 777X aircraft was split by a high-pressure rupture just as it approached its target stress level during a test in early September, Boeing said on Wednesday.
The world's largest planemaker suspended load testing of the new widebody in September when media reports said a cargo door failed a ground stress test. There have also been issues with  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) new GE9X turbine engine that will power the jet.
The Seattle Times, which first reported new details on the testing issue https:// said photos it had obtained of the test on the 777X showed that the extent of the damage was greater than previously disclosed and earlier reports were wrong about crucial details.
During the final load testing of a 777X test airplane, engineers ran a test that involved flexing the aircraft's wings beyond what is expected during normal commercial service, Boeing said. 
""A testing issue occurred during the final minutes of the test, at approximately 99 percent of the final test loads, and involved a depressurization of the aft fuselage,"" Boeing said. 
The company did not see any significant impact on the jetliner's design or preparations for first flight, and it did not see any impact from the test on the overall program schedule, Boeing said.
The 777X is due to fly for the first time in early 2020, with the first jet on track to be delivered to an airline in 2021, Boeing has said. 
Boeing shares were down 0.6% at $371.09.
Boeing said it is still assessing the root cause of the testing issue.
The U.S. planemaker would almost certainly not have to do a retest and regulators would likely allow Boeing to prove by analysis that it would be enough to reinforce the fuselage in the area where it failed, the Seattle Times said. 
A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, Lynn Lunsford, said the agency was ""continuing our conversations with Boeing about the situation. 
""The FAA requires manufacturers to meet design and certification standards. How they choose to do that is up to them,"" Lunsford said.

Tim Clark, president of Emirates - the largest customer for the 777X jet - has questioned the testing of the aircraft, telling reporters at last week's Dubai Airshow that he did not know when the Gulf airline would receive the first jet.

773,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 02:31PM ET</span>",Deere's Dour Outlook Tests Faith in Manufacturing Rebound,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Deere & Co. results show the trouble with reading the economic tea leaves.
The maker of tractors and construction equipment slumped on Wednesday after announcing a depressed outlook for fiscal 2020 that caught investors off guard. Deere expects net income to be no higher than $3.1 billion next year, a decline relative to 2019 and well below the $3.46 billion analysts had been modeling. Here was investors’ response:
The root of the disappointment is Deere’s expectation that global agricultural and turf equipment sales will slump 5% to 10% next year. Heading into earnings, there was optimism that Deere might even see growth in that division, should the prospect of a trade deal and the Trump administration’s plans to pump financial support into the farming industry incentivize growers to finally swap out aging equipment. Indeed, data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed that capital spending excluding aircraft increased in October by the most since the start of the year, adding credence to the idea that the slowdown in industrial growth is bottoming out.
With the trade war still lingering in the background, though, it appears Deere CEO John May isn’t banking on much of anything. That seems the prudent path to take. For one, May only just ascended to the CEO role this month and is likely disinclined to set goals he can’t guarantee in such an uncertain environment (3M (NYSE:MMM) Co.’s Michael Roman, who’s cut guidance an absurd number of times in his short tenure, should probably take note). But even CEOs who have been around for a while would have trouble predicting how their customers will act six to nine months down the road. This industrial downturn has been different from others in that it’s not a function of supply-and-demand dynamics but of political uncertainty. Manufacturing data can naturally be lumpy given the volatile timing of big projects, or in the case of this year, the General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). labor strike. But the unpredictable nature of trade negotiations makes the trajectory of any recovery particularly difficult to predict.
The tariffs that China and the U.S. have levied against each other have made inventory management something more akin to an Olympic sport as companies try to get ahead of the levies but also guard against getting stuck with a bunch of unwanted goods. That challenge was reflected in Deere’s outlook. Looking at the broader market, Deere expects demand for agricultural equipment to drop 5% in the U.S. and Canada, while the European, South American and Asian markets are seen remaining flat. That’s not as severe as Deere’s forecast for its own business, a dynamic which Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann says likely reflects an expectation that dealers are still sitting on too much inventory and will work through that before placing new orders. An upwardly revised GDP figure released Wednesday of 2.1% for the third quarter also reflected inventory accumulation.   
Point being, no one really knows anything, and everyone is afraid of moving in the wrong direction. One reason Deere’s lackluster guidance hit its stock particularly hard is that the forecast wasn’t accompanied by much detail on restructuring that the company had previously indicated would be forthcoming. The company will implement a voluntary separation program for some employees that should save about $150 million annually when combined with 2019 cost-cutting efforts. If the outlook is really as bad as Deere claims, though, you would think we would see something more substantive on cost cuts. But to get aggressive with restructuring, Deere also has to be confident that this market isn’t going to turn around on a dime if there is in fact a legitimate trade deal, lest it end up short-staffed. 
The Trump administration is quickly running out of ways to describe the trade talks and proximity to a “phase-one” agreement. One day we were down to the “short strokes,” the next we’re in the rather morbid sounding “final throes.” But while investors are more than happy to price in those words as a done deal, CEOs are thinking differently. Deere’s downbeat guidance follows similar outlooks from  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). and Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Electric Co. that in certain lights could be construed as conservative. Or they might just be accurate."
774,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 02:15PM ET</span>",Top U.S. retailers absorb tariff pressure ahead of holiday shopping season,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prices for electronics sold online at top U.S. retailers were up slightly heading into the critical U.S. shopping season, but sites including Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) have held prices steady for many other popular holiday products despite the pressure from tariffs on Chinese imports.
The analysis is based on a pricing study conducted for Reuters by retail analytics firm Profitero, which examined online prices from seven large retailers for 21,000 products. 
The firm compared product prices during October and November last year to those this year in key holiday categories including appliances, electronics, toys and video games across Walmart, Walmart-owned Jet.com, Amazon,  Target  Corp (N:TGT),  Best Buy  (N:BBY), GameStop (N:GME) and Staples.
On average, the prices the retailers charged for electronics were 2.3% higher than the year-ago period, while across all the categories, prices were 0.9% higher, said Keith Anderson, senior vice president for strategy and insights at Profitero.
That's lower than the average rate of inflation during the same period, which stood at 2.4% in 2018 and about 1.8% in 2019 so far.
In categories such as toys, prices dipped 0.2% and video games fell 2%, according to Profitero, which has not looked at year-over-year changes in pricing across the sampling of retailers and categories in the past. 
Walmart and Target did not comment on the study but pointed Reuters to past comments from executives about how they have managed tariffs by working with vendors and diversifying their supply chain. Amazon did not immediately comment on the study. Best Buy declined comment and GameStop did not respond to requests for comment. Staples asked to see the study but did not comment.
America's trade war with China threatens to push up product prices, which could hurt consumer spending this holiday season, a period which makes up nearly 40% of annual revenue for many retailers. The two countries are currently struggling to strike a preliminary trade deal. 
About $539 billion worth of goods came into the United States from China in 2018, making the country the largest supplier of imported goods, the U.S. Trade Representative said. U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs and threatened more as leverage in trade negotiations with Beijing. 
But while tariffs have driven up costs of goods for many retailers, at least the large firms have so far refrained from passing that cost pressure to shoppers, according to interviews with researchers, consultants and retail companies. 
EBIT margins for all retailers excluding Walmart have been declining since October 2018 and at 6.7% are at their lowest since 2010, according to an analysis by Oxford Economics.
CONSUMERS NOT SEEING FULL EFFECTS
""Right now, nobody wants to be grinchy and steal Christmas so they are passing on as little as possible,"" said Jeff Unze, a president at BorderX Lab - an e-commerce platform, which connects American retailers with Chinese consumers, and tracks pricing changes in both markets. 
On Sept. 1, the U.S. imposed a 15 percent tariff on many consumer goods from China that increased the cost of goods sold for most retailers. For example, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) said tariffs will increase its cost of goods sold by about $19 million in the fourth quarter if tariffs are fully implemented. 
In the Profitero analysis, Walmart's products were only 0.4 percent more expensive compared to a year ago on a sample of over 6,000 popular holiday products. Amazon was 0.6 percent pricier on 9,200 products. A sampling of 1,200 items sold online by Target were 0.9 percent less expensive than during the year earlier period.
By contrast, chains such as Staples were over 4.7 percent more expensive, and the goods sold by Best Buy were priced at 1.1 percent more. 
The study did not include popular categories such as apparel and accessories, which have largely not been subject to the Trump administration's latest tariffs but are likely to face a 15% tariff in a new round scheduled for Dec. 15.   
Consumer price index data, through October, shows that televisions, phones, computer accessories, video and audio products accounted for four of the top five largest year-over-year price declines by category. 

The data is based on sampling by the Bureau of Labor Statistics only through October, however. In contrast, Profitero looked only at online pricing at seven retailers during October and November.

Manchester United (NYSE:MANU) shares rose 10.8% on expectations that the deal could boost private equity or buyout interest in other major teams.
While Man City has eclipsed Man United on the field in recent years, helped by an influx of cash from Sheikh Mansour of the UAE, Manchester United has a history and global fanbase that make it one of the most famous clubs in soccer.
Silver Lake Managing Director Egon Durban, who will join CFG's board, said the California firm's investment would ""help drive the next phase of CFG's growth in the fast-growing premium sports and entertainment content market.""

NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), the world's largest brewer, is exploring options for its packaging activities as it streamlines its portfolio and focuses on its core beverage business, sources close to the matter said. 
The company is working with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on a deal for its U.S.-based canning activities which AB InBev inherited when it bought Anheuser Busch in 2008, the people said. 
Deutsche Bank has been hired to explore a sale of a minority stake or a joint venture for AB InBev's North American bottling and canning activities which could be worth $5-6 billion, one of the people said, adding that it was not aiming for an outright sale. 
The $52 billion Anheuser-Busch InBev merger in 2015 spurred a series of divestments, notably of non-beer activities, such as its theme parks. St Louis-based Metal Container Corp was mooted as a possible asset for sale at the time, but instead it was kept. 
Now, after its $100 billion plus purchase of nearest rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) in 2016, AB InBev is again looking to reduce its debt, selling its Australian business and beer brands in Europe and floating part of its Asian operations. 
Anheuser-Busch InBev and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. 
Anheuser-Busch InBev last month issued a profit warning and posted weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings growth sparked by reduced demand for its beer in Brazil and South Korea. 
The cautious outlook came after main rival  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) trimmed its 2019 guidance following an unexpected dip in sales in the Americas. Anheuser-Busch Inbev has already been sounding out interest from private equity firms for the packaging operations, one of the people close to the matters said. 
Another source said that he expected the business to be valued at around 11 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Peer Ball trades at 14 times its expected core earnings, while other peers like Crown, Silgan and Ardagh trade at around 10 times. 

""The main question is what value is attached to the supply contract that any buyer would seal with AB Inbev"", one of the people said. While the packaging business makes bottles for other parties as well, AB InBev is by far its largest customer.

(Reuters) - A federal judge said up to 29 million  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) users whose personal information was stolen in a September 2018 data breach cannot sue as a group for damages, but can seek better security at the social media company after a series of privacy lapses.
In a decision late Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco said neither credit monitoring costs nor the reduced value of stolen personal information was a ""cognizable injury"" that supported a class action for damages.
Alsup also said damages for time users spent to mitigate harm required individualized determinations rather than a single classwide assessment.
Users were allowed to sue as a group to require Facebook to employ automated security monitoring, improve employee training, and educate people better about hacking threats.
Alsup rejected Facebook's claim that these were unnecessary because it had fixed the bug that caused the breach.
""Facebook's repetitive losses of users' privacy supplies a long-term need for supervision,"" at least at this stage of the litigation, Alsup wrote.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC aims to shift $20 billion worth of assets to a new blockchain-based custody platform by March, in one of the biggest deployments yet of the widely-hyped but still unproven technology by a global bank.
The platform, known as Digital Vault, will give investors real-time access to records of securities bought on private markets, HSBC (L:HSBA) told Reuters, and seeks to capitalize on booming interest in such investments by yield-hungry investors.
Banks and other financial firms have invested billions of dollars into finding uses for blockchain, a digital ledger that can be instantly and transparently updated. Few, however, have come up with practical or widely-used applications. 
Proponents say the blockchain will upend the financial sector by cutting out costly processes or the need for middlemen - though there have been few solid examples yet of such revolutionary use.
The HSBC platform will digitize paper-based records of private placements, using blockchain to reduce the time it takes investors to make checks or queries on holdings. 
Records of so-called private placements are typically held on paper and lack standardization, making access tricky and time-consuming. HSBC currently looks after up to $50 billion worth of the assets, it said. 
It is not yet clear, though, how transformational the project could become. HSBC could not quantify the amount that could be saved for the bank or its clients by the platform.
Demand for private placements of both debt and equity have grown significantly in recent years, as investors search for higher returns amid low interest rates worldwide and technology firms in particular shun the scrutiny of public markets.
HSBC expects the global value of private placements to hit $7.7 trillion by 2022, a jump of 60% from five years earlier. Over the same period, it thinks allocations by asset manager clients will grow to 20% from 9%.
Ciaran Roddy, who heads custody innovation at HSBC's securities services arm, said interest in private placements from U.S. and British insurers, as well as Asian and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, is on the rise.
""With some of the yields that are on offer, we are definitely seeing an increase in demand,"" he said.
The news comes ahead of an expected shake-up of HSBC's global banking and markets division, with interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn seeking to cut costs and improve returns in the business. 
Windsor Holden, an independent consultant who tracks blockchain and cryptocurrencies, said major savings were unlikely in the initial stages of projects such as the custody platform.
""I wouldn't expect to see huge savings, or huge efficiencies announced in the first year to 18 months,"" he said.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 11:51AM ET</span>","Gamblers back Tesla in Ford tug of war as orders reach 250,000","(Reuters) - Orders for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's electric pickup Cybertruck are inching closer to the record set by the company's Model 3 sedans in 2016, with company head Elon Musk signaling 250,000 customers have now lined up to buy the new vehicle less than a week after its launch.
The flood of reservations has been encouraged by Tesla's cut-price $100 deposit to place a booking and a steady drum beat of promotion from the Silicon Valley billionaire to his millions of social media followers.
He tweeted ""250k"" on Tuesday night in an apparent reference to the number of orders. The company did not immediately confirm that figure on Wednesday.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co executive Sunny Madra has also pitched in by challenging Musk via his Twitter account to an ""apples to apples"" tug of war between the Cybertruck and a comparable Ford F-150 pickup. 
At the Cybertruck launch last week, Musk showed a video of the Tesla vehicle winning a tug of war and dragging a Ford truck uphill. He said he would happily hold another contest next week. 
One online bookmaker on Wednesday had the Tesla as favorite to win a contest at odds of 5 to 2 on. 
Tesla shares were up nearly 1% in premarket trading on Wednesday, but are still down around 7% since the launch last Thursday.
Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The electric car maker opened bookings immediately after the unveiling and allowed potential buyers the option to reserve three versions of the truck priced at $39,900, $49,900 and $69,900. It plans to start manufacturing the truck around late-2021.
The reservation price compares to $1,000 that the company charged to book a Model 3 in the months after its much-hyped launch three years ago. 
""The $100 Truck reservation is Tesla admitting preorders are meaningless,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said.
Tesla claimed it had 455,000 reservations for the Model 3 in 2017 before it started selling and it had sold 275,000 of the cars by the second quarter of this year.
Gordon Johnson, an analyst at GLJ Research, said Cybertruck would likely have a much lower conversion rate of actual purchases to orders.
Musk's tweets has hinted that Tesla will employ new techniques to build Cybertruck, which is made of stainless steel used in rockets.

Cybertruck's angular futuristic design has polarized opinion, with some analysts saying it had no chance of drawing in the sort of mass audience that has made pickup trucks the U.S. car industry's best-selling vehicles.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian firm part-owned by  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) that was hit by sanctions for its role in installing the German company's turbines in Crimea has started liquidation proceedings, according to filings to a Russian companies database.
Interavtomatika notified authorities of its decision to cease operations on Tuesday, the filings in the Spark database showed. It gave no explanation for the move.
German conglomerate Siemens owns a 46% stake in Interavtomatika, which installs automated control systems in power plants and works with products manufactured by Siemens or those under its license.
In 2017 Russia installed turbines bought from Siemens at power stations in Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.
That led to legal proceedings and fresh sanctions against Russian officials and companies, including Interavtomatika, by the European Union and United States.
Siemens at the time said Russia had clandestinely delivered the turbines to Crimea and that it planned to sell its stake in Interavtomatika after the scandal. However, it has not yet done so.
Moscow denies this and claims to have modernized the existing turbines using Russian specialists and equipment.
The construction of power plants in Crimea, which began to operate at full capacity in March 2019, was carried out by Russian engineering company Technopromexport, part of the state-owned Rostec corporation.
In September, Rostec sold its 17.34% stake in Interavtomatika to then second-largest shareholder, the All-Russia Thermal Engineering Institute (VTI) for 67 million rubles ($1.05 million), taking the VTI's share to 54% from 37%.

The assets, related to emerging-market debt, were part of Deutsche's unit to wind down unwanted securities, the people said, confirming a development first reported by Bloomberg. 
As part of a broad overhaul, Deutsche has hived off billions in assets into a so-called capital release unit, also called a bad bank. The sale to Goldman marks the latest in a series of disposals of such assets.
The unit contained 177 billion euros ($195 billion) in leverage exposure at the end of the third quarter. The bank aims to reduce that to 119 billion euros by the end of this year.
It is unclear how much the sale to Goldman chips away at that goal because the nominal $50 billion is not comparable to leverage exposure, a measure of risk. 
Goldman purchased the debt at a deep discount and believes it can make a modest profit on the deal, according to a fourth person familiar with the matter. The book likely includes derivatives, as well as emerging-market debt, the person added.
Deutsche has said it sold packets of equity derivatives in three auctions. It is now trying to sell more complex equity derivatives, a process that will take a couple of years.
Deutsche has also struck a deal to transfer its prime brokerage business to  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP). 
Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>","Pfizer, Novartis lead $2 billion spending spree on gene therapy production","By Carl O'Donnell and Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) - Eleven drugmakers led by  Pfizer  and  Novartis  have set aside a combined $2 billion to invest in gene therapy manufacturing since 2018, according to a Reuters analysis, in a drive to better control production of the world's priciest medicines. 
The full scope of Novartis' (S:NOVN) $500 million plan, revealed to Reuters in an interview with the company's gene therapy chief, has not been previously disclosed. It is second only to Pfizer (N:PFE), which has allocated $600 million to build its own gene therapy manufacturing plants, according to filings and interviews with industry executives.
Gene therapies aim to correct certain diseases by replacing the missing or mutated version of a gene found in a patient's cells with healthy copies. With the potential to cure devastating illnesses in a single dose, drugmakers say they justify prices well above $1 million per patient. 
But the treatments are also extremely complex to make, involving the cultivation of living material, and still pose a risk of serious side effects.
Drugmakers say building their own manufacturing plants is a response to rising costs and delays associated with relying on third-party contract manufacturers, which are also expanding to capitalize on demand. 
They say owning their own facilities helps safeguard proprietary production methods and more effectively address any concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is keeping a close eye on manufacturing standards.
""There's so little capacity and capability at contract manufacturers for the novel gene therapy processes being developed by companies,"" said David Lennon, president of AveXis, Novartis's gene therapy division. ""We need internal manufacturing capabilities in the long term."" 
The approach is not without risks.
Bob Smith, senior vice president of Pfizer's global gene therapy business, acknowledged drugmakers take a ""leap of faith"" when they make big capital investment outlays for treatments before they have been approved or, in some cases, even produced data demonstrating a benefit.
PUSHING THE LIMITS
The rewards are potentially great, however. 
Gene therapy is one of the hottest areas of drug research and, given the life-changing possibilities, the FDA is helping to speed treatments to market. 
It has approved two so far, including Novartis's Zolgensma treatment for a rare muscular disorder priced at $2 million, and expects 40 new gene therapies to reach the U.S. market by 2022. 
There are currently several hundred under development by around 30 drugmakers for conditions from hemophilia to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia. The proliferation of these treatments is pushing the limits of the industry's existing manufacturing capacity. Developers of gene therapies that need to outsource manufacturing face wait times of about 18 months to get a production slot, company executives told Reuters. 
They are also charged fees to reserve space that run into millions of dollars, more than double the cost of a few years ago, according to gene therapy developer RegenxBio. 
As a result, companies including bluebird bio (O:BLUE), PTC Therapeutics (O:PTCT) and  Krystal Biotech  (O:KRYS) are also investing in gene therapy manufacturing, according to a Reuters analysis of public filings and executive interviews. 
They follow Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc (O:BMRN), developer of a gene therapy for hemophilia, which constructed one of the industry's largest manufacturing facilities in 2017.
REGULATORY SCRUTINY
The FDA is keeping a close eye on standards. 
This comes amid the agency's disclosure in August that it is investigating alleged data manipulation by former executives at Novartis' AveXis unit.
AveXis had switched its method for measuring Zolgensma's potency in animal studies. When results using the new method didn't meet expectations, the executives allegedly altered the data to cover it up, the FDA and Novartis have said.
One of the former executives, Brian Kaspar, denied wrongdoing in a statement to Reuters. Another, his brother Allan Kaspar, could not be reached for comment.
Novartis and the FDA say human clinical trials, which found Zolgensma effective in treating the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy in infants, were not affected. Novartis also says its investments in gene therapy production started long before it became aware of the data manipulation allegations. 
But the scandal has highlighted the importance of having a consistent manufacturing process for gene therapies, industry executives say. 
According to four of them, the FDA has stressed in recent meetings the need for continuity in production processes all the way from the development of a drug to its commercialization.
By bringing production in-house, drugmakers may avoid pitfalls such as the need to switch to a larger facility if contract manufacturers' capacity proves limited, executives say.
The FDA is finalizing new guidelines for gene therapy manufacturing, expected at the end of the year. 
""Manufacturing consistency is always a major concern for the agency,"" FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo told Reuters.
Highlighting the pressures on the industry,  Sarepta  Therapeutics (O:SRPT), which largely outsources manufacturing, delayed a clinical trial of its Duchenne treatment in August, telling investors it wanted to avoid any questions from regulators about consistency in producing its therapy at commercial scale.
ENOUGH GROWTH FOR ALL? 
""Between the trade secrets, the cost schedules and the time lag, it makes a whole lot of sense, if you can do it, to build out your own facilities and more and more gene therapy companies have started to do that,"" said Krish Krishnan, chief executive of Krystal Biotech Inc. 
Krystal, which is developing therapies for rare skin diseases, has built one manufacturing facility and plans to invest more than $50 million in a new one it will start constructing in December.
MeiraGTx (O:MGTX), which focuses on gene therapies for eye conditions, estimates it is currently spending roughly $25 million a year on manufacturing, including process development.
Despite such moves, however, contract manufacturers like Lonza (S:LONN) and Thermo Fisher (N:TMO) are confident their businesses will continue to grow due to the strength of demand. 
Thermo Fisher has told investors its Brammer gene therapy manufacturing division, acquired in May, could soon earn $500 million in revenue a year, double its projected 2019 earnings. Lonza CEO Marc Funk is also optimistic. 

""Demand in gene therapy has increased,"" he said in an interview. ""We believe this is going to continue in the coming years.""

789,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 09:49AM ET</span>",Catalyst Plans a $1.5 Billion Rival Bid for Hudson’s Bay,"(Bloomberg) -- One of Hudson’s Bay Co.’s largest shareholders has made a bid that values the retailer at more than C$2 billion ($1.5 billion), topping a rival offer from a group led by the company’s chairman.
Catalyst Capital Group Inc., which holds a 17.5% stake in the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, offered C$11 a share in cash Wednesday for the rest of the company, according to a statement, confirming a Bloomberg News report. Its bid is fully financed and would be subject to customary due diligence, Catalyst said.
The proposal represents a 6.8% premium to the C$10.30 a share that Hudson’s Bay Chairman Richard Baker and his partners agreed to pay last month.
Catalyst has filed a complaint with the Ontario Securities Commission regarding the conduct of the Baker consortium and Hudson’s Bay, according to the statement.
""Their actions are contrary to the public interest, including misrepresentations in circular and other potential securities law violations and a deeply flawed process,"" Catalyst said.
Catalyst is urging fellow shareholders to vote against the Baker bid at a Dec. 17 meeting. The Canadian private equity firm believes a deal could be voted on and closed by February.
Catalyst, a Toronto-based investment firm run by Newton Glassman, has opposed the Baker bid, saying it undervalues the department store chain. Catalyst is concerned about the value the company has recently ascribed to its real estate, which amounted to about C$8.75 a share, the people said. In particular, it’s questioning why the value of its flagship Saks Fifth Avenue store fell sharply in a recent appraisal, they said.
Officials at Hudson’s Bay, the board’s special committee and the Baker group weren’t immediately available to comment.
Stock Falls
Hudson’s Bay closed down 1% Tuesday to C$8.83 a share in Toronto as skepticism mounts that the Baker group would win support from minority holders to take the company private. The shares have fallen about 2.6% since Baker’s group went public with its proposal on June 10. The company has a market value of C$1.63 billion.
Winning support for its proposal might prove a challenge for Catalyst despite the higher terms. Baker and his partners, who collectively own a 57% stake in the Toronto-based company, said when they originally proposed taking Hudson’s Bay private in June for C$9.45 a share that they weren’t interested in alternative transactions.
The group was subsequently forced to raise its bid after opposition mounted from minority holders, including Catalyst and activist investor Jonathan Litt’s Land & Buildings Investment Management. Baker said the terms of the deal it reached in October would be its “best and final offer.” The deal with Baker isn’t subject to any termination fees and has the unanimous support of Hudson’s Bay’s board, according to a regulatory filing.
No Other Bidders
The board committee reviewing the transaction said in the filing it didn’t receive any written expressions of interest from other parties since Baker’s group went public with its offer. The board committee said it decided to support the Baker takeover in part because of the company’s recent performance, outlook and the likelihood that other bidders would not emerge given the Baker group’s lack of interest in an alternative transaction.
Baker is trying to take the company private in a bid to turn around the struggling retailer, which faces growing competition from sellers like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). The stock has plunged by about two-thirds in the past five years, joining other department store chains that are losing ground to online shopping.
For much of the 20th century, Canadians had plenty of reasons to shop at the Bay, a storied company whose 349-year history is deeply entwined with that of the nation. North America’s oldest company began as a fur trader founded by two French adventurers and their influential British backers.

Kolomoisky rejected the allegations and said that the main reason for the protests was the bank's exchange rate policy, aimed at strengthening the hryvnia currency, which he said was destroying the Ukrainian economy.
He said PrivatBank's case had no link to the protests.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during a visit to Lithuania, said that a businessman could not appoint or fire the central bank management.
""I think that the head of the national bank is protected, can work and do his job,"" Zelenskiy told a news conference in Vilnius.
Zelenskiy and Kolomoisky have long-standing business ties, but the president has denied suggestions that he would help the former owner regain control of PrivatBank or win compensation.
Later on Wednesday, the central bank governor Yakiv Smoliy told reporters that the bank remained independent and felt no pressure from either President Zelenskiy or the government on its activities.
He said those organizing the protests wanted to stop the cooperation with the IMF which, together with the Ukrainian authorities, insists on the return by the former owners of funds previously withdrawn from the bank.
When the bank was nationalized, the authorities said the lender had a $5.6 billion hole in its balance sheet due to shady lending practices. Kolomoisky disputed this assessment.
The authorities are pursuing separate legal claims in the courts in Ukraine and Britain seeking to recover the money.
The protracted legal battle between Kolomoisky and the Ukrainian authorities is being closely watched by investors and could weigh on Ukraine's negotiations with the IMF. Authorities warn the IMF may freeze aid if the nationalization is reversed.
But Smoliy said he expected positive results from an IMF mission that left Ukraine last week.
The Fund said on Saturday it would continue talks with Ukraine about a new support program in coming weeks, following significant progress in discussions so far with Kiev."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (HK:1010) posted its slowest-ever quarterly revenue growth as the country's smartphone market grapples with a protracted lull in sales and larger rival Huawei [HWT.UL] increases its share of the market.
Demand for smartphones has eased in China as consumers hold on to devices for longer. Shoppers have also rallied behind Huawei, boosting sales at the world's second-largest smartphone maker, which the United States has added to a trade blacklist.
Smartphone sales still account for most of Xiaomi's revenues but it has been promoting its internet services division, which mainly consists of online ad sales. The business, however, accounts for just 10% of total revenue - the same proportion as when the company listed its stock in August 2018.
Revenues at Xiaomi's smartphone business fell 8% to 32.3 billion yuan in the quarter ended Sept. 30. The company sold about 32.1 million phones during the period, roughly one million units fewer than a year earlier.
Total revenue rose 5.5% to 53.66 billion yuan from the same period last year, largely in line with analysts' expectations according to Refinitiv data.
Xiaomi has looked to foreign markets to make up for the sales drop at home but that came at a price with selling and marketing expenses jumping 16% in the quarter. 
Excluding one-time items, Xiaomi earned 3.47 billion yuan, versus 2.89 billion yuan a year ago.
Investors have so far appeared unimpressed by Xiaomi's efforts, pushing the stock down nearly a third so far this year.
The company is looking to aggressively roll out 5G-enabled handsets in 2020 as the technology becomes available across China. The company has released two 5G enabled smartphone models to date, one in Europe and one in its home market. 
Last month, CEO Lei Jun said the company would release more than 10 5G phones priced for a range of budgets next year.
""If you look at the Chinese smartphone market in the past two years, it is true that there has been some decline, and recently we have also seen some pressure in the market,"" Xiaomi's Chief Financial Officer Chew Shou Zi said on an earnings call.
""Once the 5G era is with us, then I believe we will start to see improvement in the smartphone market quite significantly.""

797,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 07:48AM ET</span>",International stocks to outperform U.S. in 2020: investors,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Even though the U.S. stock market continues a record-breaking rally that has sent the benchmark S&P 500 index up nearly 25% for the year, investors appear to be looking elsewhere for better values in the year ahead. 
World stock funds brought in $8.2 billion in investor inflows over the last two weeks, breaking a losing streak that dated back to early September, according to Investment Company Institute data. U.S. equity funds, meanwhile, lost more than $10 billion in outflows over the last two weeks, extending a retreat that has spanned seven of the last eight weeks. 
The move into overseas stocks comes as economic fundamentals appear to be improving in parts of Europe and Asia while U.S. growth looks to be slowing, drawing money away from a market that had been an outperfomer.
Even with the MSCI All World Country Index, which tracks global equities, nearing record highs set in January, 2018, fund managers and analysts say global stock markets still offer a better chance to outperform U.S. stocks in the year ahead. The cite significantly lower valuations after failing to keep pace with the U.S. equity market for much of the last decade. 
""We're starting to see a period where valuation is going to be the driver for future returns,"" said David Marcus, chief investment officer at Evermore Global Advisors. He has been shifting more of his portfolio into European stocks such as Belgium-based medical lab equipment maker Fagron NV (BR:FAGRO) and French media giant Bollore SA (PA:BOLL). 
The forward price-to-earning ratio for the broad Stoxx 600 index, for instance, is 15.4, well below the 19.3 forward P/E of the S&P 500, according to Refinitiv data. 
Any narrowing of that large gap in valuations could be a driver, even for companies that have strong stock performance this year, said Thomas Banks, a portfolio manager for the Federated International Small-Mid Company fund who has been increasing his stake in European companies. 
He remains bullish on companies such as  London Stock Exchange  Group PLC (L:LSE) and Sweden-based casino game operator  Evolution Gaming Group  AB (ST:EVOG), both of which are already up 50 percent for the year to date.
""Some of the higher valuations for U.S. shares has been warranted because the U.S. had a much faster growth rate. But going forward if there's a trade deal announced or an amicable solution to Brexit, the divergent growth rates could converge again"" as U.S. growth slows, said Banks. 
The U.S. economy grew at a 1.9% annual rate in the third quarter, down from 3.1% during the first three months of the year. The European Commission expects the economy in the euro zone to expand at an annual rate of 1.2% over the course of 2020, defying market expectations that growth rates would continue to fall from 4-year lows in 2018. 
Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, grew 0.1% in the third quarter after contracting 0.2% in the previous three months, easing fears that the bloc would fall into a recession. 
Further declines in the U.S. growth rate will also likely bring down the value of the dollar, which has hovered near record highs and eaten into the returns of investing in overseas markets, Banks said. 
Danton Goei, portfolio manager of the Davis International fund, said more attractive valuations are pushing him into Asian stocks and multi-national companies that are positioned to benefit from domestic consumption in India and China. 
He is bullish on Chinese companies that are not highly dependent on trade such as tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and for-profit educational company New Oriental Education and Technology Group Inc . 
""You can see that the trade war has had a very limited impact on their businesses and yet valuations have come down a lot because of the macro concerns. When you have very strong businesses and their valuations are falling for unrelated reasons, that appears like a good buying opportunity,"" Goei said.
At the same time, he is adding to positions in companies such as French aircraft engine maker  Safran  SA (PA:SAF), which he expects to benefit from growth in the Indian travel market as more consumers enter the middle class. Shares of the company are up 41% for the year to date, yet still trade near their lowest price-to-earnings ratio over the last 12 months. 
""The big difference in valuations obviously matters in terms of your likelihood of outperforming in the future,"" he said.

798,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 07:47AM ET</span>",Deere Outlook Dissappoints as Trade War Keeps Farmers Frugal,"(Bloomberg) -- Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) delivered a more cautious outlook than expected for the year ahead as simmering U.S.-China trade tensions and difficult growing conditions keep North American farmers from replacing large equipment, the company’s top moneymaker. Shares fell.
Demand for machinery has taken a back seat as trade concerns have farmers worrying about who will buy their products, while financial-services results have come under pressure due to operating-lease losses. Construction equipment purchases are also set to decline.
Giving his first guidance for fiscal 2020, newly appointed Chief Executive Officer John May projected net income in a range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. That compares with the $3.46 billion average analyst estimate.
Global sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to fall 5% to 10% for fiscal 2020, driven by lower demand for large equipment in North America. Construction and forestry equipment sales are anticipated to slide 10% to 15%. Last quarter, Deere announced cost cuts and said it would lower output compared with retail demand to manage growing inventories.
For its fiscal fourth quarter, the top tractor maker reported better-than-expected sales and earnings that were broadly in line with estimates. Adjusted earnings of $2.14 a share compares with $2.30 a year ago and an average analyst estimate of $2.13. Sales rose 4.3% to $8.7 billion.
Shares dropped as much as 4.9% before the start of regular trading Wednesday.
There are positives. A deal between the U.S. and China could provide a stimulus for North American agriculture. Moreover, U.S. government payments, so-called bailout money paid to farmers to compensate for the harm from the trade war, should reach growers in Deere’s first quarter, which could improve demand.
“Farm fundamentals should still be positive, with pent up replacement demand both in North American and South American large agriculture, and significant government payments helping support farm income,” analysts at Jefferies LLC including Stephen Volkmann said in a Nov. 25 report.
CEO May said the longer term outlook remains healthy. Executives will discuss the financial results on a conference call at 10 a.m. New York time"
799,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 07:27AM ET</span>","Deere's earnings fall on trade tensions, poor weather","CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Deere & Co . (N:DE) on Wednesday reported lower fourth-quarter earnings, hurt by trade tensions as well as poor weather in the U.S. farm belt that have slowed equipment purchases by farmers.
For the quarter ended on Nov. 3, it reported an adjusted profit of $2.14 per share, down from $2.30 per share last year. That compares with average analyst estimates of $2.13 per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The Moline, Illinois-based company said it expects net income of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion in the fiscal 2020. The forecast is lower than average analyst estimates of $3.5 billion for the year.
""Lingering trade tensions coupled with a year of difficult growing and harvesting conditions have caused many farmers to become cautious about making major investments in new equipment,"" said new chief executive officer John May.
Deere's worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to decline 5% to 10% next year. Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada, the company's biggest market, are expected to be down about 5%, on the back of lower demand for large equipment.
Sales at the company's construction and forestry division are expected to be down 10% to 15% in 2020.
Deere's shares, which have gained about 19% this year, were down 4.3% in pre-market trade."

DUBAI/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's wealthy Gulf neighbors plan to invest in the initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco, sources familiar with the matter said, helping out Riyadh as it strives to raise $25.6 billion from a domestic listing of the state oil giant.
Aramco has struggled to secure an anchor investor for the listing and found little interest beyond the Gulf, forcing Riyadh to scale back ambitions for the IPO, although it would still be the world's biggest if it raises more than $25 billion.
Aramco officials have held talks on investing with Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, both oil producing states that have close ties to Saudi Arabia and both with big sovereign funds, after Riyadh scrapped plans for roadshows outside the Gulf.
Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) was considering investing at least $1 billion, five sources told Reuters, while one of the sources said a final decision on the amount was still required board approval.
Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) also planned to invest in the IPO, two of the sources said, although the size of Kuwaiti commitment was not immediately clear.
ADIA and Aramco declined to comment. KIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Saudi Arabia aims to sell a 1.5% stake in Aramco, valuing the company at $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion, a lower valuation than the $2 trillion target initially sought by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MbS, who has made the offering a cornerstone of his economic diversification program.
Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that any Gulf state investment in the IPO would be ""purely a political decision rather than anything (else).""
He said commitments by Abu Dhabi and Kuwait, which both sit on huge oil reserves of their own, would be ""to show their support to MbS and his plans to diversify the Saudi economy.""
ADIA, estimated to have assets of nearly $700 billion, is chaired by the president of the United Arab Emirates and its deputy chairman is Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a close ally of the Saudi crown prince.
VALUATION CONCERNS
When Aramco's IPO plans were first flagged in 2016, an international listing was seen as one of the central elements, prompting interest among exchanges from New York to Singapore.
But many foreign institutional investors have said Aramco's valuation looked expensive and raised concerns about political, governance and environmental issues.
The head of the biggest refiner in Japan, a major Saudi oil importer, said Japanese firms were unlikely to invest because of difficulties in valuing the Saudi firm. Malaysian and Russian oil firms also said they would not invest.
The sale process for listing Aramco on Riyadh's Tadawul exchange kicked off on Nov. 3. Lead manager Samba Capital said retail subscriptions reached 27.04 billion Saudi riyals ($7.21 billion) on Tuesday, ahead of Thursday's deadline.
The offering to institutional investors, expected to raise about two thirds of the offering, closes on Dec 4.
Two sources said ADIA was considering investing at least $1 billion. Two others gave a range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion.

The Abu Dhabi and Kuwaiti sovereign funds manage a combined total of about $1.3 trillion in assets, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, making them among the biggest sovereign funds in the world.

LEUVEN, Belgium (Reuters) - The next time you wash your dishes, you could find yourself up to your elbows in soap suds spiked with leftover alcohol, if the world's largest brewer and a environmentally friendly detergent firm have their way.
Growing interest in alcohol-free lager, driven by demand for healthier drinks, had left  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) with a problem - what to do with all the alcohol sucked out of its beer. (https://reut.rs/2OKCxlQ)
So it sealed a deal with Belgium-based Ecover to create a dishwashing liquid with a quarter of its content derived from the zero-alcohol versions of the Leffe and Jupiler beer brands.
""The brewery was asking us what can we do with the alcohol, because it's piling up, it's a large quantity, that's why we were looking for partners,"" AB InBev's innovation and technology director for Europe, David De Schutter, told Reuters.
The company said its brewing facility in Leuven - Europe's largest with a maximum capacity of 1.2 billion liters of beer a year - could extract alcohol and it planned to spread the practice worldwide.
The residual alcohol, which serves as the active cleaning and preservative component, is extracted, cleaned and sent to Ecover for use in its ""Too Good to Waste"" detergent.
AB InBev said it was looking at ways to re-use other waste. Spent grains may be the next big thing.
Most of the 1.3 million tonnes it produces per year worldwide is currently used as cattle feed. But it said it had potential partners in the pipeline and was looking into turning it into a plant-based meat substitute for humans.

STOCKHOLM/NORWICH, Britain (Reuters) - A British biotech startup is developing a method of textile dyeing that taps into the bright colors of birds and butterflies and has micro-organisms recreate them on fabric, slashing the use of water and heavy chemicals in the process.
Based in the English city of Norwich, Colorifix has attracted backing from the venture capital arm of Swedish fashion giant H&M (ST:HMb).
""We're harnessing the ability of microbes in this case to be able to deposit and fix a pigment on to fabric,"" Colorifix Chief Scientific Officer Jim Ajioka told Reuters.
Common dyeing, with synthetic pigments, involves large concentrations of hazardous chemicals such as chromium and other heavy metal salts and consumes vast amounts of energy and water, with contaminated wastewater a big source of pollution.
Colorifix said its method uses no hazardous chemicals and cuts water use by up to 90% depending on equipment, pigment and fabric, and is carried out at lower temperatures than common dyeing.
Shoppers' growing awareness that apparel is one of the top-polluting industries is pushing image-conscious retailers to address the environmental impact of their clothes' full life cycle. The dyeing stage has one of the biggest.
Colorifix, like French rival PILI, harvests a color gene in nature and inserts it into a bacterial cell, tricking it to fill up with the color as well as duplicate. In Colorifix's dyeing process, cells jump onto the fabric and release the dye on it, after which the solution is briefly heated up to kill them.
Chief Executive Orr Yarkoni said Colorifix is about to launch industrial-scale trials in partnerships with fashion groups, including H&M, and textile manufacturers such as Switzerland's Forster Rohner and India's Arvind. The tests will be conducted at dye houses already supplying those brands.
""For the first pilots, I hope we have everything up and running by Christmas. We are starting on multiple sites simultaneously in Portugal, Italy and India,"" Yarkoni said.
If these are successful, Colorifix expects to launch commercially its 5-ml batches of microbes bulging with color, in 2020.
Challenges include creating new hues on demand, maintaining standards of current processes and keeping costs down.
""The H&M group and Colorifix were in India this summer to, together with our production organization, see how we can develop the technique so that it can be applied to our production,"" H&M spokeswoman Jeanette Mattsson said. ""Given our size it takes more work to enable a scalable solution.""
Colorifix's other backers include Swiss investment firm Challenger 88 and Cambridge University."

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Manchester City's Abu Dhabi-controlled owner has agreed to sell a $500 million stake to U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake, making it the world's most valuable soccer group with a $4.8 billion price tag.
Tech-focused Silver Lake will buy just over 10% of City Football Group (CFG), which owns reigning English Premier League champions Manchester City and teams in the United States, Australia and China, the companies said on Wednesday.
The investment crowns a rags to riches story for Manchester City, which spent much of the 1990s in the doldrums but broke into the big league of world soccer with the help of Middle Eastern cash.
Europe's top soccer clubs have drawn in big money from some of the world's richest investors over the last decade, as the game attracts more fans in lucrative markets such as Asia, the United States and the Middle East.
Chinese investors paid $400 million for a 13% stake in CFG four years ago, valuing the group at $3 billion at that time.
Man City's big domestic rival Manchester United (N:MANU) are majority owned by the American Glazer family and are valued at $2.8 billion (N:MANU).
Chelsea are owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, while America's Fenway Sports Group controls current European champions Liverpool and French champions Paris Saint Germain are owned by Qatar Sports Investments.
""We and Silver Lake share the strong belief in the opportunities being presented by the convergence of entertainment, sports and technology and the resulting ability for CFG to generate long-term growth and new revenue streams globally,"" CFG Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said.
CFG, which also owns or part owns New York City FC, Melbourne City FC, Yokohama F. Marinos in Japan, Club Atletico Torque in Uruguay, Girona FC in Spain and Sichuan Jiuniu FC in China, said none of its shareholders were selling stakes.
Abu Dhabi United Group, the investment vehicle owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, will remain the majority CFG shareholder with a stake of around 77% after the deal.
It is relatively rare for private equity firms to buy into soccer because they want a relatively quick return and while clubs make their money from lucrative broadcasting rights, their fortunes still depend on their success on the field.
Silver Lake Managing Director Egon Durban, who will join CFG's board, said the California-based firm's investment would ""help drive the next phase of CFG's growth in the fast-growing premium sports and entertainment content market"".
Silver Lake owns stakes in entertainment and sport talent agencies group Endeavor and global sports agency IMG.

TURNING THE TABLES
Although City were champions of England in 1968, the club were heavily overshadowed by local rivals Manchester United and fell into the third tier of English soccer in 1998.
The team were a mid-table Premier League side when they were purchased by the Abu Dhabi Group in 2008.
Within four years, City won the Premier League, their first top-flight title in 44 years, and Spaniard Pep Guardiola, appointed manager in 2016, guided the club to a second straight title and a domestic treble of trophies last season.
But City have yet to achieve their goal of winning Europe's most prestigious prize, the Champions League.
And an investigation by European soccer's governing body UEFA into alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play rules could potentially see the team barred from the competition.
Aside from Man City, CFG's most notable investment was to create New York City FC, a Major League Soccer franchise which plays at Yankee Stadium, home of the New York Yankees baseball team.
Man City, whose squad includes England's Raheem Sterling, Belgium's Kevin De Bruyne and Argentina's Sergio Aguero, reported record 2018-19 revenue of 535.2 million pounds ($687 million) in a fifth consecutive year of profitability."

The finance ministry said on Wednesday that local governments must ensure that special purpose bonds -- used to finance infrastructure projects -- should be issued and used as early as possible.
""To ensure we can see results early next year ... and the economy can be effectively boosted as soon as possible,"" the ministry said in a statement on its website.
The front-loaded debt quota was equivalent to 47% of the 2019 quota, it said.
""This is a big decision, which means that the government is pretty worried about the downward pressure on the economy,"" said Hua Changchun, analyst at Guotai Junan Securities.
""Currently speaking, the economy has not been effectively stabilized yet.”
Tang Jianwei, senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai, said faster local government bond issuance could help underpin infrastructure investment, but he cautioned against any quick impact on the economy.
""Special bonds could help stabilize investment, but any impact may not be felt until the first quarter,"" he said.
Beijing has been leaning more heavily on fiscal stimulus to weather the current downturn, announcing 2 trillion yuan in tax and fee cuts this year and 2.15 trillion yuan in special local government bond issuance.
China's economic growth cooled to a near 30-year low of 6% in the third quarter, and may dip lower in the fourth quarter amid a trade war with the United States.
Analysts do not expect an interim trade deal to brighten the outlook any time soon as the tariff war has only exacerbated a slowdown caused by weaker domestic demand.
Many local governments are facing increasing fiscal strains as the tax cuts and the broader economic slowdown reduce their revenues, hampering their ability to carry through on big infrastructure projects which Beijing is counting on to revive growth.
To support growth, the central bank is expected to ease policy further, although it has limited room to act due to debt, housing and inflation risks, analysts said.
""The central bank should coordinate with fiscal policy. It should release more liquidity, so we expect it to cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) again toward the year-end,"" Tang said.
The central bank has cut the RRR seven times since early 2018, alongside modest cuts in its new benchmark lending rates."

810,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 05:27AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Money-Laundering Cloud Still Hovers Over Nordic Banks,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The money-laundering crisis affecting Scandinavia’s banks shows no signs of easing up.
Shares in Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (ST:SEBa), the latest Nordic bank to be accused of channeling illicit funds from the former Soviet Union, managed a weak rebound on Wednesday after it issued a statement that was only a qualified rebuttal of the claims. It's still down 11% from immediately before Swedish broadcaster SVT made its claims.
""In the comprehensive analysis that we have made of our business in the Baltics, we have not seen that SEB has been used for money laundering in a systematic way.""
However, it added that between 2005 and 2018, its Estonian branch had processed nearly 26 billion euros ($28.7 billion) of payments from non-residents that would not meet the bank’s current standards for transparency. That was around one-third of all the non-resident transactions handled by the branch in that time.
It also said it had ceased doing business with 95% of the clients named by SVT.
Since the middle of last year, both   Danske Bank   (CSE:DANSKE) and   Swedbank   (ST:SWEDa) have fallen sharply after revelations that their operations in the Baltic States were used by (mainly Russian) entities to launder money. Neither stock has staged any meaningful recovery, even though the maximum fine expected by most analysts is much smaller than the loss of market value since the revelations.
That’s mainly because dealing with the authorities has been a huge suck on management time and energy, and because the banks have had to spend heavily on tightening their compliance capabilities – something that has taken a big bite out of their profits.
Danske, which announced early in the year it would spend $295 million on beefing up its anti-money-laundering systems, said in October it would freeze almost all hiring except in regulatory jobs. It also issued a profit warning at the start of this month after its cost-income ratio, a measure of core profitability - surged to 58.5%. It said it wants to get that ratio back to the low 50s by 2023, but that may be difficult given that it has lost the business of nearly 20,000 customers due to the scandal.
For now, SEB seems to have avoided the worst. The shares have held above the low made last year when the crisis initially broke. However, Danske and Swedbank – another Swedish bank facing similar allegations - have been less fortunate. They’re two of the three worst-performing European bank stocks this year, quite a distinction in a crowded field. Another bank facing money-laundering issues, Dutch-based ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd), is the fifth-worst performer in the sector year-to-date.
For investors willing to brave the risks, there are some signs that the market can overshoot in marking down the banks in question.   ING Groep   (AS:INGA) has rebounded smartly this year – 11% year-to-date from a money-laundering fine of just under 1 billion euros in 2018, the biggest ever handed down by Dutch regulators. Also, some important fundamentals are moving in the Nordic banks’ favor, with Sweden’s central bank set to exit its negative interest rate policy next month, and the euro zone economy also seemingly bottoming out.
Moreover, Swedbank and Danske are – at least for now – still trading at dividend yields of over 10%, which provides some protection against future regulatory hits. But until the regulators say their final word, they remain a very high-risk bet."
811,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>","Further to run for global stocks, but trade salve needed: Reuters poll","By Hari Kishan and Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The global stock market rally has further to run in 2020, according to analysts, brokers and strategists polled by Reuters, but much depends on U.S. and Chinese officials making real progress in stopping a disruptive trade war.
A slim majority of respondents - 53 of 102 - said risks to their outlook were skewed more to the upside in the Nov. 11-26 poll. Just three months ago, a clear majority - 69 of 97 - said risks were more to the downside.
The turnaround in expectations coincides with a new buoyancy in most equity markets. Fears that the global economy might slip into recession, which the government bond market has been suggesting on and off in 2019 is an imminent risk in the United States, appear to have been alleviated in recent weeks.
""With a recession still an outside chance but growth remaining lackluster, we continue to prefer equities over fixed-income investments, especially at this late stage of the cycle,"" noted analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""We expect returns to be limited considering stretched valuations, low growth and increasing uncertainties.""
A lot of recent optimism has stemmed from speculation U.S. and China trade officials are close to agreeing a way forward, despite the fact nothing substantial has been reported, let alone when or where leaders will next formally meet to discuss a resolution.
Indeed, 14 of 18 major indices polled by Reuters rose to their highs for the year in November. But two-thirds of analysts who answered an additional question - 76 of 114 - said the U.S. and China signing a partial deal would only help stocks rise marginally.
""Optimism about trade has been a factor behind the rally in global equities in the past month. But with a ""mini-deal"" now largely discounted in the markets, and economic growth unlikely to do better than stagnate over the next couple of years, any further upside for stock prices will be limited,"" noted Simona Gambarini, market economist at Capital Economics.
(GRAPHIC: Global stock markets outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/643/639/Stocks.png )
In the meantime, major central banks have cut interest rates and the European Central Bank has resumed its asset-purchase program, flooding capital markets with cash. But most developed and emerging economies are growing below potential and consumer price inflation remains quiescent for the most part.
Easy monetary policy has lifted most indices to double-digit gains this year, a feat less than a handful of the indices were expected to repeat in 2020. Only Mexico's benchmark index, which has risen about 5% so far this year, was expected to better its 2019 performance next year.
A majority of the indices covered have either breached their end-2019 predictions from a Reuters poll taken a year ago or are within striking distance before the year ends.
But that strong performance seems to be coming to an end, according to the latest poll. Even the top performing indices for the year, which have risen 25% or more, including the S&P 500 (SPX), are expected rise less than 5% over the coming year.
Taken together with the sharp rise in investing in index-tracking funds over the past decade, the latest poll results suggest many investors should brace themselves for limited returns next year.
Among analysts who answered another additional question a strong minority of 45% - 50 of 112 analysts polled - said the bull run in global stocks would end within a year. About 10% said it had already ended. Over 40 respondents said within two years and 19 said more than two years.
While stocks in advanced economies have led the rally this year, they are now expected to take a back seat and make way for emerging markets, which are forecast to outperform over the next 12 months.
Only China, Brazil and Mexico's benchmark indexes are expected to post double digit gains by end-2020. India's BSE is forecast to rise around 7% for the same period.
""As headwinds from trade uncertainty and the slowdown of the Chinese economy may be fading, at least in the near-term, emerging markets equities could continue to be a main beneficiary of better investor sentiment,"" noted analysts at UBS, who said they were closing an underweight position on emerging market stocks.

Food makers have been criticized by groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists for confusing labels that have made it difficult for customers to reduce their sugar and fat intake or increase fiber in their diet.
Nestle brands on which Nutri-Score will appear include plant-based products from Garden Gourmet, Nesquik chocolate-flavored milk, Buitoni pizzas, Nescafe coffee, Maggi products and KitKat chocolate bars, the company said."

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares made another push for an elusive record high on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington and Beijing were in the final throes of inking an initial trade deal.
Early European trading was relatively subdued, with MSCI's all-country world index now within 0.4% of its record high from January 2018 but lacking any real urgency. 
London, Frankfurt and Paris were all inching higher, (EU) Shanghai struggled after industrial company profits shrank while Australian shares had hit record highs and Japanese stocks drew support from the growing chance of extra fiscal stimulus.
A senior Japanese ruling party official said on Wednesday he believed the government was striving to compile a supportive spending package worth about 10 trillion yen ($92 billion).
""Something will come out of the phase one (Sino-U.S. trade) talks,"" said TD Securities Senior Global Strategist James Rossiter. ""Rolling back tariffs to where they were in August with the December ones put on hold or cancelled maybe."" 
But he said the two countries were unlikely to go beyond that and China's industrial profits data overnight underscored the economic strain.
In the currency markets, the dollar was broadly stronger against developed and emerging currencies, with dollar/yen holding above 109 and euro/dollar steady. [FRX/]
That was despite softer-than-expected U.S. economic data on Tuesday which showed a fourth straight monthly contraction in consumer confidence and an unexpected drop in new home sales in October. 
Sterling  continued to edge lower as pre-election opinion polls showed some narrowing of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives lead over opposition parties, even though he remains favourite to gain an overall majority.
The reaction to the poll narrowing has been modest as the prospect of another hung parliament raises the prospect of some form of coalition government made up of parties supporting a second Brexit referendum. 
Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore, said while Sino-U.S. trade headlines may be driving some tactical, near-term moves in the market, they were mostly just ""noise"".
The broader market direction is ""about the accommodative Fed and accommodative monetary policy and the fact that structurally the meta-trend is still lower in yields and rates,"" he said.
Some analysts said a renewed fall in U.S. and European bond yields on Tuesday also pointed to more mechanical explanations beyond trade for rising equity prices.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday that monetary policy was ""well positioned"" to support the strong U.S. labour market.
In emerging markets, traders were keeping a close eye on Brazil's real, which hit a record low below the troughs hit during the deep recession of 2015 and despite ongoing central bank intervention.
Among the main commodities, oil prices edged lower after hitting their highest since late September on the reassuring trade headlines. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) was down 0.21% at $58.29 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) lost 0.11% to $64.20 per barrel.

Trump said on Tuesday that Washington was in the ""final throes"" of work on an initial trade agreement, adding to optimism from earlier in the day when Beijing said top negotiators from both countries had reached a consensus on ""resolving relevant problems"".
""European markets look like they could be heading back up to all-time highs like the U.S. markets, but we're not quite there yet,"" said Michael Baker, analyst at ETX Capital.
""In the past, you've tended to have a bad response (on the trade deal) at some point, but that doesn't seem to be coming and the markets are enjoying it.""
European shares have crawled towards a record high this month on hopes that the world's top two economies would defuse a trade war that has dulled business sentiment, dented corporate investment and hurt global growth.
But impediments to a truce remain, with a U.S. bill on human rights in Hong Kong being a potential sticking point with China. Reuters also reported last week that the interim deal could slide into 2020, given China's ask for more extensive tariff rollbacks.
Investors have turned to central banks in major economies for clues on monetary policy to stem the global downturn. The European Central Bank cut interest rates deeper into negative territory in September, while the U.S. Federal Reserve has lowered borrowing costs three times this year.
A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed the benchmark European index is expected to hit a record high by the end of next year, underpinned by loose monetary policy and hopes of an orderly Brexit.

The safety of vaping has been in the spotlight, with U.S. health officials reporting more than 2,000 cases of vaping-related lung illness and 47 deaths linked to its use in the country, leading to tighter regulatory scrutiny and individual state bans.
This has led to a drop in demand for the devices, pushing the company to forecast revenue growth in its new categories business that sells e-cigarettes, tobacco heating products and oral products - to be at the low end of its 30-50% target. It had previously anticipated revenue growth in the middle of that range.
U.S. vaping products make up 17% of the company's new categories business and generate 0.8% of total group revenue, according to Jefferies analysts.
Excluding the United States, BAT said it would be able to hit new categories growth in the middle of that range.
Rival Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) earlier this month issued a cautious forecast for 2020, citing a ""challenging"" and ""volatile"" U.S. regulatory environment.
BAT, however, said on Wednesday overall revenue would now grow in the upper half of its 3%-5% long term forecast range, benefiting from stronger pricing and market share gains in its traditional cigarettes business.
The company also maintained its forecast for adjusted earnings per share growth in the high-single-digit range.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto's stock market will rise over the coming year, adding to large gains in 2019, as low interest rates support the global economy and investors take a liking to its cheaper valuation than Wall Street, a Reuters poll found.
The median forecast in the Nov. 11-25 survey of 26 portfolio managers and strategists was for the S&P/TSX Composite index to rise 3.5% to 17,625 by the end of 2020 from Monday's record close of 17,032.86. The index has climbed about 19% since the start of the year.
""With interest rates roughly at all-time lows, with inflation non-existent ... I think we are still in a very good environment for stocks,"" said Allan Small, a senior investment adviser at HollisWealth. ""I don't think we are going to see a recession in 2020.""
Major central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have eased monetary policy this year in the hope of improving the outlook for economic growth after it was buffeted by trade conflicts.
""Some kind of trade deal will likely be agreed to between the U.S. and China and it should help calm markets and help capital investment get back on track,"" said Ben Jang, a portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth. ""Valuations for Canada appear attractive compared to the U.S.""
The Toronto market trades at a multiple of less than 15 times annualized earnings, based on a preceding 12-month period, versus a price-earnings ratio of about 22 for the S&P 500, data from Refinitiv Eikon showed.
""The extended stretch of U.S. equity outperformance has likely run its course,"" said Candice Bangsund, a portfolio manager at Fiera Capital Corporation.
She is looking for a rotation away from growth stocks, which include technology shares trading at high multiples, into value stocks, which tend to trade at a lower price than their earnings suggest they are worth.
Many value stocks can be found in the financial, industrial and resource sectors of the Toronto market. When combined, these sectors account for about three-quarters of the TSX Composite's market capitalization.
Technology, with a gain of more than 50%, has been the top performing sector this year on the TSX, helped by a more-than doubling in the share price of Shopify Inc.
The TSX's worst performing sectors have included energy, down nearly 3%, as investors fretted about slow progress toward building additional pipeline capacity, and healthcare, which has fallen more than 13% because of a plunge in once high-flying cannabis shares.
But prospects for pot stocks could be improving as a result of the potential for Ontario, Canada's largest province, to accelerate its roll-out of retail cannabis distribution and for the United States to take steps toward the weed's federal legalization, said Robert McWhirter, a portfolio manager at Selective Asset Management Inc.
Last week, a U.S. congressional committee passed legislation to decriminalize cannabis, taking it a step closer to being approved by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.
The pot stocks have given technical buy signals and could be ""reasonable performers into 2020,"" McWhirter said.

821,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 02:28AM ET</span>",Premarket London: BAT Upbeat Despite U.S. Vaping Crackdown,"Investing.com -- Here is a summary of regulatory releases from the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday, 27th November. Please refresh for updates.
Tobacco giant   British American Tobacco   (LON:BATS) said it’s “on track for a strong year”, with adjusted revenue growth and operating profit both in the upper half of their respective target ranges.

Earnings per share are expected to rise by just under 10%, helped by a 120-basis point contribution from currency effects. That will reverse into a headwind of 200 basis points next year, it said.


In a pre-close trading statement, the company shaved its forecasts for growth in its new-generation tobacco products but was unfazed by recent moves in the U.S. to crack down on various new forms of nicotine consumption.
“We believe that the issues around vaping in the U.S. should lead to a better and stronger regulatory environment in which we are well placed to succeed.”


It still expects U.S. consumption of tobacco to fall around 5.5% this year, and by 4%-6% next year, but has managed to keep its own sales declining at a slower rate. It has raised its market share in the U.S. by 30 basis points so far this year.

  Rio Tinto   (LON:RIO) has approved a $749 million investment in its existing Greater Tom Price operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The investment is in line with prior guidance.

Pub owner and brewer Marston’s (LON:MARS) said it's on track to meet its target of cutting debt by 200 million pounds ($258 million) by 2023 after reporting a pretax loss of 20 million pounds in the year through September. Underlying earnings per share fell to 13.5 pence but the company held its dividend at 4.8p.

The brewer has been reshuffling its asset portfolio against a background of steady decline in the pub business and has benefited more than many from direct sales of its beers to supermarkets and off-licenses. Total volumes in brewing rose 1% on the year.


Marston’s also said its sharpened focus on food-led pubs is starting to bear fruit, adding that it’s “well prepared” going into the crucial holiday season.


Drinks maker   Britvic   (LON:BVIC) raised its dividend by 6.4% to 30 pence a share after a 2.8% rise in revenue and a 20 basis point improvement in operating margins.
Net profit fell to 80.9 million pounds, while adjusted earnings per share rose 6.2% to 59.8p, slightly below estimates.
“While the current macro-economic environment remains uncertain, we do expect to make further progress in 2020,” Chief Executive Simon Litherland said in a statement."

823,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 01:36AM ET</span>",China's heft in stock benchmarks stirs worries of concentration risk,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's dominance in widely followed emerging market benchmarks has investors worried about concentrated risks, fuelling demand for indexes that limit their exposure to mainland companies.
Global index provider MSCI's latest round of China stock inclusion, completed on Wednesday, took Chinese equities to 34% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, bigger than the combined weight of the bottom 21 country components. China's weight in the FTSE Emerging Index stands at 35%, and will grow to roughly 37% by March.
To some investors, spooked by a slowing Chinese economy and the protracted Sino-U.S. trade war, those numbers are uncomfortably high. 
""Any time China faces a slowdown or faces overall market volatility, it is going to be the biggest driver of volatility in the EM portfolios,"" said Jason Hsu, chairman and chief investment officer of asset manager Rayliant Global Advisors. ""Because it's so big, you don't get a diversification benefit.""
Hsu said U.S. sanctions against Chinese firms create regulatory risks and could spawn more index customisation.
Thomas Taw, the head of Asia-Pacific iShares investment strategy at asset-management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), said investors would increasingly see China as a separate asset class in emerging markets (EM), much as Japan was separated from the rest of Asian assets in the 1980s.
""It will make sense for portfolio managers to start allocating separately to EM ex-China, as well as getting China exposure directly through single country allocation,"" he said.
MSCI's global head of equity solutions, Sebastien Lieblich, said the index provider used transparent, unbiased rules to determine the weight of any country in its global and EM benchmarks. He said the methodology was based on market capitalization of listed companies.
But the company offers custom indexes to address clients' concerns about concentration or regulatory risks, he said. 
FTSE Russell, owned by the London Stock Exchange, declined to comment. 
BLUESTAR 
Investor concerns have created opportunities for smaller index providers such as BlueStar Indexes. 
""Investors are awakening to a stark dichotomy during 2019, namely, at the same time that trade and geopolitical tensions between the United States and China are rising, the weight of China is also going up in their portfolio,"" said Steven Schoenfeld, BlueStar's founder and chief investment officer.
To address such concerns, New York-based BlueStar plans to launch its Emerging Market Risk-Controlled index in the next two months, which would limit investor exposure to China to about 24%. 
Its ""Policy Screen"" would also keep out stocks such as Hikvision and iFlytek, blacklisted by Washington due to national security concerns or human rights violations, Shoenfeld said.
""While these public policy issues are not directly related to investment risk, many investors are saying: 'Wow, this is a risk worth noting. This is a policy risk , a potential reputational risk or perhaps also a regulatory risk,'"" Schoenfeld said.
Rayliant's Hsu says he wouldn't be surprised to see China being left out of EM indexes altogether.
""I hear a lot of our client prospects either asking about it, or wanting it,"" he said. 
Other providers say active investment - rather than tweaking indexes - is the way to approach China risks, which could quickly change based on geopolitical developments. 

""Investing in Asia and EM more broadly is better suited to active management for exactly these reasons,"" said Andrew Gillan, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at Janus Henderson Investors.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",Feuding Korean firms risk disrupting electric car battery supplies,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - In 2018, South Korea's  SK Innovation  beat its larger, local rival LG Chem to a multibillion dollar deal to supply German carmaker Volkswagen with electric vehicle batteries in the United States.
With great fanfare, SK Innovation (SKI) (KS:096770) broke ground in March on a $1.7 billion factory in Commerce, Georgia, about 200 km from VW's (DE:VOWG_p) Chattanooga plant, which will be the automaker's electric vehicle hub in the United States.
LG Chem (LGC) (KS:051910) had other ideas.
Stung by missing out on the VW deal to the new kid on the block and the departure of 77 employees for its rival across the Han River in Seoul, LGC took SKI to court in the United States in April accusing it of misappropriating trade secrets.
Fast forward seven months and the two firms have hit each other with U.S. lawsuits for battery patent infringements in a bitter row that threatens to disrupt the launches of electric vehicles (EVs) by some of the world's biggest carmakers.
U.S court filings reviewed by Reuters show the feuding firms are trying to stop each other from importing and selling EV batteries destined for the SUVs VW will build in Tennessee as well as GM's (N:GM) Bolt, Ford (N:F) pickups, Jaguar's I-Pace, Audi's (DE:NSUG) e-tron, and Kia Motor's (KS:000270) Niro.
At stake is the Korean firms' ability to supply automakers in the United States with batteries just as the car producers are scrambling to lock in supplies with lucrative contracts ahead of an expected surge in demand, according to court filings by the two companies and several industry experts.
""Whoever loses the fight would suffer a fatal blow, unless the two reach a settlement. This will also be a setback for automakers,"" said Cho Jae-phil, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked previously at another Korean rival, Samsung (KS:005930) SDI (KS:006400).
Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said it was encouraging LGC and SKI to resolve their conflict without litigation and that it believed there was sufficient demand for multiple suppliers.
""We are aware of the issue. As a normal course of action, we have business continuity plans in place to protect our interests,"" Flake said in an emailed statement to Reuters. 
GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said the company was aware of the dispute and at this point it did not expect any impact on the production of its Chevy Bolt electric vehicle.
Kia, Jaguar Land Rover and Volkswagen, which also owns Audi, declined to comment.

TRADE SECRETS
Volkswagen has said it is worried there won't be enough batteries for all the EVs it plans to launch in the next five years, partly because producers such as LGC and China's CATL (SZ:300750) don't have enough skilled workers for new plants in Europe to ramp up output quickly.
According to Korea's battery industry tracker SNE Research, the market for EV batteries - the most expensive and important component in the vehicles - is set to grow 23% a year to reach $167 billion by 2025, making it bigger than the global memory chip market which is expected to be worth $150 billion by then. 
In one court filing, LGC said its rival poached employees working on its own project to supply batteries for VW's MEB electric vehicle architecture - and that SKI only won the VW contract because it had misappropriated trade secrets.
SKI has denied stealing trade secrets, saying its staff signed agreements not to use information from former workplaces. ""We value intellectual property,"" a spokesman for SKI said. 
If the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) rules in favour of LGC on June 5, when it is due to make a preliminary ruling, that could jeopardise SKI's plans to supply VW in the United States with batteries from Georgia or a new factory in Hungary, according to court filings. 
In April, LGC asked the ITC to block SKI from bringing batteries and components into the United States, as well as manufacturing systems needed for U.S. production which is scheduled to start in 2022.
The SKI spokesman said there had been no change to its schedule for the factory, which will have the capacity to make batteries for more than 200,000 EVs a year. He said SKI had received inquiries about the lawsuits from customers, including if they would have an impact on supplies, without elaborating. 
LGC said a final ruling on the case would be made on Oct. 5 next year but it asked the ITC earlier this month to make a so-called default judgment against SKI quickly.
According to a memo obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, the Commission's investigative staff recommended a motion in favour of LGC as it is ""the most appropriate sanction for Respondents' (SKI's) widespread spoliation of evidence."" 
Evidence spoliation is destruction or alteration of evidence that may be used in a legal proceeding. 
The staff also said a two-day hearing may be held ""because of the severity of the allegations of misconduct and the extraordinary nature of the relief requested by (LGC).""
SKI denied the allegation of evidence spoliation in a statement on Wednesday, saying it is ""sincerely responding to any investigation by the ITC"" and its statement of position filed with the panel will clear the ""groundless"" accusation.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/AUTOS-BATTERIES-SOUTHKOREA/0H001QXL09K0/eikon.png
WAR OF WORDS
The patent infringement lawsuits lodged by the companies in the United States, meanwhile, mean that if one, or both, lose they probably won't be able to market products using the patents in question in the country, the companies said in court filings. The two have taken their feud to South Korean courts as well.
LGC said in a statement it would impossible to design around its patents while SKI said losing the patents case could create ""substantial setbacks"" to its battery business.
SKI and LGC said there had been no supply disruptions yet.
LGC was an early industry force to be reckoned with, winning a deal in 2008 to supply batteries for GM's Volt, the world's first mass-market, plug-in hybrid car, and it has since worked with almost every EV maker including Tesla (O:TSLA).
But LGC has been grappling with an exodus of workers: 1,258 staff jumped ship from 2016 to 2018, according to its sustainability reports. The company told Reuters the total number of staff who have joined SKI since 2016 has risen since it filed its complaint in April to about 100.
The bitterness of the fight is worrying Korean government officials on the grounds it could damage the firms' reputations and let rivals win market share from South Korean companies.
Lawmakers have called on the government to intervene and Industry Minister Sung Yoon-mo said in October it was watching the dispute closely to see how and when it could play a role to bring about a ""positive outcome for the country overall"".
Beejay Kim, a battery consultant, said Volkswagen may have to broker a truce as the dispute could disrupt not only battery suppliers but also reduce competition between its vendors.

""No one wants them to fight till the end,"" he said.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",U.S. stocks to keep climbing in 2020 but growth well below this year's: Reuters poll,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks will keep rising in 2020 but at a much more modest pace than this year, with plenty to potentially slow the ascent, according to a Reuters poll of strategists.
The benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) will finish 2020 at 3,260, roughly 4% above its close on Monday of 3,133.64, based on the median forecast of 52 strategists polled by Reuters in the last two weeks.
So far this year, the S&P 500 is up about 25%.
""It's going to be a good year, but not a great one,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA in New York. He sees the S&P 500 ending next year at around 3,380.
Most - 15 out of 21 respondents - said they expected the bull market would extend into 2020 and run for at least a year.
Stocks will benefit from more stable global growth, accommodative central banks and a better-than-expected recovery in U.S. earnings, strategists said.
""Comparisons are going to be easier next year"" for earnings, said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. ""Everyone is so focused on near-term earnings and how they're negative. That's not the way to look at it.""
Belski expects the S&P 500 to end next year at 3,400.
Following 2018's sharp, tax-cut fueled gains, S&P 500 companies are expected to increase earnings overall by just 1.1% in 2019. Growth is forecast at 10% for 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Still, a majority of respondents said there is more of a risk the market falls short of their S&P 500 index targets than surpasses them.
Among the biggest uncertainties for the market will be the drawn-out trade war between the United States and China, which stands to further hurt global growth, and the 2020 U.S. presidential election, strategists said.
Slower-than-expected global growth poses the biggest risk to the bull market, said Stovall.
Almost all respondents said the market would see further upside in the event of a partial trade deal, with some seeing the potential gains as significant.
The S&P 500 index is already trading above the poll's end-2019 median target of 3,100, but if it finishes at that level, the end-2020 forecast would represent a 5.2% annual gain.
The poll also showed the Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) finishing 2020 at 29,400, based on a median forecast of 27 strategists. That is up about 4.8% from Monday's close of 28,066.47."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two of Australia's top shareholder proxy advisers on Wednesday urged investors to vote out more directors of Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) after a money-laundering scandal claimed the CEO and chairman of the country's No.2 retail bank.
The campaign suggested efforts by Westpac to curtail outrage over a lawsuit accusing it of enabling 23 million payments in breach of money laundering laws, including between known child exploiters, have fallen short.
The country's oldest bank holds its annual meeting on Dec. 12, and has already said the chairman of its risk and compliance committee, Ewen Crouch, will not seek re-election after the lawsuit from financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC last week.
Proxy adviser CGI Glass Lewis said it would also recommend shareholders vote against director Peter Marriott, a former chief financial officer of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), as he had been on the board since 2013 when the payments at the centre of the scandal began.
""Due to the length of his tenure and his banking background ... his accountability for these matters should be enforced (and) his re-election should not be supported,"" CGI Glass Lewis said in a note reviewed by Reuters.
Another proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), said it recommended voting against Marriott and another Westpac director, Nerida Caesar, on the grounds that Caesar was also on the bank's risk and compliance committee, according to the Australian Financial Review.
Marriott and Caesar were not immediately available to respond to Reuters requests for comment.
U.S.-born Chief Executive Brian Hartzer stepped down on Tuesday and Chairman Lindsay Maxsted said he would retire in early 2020, sooner than planned, only days after he had argued that change at the top would destabilise the bank.
Hartzer's departure effective from Dec. 2 made Westpac the third of Australia's four-biggest banks to lose its top executive in the past 18 months, following a series of scandals and a damaging public inquiry which found systemic industry misconduct.
If owners of more than a quarter of an Australian company's shares vote against its executive pay plans at its AGM, as they did for Westpac in 2018, they can call for the entire board to be removed under Australia's ""two strike"" law.
CGI Glass Lewis said it would not recommend voting against Westpac's pay plans because the bank had already taken action over the latest allegations.
In the event of a second ""strike"", CGI Glass Lewis said it would recommend voting against removing the board on the grounds that this was ""an option of last resort"".
TROUBLE OVER THE TASMAN
Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Adrian Orr said he was ""very concerned"" about the AUSTRAC allegations against Westpac, which has a major presence in New Zealand, as he announced the central bank was ramping up its scrutiny of banks and insurers.
The RBNZ had contacted all banks to ask for assurance they were meeting regulatory requirements, and was working closely with Westpac's New Zealand subsidiary on the issues that had arisen in Australia, Orr told a media conference.
""Our recent reviews of banks and life insurers, and the number of recent breaches in key regulatory requirements, reinforces the need for financial institutions to improve their behaviour,"" said RBNZ deputy governor Geoff Bascand in a statement accompanying the bank's financial stability report.
Westpac shares closed down 0.2% on Wednesday, taking its total decline to 6.6% or A$6.2 billion ($4.2 billion) in market capitalisation since the money-laundering lawsuit was announced.
The Australian newspaper reported Westpac had lost a bid to supply loans to a government home-deposit assistance scheme due to reputational risk.
Australia's four biggest banks applied for two positions on a panel of lenders for the nationwide home-affordability scheme from Jan. 1, 2020, but Westpac now expected to be excluded, the newspaper reported citing unnamed Westpac sources.
Australia's major retail banks make most of their profit from the home loans.
A Westpac spokesman declined to comment.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An attorney for Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), said on Tuesday that his client had no intention of settling a defamation suit brought by a British cave explorer before the case goes to trial on Dec. 3.
Vernon Unsworth is suing Musk for calling him a ""pedo guy"" in one of a series of tweets. Musk posted the tweets after Unsworth accused Musk in a CNN interview of grandstanding by offering to help Unsworth's diving team rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach from a cave in Thailand in July 2018.
Asked after Tuesday's session in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles if there was any chance Musk would settle before the civil trial, his attorney Alex Spiro told Reuters: “No.”
The defamation suit is one of the last remaining issues hanging over Musk from a turbulent period in 2018 and early 2019, during which the tech entrepreneur's use of Twitter and his personal behavior rattled Tesla shareholders and drew pressure from regulators.
Lawyers for Musk and Unsworth argued for a second day on Tuesday about evidence that could be used in next week's trial. U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson said those arguments would continue on Monday before he provides a written ruling.
Unsworth's attorney L. Lin Wood wants to present a series of emails Musk wrote to a Buzzfeed reporter in August of last year, including one in which he told the reporter to ""stop defending child rapists.""
Unsworth‘s legal team withdrew the Buzzfeed emails from the basis of its defamation suit last week, and is suing now only for the four tweets Musk published in July 2018. But Wood told the court he wants to present the emails as supporting evidence pointing to Musk’s ""state of mind"" in the original tweets.
Musk has apologized for the ""pedo guy"" comment, saying it was a common insult in his native country of South Africa, and that he did not intend to accuse Unsworth of pedophilia.
""BACKDOOR EVIDENCE""
Spiro told the court Musk was ""not trying to block evidence"" by wanting the emails excluded.
“(But) from our perspective, this is trying to backdoor evidence,” which, Spiro said, could prejudice a potential jury after Wood removed the emails from the defamation claim against Musk.
Lawyers for both sides said on Monday that Musk and Unsworth would testify in what promises to be a combative trial. 
""Evidence is going to be through Mr. Musk (testifying) that in fact Mr. Musk didn't call him a pedophile. Mr. Musk deleted the tweet, apologized and moved on,"" Spiro told the court.
Unsworth, who is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, will provide evidence of damages by “talking about his worries, his anxieties, his concern by being branded a pedophile,” Wood told the court on Monday.
Last week, Wilson rejected Musk's attempt to have the lawsuit dismissed and also ruled that Unsworth was not a public figure - which makes it easier to prove defamation.
Unsworth can now win if he shows Musk acted negligently in making his comments.
The dispute between the two men arose after the cave search team in Thailand decided not to use a mini-submarine offered by Musk's SpaceX rocket company to help with the rescue. Unsworth told CNN the offer was a ""PR stunt"" and Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurts.""
The case is Unsworth v Musk, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 18-08048.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 12:11AM ET</span>",Swedish bank SEB missed money laundering 'red flags' in Estonia: TV report,"(Reuters) - Swedish Television (SVT) reported on Wednesday that it had obtained a list of 194 clients of Swedish bank SEB (ST:SEBa) connected to suspected money laundering in Estonia.
The public broadcaster's investigative show ""Uppdrag Granskning"" reported that the client list, which also showed about 2,000 transactions, contained ""red flags"" - names associated with well-known proxies for Russian non-resident companies suspected of money laundering.
SVT said the report was done in collaboration with the Organized Crime and Corruption Project consortium of investigative reporting, which provided a cache of leaked information.
SVT said the transactions included around 475 million Swedish crowns ($49.35 million) connected to the so-called Magnitsky affair in Russia. The money moved through SEB accounts, the broadcaster reported.
Sergei Magnitsky was a Russian lawyer arrested in 2008 after accusing Russian officials of involvement in large-scale tax fraud. He died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after complaining of mistreatment.
""I find it surprising that they didn't see, both within their own client base, but also within some of the counterparties who were paying through their client base, significant areas for concern,"" money laundering expert Graham Barrow said in the broadcast.
On Tuesday night SEB said in a statement that it had processed close to 26 billion euros ($28.66 billion) from non-resident Estonian customers between 2005 and 2018 that would not meet the bank's current standards of transparency.
SEB Chief Executive Officer Johan Torgeby's statement sought to defend the bank's record.
""In the comprehensive analysis that we have made of our business in the Baltics, we have not seen that SEB has been used for money laundering in a systematic way,"" he said.
""Still, at any given time, all banks are subjected to the risks that financial crime entail,"" Torgeby added.
In April, Torgeby said he was ""comfortable"" with how the bank had conducted itself in the past but that there were no guarantees.
The revelations risk bringing SEB deeper into a long running Baltic money scandal which has hammered the shares of rival  Swedbank  and Danish lender Danske Bank.
SEB had managed to stay clear of the scandal until Nov. 15 when SEB shares fell 13% after the bank said broadcaster SVT had contacted it about the report airing on Wednesday.
On Nov. 20, Swedbank's (ST:SWEDa) CEO Jens Henriksson said the bank wanted to ""get to the bottom"" of a suspected funds transfer from a Russian arms company, which SVT said may have violated U.S sanctions.
Swedbank has lost around 40% of its market value since allegations surfaced that its Estonian branch processed suspect gross transactions of up to 20 billion euros a year from mostly Russian non-residents between 2010 and 2016.
The scandal started in 2017 with Danske Bank, Denmark's biggest bank. In September 2018, CEO Thomas Borgen resigned and the bank detailed compliance and control failings.
Danske Bank is under investigation in several countries over 200 billion euros ($220 billion) in suspicious payments moved through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 in one of the largest money laundering scandals uncovered.
At market close on Tuesday, SEB shares were down almost 8% since the start of the year. Before SEB's Nov. 15 statement, the bank had been trading up over 7% for the year."

Political unrest in Hong Kong that began in June saw some of the violence taking place in and around MTR stations. The operator had to close lines early and suspend train services as most stations were left badly damaged. 
Goldman believes MTR will see traffic recover quickly from the “short-term operational disruption” as the situation in Hong Kong improves, according to a note cited by Bloomberg. 
The report, which was led by analyst Simon Cheung, compared the unrest with the 2003 SARS epidemic where MTR patronage rose by 2% in July that year after dropping 20% in April.
The analysts noted that the company has locked in profits on property sales and may see some upside from rail expansion plans.

831,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 10:16PM ET</span>",Indian stock gains to be limited in 2020 as economy slows: Reuters poll,"By Indradip Ghosh
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian stocks are set to rise further over the coming year, according to a Reuters poll of equity strategists, but those gains will be limited as fiscal stimulus and easy monetary policy fail to reverse an economic slowdown.
The BSE Sensex index (BSESN) was forecast to rise another 6.7% to 43,645 by end of next year from Monday's close of 40,889. It has gained over 13% in the past two months and repeatedly set record highs after the Indian government announced several measures, including a corporate tax cut.
That expected rise in stocks in the Nov. 11-26 poll of 50 strategists would be half the rally so far this year and similar to the average rate for fixed deposits - a relatively safe asset - in Indian banks.
""The slew of measures announced by the government in recent months and the Reserve Bank of India reducing rates should result in only a very gradual recovery in demand over the next 12 months,"" said Sher Mehta, director at Virtuoso Economics.
""As a result, the pace of economic recovery and earnings growth is likely to be subdued over the next two years. This in turn should cap stock market gains over the next 12-month period and beyond.""
When asked what would most likely drive Indian stocks over the next 12 months, a significant minority of respondents - 17 of 48 - said it would be a recovery in demand and 15 analysts said global capital inflows.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have turned net buyers of Indian equities after being net sellers in July and August. Capital inflows in domestic equities touched a seven-month high in November, according to data from National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL).
""Buying opportunity enthused FPIs (are set) to look into the Indian market. FPIs are expecting stable governance, and we are at the bottom of everything - whether it is GDP, unemployment or consumption. From here, improvements are expected,"" said KK Mittal, vice president at Venus India.
Still, less than a fifth of strategists in the poll said fiscal stimulus was most likely to be the major driver in gains over the coming year.
""The government is announcing stimulus time and again, but the stimulus will not have an immediate impact on the economy or on consumption or investments,"" said Mittal.
A separate Reuters poll predicted the RBI would cut its key interest rate for the sixth consecutive time at its meeting next week and ease again next year, which might provide a further boost to domestic equities. [RBI/INT]
But the average price-to-earnings ratio is currently at a high not seen since at least the turn of the millennium, and the recent surge in stock prices has raised concerns over their valuation.
""I see a selective downside in stocks that have already moved up too much because of valuation concerns. We can see some correction due to valuation reasons in those stocks that have taken the market to an all-time high,"" said Rudramurthy B.V., managing director and research head at Vachana Investments."

London-based Rio will invest $749 million to bring the Western Turner Syncline Phase 2 project into production from 2021, according to a statement Wednesday. It will help extend the life of operations around the Tom Price mine, which began exporting in 1966.
While the new project is aimed only at replacing output that’ll be lost from aging pits, Rio will have options to boost volumes from its $2.6 billion Koodaideri development, Chris Salisbury, iron ore chief executive officer, said in a phone interview.
Australia’s top miners continue to see potential to leverage low production costs and a dominant position in the seaborne trade to generate strong profits from iron ore, even as they forecast China’s steel output to reach a peak.
Demand for ore is being supported by infrastructure projects in China launched earlier in 2019 and by ongoing property development, Salisbury said. There’s also been a more limited impact from the nation’s traditional winter output curbs on steel mills intended to limit pollution, he said.
“We haven’t seen significant effects of those so far in the season,” Salisbury said. “We are pleased with the level of demand at the moment.”
Rival BHP Group is spending about $3 billion on its South Flank mine and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. is investing more than $3 billion in two developments, including the Iron Bridge project that’ll add output of higher-quality materials.
Rio forecasts its iron ore shipments to rise as much as 5% in 2020 and expects to have capacity to hit a long-standing target for annual cargoes of 360 million tons by 2022. Iron ore accounts for about 43% of its revenue.
“Our iron ore business does continue to deliver industry leading margins,” Salisbury said. The investments are “a commitment to the importance of iron ore to the overall Rio portfolio,” he said.
Rio’s investment in the Western Turner project will add a new crusher and a 13-kilometer (8-mile) long conveyor belt, trimming the need for road haulage and helping cut the mining hub’s greenhouse gas emissions, the producer said. The plan will also protect the future of the company’s flagship Pilbara Blend iron ore product."
833,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 10:03PM ET</span>","Analysts Bet Cheapest Indian Stock, Tata Steel, Can Rise in 2020","(Bloomberg) -- A revamp of its European operations, an improved product mix and a ban on cheaper steel imports to India may bolster the fortunes of Tata Steel Ltd.’s shares, the least valued stock on the South Asian nation’s benchmark equities gauge.
Tata Steel shares have lost nearly half of their value since Jan. 2018 to trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 4.7, the lowest on the S&P BSE Sensex Index. The company, which last year got more than 50% of its sales abroad, last week outlined job cuts and other measures aimed at cutting costs in Europe, which it called a “dumping ground” for steel.
“Indian steel prices may have found a floor, thanks to the minimum import price, and have already started moving up,” said Siddharth Gadekar, an analyst at Equirus Securities Pvt., “That kind of stability in prices gives investors confidence.”
Tata Steel has been closing and selling plants in the U.K since the 2008 financial crisis to make its business there more profitable. It’s now focusing on India, and aims to ramp up capacity as demand is set to expand by as much as 7% in 2020, according to the World Steel Association. That’s the most among the top 10 steel using countries.
While protection from cheaper shipments from abroad will also benefit Tata Steel’s domestic peers, its valuation advantage, product mix and debt reduction steps may increase its appeal to investors. India imposed a minimum import price for steel products in 2016.
“Tata’s volume of sales should beat the rest of the industry because of their value for money offering, and their entrance into the pipeline steel category,” said Richard Leung, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, “The rest of the industry may see muted growth next year because of reliance on legacy demand like automobiles.”
To be sure, Tata Steel’s debt-to-equity ratio is higher than most local peers, largely due to its 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for about $13 billion and its acquisition of Bhushan Steel for about $5.3 billion last year. Still, Moody’s Investors Service said in a Nov. 25 note that the company’s European cost cuts will support a turnaround in less profitable operations that have hurt the company’s overall credit quality.
“In a down cycle the companies that have higher debt tend to trade at a discount,” said Equirus Securities’ Gadekar, “With their earnings profile and current steel prices, they can service their debt easily.”"

BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday partially overturned the convictions of Insys Therapeutics Inc's founder and three former executives accused of bribing doctors to prescribe an addictive opioid, but declined to disturb the remainder of the jury's verdict.
U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston ruled the evidence prosecutors presented at trial did not support finding that John Kapoor and the others intended for doctors to prescribe the drug, Subsys, to patients who did not need it. 
The ruling could impact the eventual sentence received by Kapoor, the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive to be convicted in a case tied to the deadly U.S. opioid addiction epidemic.
Chandler, Arizona-based Insys filed for bankruptcy in June days after striking a $225 million settlement with the U.S. Justice Department.
A federal jury found Kapoor, its onetime chairman, guilty in May of running a wide-ranging scheme to bribe doctors nationwide by retaining them to act as speakers at sham events ostensibly meant to educate clinicians about its fentanyl spray, Subsys.
But in her 85-page ruling, Burroughs said prosecutors failed to establish that Kapoor and his co-defendants intended for doctors to abdicate their duties to their patients and prescribed them Subsys for non-legitimate medical uses.
""Even though the evidence could be readily understood as proving that defendants did not care whether patients needed the drug, that still is not enough to prove the requisite intent,"" Burroughs wrote.
As a result, she vacated the convictions of Kapoor and three former executives, Richard Simon, Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan, for conspiring to illegally distribute a controlled substance and commit honest services fraud.
Those were some of the so-called predicate acts underlying their racketeering conspiracy conviction. She declined to overturn the related mail fraud and wire fraud convictions of those four and another former executive, Michael Gurry.
Burroughs said the evidence on those counts supported finding they carried out a scheme to bribe doctors and defraud insurers into paying for Subsys, which was approved only for treating pain in cancer patients.
Beth Wilkinson, Kapoor's lawyer, in a statement said: ""We have always believed that the government brought charges it could not sustain.""
She and other defense lawyers in court papers had claimed the illegal drug distribution charge if sustained could have resulted in longer prison sentences and Kapoor being sent to a prison reserved for ""leaders and organizers in the drug-dealing world.""

He and the others face sentencing in January.

Silver Lake is buying over 10% of Abu Dhabi-controlled City Football Group (CFG), the newspaper reported, adding that an official announcement was expected as early as Wednesday.
The deal was signed on Saturday by CFG Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and Silver Lake managing partner Egon Durban, according to the FT. The report added that Abu Dhabi aims to retain its majority ownership of CFG.
The U.S. private equity firm aims to hold its stake for about 10 years but could also seek to cash out through an initial public offering or selling to another private investor, FT reported. Silver Lake had also approached other European and English soccer clubs, including London's Chelsea Football Club.
The English Premier League champions drew in record revenue of 535.2 million pounds ($686.66 million) in a fifth consecutive year of profitability in 2018-19, marking their 11th straight year of revenue growth under the ownership of the Abu Dhabi royal family. The club won an unprecedented domestic treble last season.
CFG and Silver Lake were not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citadel's commodities investments are up at least $1 billion for the year, according to three sources familiar with the matter, helping to drive strong overall performance at one of the world's largest hedge funds. 
Citadel, which manages more than $30 billion in assets, has profited from a strong performance in European natural gas and power trading, two of the sources said. Its flagship Wellington fund has gained more than 15% this year through October, one source close to the fund said. 
A spokesperson for Citadel, led by Chicago billionaire Ken Griffin, declined to comment.
British and Dutch gas prices, benchmarks for Europe-wide gas sales as well as some liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets, lost half their value from September 2018 through October 2019. They hit 10-year lows in June, weighed down by an influx of LNG and gas supplies from Russia, the United States and others.
Citadel's hedge funds invest across asset classes such as equities, fixed income and credit. Commodities, one of Citadel's five core investment strategies, invests in both financial and physical markets.
Hedge fund industry returns have been muted in recent years prompting some big names to wind down operations, such as Jamison Capital's macro fund, T. Boone Pickens'  BP  (LON:BP) Capital and Andy Hall's main hedge fund at Astenbeck Capital Management.
Citadel is among a handful of multi-strategy funds that have performed well despite the challenging commodities trading environment. 
Industry returns have averaged about 5%, according to the Hedge Fund Research (HFR) asset weighted composite index while returns in the HFR macro commodity index have averaged gains of about 4% year-to-date. 

Earlier this month, Citadel named firm veteran James Yeh president and co-chief investment officer for Citadel's hedge fund business, effective Jan. 1, 2020, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

Dell is the third-biggest PC maker after China's  Lenovo Group Ltd  (HK:0992) and HP Inc (N:HPQ), with the business accounting for nearly half of its total revenue.
""Intel CPU shortages have worsened qtr-over-qtr, impacting our commercial PC and premium consumer PC Q4 forecasted shipments,"" Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Clarke said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
Intel said last month that demand for its processors used in PCs was outstripping its ability to add capacity, prompting it to rely on contract manufacturers to ease shortage.
Dell's PC business had a strong quarter, with sales rising 4.6% to $11.41 billion and mirroring upbeat results from rival HP, which also reported earnings on Tuesday. 
Revenue from Dell's server and networking unit, however, dropped 16% to $4.24 billion in the third quarter ended Nov. 1, while sales in its VMware (N:VMW) unit rose 11.4%.
The PC maker said excluding China, its server business was down mid- to high-single digits in the quarter and that demand for servers will ""remain challenged"". 
The company cut its fiscal 2020 revenue forecast to between $91.5 billion and $92.2 billion from between $92.7 billion and $94.2 billion. 
The Texas-based company reported total revenue of $22.84 billion for the latest quarter, narrowly missing estimates of $23.04 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Dell's net income was $552 million, compared with a loss of $895 million a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.75 per share, while analysts were expecting a profit of $1.62 per share.

The U.S. air regulator also repeated that it has not completed its review of the 737 MAX aircraft design changes and associated pilot training.
In a letter sent to Boeing on Tuesday, the FAA said it ""has determined that the public interest and safety in air commerce require that the FAA retain authority to issue airworthiness certificates and export certificates of airworthiness for all 737 MAX airplanes.""
The agency said it will keep the authority to issue the certificates until it is confident Boeing has ""fully functional quality control and verification processes in place"" and that other Boeing procedures meet all regulatory standards.
""We continue to follow the lead of the FAA and global regulators,"" Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said by email. ""They will determine when key milestones are achieved and when the fleet and training requirements are certified so the MAX can safely return to service.""
Boeing said earlier this month it expected the FAA would unground the 737 MAX planes around mid-December even though it did not expect the agency to complete its review of revised training requirements until January.
The 737 MAX, Boeing's best-selling plane, has been grounded worldwide since March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people.

The company still has many hurdles to complete including a certification test flight that has not yet been scheduled and simulator work with international pilots. It must also complete a software documentation audit.

839,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 05:42PM ET</span>","Uber drives up prices for shared rides, Chicago data reveals","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - How much ride-hailing companies Uber and  Lyft  charge customers throughout a day is one of the most closely held secrets in Silicon Valley. 
But a law in Chicago requiring the companies to disclose fare data shines a light on how at least one of the former ""unicorns"" is trying to turn a profit for the first time.
A Reuters analysis of the data shows fares for shared rides in the city have risen significantly over the past year, while fares for single riders have remained stable. 
The price increases for shared rides predominantly affect Chicago's low-income neighborhoods, which is where most of the carpool rides are booked, the analysis showed. Over this period of increased fares, carpool ridership fell.
For a graphic on Shared rides decline in Chicago as prices rise, click https://graphics.reuters.com/UBER-PRICING-CHICAGO/0100B32T293/uber-pricing-chicago.jpg 
The Chicago data does not differentiate between rides operated by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), or smaller ride-share rival Via. Data by Second Measure, which tracks credit card expenditures, estimates that Uber commands a roughly 72% market share in Chicago. The data also does not indicate whether similar strategies are being rolled out in other cities. 
The fare changes in Chicago show an attempt to reduce discounts for customers in order to help convince investors that ride-hailing can be a profitable business model. 
But the shift comes with political risks, as cities from Chicago to London take ride-hailing companies to task over congestion, driver treatment and passenger rights. On Monday, regulators in London stripped Uber's license for the second time in just over two years, pending an appeal, over a ""pattern of failures"" on safety and security.
After reviewing the findings from the Chicago data, Uber said it has traditionally seen losses in its shared Pool rides segment. Earlier this month, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said Uber was ""losing significant sums"" due to heavy discounts on those rides.
""We want Pool to be available to as many people and in as many cities as possible, and to do that it has to be financially sustainable for years to come"" through measures including pricing and better algorithms to find more pool riders, an Uber spokesman said.
Lyft declined to comment on its pricing strategy, but said shared rides have increased access to affordable and reliable transportation, particularly in neighborhoods under served by public transit and passed over by taxis. 
Lyft said that given Uber controls nearly two-thirds of the Chicago market, the data most closely reflected Uber's strategy, and noted its own data did not show a decrease in shared rides.
Via, the smallest Chicago player almost exclusively focused on shared rides with an estimated 1% market share, also declined to comment on pricing but said its own interpretation of the Chicago data was consistent with the analysis.
""In city after city, we have seen that there is far more price sensitivity with pooled rides than with private, single passenger ones,"" Via said, adding that it was crucial for fees and taxes on shared rides to stay low in order to decrease congestion.  
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has proposed taxes on ride-hailing services to combat congestion, by increasing the tax for solo trips and lowering taxes on shared rides. She also is pushing a new surcharge of $1.75 on weekday rides in the downtown area. 
Chicago's city council on Tuesday approved the congestion tax changes as part of the city's 2020 budget. 
Uber and Lyft, which have supported congestion taxes in New York and other cities, are fighting Lightfoot's congestion proposal, calling it unfair for not including regular taxi services and disproportionately hurting lower-income residents. 
They also said Lightfoot's measure helps some of the city's richest parts in the north, dominated by white residents, while hurting predominantly black and Hispanic residents on the South and West Side. 
Lightfoot, Chicago's first female African-American mayor, has rejected those claims, accusing Uber of stirring up racial tensions in opposition to the proposal.
Uber and Lyft put forward an alternative taxation plan that was rejected by the city as doing too little to ease downtown congestion. Uber in a statement said it wished Chicago would remove fees on shared rides altogether.
The Reuters analysis of more than one million Chicago rides between January and September 2019 - the only full quarters for which the city currently makes data available - found that fares per mile increased 13% for shared rides. But they remained unchanged for private rides. 
Shared rides fell to about a third of all rides in a group of the least affluent neighborhoods of Chicago in the third quarter from about half of rides in the first.  
Presented with Reuters' pricing analysis, city representatives said they interpreted the data as an attempt by the companies to change customer behavior.    
""We have real concerns about the claims these companies make because actually they're the ones causing the pain to the communities in terms of cost, not the mayor's plan,"" said Rosa Escareno, Chicago's Commissioner of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection who led the congestion policy.
Uber declined to directly comment on the city's allegations, but said it made no sense that passengers in a solo taxi ride downtown will pay no tax while those taking a shared trip far from downtown will.

Lyft said the Mayor ""is attempting to distract from what her plan will do: backtrack on her campaign promises and raise the cost of transportation in Chicago for communities who can least afford it.""

In the meeting, while addressing members of the European Parliament, Barnier said the 11 months from Britain's planned EU exit on Jan. 31 until the end of its transition period would normally not be enough to negotiate a trade agreement, the newspaper reported. 
But he added that Brussels will strive to have a deal in place for the end of 2020, according to the report.
Barnier also said issues beyond the scope of the trade pact, such as concluding an agreement on road freight and aircraft takeoff and landing rights, could take longer, with the option for Brussels to take contingency measures to prevent economic disruption if talks were to continue past the end of 2020, the report said.
Barnier said cooperation with the UK on security and defense was also a top priority for the EU in the talks, according to the FT.

Barnier's reported remarks follow his comments earlier this month when he said negotiations on a future trading relationship with Britain would be ""difficult and demanding,"" as the bloc ""will not tolerate unfair competitive advantage"".

A deluge of data on inflation, jobless claims, housing, GDP and durable goods orders is on the calendar for Wednesday as a results of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. Investors will likely look to the data to gauge whether current fears that the economy is set for a slowdown in fourth quarter are misplaced.
1. Jobless Claims, Durable Goods, Inflation on Watch 
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will report its second reading of third-quarter 2019 gross domestic product at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect that third-quarter growth stayed at annual rate of 1.9% from its first measure and down from 2.0% in the second quarter, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The Commerce Department will report October's orders for goods lasting three years or more and October data for the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge at 8:30 AM ET.
The decline in durable goods orders is expected to have shrunk to 0.5% in October, following a 1.1% decline a month earlier.
Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are predicted to have rebounded last month, rising 0.2% following a 0.4% decline the prior month.
The Fed's preferred inflation measurem core PCE - which calculates price changes minus volatile food and energy costs – is expected to have risen 0.2% in October, but remain unchanged at 1.7% from a year earlier.
On the labor market, economists forecast that initial jobless claims fell to 223,000 from 227,000 previously.
2. Housing, Consumer Spending in Focus
The National Association of Realtors will provide an update on pending home sales at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
On average, economists predict that pending home sales slowed to 0.2% in October, compared with a 1.5% increase in the prior month.
The health of the U.S. consumer will also come into focus, with personal income for October forecast to again post a rise of 0.3%, while personal spending is expected to have increased 0.3% from 0.2%.
3. U.S. Oil Inventories to Decline?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report is due Wednesday, with many keen for clues on whether last month's smaller-than-expected build is a sign of things to come.
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 418,000 barrels for the week ended Nov. 22. A week ago, the EIA reported a build in crude of 1.379 million barrels. While large, that was smaller than expected and helped oil prices move higher.
Crude oil futures rose 0.7% to settle at $58.41 a barrel on positive U.S.-China trade headlines and hopes that OPEC will announce further production cuts at a meeting next week. But If the oil cartel and its allies fail to signal further cuts, oil prices could drop sharply.
""(i)t seems doubtful whether OPEC is willing to do this,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said, warning that ""oil prices risk dropping sharply in December if there is disappointment at an insufficient OPEC decision.""
Late Tuesday, ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released dat that showed weekly crude stockpiles rose by about 3.6 million barrels the week before. While the API data is not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, it often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels. "

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Blackwells is pushing to remove Tom Barrack, a billionaire friend of President Donald Trump, as CEO of Colony Capital, saying his mismanagement of the real estate and investment firm has cost shareholders billions of dollars in lost gains.
Blackwells, which owns a 1.85% stake in Colony Capital, also wants to install five new directors on the company's board, saying investors have soured on the company and will return only when a new leader is named and independent directors are seated.
Colony Capital's share price has tumbled 20% to trade at $4.78 since Barrack, the executive chairman, was named to the additional post of CEO a year ago.
""It is time for Mr. Barrack to go and for the Board to be reconstituted with truly independent and experienced business leaders, who can provide effective and constructive oversight,"" Jason Aintabi, Blackwells' chief investment officer said in a statement.
Blackwells said Barrack was responsible for a three way merger in 2016 that the hedge fund says cost shareholders $6 billion in wealth. It also said the current board for was too deferential to Barrack. 
The hedge fund said it plans to nominate directors at next year's annual meeting who have experience in finance, asset management, commercial real estate, hotel and casino management and restructuring and corporate governance.
Colony Capital said it values constructive engagement with its shareholders and has been taking ""meaningful steps to simplify its business, rationalize its balance sheet"" and control expenses. The company also said its pivot to digital strategies should boost efficiency. The statement did not discuss the CEO.
The announcement comes just months after Blackwells and Colony Capital, which invests $53 billion, in February announced that they had worked together to seat two new directors and agreed on naming a third.
The hedge fund also called Barrack, who chaired Trump's Inaugural Committee, a distracted CEO. The inaugural committee has been probed by congress and federal agencies.
""Three things are necessary for Colony to succeed again,"" Aintabi wrote. ""The Company must be simplified, must be led by a respected executive with significant public markets experience and must have a Board that is fully independent and willing to exert influence and oversight even when the decisions are uncomfortable.""

Blackwells intends to nominate former Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) executive Jennifer Hill, former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) executive William Johnson, former OneMain CEO Jay Levine, former co-CEO of Ares Commercial Real Estate Corp. Todd Schuster and Eldorado Resorts board member David Tomick as directors.

The S&P 500 was up 0.22%. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.20% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.18%.
Helping the market was a comment from President Donald Trump saying a phase one trade agreement with China was close, though he didn't say how close.

Also hitting new highs were Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Allstate (NYSE:ALL) and Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST).
A big loser was Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), suffering because tariffs on Chinese imports were squeezing profits. Shares fell 15.2%, the biggest decliner among stocks in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 Index.
Adding some additional cheer was the Commerce Department's new home sales report, which showed October sales down 0.7% but September sales revised up to 738,000 units, the highest level since July 2007 – just before the financial crisis hit.
Homebuilder shares moved higher as well, led by NVR (NYSE:NVR) and luxury builder Hovnanian (NYSE:HOV).
The report also boosted shares of   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD), Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) and Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW).

Gold rose modestly. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 40 cents to $58.41 a barrel. Brent Oil Futures crude for February delivery rose 59 cents to $63.21. OPEC meets next week.
Interest rates were lower with the 10-Year Treasury yield falling to 1.738% from Monday's 1.764%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. lawmakers behind a bill to stop a large federal retirement pension plan from investing in a fund that includes China-listed shares said the pension plan's administrators are being misleading about what their bill entails.
The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) said last week the bipartisan legislation would, if passed, deprive participants in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) it manages of a significant opportunity for better returns. The plan is similar to a private 401(k) and has around $600 billion in assets.
Senators Marco Rubio and Jeanne Shaheen introduced the TSP Act on Nov. 6 at a time of heightened trade tensions with China and efforts to limit the flow of U.S. capital to Chinese companies due to security concerns.
In a letter to the bill's backers, the FRTIB said the legislation was discriminatory and, as written, would prevent the board from offering any international investing option to its participants.
Rubio's office denied that was the case.
""Not only is the FRTIB analysis of the bipartisan TSP Act deeply flawed, the Board's claim that there is no international index available that meets the bill's criteria is categorically false,"" Rubio spokesman Nick Iacovella said in a statement to Reuters late on Monday.
The bill would only stop the FRTIB from investing in China A-Shares, Iacovella said.
""Either the Board is concerningly unaware of the many international indices that do not include China A-Shares, or they are being purposefully misleading,"" he said, without giving an example of such an index.
The FRTIB decided in 2017 to switch the benchmark for its international stock fund to the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S.A. Investable Market Index, which represents 99% of world equities, including China-listed stocks, from its current benchmark which excludes Canada and emerging markets.
The senators backing the bill are trying to block the move on the grounds that some of those companies are involved in the Chinese government's military activities, human rights abuses and industrial policy.
They say the FRTIB can stick with its current benchmark, but the Board contends that would not meet the requirements of the senators' legislation, either.
FRTIB spokeswoman Kim Weaver said on Tuesday the board stood by its analysis.
""There is no logic behind not allowing TSP investors to access the same index that's used by the top 10 companies in America, the top 10 defense contractors, and the top 20 state plans,"" she said."
847,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 04:42PM ET</span>",Exhausted worker's plea for rest spurs breakthrough in Canada rail strike: union,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - As Canada's biggest rail strike in a decade dragged on with no resolution in sight, the recorded pleas of an exhausted rail worker who wanted a break after a 10-hour shift helped deliver a critical breakthrough, a union leader told Reuters on Tuesday.
The audio recording http://teamsterscanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2018-Oct-19-exhausted-worker.mp3, released on Monday by Teamsters Canada, cut to the heart of workers' demands in the eight-day-old strike, which rippled through the country's economy from disrupted grain exports to planned layoffs. 
While Reuters could not independently verify the recording, its release helped change public perception and acted as a catalyst for a deal reached on Tuesday with Canadian National Railway Co (TO:CNR), Teamsters Canada President François Laporte said.
The recording featured a conductor who wanted approval from government regulator Transport Canada before moving a train after a 10-hour shift.
""We are not refusing duty. You can log that. I have told you on recording that we are unfit for duty. We're past our 10th hour. We're up to almost 11 hours,"" the conductor says.
The supervisor responds if he does not move the train, he will consider it refusing to do the job and will request an investigation.
""Sir, that's your call. ...If I take this train now and we hit somebody, who is responsible for that now?"" the conductor asks.
Teamsters, the union representing 3,200 CN workers, declined to disclose the name of the conductor but said he ultimately did not move the train and was suspended for 14 days without pay. 
CN, which said on Monday that it is aware of the recording, did not offer an immediate comment on Tuesday.
Transport Canada said on Monday it had not received a complaint regarding the recording. 
Transport Minister Marc Garneau on Tuesday declined to comment on the recording, but told reporters in Ottawa that efforts are under way by his government to improve fatigue management in the rail sector. 
""This is the kind of situation we want to avoid,"" Laporte said of the recording. ""We have to protect our people."" 
The agreement reached with CN Rail, Canada's largest railroad, will better protect thousands of workers from being reprimanded in cases where they are too tired to safely operate trains, Laporte said in an interview.
""When you repeat that you're fatigued, you won't be subject to discipline,"" Laporte told Reuters. 

The tentative agreement must still be ratified by union members, including conductors and yard workers, with a vote expected in eight weeks, CN said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks crawled higher on Tuesday, and all three major Wall Street indexes notched record levels, as upbeat comments by President Donald Trump on trade talks eclipsed some softer-than-anticipated economic data.
Trump said the United States and China were close to an agreement on the first phase of a deal, while stressing Washington's support for protesters in Hong Kong, a point of contention between the world's two largest economies.
""Right now the characterization is things are pretty good so we are kind of gaining on it, but until it is done, it is not done,"" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""So a holding pattern is probably, unfortunately, a very appropriate place for the market to be right about now.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 55.21 points, or 0.2%, to 28,121.68, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 6.88 points, or 0.22%, to 3,140.52 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 15.45 points, or 0.18%, to 8,647.93.
Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) gained 1.30% after a report that its streaming service was averaging nearly 1 million new subscribers a day. The stock helped keep the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the plus side, providing about 20 points to the upside.
Rising hopes for a trade deal between the world's two largest economies, solid U.S. economic indicators and a third-quarter corporate earnings season that has largely topped lowered expectations have pushed stocks higher. The three major indexes have now notched a record close in five of the past eight sessions.
Also supporting stocks has been the dovish turn by the Federal Reserve, which has cut interest rates three times this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday that monetary policy was ""well positioned"" to support the strong labor market.
Investors are watching for signs on the health of the consumer for the holiday shopping season. Consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November but remained at levels sufficient to support a steady pace of consumer spending, according to data on Tuesday. A separate report showed that new home sales unexpectedly dropped in October, although data for the prior month was revised up, with purchases hitting their highest level in over 12 years.
Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. The consumer discretionary sector (SPLRCD) rose 0.81% and provided the biggest boost, led by a 9.86% jump in shares of  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) following a strong holiday-quarter profit forecast.
In contrast,  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) tumbled 15.24% after it projected holiday-quarter profit below estimates, signaling the fallout from the trade dispute.
Best Buy was the best performer on the S&P 500, while Dollar Tree was the biggest drag on both the S&P and the Nasdaq.
Among other stocks,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co  (N:HPE) fell 8.48% as the enterprise software maker missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.96 billion shares, compared to the 7.12 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Trading volume is expected to lighten considerably in the sessions surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 66 new lows.

Treasuries rose.
The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite climbed to fresh records. China said earlier that negotiators “reached consensus” on certain issues in a phone call and agreed to stay in contact on the remaining points. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index edged higher for a third day, while Asian shares were mixed.
“This phase one trade agreement between the U.S. and China would be at least a step in the right direction,” said Dave Campbell, a principal of San Francisco-based BOS, which manages about $4.5 billion. “Markets would interpret that pretty positively -- in fact, they’re already starting to lean that way.”
The dollar was mixed versus major peers after five consecutive days of gains. Brazil’s central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market for the first time in three months, selling greenbacks to prop up the real after it slumped to a record low. Crude oil gained.
Hopes that a partial trade deal is just around the corner have pushed a global benchmark of stocks to within 1% of an all-time high. A flurry of buyouts has also helped.
”We’re getting to the point where they need to show us the money,” said Michael Reynolds, investment strategy officer at Glenmede Trust Co. “Talk is one thing but an actual deal on paper, pen to paper, is what is going to dramatically change the market narrative.”
Investors are continuing to weigh the dispute’s impact on the world’s largest economy. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard painted a mostly positive picture of the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy while advocating longer-term changes in the conduct of monetary policy in an era of low interest rates and subdued inflation.
Elsewhere, Bitcoin fell for a 10th day, its longest losing streak on record.

LONDON (Reuters) - British annual car production will drop by a third to 1 million by 2024 if Brexit leads to tariffs with the European Union, a trade body warned on Tuesday, saying output would be lost to other countries. 
Britons head to the polls in just over two weeks to elect a new government with Prime Minister Boris Johnson promising to pass his Brexit deal as soon as possible, whilst the opposition Labour Party would renegotiate and call a referendum in 2020.
If Johnson, leading in the polls, is re-elected, next year is set to be dominated by talks with Brussels on future trading terms, with British automakers seeking the continuation of free and frictionless trade with their largest export market. 
The sector, Britain's biggest exporter of goods, warned on Tuesday that World Trade Organisation tariffs on components imported into Britain and exported vehicles would add more than 3.2 billion pounds ($4 billion) a year to manufacturing costs in the worst case scenario.
""By 2024, falling demand and model reallocation to more competitive and welcoming production locations would see annual output falling to just 1 million vehicles per year,"" the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. 
Production stood at 1.5 million cars in Britain last year but has fallen by 16% so far this year, hit by a slump in demand for diesel vehicles, falling sales in China and a hit to consumer confidence due to Brexit uncertainty.
Honda (T:7267) and Ford (N:F) have announced plant closures this year but both blamed factors other than Brexit. 
 Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) has said a decision to keep open its Vauxhall car factory in northern England is dependent on the final terms of Brexit. 

""The next government must deliver the ambition, the competitive business environment and the commitment needed to keep automotive in Britain,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday set out a procedure to protect its telecommunications networks and their supply chains from national security threats, saying it would consider whether to bar transactions on a case-by-case basis.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in May declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing national security risks. The order was widely seen as being aimed at Chinese firms such as telecoms equipment market leader Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (HK:0763).
The Trump administration added Huawei to its trade blacklist in May, citing national security concerns, but has issued licenses to allow some U.S. companies to continue to do business with the world's second-largest smartphone maker, a leader in next-generation 5G network technology. 
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that Secretary Wilbur Ross had chosen to adopt a ""case-by-case, fact-specific approach to determine which transactions must be prohibited, or which can be mitigated.""
The outlined approach, in a proposed rule, does not mention either Huawei or ZTE.
""These actions will safeguard the Information and Communications Technology Supply Chain,"" said Ross said in a statement. ""These rules demonstrate our commitment to securing the digital economy, while also delivering on President Trump’s commitment to our digital infrastructure.
Trump's May order invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president authority to regulate commerce in response to a threat to the United States.
It directed the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up an enforcement plan by October.
Trump's order said Ross, in consultation with other U.S. agencies, can bar transactions from firms connected to ""a foreign adversary"" that pose a national security risk, including those that ""pose an undue risk of sabotage or subversion.""
The Commerce Department said the procedure unveiled Tuesday is open to public comment before it becomes final, but that the determination of ""foreign adversaries"" is solely at Ross's discretion. It also gives Ross the power to immediately prohibit or revise transactions that pose national security risks.
On Friday, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to designate Huawei and ZTE as national security risks, barring their U.S. rural carrier customers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase Huawei or ZTE equipment.

Huawei argued the FCC's decision was based on ""nothing more than irrational speculation and innuendo."" China said on Monday the United States should stop abusing the concept of national security and abusing Chinese companies.

DETROIT (Reuters) - A battery-powered Lincoln SUV, due in mid-2022, will be the first  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) vehicle built on a custom electrified chassis that resembles a skateboard, which was developed by Ford-backed startup Rivian, according to several people familiar with the program.
The all-wheel-drive Lincoln SUV could compete against Rivian's R1S, an electric sport utility vehicle slated to go into production in early 2021 that will be priced from $72,500. Both models will use Rivian's so-called skateboard, a flexible platform that combines electric motors, batteries, controls and suspension.
On Tuesday, Ford declined to comment. Rivian did not respond to a request for comment.
The new Lincoln, which carries the internal program code U787, also could compete with premium offerings from others, including General Motors Co (N:GM), which plans to introduce at least two new electric SUVs by 2023, one for Cadillac and one that could revive the Hummer name, sources have said.
Ford invested $500 million in Rivian this year and plans to help it begin production next year at a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois.
When Ford made the investment, it said it would use Rivian's skateboard to develop its own electric vehicle, but did not disclose details.
It is not clear where Ford intends to build the Lincoln SUV, which will be among the first of several battery-powered utility vehicles planned for Ford's premium brand in North America and China, according to supplier sources familiar with those programs who asked not to be identified.
Ford expects to introduce a compact Lincoln electric crossover in late 2021 or early 2022 and a mid-size companion in 2023, the sources said.
The U.S. auto industry plans to invest billions of dollars over the next few years to build all-electric pickups and SUVs, sectors of the market that have been among the most profitable, especially for Detroit-based automakers.
But analysts have questioned whether demand from consumers and commercial customers will come close to matching production.
Founded in 2009, Rivian has raised $1.9 billion from investors, including e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. The first Amazon vans will be built in Normal and are to be delivered in 2021.
Ford aims to sell an electric F-series pickup in late 2021, sources have said. It also will offer the electric Mustang Mach E SUV next year as part of plans to invest $11.5 billion by 2022 electrifying its vehicles."

Investing.com - Pivotal Research cut its price target on Amazon.com to $2,100 from $2,500 Tuesday after lowering its growth estimates for the tech giant. Pivotal analyst Michael Levine questioned if the company can meet analysts' somewhat lofty growth estimates at a time when its retail gross profit has slowed and its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (or AWS) has slumped.
The new target is in line with the consensus 12-month target of 48 analysts tracked by Investing.com. That target is about $2,150, which implies an upside of about 20%. 
Privotal is projecting {{0|Amazon.com]] will earn $4.11 per share in the fourth quarter, a touch ahead of the $4.08 consensus fourth-quarter estimate of analysts compiled by Investing.com. That would be down from $6.04 a share in the 2018 fourth quarter. Revenue is projected to rise about 18.8% to nearly $86 billion. 
 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was up more than 1% on the day Tuesday afternoon. The market values the stock fairly richly. Its forward price-earnings ratio is 65. 
""We are cutting our target multiples. Enterprise value/gross merchandise value on retail goes to 1x from 1.25x and our AWS multiple goes to 15x EV/EBITDA, down from 17.5x,"" Pivitol said. ""We believe 1Q20 --the next catalyst along with 4Q19 earnings-- is clearly modeled too high.""
Pivotal did recognize, however, that growth will likely return in the second quarter of 2020 thanks to the introduction of one-day shipping and a slowdown in the pace of margin decline, but the firm said it is ""not clear to that the bounce back will be as strong as people expect.""
With its rollout of its one-day Prime shipping program across the U.S. underway and plans to expand the concept globally, Amazon.com could elevate shipping costs as well as generate a new investment cycle in fulfillment center capacity, Pivotal added. "

855,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>",Trump Says China Deal in ‘Final Throes’ as Top Officials Speak,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
President Donald Trump declared Tuesday that talks with China on the first phase of a trade deal were near completion after negotiators from both sides spoke by phone, signaling progress on an accord in the works for nearly two years.
“We’re in the final throes of a very important deal,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “It’s going very well.”
Trump announced Oct. 11 that he had reached the outlines of a “substantial” but partial deal that would see China ramp up purchases of U.S. farm goods, make new commitments to protect U.S. intellectual property, refrain from manipulating its currency and further open its financial sector to foreign investors. Since then, the two sides have been wrangling over how to put the deal on paper and what tariffs the U.S. will drop in exchange.
The negotiations have been complicated by strong support in the U.S. for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong and China’s suspicions that the U.S. is feeding unrest in the territory. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. wanted to see things “go well in Hong Kong” but added that he was confident of a good outcome.
Chinese President Xi Jinping “can make that happen,” Trump said. “I know him and I know he’d like to make it happen.”
Trump gave no indication Tuesday about whether he would sign legislation Congress passed last week backing the protest movement in Hong Kong. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has warned of “strong countermeasures” in response to the measure.
Trump’s comments came after officials on both sides signaled talks were back on track toward an interim deal after negotiators from the world’s two largest economies spoke by telephone.
Negotiators are “getting really close” to completing the first phase, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News early Tuesday. She told reporters that the sides continue to negotiate sticking points including forced technology transfer and alleged theft of intellectual property, adding that “things like this take awhile.”
In a statement, China’s Ministry of Commerce said officials “reached consensus on properly resolving relevant issues” and agreed to stay in contact on the remaining points in phase one. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office confirmed a conversation took place, but declined to comment on the contents.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed core concerns, according to China’s statement, which didn’t provide further details.
As the phase-one talks progress through the final stages, people familiar with the details have said the contours will include U.S. assurances of no additional tariffs and the rollback of existing ones -- a key Chinese demand. The American side wants Beijing’s pledge of billions in purchases of U.S. commodities -- a deliverable Trump wants for his rural base. A date and place to sign the deal still hasn’t been decided.
Stocks in Asia gained and U.S. equities touched new highs on optimism that the countries won’t escalate a tariff war that’s dragged on for 20 months and involves about $500 billion in products traded between them.
Talks on the limited deal have continued since it was first announced in October, with both sides making concessions recently on issues such as food imports, intellectual property and tech giant Huawei Technologies Co. Liu, China’s chief negotiator, said last week that he was “cautiously optimistic” about concluding a phase one deal, but the lack of a deadline and comments from Trump and others have led to speculation that talks could extend into next year.
If a phase-one deal does not materialize before Dec. 15, Trump will have to choose whether to carry out his previous threat to impose 15% tariffs on some $160 billion in imports from China.
Trump said last week that a trade deal with China “can’t be like an even deal” because the U.S. is “starting off from the floor” and China is “already at the ceiling.”
“Key is what happens if we do not get a deal by 15 December,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group in Singapore. “Will the U.S. agree to suspend the tariffs out of goodwill?”
Trump is also facing questions at home over how meaningful an interim deal will be and whether it will lead to further rounds of negotiations.
Even if a first phase deal is signed, it is expected to skirt more difficult issues such as U.S. concern about Chinese industrial subsidies and other forms of protectionism. Similarly, from the Chinese side it is unlikely to address what Beijing sees as systematic American attempts to shut out Chinese technology companies from the U.S. market over security threats as well as their access to American components.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday released new proposed rules that would give it the power to restrict U.S. imports of foreign technology and their use in domestic supply chains and infrastructure.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 02:16PM ET</span>","Federal prosecutors open criminal probe of opioid makers, distributors: WSJ","(Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into whether pharmaceutical companies intentionally allowed opioid painkillers to flood communities, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
At least six companies have received grand-jury subpoenas from the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of New York - Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA),  Mallinckrodt  Plc (N:MNK), Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc (N:AMRX) and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK), the Journal reported.
Shares of Amneal, Teva and McKesson fell between 3% and 7%, while AmerisourceBergen and Mallinckrodt were down marginally.
The subpoenas were in connection with a Brooklyn federal probe, the Journal reported.
A spokesman for the Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office declined to comment. 
The probe is in early stages and prosecutors are expected to send subpoenas to other companies in the coming months, the report said, citing one of the sources.
The companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Teva, J&J, Amneal and Mallinckrodt disclosed in recent regulatory filings that they received subpoenas from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, which the companies generally described as regarding their anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of opioid medications. 
The companies said it was part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. 
Teva, Mallinckrodt and J&J also said they had received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services as part of an industry-wide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums. 
Opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacy chains have been defending themselves against thousands of lawsuits by state attorneys general, local governments and class actions accusing them of fueling an addiction crisis.
Opioids have contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997, according to government statistics.

857,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 02:08PM ET</span>","U.S.-China Ties Grow Stronger, If Only in the Bond Market","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Those who fear an impending cold war between the U.S. and China need only look to the bond market to see evidence of a potential thaw.
In the midst of a holiday-shortened week for American markets, China easily sold a record $6 billion of dollar-denominated bonds, accumulating $20 billion of investor orders that allowed it to tighten yield spreads for a lower borrowing cost, Bloomberg News reported. While hardly unexpected — this is the third straight time the country has borrowed in the U.S. currency around this time of year — it nevertheless sends a clear signal to global investors that the ongoing trade dispute with the U.S. isn’t going to stop China from integrating itself and local issuers into worldwide financial markets. And it likely suggests a limit to how far any sort of lasting tensions between the two largest economies can go.
China’s Ministry of Finance has said one goal of its dollar-debt sales is to help build a benchmark yield curve for Chinese issuers. That would serve two functions: It would allow its multi-national firms to raise funds in the U.S. currency more easily, while simultaneously giving Chinese banks a local option to allocate dollar deposits. Thanks to this week’s deal, which had portions due from three years to 20 years, China will have now have dollar debt that matures from 2022 all the way to a small portion in 2096.
It’s important to remember that China doesn’t need to do this. It has all the access to the greenback it would likely ever need in the form of its $1.1 trillion of U.S. Treasury holdings. Selling a sliver of its Treasuries would effectively serve the same purpose as a dollar-bond sale, only it would somewhat weaken the link between the two countries. Creating the foundation for a more robust dollar-debt market in China, on the other hand, does the opposite. Already, that market exceeds $740 billion, with sales in 2019 on pace to reach an all-time high.
Even at this massive size, Chinese dollar bonds (and those from other countries, too) are still ultimately subject to the whims of U.S. officials. Earlier this year, the Trump administration was reportedly discussing ways to limit U.S. investors’ portfolio flows into China, such as by delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges and limiting Americans’ exposure to China’s market through government pension funds. They cited Beijing’s restrictions on the release of some financial information and unusual influence over private companies.
Many investors view such a move by the U.S. as mostly self-destructive, similar to how they react to any fear-mongering over China dumping its Treasuries and causing a sharp spike in yields. The vastly integrated financial markets, in other words, are seen as the red line that neither country will want to cross in a long-lasting standoff.
China’s further foray into dollar bonds only strengthens that thesis. For as much as the country throws its weight around, its financial system is simply nowhere near that of the U.S. The yuan is not a major foreign currency. Its bond market is comparatively underdeveloped and opaque, and, on top of that, S&P Global Markets predicts that onshore corporate-debt defaults will reach a record high in 2020. Relative to other developed-market economies, China lacks large institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds.
For those reasons, it’s questionable to conclude that the U.S. and China are truly in the “foothills of a cold war” that could morph into something worse than World War I, as Henry Kissinger described it earlier this month. For as far apart as the countries may seem on a range of issues, from trade to intellectual property and human rights, they’re pretty much as close as ever in the financial markets. It’s never a bad idea to follow the money. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said on Tuesday it had filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow companies going public to raise capital through a direct listing, instead of an initial public offering. 
This new hybrid model comes after criticism by venture capital investors of the traditional IPO, which for decades has been the route to the public markets for companies such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT). 
""Will this displace the traditional IPO? No, but is it another pathway we are providing companies to come to the public markets and to have investors participate and (have) growth opportunities? Yes,"" Vice Chairman and Chief Commercial Officer John Tuttle said in a telephone interview about the plan by NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE). 
A direct listing has so far differed from an IPO because it does not raise fresh funds; rather, it is a way for existing investors to monetize their shares. 
In 2018, music streaming business  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) pioneered direct listing followed in 2019 by communication platform  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK). Both had successful market debuts but their share prices have since struggled. 
Venture capital investors have backed direct listings as a better way to price newly public shares. Direct listings also avoid restrictions on stock sales by insiders, which often includes venture capitalists, and are less costly than an IPO, in which companies pay banks to underwrite a share offering and to stabilize their share price if needed. 
In this new direct model, all of the shares being offered by a company - so-called primary shares - are to be sold in the first trade to a variety of buyers. Stock owned by existing investors - referred to as secondary shares - can be sold throughout the first day of trading.
The new model will make a direct listing more attractive to companies but it will not dislodge the IPO overnight as the most popular route to the public market, according to Greg Rodgers, a partner law firm Latham & Watkins who worked on the Spotify and Slack offerings. 
""For the foreseeable future, issuing primary capital in this way will be quite novel,"" Rodgers said. 
Bill Gurley, a partner at venture capital firm Benchmark Capital and one of the biggest proponents of direct listings, has complained banks have been ""fleecing"" companies by pricing shares low so that they pop on their first trading day.

The last day of subscription for the retail tranche of the share sale is Nov. 28, it said. Aramco launched the IPO on Nov. 3.

Fears that SEB could be dragged into a dirty money scandal that has rocked Nordic rivals  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) and  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) sent SEB shares plunging 13% on November 15 after SEB said it had been contacted regarding money-laundering by public broadcaster SVT's investigative news program ""Uppdrag Granskning"".
SEB CEO Johan Torgeby said in a statement on Tuesday: ""In the comprehensive analysis that we have made of our business in the Baltics, we have not seen that SEB has been used for money laundering in a systematic way.""
""Still, at any given time, all banks are subjected to the risks that financial crime entail.""
SEB's statement said the bank had handled transactions of 84.6 billion euros from non-resident clients in Estonia between 2005-2018. It said that of that total, 25.8 billion euros were from ""low transparency"" customers.
Last week, SEB had received a list of 194 of corporate clients from SVT a day before the broadcast of its program investigating money-laundering in the Baltics.
SEB has said customer relationships had been terminated with about 95% of clients whose names were supplied by SVT, and that the bank had reported any suspect activities to financial police."

862,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 01:12PM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Warnings on Warren Turn Into Bet by One Hedge Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- For weeks now, some of Wall Street’s biggest names -- Paul Tudor Jones, Steve Cohen, Leon Cooperman -- have been arguing that an Elizabeth Warren presidency would sink U.S. financial markets.Those were just idle forecasts, though. No one said they were doing anything differently as a result. Until now. Scott Bessent, the Soros Fund Management alum who runs a $4.5 billion macro hedge fund named Key Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management, is shorting the dollar in a bid to monetize the market reaction he anticipates.
“Intelligent people can argue whether Senator Warren’s numerous programs will be good or bad for American society, but they are unequivocally negative for U.S. asset prices,” Bessent wrote in a Nov. 14 letter to investors.
It’s a risky proposition, as the 2016 election showed. Back then, many predicted a Donald Trump victory would drive down markets, only to watch them surge in the immediate aftermath of his victory. Bessent says, though, that there are many other factors that support his bet now, and that all it might take is Warren’s further rise in polls to spark a sell-off.
“A Warren presidency, or the mere threat of one, will likely hasten the exodus of foreign and domestic capital to overseas markets,” Bessent wrote.
The forces that have drawn investors to the U.S. -- superior economic growth, technological leadership and a hospitable environment for capital -- have already started to fade, he told clients. What’s more, rising equity valuations have made markets vulnerable to any shift in policies that have been favorable to companies.
Dollar put options -- which give the right to sell the currency -- are “particularly attractive” given the low level of implied volatility in foreign-exchange rates, according to the fund manager. A JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. gauge of currency volatility is close to a five-year low.
Warren, the senior senator from Massachusetts, is among the frontrunners in a still-large field of potential Democratic nominees. While her national polling numbers have faded since early October, they’re almost double the level from six months ago, according to RealClear Politics averages.
Pete Buttigieg has surged to the lead in Iowa, the first caucus state, with 24% support, according to the RealClear Politics average. Bernie Sanders, Warren, and Joe Biden follow with polling averages of 18.3%, 17.7% and 16.3%, respectively.
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg entered the Democratic contest on Sunday. Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.
In 2016, several marquee hedge fund managers said markets would plunge on a Trump victory. But the S&P 500 has yet to close below its Nov. 8, 2016, level and has returned more than 50%, including dividends, since. It set another record high Tuesday.
For Bessent, stricter labor and environmental standards for trading partners, a “dramatic rethink” of antitrust policy and steps to empower workers are among Warren’s proposals that could erode assets stateside.
Warren has also called for “actively managing” the level of the dollar to bolster exports and domestic manufacturing.
“A dramatically weaker dollar, conveniently one of her policy prescriptions, is, in our view, the best way to play the rising chance of the Senator moving into the White House,” the fund’s letter said.
The letter didn’t indicate the size of the fund’s dollar wager. A spokesman for Key Square Capital declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on Bessent’s dollar position.
Dollar Blame
Trump has been vocal about the dollar as well, blaming its strength for hurting U.S. exports. A broad measure of the greenback is up about 1% this year, building on last year’s gains.
Bessent, who spent much of his career working for George Soros, founded Key Square in 2016 with $2 billion in backing from his former employer. While still with Soros, Bessent made $1 billion in late 2012 and early 2013 on a bet that the yen would tumble.
Citing the roughly 31% gain in stocks in 1980 in the seven months before Ronald Reagan’s election, Bessent said the inverse could happen with Warren.
“We posit that if the U.S. equity markets are spooked by a Warren presidency, most of the decline may have occurred by Election Day.”"

866,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 12:01PM ET</span>",China raises $6 billion in its biggest ever international bond sale,"By Kevin Yao and Noah Sin
BEIJING/HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - China raised $6 billion in its biggest ever international sovereign bond sale on Tuesday, as it pounced on the year's sharp dive in borrowing costs.
The finance ministry sold the bonds in four tranches. A 3-year issue priced 35 basis points above benchmark U.S. Treasuries, a source at one of the managing banks said. A 5-year bond priced at 40 bps above Treasuries, a 10-year at 50 bps above Treasuries and a 20-year tranche at 70 bps above Treasuries, the source said.
The deal comes after a market rally this year that has driven global bond yields sharply lower, significantly decreasing the cost of financing compared with its previous dollar issuance in October 2018.
The $6 billion total was roughly double the original target and order books -- or demand -- for the bonds had been over $20 billion earlier in the day, according to Refinitiv capital markets news service IFR.
""This has been the largest Reg-S offering by an Asian sovereign issuer to date,"" said Sam Fischer, head of China onshore debt capital markets at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), one of 13 banks mandated to lead the sale.
China's finance ministry had signaled the move would help it improve its bond yield curve.
It will ""provide a pricing benchmark for Chinese enterprises issuing U.S. dollar bonds,"" Bank of China (SS:601988) had said in a statement on its website on Tuesday.
The sale marked only the third dollar bond sale since Beijing revived its international debt issuance program two years ago after a 13-year hiatus.
That comeback deal in 2017 raised $2 billion while a separate transaction in 2018 raised another $3 billion.
Earlier this month China also sold its first euro-denominated bond in 15 years, raising $4.4 billion, and analysts believe European markets will become a greater source of funds for the Asian powerhouse in the future.
All bonds offered buyers between 2 and 3%. U.S. 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) yielded 1.75% on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data, nearly 150 basis points below its highs last October when the sovereign issuer last tapped the dollar bond market.
""From a tactical financing standpoint, now is an opportune time to obtain some relatively inexpensive financing,"" said Alex Kozhemiakin, head of emerging markets debt at Macquarie Asset Management in New York."

The tariffs linked to the prolonged trade war between Washington and Beijing have been a pressure point for retailers, which source a large chunk of their merchandise from China.
Dollar Tree, which has been trying to cushion the tariff costs by negotiating price concessions with vendors and cancelling orders, said that if the tariffs are fully implemented it would increase its cost of goods sold by about $19 million in the current quarter.
Chief Financial Officer Kevin Wampler on a post-earnings call said that almost all of the tariff-related costs are due to levies imposed on Sept. 1, as their timing did not allow for significant mitigation by the company.
Shares of the company fell $19.00 to $93.25, wiping out $4.53 billion in market valuation.
The retailer expects a fourth-quarter profit in the range of $1.70 to $1.80 per share, well below the average analyst expectation of $2.02.
The company forecast holiday-quarter sales of $6.33 billion to $6.44 billion, the mid-point of which is below analysts' estimate of $6.41 billion.
Dollar Tree said six fewer selling days between Thanksgiving, the traditional kickoff of the U.S. holiday shopping period, and Christmas this year would hurt its current-quarter sales.
The company also cut its full-year profit forecast, hurt by tariffs' impact as well as costs related to store closures and renovations.
Earlier in August, Dollar Tree did not include costs linked to the proposed tariff hikes in its full-year forecast, saying that it was working to mitigate them.
The Chesapeake, Virginia-based company has been closing hundreds of Family Dollar stores this year while pouring money to renovate thousand more with new decor and addition of coolers, and alcoholic beverages to turn around the business.
It has also been adding snacks and frozen food segments at its namesake stores to attract consumers as it battles competition from big-box retailers Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT), as well as a shift to online shopping.
Dollar Tree's same-store sales rose 2.50% in the third quarter ended Nov. 2, slightly below expectation of 2.54%.

Excluding items, it earned $1.08 per share, missing estimate of $1.13.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 11:09AM ET</span>",S&P 500 earnings seen declining in fourth quarter from year earlier: Refinitiv,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - S&P 500 companies' (SPX) earnings are expected to decline in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period, which could be a second straight quarterly profit fall for the group, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
As of Tuesday, fourth-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 were expected to fall 0.1% from the year-earlier period, according to analysts' forecasts compiled by Refinitiv.
The latest estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is down sharply from 11.5% growth projected for the period as of the start of the year and down from 4.1% growth projected for the quarter as of Oct 1.
Third-quarter earnings, with results in from almost all of the S&P 500 companies, are estimated to have declined 0.4% from a year ago, based on Refinitiv's data.
Two straight quarters of year-over-year profit declines would mark an earnings recession. The last of those occurred from July 2015 through June 2016, which dovetailed with a broad run of stock market underperformance.
But the fourth-quarter number is likely to change once companies report actual results, since many companies tend to beat conservative profit expectations, making it possible that the fourth quarter will end with positive earnings growth.
Earnings have struggled this year after last year's tax-fueled gains and as worries about the U.S.-China trade war have weighed on estimates, but many strategists think the third or fourth quarter will be the trough for the current cycle.
Economically sensitive companies - industrials (SPLRCI), energy (SPNY), consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and materials (SPLRCM) - are forecast to have the biggest year-over-year fourth-quarter profit declines among sectors, while the heavily weighted technology sector (SPLRCT) is expected to have just a 0.5% increase, based on the data."

The $4.5 billion decline drove profits to 7.3% lower than where they stood one year ago, but the FDIC said 62% of banks reported annual profit increases, and just 4% of banks were unprofitable.

""We plan to engage directly with HP shareholders to solicit their support in urging the HP Board to do the right thing and pursue this compelling opportunity,"" Xerox said in a letter to HP's board.
HP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
HP on Sunday rejected Xerox's $22 per share offer that consists of $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox share for each HP share, saying the offer ""significantly undervalues HP"".
The computer maker also accused Xerox of using aggressive words and actions to force a potential combination on opportunistic terms and without providing adequate information. 
""While you may not appreciate our 'aggressive' tactics, we will not apologize for them,"" Xerox said on Tuesday.   
Last week, Xerox threatened to take its bid hostile, if HP did not agree to a ""friendly"" discussion and open its books before Monday.
Xerox made the offer for HP, a company more than three times its size, on Nov. 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities.
HP has also said that under Xerox's proposed terms, the combined company would be saddled with ""outsized debt"".
However, HP left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer and said it can evaluate the merits by a due diligence of Xerox.

873,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 09:54AM ET</span>",Small May Turn Mighty as Strategists See Russell Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- Smaller U.S. stocks could be set for a big run higher into the end of the year, according to Wall Street.
A combination of improving economic data, bullish technical signals and a seasonal effect could give a boost to the shares, which have lagged their larger peers for much of the last year, said strategists from Tallbacken Capital Advisors LLC to Saxo Capital Markets Pte.
“The technical condition on the Russell 2000/S&P 500 price ratio continues to push higher after several quarters of severe decline,” Tallbacken CEO Michael Purves wrote in a note Monday. “If risk is on into year’s end, we won’t be surprised to see the relative performance continue.”
The Russell 2000 Index -- a benchmark for U.S. small caps -- climbed 2.1% Monday to its highest since October 2018, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index which rose 0.8%. The gauge of smaller companies remains more than 6% below its all time high, while the S&P 500 is trading at a fresh record.
Improving Data
A raft of good economic data last week, from manufacturing to consumer sentiment, may be benefiting the Russell, according to Kay Van-Petersen of Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore. Smaller companies are often seen as closely linked to the domestic economic cycle.
The improved performance in the small-cap index could also be coming from hopes of mean reversion versus bigger stocks, or even a short squeeze, Van-Petersen added.

Evercore ISI technical analyst Rich Ross sees about 10% short-term upside for IWM, an iShares exchange-traded fund that tracks the Russell 2000. The ETF has broken a year-long “stubborn” technical resistance level, with breadth expanding -- a bullish sign -- he wrote Monday.
Seasonal Move
Meanwhile, Tallbacken’s Purves noted the median December performance for the Russell 2000 is a 2.5% gain, in data going back to 1979, and that about a quarter of those months saw a return of more than 5%.
“Of course, there are plenty of negative Decembers for the Russell 2000, and some can be sharp,” he said. “But if risk is on, there is a good chance for it to continue to gain meaningful ground into the end of the year and perhaps a lift higher in January as well.”

875,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 09:49AM ET</span>",It's not just trade hopes fueling the U.S. stocks rally,"By April Joyner and Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks have leap-frogged over a host of concerns, including a stall in corporate earnings and political controversy in Washington, on their way to record highs this month.
Some market observers have attributed investors' glass-half-full outlook to periodic inklings of progress toward a trade agreement between the United States and China. The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq all closed at records on Monday as China's Global Times newspaper reported that Beijing and Washington were ""moving closer to agreeing"" on a ""phase one"" trade deal.
But other factors have helped U.S. equity investors look past risks such as the possibility of the first year-over-year decline in quarterly earnings since 2016 and disruptions from the impeachment inquiry on President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine and the 2020 presidential election.
The prospect of renewed economic growth and favorable monetary policy have arguably played greater roles than trade optimism in fueling the rally in U.S. shares, some say.
""I'm under the strong belief that trade is a side show,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York.
ECONOMIC INDICATORS ON THE UPSWING
Soft manufacturing data led to a drop in U.S. stocks over the summer, but certain measures suggest the sector is set for a rebound. IHS Markit's widely followed U.S. manufacturing index has moved off its August lows.
The rate of change in the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index, which is made up of 10 components, including manufacturers' new orders and building permits, likewise points to the beginnings of a turnaround, Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, wrote in a recent blog post.
The rally in U.S. shares reflects growing economic confidence, several analysts say.
""There's a recognition that things aren't as bad as some feared,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.

SUPPORTIVE MONETARY POLICY
The Fed's 2018 regime of rate hikes fueled sharp equity declines last December. But this year brought a pause and then an about-face, with three rate cuts in July, September and October.
(For a graphic on 'The Fed takes a U-turn' click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9125/9037/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Last month, the Fed also said it would start buying some $60 billion a month in Treasury bills. It has characterized these purchases as distinct from quantitative easing, or QE, its bond purchases to keep interest rates near zero during and after the financial crisis a decade ago. But some analysts say they have similarly boosted financial markets.
""No matter what the Fed wants to call it, it is QE,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. ""It's quite supportive for equity prices going forward.""

NO ALTERNATIVE
With the steep climb in Treasury prices this year, the S&P 500 dividend yield has outpaced the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. That has made stocks indispensable for investors in search of steady income from their holdings, even though earnings multiples for stocks are higher than their long-term average.
""We think this speaks to the relative attractiveness of equities,"" John Linehan, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, said at the firm's global market outlook briefing last week. ""The reality is for investors, given where fixed income is, there really are no real attractive alternatives to equities.""

HAMBURG/MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) luxury car unit Audi (DE:NSUG) on Tuesday said it would cut one in ten jobs, freeing up billions of euros to fund its shift toward electric vehicle production. 
Carmakers are struggling with an auto industry downturn, particularly in key market China, and the need to increase investment in electric vehicles as several countries move to eventually ban conventional combustion engines. 
Audi said it would cut up to 9,500 jobs, or 10.6% of its total staff by 2025, saving 6 billion euros ($6.61 billion), but also create up to 2,000 new positions in the areas of electric mobility and digitalization.
""The company must become lean and fit for the future, which means that some job profiles will no longer be needed and new ones will be created,"" Audi said in a statement.
The group said the cuts, which would also include management positions, would take place along the demographic curve through employee turnover and early retirement programs and help it reach a profit margin of 9-11%.
Rival  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) as well as car suppliers Continental (DE:CONG) and Osram (DE:OSRn) have also recently announced staff and cost cuts.
Audi agreed to extend an employment guarantee which rules out forced layoffs for its workforce until the end of 2029, something which had been a sticking point in discussions between management and labor representatives.
""We have reached an important milestone: The jobs of our core workforce are secure,"" said Peter Mosch, chairman of the general works council of Audi. ""The extension of the employment guarantee is a great success in difficult times.""
The agreement between management and workers sees annual production capacity at Audi's German plants in Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm at 450,000 and 225,000 respectively.
Audi said a fund would be set up at the Neckarsulm site to fund the shift toward electric vehicles and would be worth 300 million euros by 2025.
""In times of upheaval, we are making Audi more agile and more efficient,"" Audi CEO Bram Schot said. ""This will increase productivity and sustainably strengthen the competitiveness of our German plants.""

 Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT) have already predicted strong sales in the crucial period between Thanksgiving and Christmas that can account for as much as 40% of annual sales for U.S. retailers faced with a slowing economy.
U.S. consumer spending is slowing faster than economists had expected and the latest data has shown pockets of weakness, including in electrical appliances, which are Best Buy's main market.
Retail sales overall, however, rebounded in October and Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said Best Buy was well prepared for the holidays with new products, deals and online ordering options.
""The typical Best Buy customer is at or slightly above median income, and this group is currently thriving,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.
""At the same time, there are an increasing number of new consumer electronics products that have captured interest, including items in the mobile, smart home and wearables categories, all of which Best Buy excels at.""
The retailer's focus on repair and tech support services as well as new financing and leasing options has also been helping it pull more shoppers into stores, especially at a time when the U.S. shopping landscape is being dominated by online retailers.
Best Buy said it expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, largely above Wall Street expectation of $2.65.
The company said same-store sales in the quarter was expected to rise between 0.5% and 3%, the mid-point of which is above estimates of a 1.4% increase.
In the third quarter, overall same-store sales rose 1.7%, beating analysts' average estimate of a 1.3% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue rose to 1.8% to $9.76 billion, beating expectations of $9.70 billion. Excluding one-time items, Best Buy earned $1.13 per share, ahead of analysts' estimates of $1.03 per share."

While Aldi had the lowest price tag, it was still 3.9% higher than its basket last year. Rival discounter Lidl also came in low, at $50.74, but that represents a 17% price increase from 2018. Both stores offer mostly private-label items, which are usually lower-priced than their branded counterparts sold at other stores. The price of a basket at Walmart (NYSE:WMT),   Target   (NYSE:TGT), ShopRite, Stop & Shop and Albertson’s Acme chain all dropped. At Acme, the cost is down 20% as the company tries to lure shoppers into stores.
For consumers looking at mostly organic meals, the basket price has gone up about 5% on average from last year. At Fairway Market, the increase is 15%, while it’s up 8.5% at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).’s Whole Foods Market. (Amazon Prime members, however, will only see about a 5% increase.) Trader Joe’s, which has been opening new stores, brought prices down 3%.
For those planning on cooking for a large group, a trip to the warehouse store is well worth it. When converted to standardized supermarket pack sizes, Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Sam’s Club and BJ’s all beat Walmart and Target."

883,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 08:07AM ET</span>",London Stock Exchange shareholders bless $27 billion Refinitiv deal,"By Huw Jones and Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) shareholders overwhelmingly backed the exchange's $27 billion takeover of data and analytics company Refinitiv on Tuesday, a deal designed to broaden LSE's trading business and make it a major distributor of market data.
LSE Chairman Don Robert told a shareholders meeting in London that the exchange's board was unanimous in recommending the Refinitiv deal because it was a ""compelling opportunity"" in the best interests of shareholders and the company.
LSE said 99.27% of votes cast at the meeting backed the deal with 99.26% supporting the LSE's intention to issue shares to help pay for the transaction, which is expected to complete in the second half of 2020.
One shareholder asked whether the LSE was simply bulking up to avoid becoming a future takeover target.
""We feel very strongly this is in the long-term strategic interest of the London Stock Exchange. It will give us an opportunity to have a truly global business,"" LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer said.
There have been numerous attempts at cross-border alliances between exchanges for more than a decade as profits from the business of running stock markets have fallen but many of the deals have run into regulatory and political opposition.
This has pushed exchanges to look for related businesses. LSE and New York Stock Exchange owner ICE (N:ICE), for example, are moving into more profitable and less politically sensitive areas such as data and analytics, where revenue is rising.
ITALIAN REMEDY?
The deal was announced in August, just 10 months after a consortium led by U.S. asset manager Blackstone (N:BX) completed a leverage buyout of Refinitiv from  Thomson Reuters  (TO:TRI).
Obtaining regulatory approval for the deal is likely to be a lengthy process and some assets may need to be sold, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters.
There is market talk that LSE would sell all or part of the Milan stock exchange to European rivals if regulators demand ""remedies"" in return for approving the deal.
Schwimmer said he would not comment on market speculation.
The sale of some or all of the Milan bourse would also help LSE cut its debt, which is expected to rise after the Refinitiv deal. LSE's net debt ratio to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) stood at 1.7 as of June but may jump to 3.5 after the deal, analysts have said.
LSE will issue about $14.5 billion of new shares to fund the deal and take on Refinitiv's net debt of $12.5 billion.
Thomson Reuters (N:TRI), the parent company of Reuters News, holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv.
Once the deal has gone through, Refinitiv shareholders will own about 37% of LSE but have less than 30% of total voting rights. Thomson Reuters said in August it would own 15% of LSE following the deal. 

Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HK:0388) threatened to derail the deal in September by making an unsolicited $39 billion takeover offer for LSE. The Asian exchange walked away after failing to convince LSE management and investors to back the move.

(NYSE:C) was fined 44 million pounds ($57 million) by the Bank of England for years of inaccurate reporting to regulators about the lender’s capital and liquidity levels.
The central bank’s  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority said that between June 2014 and December 2018, two of the Wall Street firm’s units in the U.K. had flaws in the systems they used to report financial information to regulators, as well as failings in internal governance. There were significant errors in reports that had “material or potentially material impact on the returns,” according to the PRA.
The bank “failed to meet the standards of governance and oversight of regulatory reporting which we expect of a systemically important bank,” Sam Woods, deputy governor for prudential regulation and chief executive officer of the PRA, said in a statement.
While there were widespread problems, the PRA said the bank had surplus liquidity and capital requirements at all times.
“Citi has fully remediated the past regulatory reporting issues identified by the PRA, and settled this matter at the earliest possible opportunity,” the New York-based bank said in a statement."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks edged off their highest in almost two years on Tuesday, but kept record levels in sight, following fresh signs that the United States and China were working to end a trade war dragging on the global economy.
China's Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held a phone call on issues related to a phase one trade agreement on Tuesday, China said.
This, alongside a strong Hong Kong debut for Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  in the world's largest share sale this year, boosted markets in Asia (MIAPJ0000PUS) (N225) (AXJO).
MSCI's 49-country main world share index (MIWD00000PUS), touched its highest level in almost two years, before drifting lower as the European session wore on. Still, it remained less than 1% off record highs hit in early 2018.
European stocks, with the exception of London's FTSE (FTSE), were broadly lower (GDAXI) (FCHI) and U.S. equity futures also inched down (ESc1) (1YMc1) as a note of caution returned after a strong rally fueled by trade talk hopes.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) remained within striking distance of four-year highs.
""The outlook is positive as world trade angst is the biggest negative out there, especially when you throw in loose policy, the pick-up yields for equities versus bonds and the like,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James in London.
""However, the residual issues are clear: The first is a reversal in world trade optimism, the second is that valuations become perceived as overstretched - this can easily happen given lackluster corporate earnings growth.""
In Asia, Alibaba shares (HK:9988) (N:BABA) opened almost 7% higher in Hong Kong than their issue price and at a small premium to pricing in New York. The listing has been seen as a vote of confidence in Hong Kong after months of anti-government protests that have rocked the financial hub.
A flurry of major acquisition activity has also supported sentiment in equity markets, with France's LVMH (PA:LVMH) agreeing to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany (N:TIF) for $16.2 billion and  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) set to purchase U.S. discount brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (O:AMTD) in an all-stock deal valued at $26 billion.
ALL ABOUT TRADE
Still, it was the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks that remained the key driver for world markets.
The U.S. dollar gave up earlier gains as some of the optimism over an agreement faded, slipping from a two-week high of 109.205 yen hit during Asian trade.
The euro was also a touch firmer at $1.10150 (EUR=EBS).
China's yuan - the currency most sensitive to the trade war - had risen to a one-week high of 7.0181 against the dollar, but was last trading at 7.0388 .
""China and the U.S. agreed on a framework to resolve their phase one issue, which is just a way of saying that they did admin work,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
The United States has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in a 16-month dispute over trade practices that the U.S. government says are unfair. China has responded with its own tariffs on U.S. goods.
The next important date to watch is Dec. 15, when Washington is scheduled to impose even more tariffs on Chinese goods.
Safe-haven bond yields (DE10YT=RR) nudged back down, also reflecting the more cautious tone among investors.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was last down 2 basis points on the day at around 1.75% (US10YT=RR).
Elsewhere, Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP), the world's biggest cryptocurrency, dipped to $7,065, holding above six-month lows hit on Monday after the People's Bank of China launched a fresh crackdown on cryptocurrencies.
U.S. crude (CLc1) was flat at $58 a barrel. Brent crude (LCOc1) was little changed at $63.71 per barrel."

The 569-meter building will break ground in the first half of 2020, Seoul city said in a statement. 
The approval came more than four years after Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, offered to purchase the site with $10 billion in 2014, more than triple its market price, outbidding  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and sparking a stock sell-off.
The construction, originally scheduled to commence in 2016, was delayed partly due to security concerns raised by South Korea's air force, which said the building would interfere with radar and military operations, a Seoul city official said. 
Hyundai signed an agreement with the defense ministry to resolve operational restrictions until the construction of the building has reached around 260 meters high, the official said, adding that the construction can be suspended should Hyundai fail to do so. 
The building, consisting of 105 floors, will house not only offices, but a car theme park, a hotel, a concert hall and a convention center, according to its 2014 plan. It will be home to 18,000 employees from 30 affiliates of the conglomerate, it said at the time. 
Hyundai Motor said in March that it was in talks with potential investors to share additional investment costs worth about 3.7 trillion won needed to develop its new headquarters, following a call by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management Corp to drop the controversial project. 
Hyundai Motor is trying to rebound from its sixth consecutive annual profit declines, while accelerating its investments in future technologies. 

Hyundai said it ""will continue to work closely with the Seoul Metropolitan Government to proceed with the project in compliance with the administrative procedures.”

Carrefour hired Chief Executive Alexandre Bompard in July 2017 from Fnac Darty, France's largest electronics retailer, and made reviving flagging sales at large hypermarkets a priority. Hypermarkets contribute 51% of Carrefour sales in France.
The two groups had opened two pilot Darty stores in November 2018 in Carrefour hypermarkets in Ville-du-Bois, near Paris ,and in Limoges, in central France.

893,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 05:36AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Uncertainty Without End - Trading the Brexit Election,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- How do you trade an election campaign? is a bit like the old joke about how hedgehogs make love - ""very carefully."" The sad truth is that investors' yearning for certainty is likely to be no more than half-satisfied, even in the most likely scenario.
True, the U.K. market outperformed the rest of Europe again on Tuesday, with the FTSE 100 rising 0.1% and the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 midcap index rising 0.3%. 
That’s another tentative sign that investors are turning more positive on what has been the world’s most despised asset class for most of the last four years. The reason? Confidence – at least a relative degree of it – that the Dec. 12 election will produce a Conservative majority in parliament, breaking the deadlock on Brexit and banishing the risk of a hard-left Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn.
Skeptics who argue that a Tory majority has its own risks overlook the increasingly debilitating effect of this endless uncertainty over Brexit. Data out Tuesday showed U.K. mortgage approvals fell to their lowest in seven months, and the Bank of England earlier this month identified the “domestic impact of Brexit-related uncertainties” as one of the chief reasons for a “material” slowdown in the U.K. this year. 
But the U.K. is still the worst performing market in Europe both this year and on a three-year view, for good reason.
A Conservative majority – to which most U.K. bookmakers ascribe a probability between 60%-70%, would almost certainly lead to the country formally leaving the European Union within a month or two. That would finally rule out the prospect of remaining, which the overwhelming majority of economic analysis suggests is the most positive for the U.K.’s long-term economic future. 
It would not, however, settle the degree to which the U.K. would remain aligned with the EU. Here too, the government’s own analysis sees big variations in long-term economic outcomes, with the most favorable – close alignment with the EU’s standards and trade policy – at odds with a political dynamic pushing for a more distant relationship. 
By contrast, a Conservative defeat would most likely lead to a hung parliament and a second referendum - another few months of uncertainty in which the optimal long-run outcome is kept alive, but with no guarantee of success.
Jim O’Neill, chairman of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, said on Tuesday that any relief rally in U.K. assets on the back of a Conservative election win would soon run into headwinds “by February or March”, because the proposed transitional period following Brexit is still set to expire at the end of 2020. That leaves the U.K. with no time to negotiate a comprehensive trading arrangement with the EU.
But while the top-down analysis is inevitably still gloomy, the bottom-up effects are much rosier. Individual stocks such as utilities would have the risk of renationalization removed, and all domestic-consumption themed stocks would logically seem poised to benefit from the big increase in budget spending that the Tories are promising to cushion the Brexit blow.
The bottom line: nothing is certain, and everything is possible. Nice if you like to trade risk, but still a horrendous backdrop for seeking long-term value."
894,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 04:35AM ET</span>",Hyundai Motor to invest $1.55 billion in first Indonesia car plant,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) said on Tuesday it has signed a preliminary deal to build a new factory in Indonesia, which would be its first car plant in Southeast Asia and a crack at Japanese rivals that dominate the market. 
The deal comes as Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270) struggle with a prolonged sales downturn in China, where they suspended two factories this year. 
Hyundai Motor said it will invest about $1.55 billion in the Indonesia auto manufacturing plant from now until 2030, including product development and operation costs. 
The facility, to be built in the city of Bekasi, east of Jakarta, will start production in late 2021, with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles and a plan to grow that to 250,000 vehicles a year, Hyundai said. 
Hyundai plans to make small sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), while electric vehicles (EVs) tailored to Southeast Asian market are under consideration. 
Hyundai said it is building the production facilities to avoid import tariffs ranging from 5% to 80% in the ASEAN region. The plant will cater to Indonesia, the region's largest automobile market, and other countries belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), it said. 
The plant will allow the automaker to secure future growth to help it ""combat slowing demand in the global automotive market"", Hyundai said in its statement. 
The deal was signed at an event attended by Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Hyundai Motor Executive Vice Chairman Euisun Chung. Widodo is in South Korea for a meeting of ASEAN leaders hosted by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. 
Moon has been pushing a ""New Southern (NYSE:SO) Policy"" aiming to deepen ties with Southeast Asia as Seoul seeks to curb its reliance on traditional trading partners like China and the United States. 
Hyundai is far behind Japanese rivals in Southeast Asia, with its sales reaching 122,883 vehicles versus Toyota's 854,032 from January to September this year, according to research firm LMC Automotive. 
LMC Automotive forecast a 4% year-on-year decline in total vehicle sales in the ASEAN region in the fourth quarter, partly because the slowdowns in the Thai and Indonesian economies show no signs of abating. 

Hyundai said key ASEAN countries including Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore are expected to see combined vehicle sales grow to 4.49 million units in 2026, from 3.16 million in 2017.

Just Eat shareholders have two offers to consider: a tie-up between the British group and its Netherlands-based peer Takeaway.com and a 710 pence-a-share cash offer from technology company  Prosus  (AS:PRX).
Just Eat urged shareholders on Monday to shun the $6.3 billion offer from Prosus, saying the lower valued deal with Takeaway.com was a better bet as it would create the largest food delivery firm outside China.
Cat Rock, which controls about 3% of Just Eat's shares and has a 5.69% stake in Takeaway.com, said the Prosus offer significantly undervalued Just Eat and shared none of the future potential of the business with Just Eat shareholders.
""A Just Eat merger with Takeaway.com would create a formidable global leader with significant growth prospects and world-class management,"" Cat Rock founder Alex Captain said in an open letter.
""We believe this combined company could comfortably be worth over 1,200p per share by the end of 2020, providing Just Eat shareholders with 60% upside to the current share price.""
Takeaway's offer values Just Eat's shares at 678.6 pence each, based on both companies' share prices on Tuesday morning.
Cat Rock said its view of the future share price was based on revenue forecasts for both companies and historical trading averages.
It said Just Eat's shares had been hurt by almost three years of poor management at the group and a sale to Prosus at the current offer price would only crystallize the disappointing performance of the stock.
It added that rejecting both offers would continue the status quo that had led to the underperformance.
Prosus, the Dutch arm of South African e-commerce giant Naspers (J:NPNJn), said on Friday that the rationale for its bid remained strong, despite a rally in Takeaway's shares that has narrowed the gap between the offers.
Both offers are open until Dec. 11.

The stock, on track for its worst day in more than five years, pushed the wider travel & leisure sector (SXTP) down 2% and was the biggest drag on the pan-European STOXX 600 index.
The benchmark index (STOXX) was down 0.2%, after gaining more than 1% on Monday, in its best day in more than a month, following a report that Washington and Beijing were close to a trade pact.
China said on Tuesday top trade negotiators from both countries had reached a consensus on ""resolving relevant problems"" on a phone call, but gave no indication about the timing of a deal, which was expected to be signed in November.
""We've seen this many times in the last couple of months, that they're in trade talks once in a while (but) the problem is that they're still miles apart in what they want,"" said Timme Spakman, macro economist at ING Bank.
The STOXX 600 index has climbed to four-year highs this month on growing hopes that the world's top two economies would settle the trade dispute, which has posed the biggest risk to global growth this year.
Trade optimism has also powered Germany's export-heavy index (GDAXI) to a near two-year high, despite a clutch of recent economic data showing manufacturing activity in Europe's biggest economy was stuck in a recession.
To propel future growth, European Central Bank Chief Christine Lagarde last week called on euro zone governments to strengthen domestic demand, as a resolution to the trade war remains elusive.
Shares of French car parts maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) jumped 5% to a two-week high as it said it was targeting record sales, profits and cash generation in 2022, partly helped by a boost from its acquisition of Japanese company Clarion.
Britain's Pets at Home Group Plc (L:PETSP) rose 9% after the company forecast full-year underlying pretax profit towards the top end of expectations, boosted by higher demand for its pet food and vet services."
897,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>",Alibaba's Hong Kong shares rise 6.6% on debut in heavy volume,"By Kane Wu and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group's (N:BABA) (HK:9988) Hong Kong shares closed their first trading session up 6.6% from the issue price after this year's largest stock sale.
Shares worth HK$13.99 billion ($1.78 billion) were traded, according to Refinitiv data, making it the third biggest debut on record for the Hong Kong market.
Alibaba is already the fifth most-traded company in New York this year, averaging $2.6 billion a day, Refinitiv data showed.
The Chinese e-commerce giant has raised at least $11.3 billion from its secondary listing, which has been seen as a vote of confidence in Hong Kong's financial future amid six months of increasingly violent anti-government protests.
The figure could climb to as much as $12.9 billion if Alibaba chooses to exercise an over-allotment option within 30 days of the start of trade..
Alibaba shares closed at HK$187.60 which was 6.6% higher than the issue price of HK$176 per share.
On Monday its U.S. American Depository Shares (ADS) closed at $190.45. With eight Hong Kong shares per ADS, that implied a price of HK$186.30 per share.
Alibaba's debut ranks third in the city for first-day turnover behind insurer AIA Group (HK:1299) in 2010 which recorded $HK49.38 billion in turnover, China Literature was second with $HK14.17 billion when it debuted in November 2017, Refinitiv data showed.
The average daily turnover on the Hong Kong Exchange this year has been $11.6 billion, according to the exchange's third-quarter earnings report, implying that Alibaba on Tuesday accounted for more than one-tenth of total market turnover.
The funds raised from the Hong Kong listing will help Alibaba, Asia's biggest company by market value and world's seventh largest, invest more in a range of online services.
But analysts also note that the establishment of a base of investors in Hong Kong and China could function as a backup for the company should its shares be hit in New York amid the U.S.-China trade dispute.
The Hong Kong and New York stocks are fungible, which means investors can buy and sell the same shares on either exchange and that pricing on the exchanges are unlikely to diverge too far from each other.
A LONG TIME COMING
The premium to New York reflects the willingness of investors in the city and Asia to take on the stock of a company they know well, market participants said. Expectations are also high that it will get a lift in valuation when it becomes eligible for trading in the Stock Connect that links Shanghai and Shenzhen with Hong Kong next June.
""There will be some upside for the company's price in Hong Kong but I don't think we will see the shares double or triple in a year,"" said Geo Securities Chief Executive Francis Lun.
At Tuesday's listing ceremony, CEO Daniel Zhang noted the Hong Kong debut had been a long time coming.
Alibaba had hoped to initially list in Hong Kong, but eventually chose New York for its record-breaking $25 billion initial public offering in 2014 after its unusual governance structure failed to win acceptance from Hong Kong regulators.
The loss of the listing triggered years of argument and consultations that resulted in rule changes last year.
""Thank you Hong Kong and thank you HKEX. Your reform and innovation of the capital markets in the past few years has made it possible for us to realize what we missed five years ago,"" Zhang said at the listing ceremony.
The Hong Kong listing has surpassed other large stock sales this year, ranking ahead of Uber Technologies (N:UBER) $8.1 billion IPO and $5.7 billion IPO for Anheuser-Busch InBev’s (BR:ABI) Asian brewing business in Hong Kong.
In its prospectus, Alibaba said it would use the funds raised to increase its investment in online delivery and local services platform Ele.me and in online travel group Fliggy.
Alibaba also plans to spend more on developing Youku, one of the leading online video platforms in China.
Small retail investors were enthusiastic buyers of the deal, subscribing for 40 times the shares they were originally allotted and eventually taking 10% of the deal."

PARIS (Reuters) - French car parts maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) said it was targeting record sales, profits and cash generation in 2022 as a result of its strategy program and the boost from its acquisition of Japanese company Clarion, lifting its shares.
Faurecia, which is 46 percent owned by Peugeot-maker PSA (PA:PEUP), expected annual average sales growth of above 5 percent between 2019-2022, with sales reaching above 20.5 billion euros ($22.60 billion) in 2022.
Faurecia, whose main French rival is  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), added its operating margin should rise to 8 percent in 2022 versus its target of a 7 percent margin in 2019.
Faurecia's shares rose 2.6 percent in early session trading.
""Our new Business Group, Faurecia Clarion Electronics, is a strong enabler for the Cockpit of the Future and has a robust roadmap for profitable growth. At the same time, our investment in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles will accelerate our Zero Emissions strategy and allow us to benefit from rapid powertrain electrification,"" said Faurecia chief executive Patrick Koller.

899,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 03:01AM ET</span>",Alibaba Leaps 8% in a Major Boost for Hong Kong’s Ambitions,"(Bloomberg) --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. rose 7.7% in its Hong Kong debut, capping a landmark share sale that unfolded during violent anti-government protests.
Chairman Daniel Zhang, lieutenants wearing Alibaba lapel pins and Hong Kong dignitaries were on hand to strike the opening gong Tuesday at a celebration of the city’s biggest stock listing this year. The company presented a Chinese-style painting to the exchange -- a souvenir to go with the showy coming-out party. The Chinese e-commerce giant’s shares rose to as much as HK$189.50, versus a HK$176 issuance price.
Asia’s most valuable corporation raised about $11 billion in the financial hub’s largest issuance of stock since 2010, a triumph for a stock exchange that lost many of China’s brightest technology stars to U.S. rivals. The blockbuster debut by one of China’s most successful companies signals confidence in Hong Kong’s future even as pro-democracy protests rock the city, earning Alibaba goodwill in Beijing. It makes it easier for investors in the mainland to buy and sell Alibaba shares, which are primarily listed in New York.
It’s also a homecoming of sorts for Alibaba, whose decision to hold its $25 billion initial public offering five years ago in New York dealt a blow to Hong Kong’s ambitions. Listing closer to home has been a long-time dream of billionaire co-founder Jack Ma’s. More broadly, his company has been trying to sustain growth at a time the engines of China’s economy are sputtering. Like fellow internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba’s exploring new markets as China clashes with the U.S. over everything from trade and technology to investment.
“We came home. We came back to list in Hong Kong,” Zhang said to applause. “It helped make up for our regret five years ago.'’
Why Now, and Why Hong Kong, for Alibaba’s Share Sale?: QuickTake
A marquee name like Alibaba’s could draw investors and boost trading liquidity for Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which just saw its biggest profit slump in more than three years following a failed bid to buy its London counterpart in September. Efforts to court Alibaba emanated from the very top, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, herself lobbying Ma. The Chinese company’s decision to forge ahead despite a recent escalation in protest-related violence pleased officials trying to persuade the world that the troubled city still has a future as a financial hub. Alibaba’s sale could tempt Chinese tech unicorns from Didi Chuxing Inc. to ByteDance Inc. to opt for Hong Kong over the U.S. if they eventually go public.
“Alibaba will be the leading light for bringing more companies in,” Andrew Sullivan, a director at Pearl Bridge Partners, told Bloomberg Television. “You may see some new money being allocated. The keen competitor is going to be Tencent, which has historically traded at a premium.”
The new funds will now help Alibaba finance a costly war against homegrown rivals nipping at its heels. It could swell the company’s cash pile to about $44 billion, more than any other internet company and roughly double that of arch-rival Tencent’s. The capital could bankroll competition with Tencent and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). in cloud computing and entertainment, with Meituan Dianping in food delivery and travel, and with everyone in terms of investing in promising startups that yield technology, talent or market share. And it could divert investor cash from those rivals.
Demand for Alibaba’s stock surpassed supply by several times and more shares were allocated to small investors. It’s a feather in the cap for Zhang, who took over as chairman from Ma in September. The former accountant is now spearheading the company’s expansion beyond Asia as well as into adjacent business lines from cloud computing to entertainment, logistics and physical retail. The stock trades under the code 9988 in Hong Kong, auspicious numbers in Chinese culture that connote prosperity.

900,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 02:41AM ET</span>",Premarket London: CRH Forecasts Solid 2020; Compass Takes a Hit,"Investing.com -- Here is a summary of regulatory news releases from the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday, 26th November. Please refresh for updates.

Catering provider    Compass Group    (LON:CPG) said it will take a charge of around 300 million pounds to slim down its European operations, in response to a slowdown that has hit demand and margins.

Around 190 million pounds in restructuring costs have hit the full-year results, announced on Tuesday. The rest will be booked in the fiscal 2020 year.

The charges meant that reported operating profit fell 5.4% on the year, while earnings per share fell 1.8%. Even so, the company raised its dividend by 6.1%.

For the coming year, Compass expects organic sales growth in the middle of its 4%-6% range, down from 6.4% in the fiscal year just ended. It said it expects margins to stay “strong”.

Building materials group   CRH   (LON:CRH) said it expects full-year EBITDA to be over 4.15 billion euros ($4.21 billion) after a strong third quarter and said “solid market fundamentals” across its key markets will ensure another good year in 2020.
Profit before tax from continued and discontinued operations is seen up from 2018’s 1.8 billion euros, helped by around 400 million euros in gains from disposals. Net debt is expected around 7 billion euros, below the forecast 2x EBITDA level.
Like-for-like sales growth in the third quarter rose to 5% from 3% in the first half of the year, as its Americas division lived up to expectations with a 7% surge.
EBITDA rose 27% to 3.2 billion euros ($3.5 billion), although on a like-for-like basis the gain was a more modest 7%.

Passport maker   De La Rue   (LON:DLAR) said on Tuesday it will suspend dividend payments after swinging to a loss of 9.2 million pounds in the six months through September, and will present a thorough strategic review by the end of the first quarter to address its worsening performance. 
The company, which also prints banknotes, said it faced competition from increased usage of digital payments.
It now expects an adjusted profit between 20 and 25 million pounds for the full year 2019-20.
Pets at Home (LON:PETSP) said it expects full-year profit “toward the top end of market consensus” after posting like-for-like growth of 7.6% in the first half of its fiscal 2020 year.
The underlying gross margin edged down to 49.0% from 50.3%, while statutory profit before tax rose to 37.3 million pounds from 8 million a year earlier.
The group also said it had begun a search for a new chairman, as Tony DeNunzio is stepping down after nine years in the post.

Quality assurance group Intertek (LON:ITRK) said organic revenue in the four months to October rose 3.6%, while overall revenue rose 4.5%. It said it expects “good” organic growth for the full year at constant currency."

The 4.00 euro per share bid runs until Nov. 28 and will succeed if more than 50% of shareholders tender their stock.
Morgan Stanley had secured a 21.9% stake as of Nov. 15.
""The cash compensation seems inadequate in our view,"" SdK said in a statement. ""Against the backdrop of continuing market growth and PNE's good position, we generally recommend not to accept the offer.""
SdK said shareholders should hold on to their stock and bet on a rising share price or a higher offer, adding in case of a domination agreement or a squeeze out a significantly higher price would have to be paid than the current offer.
Two of PNE's top-10 shareholders, ENKRAFT and Active Ownership Capital, will not tender their shares, according to previous statements.
They jointly account for about 8% of PNE's shares."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - First the bad news for your wallet: Americans are slated to spend more than they ever have this holiday season - around $730 billion in November and December, according to the National Retail Federation.
Online shopping alone is expected to amount to $143.7 billion over the last two months of the year, a 14.1% increase over last year, according to projections by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics.
Now the good news: There is money to be made on the other side of that trade. 
E-commerce exchange-traded funds are set up to capitalize on all those online transactions by gathering a bucket of stocks of companies like Amazon (O:AMZN), eBay (O:EBAY) and PayPal (O:PYPL) and selling shares of them as a specialized ETF.
Top players include First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index (P:FDN), Global X E-commerce (O:EBIZ), Amplify Online Retail (O:IBUY) and International Online Retail (P:XBUY), ProShares Online Retail (P:ONLN), ProShares Long Online/Short Stores (P:CLIX) and SPDR S&P Internet (P:XWEB).
There is even a new index created by MSCI (https:// a provider of analytics and solutions for financial firms, which identified the digital economy as one of its societal ""Megatrends."" That likely means that more such ETFs will be in the pipeline, since investment firms can now roll out their own e-commerce ETFs based on that underlying index.
A few tips for investors who might be stuffing e-commerce ETFs into their holiday stockings:
* Look under the hood.
Not all e-commerce ETFs are built alike. Some are highly concentrated, and some are more diversified, so proceed according to your own risk tolerance.
ProShares Online Retail, for example, has almost a quarter of its entire assets in Amazon, and another 13% in Chinese Internet giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA). If you want to bet on the big winners - and Amazon has certainly been a big winner - that would be the way to go, said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at independent research firm CFRA.
But Amplify’s IBUY has Amazon making up only a more modest 3.4% of its portfolio. If you want to spread your bets more evenly throughout the space, that would be a more appropriate pick.
*Dig into the numbers.
Fees are any portfolio's silent killer. Concentrated ETFs may offer lower expense ratios than traditional mutual funds, but higher than broader exchange-traded offerings - like, say, Vanguard's Total Stock Market ETF (P:VTI), and its microscopic .03% fees.
In comparison, the relatively new Global X E-Commerce comes with a .68% expense ratio, and ProShares Long Online/Short Stores carries a similar .65% charge.
As for performance, e-commerce ETFs have generally experienced a bumpy fall, thanks to trade wars and recession worries. IBUY, for instance, has outperformed the S&P 500 on a two-year timeframe, but underperformed year-to-date. While that offers a potential buying opportunity, ask yourself whether you are comfortable with an occasionally wild ride.
""Typically investors will find more volatility in narrower slices of the market like this,"" said Deborah Fuhr, founder and managing partner of independent London-based ETF consultancy ETFGI.
*Expand your horizons.
The United States may be the 800-pound gorilla of e-commerce, but there is money to be made outside its borders as well. To wit: the Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce (P:EMQQ), suggested Fuhr. Its basket includes familiar Chinese names like Baidu (O:BIDU) and Tencent (HK:0700), and boasts robust year-to-date returns of over 32%.
* Consider size and scope.
In the ETF world there is a fair amount of churn: If small thematic funds do not manage to attract enough assets, they occasionally close up shop. So check the total assets and know that a fund's long-term future is not guaranteed.
* Thematic ETFs are a complement, not a core.
Thematic ETFs are a nice complement to a more broadly diversified portfolio. But notes Rosenbluth: ""Investors shouldn't get carried away with them.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian antitrust probe has found that units of  Tata Steel  Ltd (NS:TISC), Sweden's AB SKF (ST:SKFb) and Germany's  Schaeffler AG  (DE:SHA_p) colluded on the pricing of bearings, according to an investigation report seen by Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) began an investigation in 2017 after receiving allegations of five companies colluding on bearings prices from 2009-2014 to pass higher raw material costs onto customers in the auto sector.
Bearings reduce friction in moving parts, helping smooth the operation of vehicles. India's bearings market is dominated by SKF and Schaeffler and is worth $1.3 billion, showed data from ICRA Research.
CCI's investigations arm, in a report dated May 6 which has not been made public, said it analyzed company emails, call records and executive testimonies and concluded that  SKF India  Ltd (NS:SKFB), Schaeffler India Ltd (NS:SCHE), National Engineering Industries and Tata Steel's bearings division contravened antitrust law by discussing and agreeing prices.
SKF, the world's largest maker of ball-bearings, in a statement said it aided the investigation, and that ""we dispute any claim of wrongdoing on the part of SKF"".
Schaeffler did not respond to a request for comment. Tata Steel and National Engineering Industries - part of Indian conglomerate CK Birla Group - declined to comment beyond saying the CCI proceedings were confidential.
The investigations arm said it found no evidence against the fifth firm, ABC Bearings, part of U.S. firm  Timken Co  (N:TKR), the report showed. ABC Bearings declined to comment.
The report also showed the investigations arm considered the collusion lasted through the financial year to March 2011 but found no evidence to indicate when it actually ended.
The four firms, ""through personal meetings of key persons, on two occasions shared the strategic information regarding their future efforts to seek price increase from"" auto sector companies, the investigations arm said in its 106-page report.
The CCI did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. A person with direct knowledge of the matter said senior CCI officials are reviewing the report and that the antitrust body is able to dispute the findings of its investigation arm.
The CCI can fine firms up to three times the profit made in each year of wrongdoing or 10% of revenue, whichever is higher.
In 2014, European Union antitrust regulators fined SKF, Schaeffler and three Japanese auto parts makers $1.3 billion for taking part in a bearings cartel from 2004 through 2011.

The investigation report showed the four companies controlled nearly 75% of the domestic bearings market in the period 2009-11 - a time when prices of steel, the key raw material in bearings, were fluctuating sharply.
The steep steel price volatility, the CCI's investigation arm said, provided the companies an ""incentive to collude"". 
There was consensus among the firms ""to seek price increase of 12% and settle at 6%"" with tractor and automotive manufacturers. With motorbike makers, there was a consensus to seek a 10% price increase and settle at 4%, the report showed.
The investigation arm also said Schaeffler and National Engineering Industries told the CCI that employees had participated in discussions with competitors ""mainly to seek coordinated price increase of bearings"". It did not elaborate on when the companies disclosed discussions to the CCI.
During the probe, ABC Bearings, SKF and Tata Steel's bearings division told the CCI they had no evidence of such discussions, the report showed.
""The conduct of the parties has resulted in appreciable adverse effect on competition,"" the CCI investigation arm said in the report. ""The sharing of price information is particularly sensitive from the competition law perspective.""

909,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 11:04PM ET</span>",CEO of Australia's Westpac exits over money laundering scandal,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The chief executive of Australia's Westpac Banking Corp stepped down on Tuesday over a money laundering scandal involving child exploitation, just a day after he told staff it was ""not a major issue"" and that he intended to stay on.
The swift turnaround by U.S. born Brian Hartzer underscored how politically and publicly sensitive missteps by Australia's big banks have become in the wake of a bruising public inquiry that found rampant profiteering in the industry. 
Hartzer's departure from Australia's second largest lender, effective from Dec. 2, made Westpac the third of the country's top four banks to lose its top executive in the past 18 months. 
Regulator AUSTRAC last week launched legal action accusing Westpac of enabling 23 million payments in breach of anti-money laundering laws, including the facilitation of offshore payments relating to child exploitation.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison was among those calling for the bank's board to consider the future of its executives, but chairman Lindsay Maxsted had said over the weekend that a change at the top would be destabilizing for the bank.
That all changed on Tuesday, when Maxsted announced both Hartzer's exit and that his own retirement in the first half of next year. He had said in September he had no intention to retire.
""We sought feedback from all our stakeholders ... it became clear that board and management changes were in the best interest of the bank,"" Maxsted said in a statement.
Maxsted added in a media call that his successor would run a global search for a new CEO and Chief Financial Officer Peter King would take over in the interim. King said he would stay ""as long as the board needs me"".
Hartzer had told senior staff in a meeting on Monday that the crisis was ""not an Enron or Lehman Brothers"", according to The Australian newspaper, referring to the two famous corporate collapses.
The newspaper quoted Hartzer, who started as CEO in 2015, as telling staff that ""for people in mainstream Australia going about their daily lives, this is not a major issue so we don't need to overcook this"". A source with knowledge of the meeting confirmed the quotes to Reuters.
Maxsted said Hartzer's reported comments were ""very disappointing ... and I and the board do not agree,"" although he added they needed to be read in context.
Hartzer will depart the two-centuries-old company, which had seemed one of the least damaged by the Royal Commission inquiry, with a year's base salary of A$2.69 million but no bonuses.
""These alleged breaches are of the most serious nature, and there needed to be accountability,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra.
CLEAN-UP JOB
The changes leave King with the task of running an investigation into how the bank facilitated offshore payments that violated anti-money laundering protocols for more than half a decade, as alleged by AUSTRAC.
The scandal is likely to be front and center at Westpac's annual general meeting, scheduled for Dec. 12., although Hartzer's exit might dampen some of the fireworks.
Westpac's shares rose 1.8% by Tuesday afternoon, having slumped 8% over the previous four trading days since the regulator announced its lawsuit, wiping A$7.5 billion off the bank's market capitalization.
""They'd been talking to institutional shareholders this week so it was the only feasible outcome to defuse the situation,"" Bell Potter banking analyst TS Lim said. ""They have been seen to be doing something.""
The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), whose pension fund members are investors in Westpac, said it believed the crisis ""warrants further board renewal in the new year.""
Maxsted said any breaches were not made ""through deliberate neglect"" as he accepted that some customers may leave the bank.
He noted that AUSTRAC was in regular contact with Westpac, including a meeting with the bank's board in March, yet did not raise concerns about the offshore payments until September.
""We don't have all the details,"" he said, adding it appeared that Westpac had been offered an update to protections for its offshore payments system, LitePay, which it did not adopt.
Larger rival Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) was accused of similar - but far fewer - breaches by AUSTRAC, resulting in a record A$700 million penalty and the early retirement of its CEO.
Both the CEO and chair of No. 3 lender National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) stood down after being singled out in the Royal Commission for failing to accept responsibility for company wrongdoings. 

Financial planner AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) lost its CEO, chair and several board members over accusations of doctoring a supposedly independent report to a regulator.

The Chinese e-commerce giant’s shares rose to as much as HK$189.50, versus a HK$176 issuance price. 
“We came home. We came back to list in Hong Kong,” said Chairman Daniel Zhang. “It helped make up for our regret five years ago.’’
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed by 10:50 PM ET (02:50 GMT). 
China’s Shanghai Composite was also flat, while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.2%. 
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, China’s Ministry of Commerce said top negotiator on trade Liu He talked with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday morning.
“Both sides discussed resolving core issues of common concern, reached consensus on how to resolve related problems (and) agreed to stay in contact over remaining issues for a phase one agreement,” the Chinese-language statement said.
The phone call followed a previous encounter earlier this month, which the ministry called “constructive.”
U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that a trade deal with China is “potentially very close” but it “can’t be like an even deal” because the U.S. is “starting off from the floor” and China is “already at the ceiling.”
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.4% higher, while South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 0.6%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 gained 0.8%. 
Westpac Banking Corp. rose for the first time in five days after its CEO resigned over a money-laundering scandal.
Meanwhile, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe will give a speech on unconventional monetary policy later in the day. 
In the U.S., consumer spending data is due Wednesday, along with GDP, jobless claims and durable goods. Equities and bond markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. "
911,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 10:36PM ET</span>",Peak Resources receives U.S. funding interest for rare earth project,"(Reuters) -  Peak Resources Ltd  (AX:PEK) on Tuesday said it received an indication from a U.S. government agency regarding possible funding for its Ngualla Rare Earth project in Southern (NYSE:SO) Tanzania.
The Overseas Private Investment Corp, a U.S. government agency that helps American businesses invest in emerging markets, would consider financing the African project, subject to a review and approval process, Peak Resources said in a statement.
The United States has been pushing to increase its rare earths capabilities to secure stable supply of the specialized material amid the country's trade conflict with China.
Since China is the world's largest producer of rare earth minerals there is concern the nation could use its supplies as a bargaining chip in its trade war with the United States.
The governments of Australia and the United States have said they would support and develop critical minerals and rare earths projects.
Rare earth minerals are used in electric vehicles, smart phones, renewable energy and defense applications, and Australia has some of the largest rare earths producers outside China."
912,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 10:31PM ET</span>",Lynas expects funding news for U.S. rare earths plant by end February,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's Lynas Corporation expects to make an announcement on how it will fund development of a new heavy rare earths processing facility in the United States by the end of February, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
The United States has sought to shore up its supplies of rare earths products this year, as escalating trade tensions between it and China fueled concerns that the world's dominant producer could restrict supply.
Lynas in May signed a preliminary agreement to build out a heavy rare earths separation plant with privately held Blue Line in Texas, which is likely to be followed by a light rare earths separation facility there, Chief Executive Amanda Lacaze told investors at the company's annual general meeting in Sydney.
Light rare earths, such as Neodymium, prized for their strong magnetic qualities, are used in everything from wind turbines to guided missiles. Heavy rare earths like lanthanum are used in industries such as lighting.
""We are in various different negotiations with respect to funding and offtake for that plant. We do expect to have more announcements on that sometime in the next two to three months,"" Lacaze said.
""The U.S. has allowed itself to be really exposed. We think by starting with a relatively defined facility there with heavy rare earths as a starting point we will help to reinvigorate the supply chain in that market.""
China dominates the supply chain of rare earths from mining to processing to magnet production, accounting for more than 80 percent of global supply. 
Lynas was part of an Australian trade delegation that visited Washington last week to promote closer ties between the two nations around minerals, she said.
For now, however, prices for its major products, Neodymium and Praseodymium 'NdPr', remain weak, Lacaze said. 
""Unfortunately we have not seen a sustained improvement in pricing,"" she said. 
""Part of the potential response from Chinese industry is to say well, we don’t want a lot of new supply starting up. So therefore, you would have seen the quotas for production in China have already been raised. And certainly the price at which they are prepared to sell their products remains ... in the doldrums."" 
China shipped out a fifth more rare earths magnets to the United States in October and lifted its annual rare earth output quotas by 10% earlier this month to record-high levels for 2019.
Lacaze also said that mine life at its Mount Weld rare earths deposit, one of the biggest and richest in the world, could extend beyond 25 years. 

""It is open at depth and it is open laterally. So we expect that it will have significantly more life as we go forward.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's chief executive, Elon Musk, will testify in his own defense against a defamation lawsuit brought by a British cave explorer, Musk's lawyer said on Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.
Vernon Unsworth is suing Musk for calling him a ""pedo guy."" Musk posted the tweet after Unsworth accused Musk in a CNN interview of grandstanding by offering to help Unsworth's diving team rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach from a Thailand cave in July 2018.
""Evidence is going to be through Mr. Musk (testifying) that in fact Mr. Musk didn't call him a pedophile. Mr. Musk deleted the tweet, apologized and moved on,"" Alexander Spiro, Musk’s attorney, told the court. 
There was no sign either side was interested in settling the case before a trial scheduled to begin on Dec. 3 in the Los Angeles federal court.
Unsworth will also testify, said his attorney, L. Lin Wood. He will provide evidence of damages by “talking about his worries, his anxieties, his concern by being branded a pedophile,” Wood told the court.
U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson called for a second day of pretrial hearings on Tuesday to thrash out what evidence can be used in next week's civil trial.
Last week, Wilson rejected Musk's attempt to have the lawsuit dismissed and also ruled that Unsworth was not a public figure - which makes it easier to prove defamation.
Unsworth can now win if he shows that Musk acted negligently when making his comments.
PUBLIC FIGURE
Musk had argued that Unsworth became a public figure because of his help with the high-profile rescue and needed to prove ""actual malice.""
Musk has apologized for the ""pedo guy"" comment, saying it was a common insult in South Africa where he was raised, and that he did not intend to accuse Unsworth of pedophilia.
Unsworth has denied the allegations and has said he had shared a house in the Thailand countryside with a 40-year-old woman who owned a nail salon.
The dispute between the two men arose after the search team decided not to use a mini-submarine offered by Musk's SpaceX rocket company to help with the rescue. Unsworth told CNN that the offer was a ""PR stunt"" and that Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurts.""
Unsworth is seeking compensatory and punitive damages..
Musk recently settled a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit over his Twitter use.
The case is Unsworth v Musk, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 18-08048."
914,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 08:53PM ET</span>",U.S. securities regulator proposes new rules on use of derivatives in exchange traded funds,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Monday proposed new regulations for the use of derivatives by investment funds to introduce some safeguards for more risky products and increase competition.
The proposal from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is subject to public consultation, would address concerns over the risks posed by so-called inverse and leveraged exchange traded funds (ETF), after some products experienced heavy losses during a spike in volatility in February 2018 subsequently dubbed ""volmageddon.""
Critics of the products blamed the magnified losses on their complexity, which many investors did not understand.
Monday's proposal partly reissues an earlier 2015 proposal meant to replace the current ad hoc product approvals system, which has allowed firms such as ProShares and Direxion to gain approval for their leveraged and inverse products.
Industry players have long complained that a lack of consistent rules has effectively barred new players in these products from entering the market to compete.
""By standardizing the framework for funds' derivatives risk management, the proposal would benefit investors, funds and our markets,"" said SEC Chairman Jay Clayton.
ETFs track baskets of stocks and have become popular due to their lower fees, but some have grown to include derivatives to amplify returns. 
Leveraged ETFs seek to magnify the performance of the indexes they track, like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for a single day. Inverse ETFs try to achieve the opposite performance, which allow investors to make money when the market or the underlying index declines.
If adopted, the new rules would require funds to limit leverage to 150% based on value-at-risk, the SEC said in its proposal, while it would allow leveraged and inverse products to limit their investment results to 300% of the return - or inverse of the return - of the underlying index.
The rules would also require all funds and advisers to determine upfront whether a customer is capable of evaluating the risk of these instruments before allowing investors to trade in leveraged or inverse ETFs.
Firms would have to implement a risk management program that includes spelling out in their prospectus whether they are subject to a proposed limit on fund leverage risk.

The agency said it would afford exemptions to firms that limit derivatives exposure to 10% of net assets or use derivatives only to hedge certain currency risks.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 08:44PM ET</span>",CBS ordered to disclose internal records on Viacom deal,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - A Delaware judge on Monday ordered broadcaster CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) to turn over records regarding its plan to reunite with Viacom Inc to a shareholder who wants to investigate if the deal unfairly benefits Shari Redstone, who controls both companies.
The deal is scheduled to close on Dec. 4, combining CBS television network, CBS News, Showtime cable networks with MTV Networks, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and the Paramount movie studios.
The judge, Joseph Slights of Delaware's Court of Chancery, ordered CBS to turn over materials the CBS board discussed when considering the merger with Viacom, which was split from CBS 13 years ago.
The company was also ordered to provide documents regarding the nomination and appointment of board members to the special committee that approved the merger earlier this year, as well as some communications between Redstone and the board.
CBS declined to comment and Viacom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shareholders were not given the opportunity to vote on the deal, which follows two recent failed attempts to merge the companies that are both controlled by National Amusements Inc, the holding company of Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari.
Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Delaware Law School in Wilmington, said the shareholder is likely to seek damages after the merger closes, rather than trying to block a deal that is closing soon.
Also on Monday, a Viacom shareholder, Louis Wilen, filed a proposed class action lawsuit against the board of Viacom in the same court. The complaint was filed under seal and no details beyond the parties' names were disclosed.
Shari Redstone's 2018 proposed merger with Viacom was rejected by the CBS board, a battle that pitted her against Les Moonves, who said the deal was harmful to CBS shareholders. 
Moonves was ousted as chief executive officer in September 2018, and National Amusements settled the litigation with an agreement not to seek a merger of the companies for at least two years.
Slights also ordered records from the earlier merger attempts to be turned over to the shareholder, Bucks County Employees Retirement Fund.
Slights found evidence that the deal may bail out Redstone's stake in Viacom and that Redstone may have violated the 2018 agreement. 

Slights did reject some of the requests for information. The judge declined to order the production of documents to determine the independence of CBS directors and refused to order CBS to turn over expert reports from the litigation over the proposed 2018 merger.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had been the only Republican among the state attorneys general who had argued that the deal to combine the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers would lead to higher prices and filed a lawsuit to stop it.
Also on Monday, Nevada said it would withdraw from the lawsuit in exchange for early deployment of the next generation of wireless in the state, creation of 450 jobs for six years and a $30 million donation to be distributed by Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford and aimed at helping women and minorities, Ford's office said.
Shares of Sprint rose 3.6 percent after the news. T-Mobile shares edged lower.
Without Texas and Nevada, 13 Democratic state attorneys general and the District of Columbia will take up the case. But Erik Gordon, who teaches at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business, said the remaining states were ""formidable.""
""If all that was left was Rhode Island and Wyoming, they'd be giggling at T-Mobile. Nobody underestimates New York and California,"" he said.
A trial is set to begin on Dec. 9 in Manhattan federal court. 
In a statement issued on Monday, Paxton's office said the agreement precludes the companies from raising prices for Texans for five years and commits the merged company to 5G network throughout Texas, including rural areas, during the next six years.
New York Attorney General Letitia James, who co-leads the lawsuit with California, said the deals that Texas and Nevada struck do not resolve antitrust concern about the proposed deal.
""The mega merger of T-Mobile and Sprint will reduce competition in the mobile marketplace,"" she said in a statement. ""There is no doubt that this merger remains bad for consumers, bad for workers, and bad for innovation, which is why we remain committed to litigating this matter.""
An adviser to California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that the ""coalition of states remains strong.""

The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission signed off on the merger after the companies agreed to divest Sprint's prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television company Dish Network Corp (O:DISH), and provide it with access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations. That deal is worth about $5 billion.

The trade optimism, which fueled the Russell's big gain, was based on a call by Chinese officials for speeding up new penalties and punitive action for infringement of patents and copyrights.The proposal was published over the weekend. The issue is key for U.S. tech companies, especially smaller tech companies trying to scale up their businesses.
In addition, Reuters reported a Chinese state-backed tabloid said Beijing and Washington were ""very close"" to an initial pact.
Tech stocks were also buoyed by a big gain in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which builds graphics chips used in games and in data centers. Nvidia helped the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rise 2.43%.
Health stocks moved higher, led by UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH).
The rally was quite broad, with 10 of the 11 S&P 500 sectors showing gains. The only decliner was the utilities sector, down 1.37% as investors were more confident in taking on more risk.
Among those that benefited from the optimism was Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), up 8.3% after a Bank of America/ Merrill analyst said the odds of a turnaround for the home wares retailer have improved greatly since the company hired Mark Tritton as its CEO in October. The shares are up nearly 86% since bottoming in August.
Among stocks hitting new 52-week highs were Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Buckle (NYSE:BKE),   General Electric   (NYSE:GE), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and RH (NYSE:RH).
Upscale jeweler Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) was up 6.2% after the venerable retailer agreed to sell out to French luxury-brand company LVMH (OTC:LVMUY) for $16.2 billion.
If there was a downside to the rally is that it is exhibiting signs of frothiness. The relative strength indexes for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished above 70 on Monday, a signal the market is getting overbought.
Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) RSI was 71 on Monday after the shares rose 1.75%. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 1.1%, hit a new all-time high of $151.35, saw its RSI finish the day at 73.
 
Crude oil  rose modestly. Gold  was lower. Interest rates also moved lower. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.75% from Friday's 1.774%.
Women's apparel company L Brands (NYSE:LB), Tiffany (NYSE:TIF), biotech company Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were the top S&P 500 performers on the day. 
Cable-and-broadcast giant Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Jacobs Engineering (NYSE:JEC), food processor JM Smucker (NYSE:SJM) and IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX), which specializes in animal health markets, were among the worst S&P 500 performers on Monday."
921,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 04:44PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. U.S. Consumer and Housing Data Due 
Top-tier economic data is on the calendar for tomorrow in the form of new home sales and consumer confidence.
The Conference Board will issue its measure of consumer confidence for November at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
The index is expected to rise to 126.9 in November from 125.9 last month, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Consumer confidence has come under added scrutiny in recent months amid growing concerns over business conditions and employment growth. But sentiment on the consumer remains bullish as few expect spending to slow ahead of the festive holiday season. 
At the same time, the latest data on new home sales are also slated for 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT) from the Commerce Department.
On average, economists predict that new home sales rebounded in October, rising 1.1% to a seasonally-adjusted rate of 709,000 units, following a 0.7% decline in sales in September.
2. Oil Supplies in Focus
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data will be closely watched Tuesday after signs that U.S. crude inventories are finally started to tighten following last week's smaller-than-expected build.
The API last week reported domestic crude oil inventories for the week ended Nov. 15, rose by 5.9 million barrels. But that was well above the 1.4 billion barrel build reported a day later by the Energy Information Administration.
Oil prices have been ticking higher in recent sessions ahead of OPEC's meeting next week, when the oil cartel may announce measures to prop up prices.
""Two out of our three alternative scenarios present upside risks to oil prices: an extension of the output deal with deeper cuts; or an extension with cuts to NGL [natural gas liquids] supply,"" JPMorgan said in a note.
Crude oil prices settled 24 cents higher at $58.01 a barrel.
3. Retail, Tech Earnings on Deck
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) reports third-quarter earnings before the opening bell on Tuesday.
The discount retailer is expected to report earnings of $1.13 a share on revenue of $5.74 billion, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com. The estimate is 4.2% lower than the $1.18 the company earned a year ago. Revenue would be up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter's $5.54 billion.
Shares are up 24.4% this year.
As well as earnings, same-store sales will be in focus to gauge whether the retailer has continued to mitigate the impact of increased tariffs on Chinese imported goods by diversifying its supply chain and cost control.
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) previously said it expected third-quarter sales of $5.66 billion to $5.77 billion. Analysts are looking for $5.74 billion.
 Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY), meanwhile, is expected to report earnings  of $1.03 a share on revenue of $9.71 billion, with many keen to see whether its sales of appliances, tablets, and headphones can continue to offset declines in video gaming and home theater sectors. In the year ago quarter,  Best Buy  earned 93 cents a share on revenue of $9.59 billion. Shares are up 40% this year.
The electronics-goods retailer has guided third-quarter comps to grow in the range of 0.5% and 1.5%.
Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) will also be among the retailers reporting results and is expected to report earnings of 38 cents a share on revenue of $1.91 billion, compared with earnings of 39 cents and revenue of $1.86 billion in the year-ago quarter.
In tech, Dell, VMware and HP are set to report quarterly results after the closing bell."
922,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 04:04PM ET</span>",How LVMH's whirlwind courtship sealed $16 billion Tiffany deal,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Sarah White
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Tiffany was codenamed ""Tea"" and LVMH was ""Latte"" in the whirlwind talks that led to the U.S. jeweler being taken over by the French luxury group for more than $16 billion, in a homage to famed film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".
The monikers were an attempt to ensure secrecy about a deal that LVMH wanted to seal swiftly before its competitors could intervene, according to two sources involved in the talks.
LVMH's bid approach was discussed by executives at the two companies in mid October, soon before the French firm launched a big factory in Johnson County, Texas, with U.S. President Donald Trump cutting the ribbon at the opening ceremony.
On Oct. 15, LVMH (PA:LVMH) executives had flown to New York, seeking to negotiate an agreement before Tiffany (N:TIF) reported its next results in December, one of the sources said. 
The urgency was driven by the fact that the Hong Kong protests and the U.S.-China trade war were expected to hit Tiffany's results and drive down its share price, potentially luring industry rivals looking to exploit its weakness, said the source.
""It was important for LVMH to be the first-mover because, when you are the world number one, it is difficult for rivals to launch a bidding war,"" he said.
The swoop was orchestrated by a trio of Italian businessmen, including LVMH managing director Antonio Belloni and Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, who played a key role in LVMH's 2011 acquisition of Italian jeweler Bulgari - the French group's first foray into high-end jewelry.
LVMH's billionaire boss Bernard Arnault, a renowned dealmaker, was himself focused on ensuring he was getting control of Tiffany's most valuable assets: all the patented elements that came with the Tiffany brand, notably its robin's egg blue boxes, the sources said.
""Bernard Arnault spent lots of time checking all the IPs and protections on the blue box. The most famous Tiffany product is actually its packaging, the color, the form, the white satin ribbon, all of this is protected,"" said one of the sources close to LVMH.
Arnault nodded to this in a Reuters interview on Monday following the announcement of the deal.
""We're the owner of a color,"" the 70-year-old said. ""It's a pretty rare thing."" 
THE ITALIAN JOB
LVMH is one of France's most famous companies and its marquee brand Louis Vuitton is First Lady Brigitte Macron's designer of choice, but its takeover of American giant Tiffany was essentially an Italian job. 
For this deal, Arnault relied on the close-knit connections that his right-hand man Belloni had forged with Tiffany's CEO Bogliolo and board member Francesco Trapani back in 2011 when the pair worked at Bulgari, the sources said. 
Their established relationship helped move the deal along swiftly and gave LVMH an advantage in its approach to Tiffany that few rivals could have emulated, they added.
Belloni, 65, met Tiffany's Bogliolo and Trapani almost a decade ago when he was leading LVMH's 3.7 billion euro ($4.1 billion) acquisition of Bulgari.
Trapani, 62, was the boss of Bulgari at the time, a company he led for 28 years. He joined LVMH in 2012 to oversee Bulgari's integration and then run LVMH's watches and jewelry division, a job he quit in 2014. 
Bogliolo, 54, was a senior executive at the Italian firm, reporting to Trapani. 
It was Rome-born Trapani who set in train the process that culminated with Tiffany's takeover. After amassing shares in the jeweler and backing an activist campaign, he ousted Tiffany's then-CEO in 2017 and offered the top job to Bogliolo. 
Bogliolo's subsequent struggles to turn around Tiffany amid a slowdown in luxury spending were closely monitored by Belloni who proposed a mid-October meeting to discuss a tie-up, according to the sources.
Belloni tapped a senior Italian banker at Citi, Luigi De Vecchi, to handle the talks, hoping to reach an agreement by the Thanksgiving celebrations on Nov. 28, said one of the sources who is close to LVMH.
De Vecchi was familiar with all the parties involved having worked on the Bulgari deal while he was at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
LVMH did not involve any French banks to negotiate its biggest-ever deal, with advisers in Paris pointing to Belloni's long-standing relationship with De Vecchi as the main reason. 

In the end, it took just over a month and three revised bids to get the Italian job done.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 04:02PM ET</span>",DHL to debut zero-emission electric delivery vans in U.S. cities,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) DHL Group's StreetScooter electric vehicle unit will enter the U.S. market next year as delivery firms and municipalities work to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
DHL will debut StreetScooter's zero-emission Work L delivery van in two urban U.S. markets, one on each coast, starting in Spring 2020, the companies said. They did not specify which markets would be the first.
Full deployment could come in 2022 and 2023, said Ulrich Stuhec, StreetScooter's chief technology officer, who joined the company from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co in October.
Los Angeles, London, Berlin, Tokyo and 30 other cities around the globe have been working to establish zero-emission zones by 2030. Those cities hope to curb accumulating greenhouse gases that contribute to extreme weather, higher temperatures and rising sea levels, which have steep economic, environmental and human costs. 
The transportation industry - which includes fossil fuel-burning ships, trains, trucks and planes - accounted for 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
Over the last three years, DHL has kicked off ""CO2-free last mile delivery"" efforts with German cities like Berlin, Hamburg and Munich.
Roughly 10,000 of the 12,000 StreetScooter electric vehicles on the road make DHL deliveries. They operate in Amsterdam, Vienna and cities around Germany - saving roughly 36,000 metric tons of CO2 per truck each year, StreetScooter said.
""We have the most experience on the road while others are still working on their first prototypes,"" StreetScooter's Stuhec said in a recent interview.  
Up-and-coming delivery competitor Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in September gave the electric vehicle industry a jolt with its plan to order 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian Automotive LLC, a company it funds. The first vans should hit streets in 2021. Meanwhile, Amazon said its delivery partners are using around 200 electric vehicles. 
 United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) has 1,000 electric and hybrid electric vehicles in its fleet, and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) last year announced plans to deploy 1,000 electric vehicles in California. 
DHL fully acquired StreetScooter in 2014. The unprofitable subsidiary is seeking new investors and customers to further ramp production. Current partners include the United Kingdom's Milk & More, which ordered 200 trucks, and Japanese delivery firm Yamato, which has started to deploy 500 planned vehicles. 

In September, StreetScooter cracked the world's biggest electric vehicle market - signing a memorandum of understanding with Chinese carmaker Chery Automobile Co to begin electric van production in 2021.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 03:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Impossible Foods eyes doubling valuation with new funding,"By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Impossible Foods Inc, maker of the plant-based Impossible Burger, is in talks with investors about a new round of fundraising that could more than double the $2 billion valuation it attained in May, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Redwood City, California-based company is seeking to capitalize on growing consumer demand for meat alternatives. Rival  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) has seen the value of its shares more than triple since going public in May, and is now worth around $4.8 billion.
Impossible Foods, aiming for a valuation of between $3 billion and $5 billion in the fundraising round, is looking to raise between $300 million and $400 million, the sources said. They cautioned that plans may change based on investor feedback.
Some existing Impossible Foods investors have been pushing for a larger raise at a higher valuation, one of the sources said. 
The fundraising could set the stage for an initial public offering (IPO) for Impossible Foods as early as next year, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.
""We need to consider every option for fueling our long-term growth. However, we have not announced any plans or timing regarding an IPO,"" an Impossible Foods spokeswoman said, declining to comment on any potential fundraising plans.
A big increase in the company's valuation would indicate venture capital investors remain willing to bankroll big valuations in private fundraisings, despite the struggles of several high-profile startups in 2019. 
Companies such as ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) have been unable to replicate high valuations attained in fundraising rounds in the stock market. 
Office-sharing company WeWork was valued at as much as $47 billion in private fundraising rounds, but was considering going public at a valuation of as low as $10 billion before postponing its IPO in September.
Impossible Foods, whose backers include venture capital investors Khosla Ventures and Horizons Ventures, as well as celebrities like tennis star Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB) and singer Katy Perry, has so far raised $777 million in the private market, according to data provider PitchBook. 
Impossible Foods says its burgers are sold at more than 15,000 restaurants around the world. It also recently started selling its products at certain U.S. grocery stores. 
The global meat substitutes market generated revenue of $4.2 billion in 2018, and is expected to be worth $6.1 billion by 2023, as more consumers convert to veganism or cut down on consumption of red meat, according to a report by Research on Global Markets.
Despite breakneck growth, some analysts have raised questions about whether the plant-based meat market has been overhyped. Beyond Meat shares, while still well above their IPO price from May, have pared gains to trade at less than half their all-time high.

Early market entrants like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat are also facing increasing competition from traditional meat producers and packaged food companies such as  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and Nestle SA (S:NESN).

Since no action was taken or announced on November 14 -- which marked the expiry of a 180 day period that President Donald Trump triggered in May to postpone tariffs on imported autos and auto parts pending bilateral trade negotiations -- there is now a broader belief that Trump has effectively lost his authority on implementing those tariffs, analyst John Murphy explained.
However, he questioned whether the industry has been lulled into a “false sense of security” as it’s possible that Trump may attempt to exert his authority and impose these tariffs on any relevant country at any point during the course of trade negotiations, further prolonging uncertainty.
“Trump may/can still attempt to implement Section 232 Autos tariffs,” the analyst added, noting that such an action could be vulnerable to court challenge.
Europe is the key trading bloc where the tariff pressures appear to be most acute, Murphy said, while Japan and Korea are likely in the clear. The analyst noted that according to the Center for Automotive Research, should the Section 232 tariffs be implemented on current non-exempt countries, the incremental price per unit would be around $2,750 per vehicle or a reduction in sales of about 1.3 million units."

The number of mainlanders traveling to Taiwan plunged by 52.5% year-on-year in October, according to data from its Tourism Bureau. This followed a big dip in September. October’s monthly drop was the biggest since Taiwan relaxed rules in 2008 to let Chinese tourists visit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
As a result of the falling number of Chinese tourists, Taiwan’s total visitor arrivals last month fell 2.15% from the same period the previous year, according to the tourism bureau. Visitor growth in the first 10 months slowed to 9.05%, or 9.73 million arrivals.
China imposed a travel ban on individual travelers to Taiwan with effect from Aug. 1, although Chinese nationals are still allowed to visit in tour groups. The move came as Beijing attempted to isolate Taiwan and Tsai Ing-wen, its independence-leaning president.

Nutrien Ltd. said Monday it notified workers of a two-week shutdown starting Dec. 2 at its Rocanville mine in the western Canadian province of Saskatchewan. About 550 of 600 employees are expected to be laid off.
It’s the latest sign that the strike by 3,200 conductors and railyard operators that began on Nov. 19 at Canadian National Railway Co. is starting to bite. Ships are waiting for grain off the West coast and the Montreal Port Authority reported cargoes of grain, sugar, minerals and bulk liquids are stalled on CN convoys.
“It is extremely disappointing that in a year when the agricultural sector has been severely impacted by poor weather and trade disputes, the CN strike will add further hardship to the Canadian agriculture industry,” Chuck Magro, chief executive officer of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Nutrien said in a statement. “Any further disruption will be harmful to our business, the Canadian economy, and Canada’s competitive position and reputation as a reliable supplier of fertilizer and food.”
More Layoffs
The shutdown equates to about 250,000 tons of potash production, according to Alexis Maxwell, a research director for Bloomberg Green Markets. Global potash markets have been weak this year, which has already prompted Nutrien to curtail production at some of it’s other Saskatchewan mines.
More furloughs are looming. In Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Canada’s east coast, the Unifor union said it received notice that 70 workers at a CN Rail autoport facility, which handles car distribution across North America, will be laid off as of Thursday due to the strike. The Chemical Industry Association of Canada also predicted companies would soon be shutting down operations and laying off workers.
Port Delays
About 12 vessels are waiting for grain in English Bay and another four in the Gulf Islands off the west coast of Vancouver, according to the Port of Vancouver.
“Things will really start to escalate at this point,” Mark Hemmes, president of grain monitor Quorum Corporation, said in a phone interview. “You can get away with a week or maybe 10 days, and see some recoverability.”
Jonathan Abecassis, a spokesman for CN, said negotiations continue and reiterated a call for binding arbitration. The network is operating at about 10% capacity, CN has said. A representative for the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference union didn’t immediately return calls.

The government, which faces calls from provinces and industry groups to force strikers back to work, has so far repeated a preference for a negotiated settlement.
The dispute, over working conditions and benefits, is threatening to hobble Canada’s export industries and stunt its already weakening growth. The strike could shave off almost a quarter-point from growth this quarter if it lasts through Dec. 5, according to Toronto-Dominion Bank economists. That’s when lawmakers, who have the power to break the impasse, return to parliament.
CN shares were down 0.3% at C$120.98 at 2 p.m. in Toronto and have lost about 2.3% since the strike began on Nov. 19.
Farmers in Montreal also marched to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s constituency office in the city on Monday to urge the government to find a way to end the strike.
An increasing number of grain producers have run out of propane and have little choice but to let crops rot in the fields, with financial losses in sight, said Patrice Juneau, a spokesman for the Quebec farmers union, L’Union des producteurs agricoles. Small animals such as piglets or chicks also can’t survive without heating, he said.
Some companies are starting to pitch in. Calgary-based Pembina Pipeline Corp. said in a statement Sunday that it plans to ship propane to parts of Canada, including Quebec. It’s preparing unit trains, made up of 105 cars, with propane sourced from western Canada. “Pembina’s facility is the only one in Canada capable of amassing these quantities of propane and building such unit trains,” the company said in its release."

Mark Tritton had been chief merchandising officer at   Target   (NYSE:TGT) before taking the Bed Bath & Beyond job in October. Analyst Curtis Nagle said he believes Tritton, who helped Target on its own turnaround, is the right man to lead Bed Bath & Beyond to a recovery.
The task will be daunting, Nagle wrote in a note. It will include selling non-core or unprofitable businesses, cost-cutting and store rationalization, selling unneeded real estate and, lastly, improving merchandising, sourcing, and in-store and online operations.
If the turnaround works, Bed Bath & Beyond could be generating EBITDA of more than $900 million annually by 2021, Nagle said. That would let the company buy back up to $1 billion in shares – about 60% of its current market capitalization.
Shares reached as high as $13.46 before settling back to $13.45, up 7.4 %. The shares are up 84% since hitting a 52-week low of $7.31 on August 15. For the year, they're up nearly 19%.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>",U.S. charges former Outcome Health executives over alleged fraud,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors announced criminal charges accusing the founders of Outcome Health of overseeing a fraudulent scheme to overbill clients and raise $487.5 million in financing from major investors.
Former Chief Executive Rishi Shah, former President Shradha Agarwal and two other former executives of the pharmaceutical advertising company were charged in a 26-count indictment in Chicago made public on Monday.
The charges were announced by the U.S. Department of Justice four weeks after Outcome agreed to pay $70 million to end its related criminal probe.
Outcome Health streams pharmaceutical ads on televisions and computer tablets it installs in doctors' offices.
Prosecutors said the defendants maintained a facade of ""extraordinary revenue growth"" through a scheme from 2011 to 2017 in which Outcome overstated its industry connections, billed clients for ads that never ran and inflated revenue.
They said this enabled the Chicago-based company to attract investors, such as affiliates of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Pritzker Group, and obtain a $5 billion valuation by 2017. Forbes magazine in 2017 estimated Shah's net worth at $3.6 billion.
Former Outcome Chief Financial Officer Brad Purdy and former Executive Vice President Ashik Desai were also charged in the indictment. Each count names one to three defendants, and Desai was named on one count.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against the defendants.
William Burck, a lawyer for Shah, said in a statement that his client was being ""scapegoated"" for the wrongdoing of others who cut deals with prosecutors. ""Mr. Shah will plead not guilty to these charges because he is, in fact, not guilty,"" Burck said.
Christina Egan, a lawyer for Agarwal, said in response to the SEC lawsuit that her client denied the agency's allegations and would defend herself in court. ""Shradha never committed fraud and never participated in any conspiracy,"" Egan said.
Purdy's lawyer had no immediate comment. A lawyer for Desai did not immediate respond to requests for comment.
Shah and Agarwal co-founded Outcome at 2006 while attending Northwestern University. Prosecutors said Shah owned an 80% stake, while Agarwal owned 20%.
Outcome's $70 million settlement, most of which has been paid, included a three-year non-prosecution agreement.
The company said in May it sold a majority stake to private equity firm Littlejohn & Co as part of a recapitalization."

The truck, made of stainless steel used in rockets and priced at $39,900 and above, failed to impress Wall Street last week after its ""armored glass"" windows shattered in a launch demonstration and analysts argued the design would not have mass appeal.
Tesla opened preorders immediately, however, and allowed potential buyers to book the truck by depositing a fully refundable $100, compared to the $1,000 Tesla charged for booking Model 3 sedans in 2016, drawing the flood of reservations and sending the company's shares back up on Monday.
Tesla received https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-model3-orders-idUSKCN0X41ZJ 325,000 orders for the Model 3 in the first week of bookings three years ago, and the initial number for the trucks suggested preorders could rival that. 
Not all orders translate into sales as many are likely eventually to be canceled and money refunded to depositors. Tesla plans to start manufacturing the Cybertruck around late-2021.
Even with Model 3's bigger deposit there was high churn, Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""$100 deposit for the truck? That's fluffy. Just a fluffy order number.""
The U.S. pickup truck market is one of the world's most profitable vehicle segments and is dominated by Ford , General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler.
Technology reviewer Marques Brownlee called the Cybertruck a ""tech-world disruptor"" and said for Tesla to enter the pick-up truck market, it had to stand out.
From touting the features of Cybertruck to taking a dig at Ford's F-150 pickup truck, Musk has been tweeting furiously to boost sales since Thursday's launch.
""Better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche 911,"" he tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/with_replies over the weekend, posting a video of the Cybertruck dragging the F-150 uphill.
Musk has long been using his 30 million Twitter following as a platform to sell Tesla's vehicles but landed in trouble last year when he tweeted he would take Tesla private before withdrawing the statement. 
As a result, he agreed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-musk-sec/teslas-musk-agrees-to-new-vetting-rules-for-tweets-in-sec-deal-idUSKCN1S22BV with U.S. regulators to submit his public statements about the company to vetting by legal counsel. Tesla did not respond to Reuters inquiries as to whether all of the tweets had been vetted. 
Shares of Tesla were last up 1.3% at $337.41 after touching a high of $344.57.

But an expected pullback in the shares of Nvidia failed to materialize and now the bank has turned bullish, touting the return of ""solid growth"" for Nvidia's key businesses.
RBC analyst Joseph Moore upgraded his rating on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to overweight from equal-weight and increased his price target to $259 from $217, sending shares of chipmaker more than 4% higher.
Nvidia is well position for growth in 2020, led by a return to solid growth in both key segments, gaming and datacenter, both of which have underperformed for the year amid tough semiconductor environment, added Moore.
Powered by ray tracing software, which boosts computer graphics performance, Nvidia's RTX graphics cards ""should generate more gamer enthusiasm in gaming products, and new data center workloads around conversational AI,"" leading to ""further data center growth,"" the Wall Street bank said.
RBC has not always been Nvidia's biggest fan over worries that the chipmaker's short-term fundamentals could not back up its lofty valuation, as shares have surged by about 65% for the year.
""The stock is expensive on near-term earnings, and we have held back as we thought that January quarter consensus was overly optimistic (which it did prove to be), but obviously that didn't give us the pullback/entry point that we had hoped for; we see upside from here,"" RBC said. ""All semiconductor stocks are at a premium multiple on 2020 earnings, but across the group we see Nvidia as having one of the best opportunities to maintain a high multiple as we shift to 2021."""

(Reuters) - EBay Inc (O:EBAY) will sell ticketing unit StubHub to ticket reseller Viagogo Ltd for $4.05 billion in cash, the companies said on Monday, nearly a year after the ecommerce major came under pressure from activist investors to hive off some of its businesses.
In January, activist investors Elliott Management Corp and Starboard Value had urged eBay to sell its ticket sales business and eBay Classifieds Group as part of a plan that could double the company's value.
Elliott valued StubHub between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, while eBay Classifieds between $8 billion and $12 billion.
Viagogo Chief Executive Officer Eric Baker had co-founded StubHub but left before the business was sold to eBay for $310 million in 2007.
Following the activist investors' request, eBay made changes to its board of directors in March. It announced a review of its StubHub and eBay Classifieds businesses as part of an agreement with activist investors to avert a proxy contest.
Elliott Management declined to comment on the development on Monday, while Starboard Value did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.
The online seller had been a target of activist investors before. In 2014, Carl Icahn asked eBay to spin off its payments unit PayPal, a move which the company followed through in 2015.
The deal, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020, comes after the exit of former CEO Devin Wenig in September, following his differences with the company's revamped board.
The e-commerce company is expected to provide an update on its classified ad business next year.
Last month, eBay forecast its holiday quarter revenue below estimates, as it faces intense competition from Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
""The core business remains challenged and these developments won't directly impact it this quarter,"" Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian said on the divestiture impacting eBay's holiday quarter.
Shares of eBay were up as much as 3.7% at $36.43 in early trade on Monday.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) & Co LLC acted as financial adviser to EBay, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Quinn Emanuel acted as legal advisers, according to the joint statement by the companies.
J.P. Morgan is acting as financial adviser to Viagogo, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Kirkland & Ellis LLP are its legal advisers."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's business ministry said it was looking at options for reforming accounting in a sign that a radical overhaul outlined by competition authorities to improve standards may be eased.
Sky News reported on Monday that ministry officials say a central recommendation from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in April that Britain's top 350 companies should hire two auditors was ""dead in the water"".
One of the auditors would have to come from outside the Big Four, the collective term for PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY that dominate auditing.
Both auditors would be fully liable for each audit but some industry officials say joint audits are impractical as auditors outside the Big Four do not yet have the resources to shoulder full legal responsibility for a string of major clients.
The CMA reviewed auditing after failures at builder Carillion and retailer BHS raised questions about audit quality, but the government has yet to say if it will implement the recommendations.
""As part of our ongoing consultation on audit market reform, we are discussing a range of policies with the industry,"" a business ministry spokesman said in response to the Sky report.
""It will be for ministers to determine the policy once a new government is formed.""
Britain goes to the polls on Dec. 12 and legislation would be needed for mandatory changes, with Brexit eating into parliamentary time.
Simon Dingemans, chair of the Financial Reporting Council, the audit sector's regulator, said in July he was not convinced that joint audits were the answer.
Michael Izza, chief executive of the ICAEW, a professional accounting body, called on Monday for ""proportionate and practical"" measures for reforming auditing given the global considerations for Britain.
The CMA, which had no comment, wants to meet with auditors, who say Big Four market share caps or ""shared audits"" would be more workable, an industry official said.
Shared audits refer to a main auditor, typically one of the Big Four, being liable for the audit, while a smaller auditor such as BDO, Grant Thornton or Mazars would audit part of the company but without the burden of liability.
""A number of challenger firms think that shared, rather than joint, audits are a sensible way to grow their business in the hope that they become realistic challengers to the Big Four in the fullness of time,"" Izza said.
The CMA rejected market caps but recommended that the Big Four should run their audit and more lucrative consulting arms separately to avoid conflicts of interest.
The opposition Labour Party said in its election manifesto that if in government it would implement this."
938,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>",Ex-Barclays executive says Qatar wanted to be its 'special' Gulf partner,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Former senior  Barclays  (L:BARC) executive Roger Jenkins told a fraud trial over undisclosed payments by the bank during the credit crisis that Qatar had wanted to be the British bank's ""special"" Gulf partner in 2008.
The former head of Barclays' Middle East business, and co-defendants Tom Kalaris, who ran its wealth division, and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions, deny conspiring to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation.
Giving evidence for the first time in the landmark London case, Jenkins, 64, said on Monday he first met former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, who was also head of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, in July 2007 in Sardinia.
Jenkins said the two men had dinner on a boat on the Italian island and met subsequently on the French Riviera at Cannes, in Los Angeles, Doha and London to discuss business deals in retail, real estate and banks as their relationship developed.
The case revolves around how Barclays avoided the fate of Lloyds (L:LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and averted a state bailout with an 11 billion pound ($14 billion) fundraising in June and October 2008.
Prosecutors allege the bankers lied to the market and other investors by not properly disclosing 322 million pounds of extra payments to Qatar, disguising them as ""bogus"" advisory services agreements.
Qatar, a major investor in Britain, and Sheikh Hamad are not accused of any wrongdoing.
When Barclays started to cast around for cornerstone investors during the financial crisis Jenkins, who was known as ""Big Dog"" by colleagues, wanted to bring in Qatar, which was seeking to diversify its vast oil and gas wealth.
On May 14, 2008, Kalaris emailed Jenkins to ask whether Sheikh Hamad had ""any sensitivity"" about Barclays approaching other potential investors, such as Abu Dhabi or Kuwait, or whether he wanted to be an exclusive Middle East player.
Jenkins, who read his emailed response out in court, said: ""Oh yes he won't like that. He wants to be (the) special Gulf guy.""
But Qatar had also watched RBS's steeply-discounted emergency rights, Jenkins said, and was a tough negotiator.
""They will have seen the RBS rights issue with a 42% discount so they would be pushing us as hard as possible to apply that discount to this transaction and apply an appropriate fee to this transaction,"" he told the jury.
The one-time graduate trainee rose to prominence at Barclays' structured capital markets division, which grew rapidly by helping clients navigate tax rules.
Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, which was only set up in 2005, was also booming and seeking investments. As cracks appeared in financial markets, Jenkins said Sheikh Hamad became increasingly interested in investing in banks.
Jenkins, who described his relationship with the sheikh as close, is due to continue giving evidence in a trial scheduled to last around five months."

LONDON (Reuters) - Governments face a struggle at a United Nations summit in Spain next week to inject momentum into efforts to curb global warming, dogged by lack of consensus, U.S. scepticism and disruptive protests demanding more action. 
Policymakers are under pressure as more extreme weather events, such as record floods in Venice and wildfires in Australia and California, are linked to climate change.
""The science is clearer and the devastating impacts of climate change continue across every region in the world,"" said analysts at HSBC.
""The silver lining is that public awareness has been growing and may raise the pressure to act, however bold and ambitious policies are sparse because of economic and geopolitical events,"" they added.
The annual U.N. climate conference, known as COP25 this year, aims to tackle outstanding issues around the Paris Agreement to limit a rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.
As current pledges under the agreement will not be enough to curb temperature rises and easily overshoot the 2C limit, countries have agreed to present more ambitious commitments by 2020 and every five years after that.
The two-week event will start on Dec. 2 in Madrid, after its original host, Santiago, the Chilean capital, withdrew last month due to riots over inequality.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has started the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, while Brazil has been criticized for developing the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) region for farming and mining amid concern over deforestation.
The European Union and Britain are grappling with Brexit and there is a snap UK general election on Dec. 12. A new EU Commission will also start work on Dec. 1, a day before the conference, which will see the current climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete replaced with Frans Timmermans.
Last year, nations agreed on a framework for implementing the Paris Agreement, breaking it down into themes such as how countries will report and monitor their national pledges to curb emissions and update their plans for emission cuts.
A U.N. summit in New York in September saw relatively few new proposals from governments despite calls by the U.N. secretary-general.
Several sticking points remain but one of the most contentious issues is around rules which determine how nations can use international carbon credits to meet their goals.
These rules should be designed to help drive emission cuts at a lower cost, thus generating finance for climate action.
""How these rules are decided will really make or break the Paris Agreement,"" said Kelly Levin, senior associate at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank.
If the rules are weak and allow more than one country to get credits for the same emission reductions, the environmental integrity of the whole agreement could be at risk, experts say."

(Reuters) -  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) agreed on Monday to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (O:AMTD) in an all-stock deal valued at $26 billion, creating a brokerage giant in a market that has been ravaged by price wars.
The acquisition will shake up the retail brokerage industry, creating a company with $5 trillion in assets under management and putting smaller rivals under pressure to scout for tie-ups.
The discount brokerage business is under pressure from new, nimbler startups that are gaining market share by eliminating commissions on stock trades.
Last month, Schwab became the first major brokerage to eliminate commissions, a move followed by others including Fidelity Investments, E*Trade Financial Corp (O:ETFC) and TD Ameritrade.
""In a low, or no fees world ... the pressure will be on other financial services rivals to try to keep up, or to gain further scale themselves,"" Bankrate.com senior economic analyst Mark Hamrick said.
While the deal could give Schwab an edge in the price war, analysts and anti-trust experts said the merger would face tough regulatory scrutiny, although it could still be approved.
""The industry will continue to have large players and we won't think it will derail a deal,"" said Stephen Biggar, director of financial institutions research at Argus Research.
The combined company will have about 65% to 70% of investment account assets, according to a note from KBW last week.
TERMS OF THE DEAL
As part of the deal, expected to close in the second half of 2020, Ameritrade stockholders will get 1.0837 Schwab shares for every share held, or $52.23 based on Schwab's Friday close.
TD Ameritrade shares rose as much as 7.6% to $51.80 in morning trading. They have surged 25% since Wednesday, a day before CNBC first reported on the talks.
TD Ameritrade, whose CEO Tim Hockey was due to step down in February, suspended its CEO search and named Chief Financial Officer Stephen Boyle as interim head to lead the company's proposed integration.
CNBC had reported that the combined company was expected to be led by Schwab's chief executive officer, Walt Bettinger.
Schwab shareholders will hold 69% of the combined company, while TD Ameritrade stockholders will have an 18% stake. The remaining roughly 13% stake will be held by  Toronto-Dominion Bank  (TO:TD), TD Ameritrade's largest shareholder."

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber (N:UBER) was stripped of its license to carry paying passengers in London on Monday for the second time in just over two years, pending an appeal, over a ""pattern of failures"" on safety and security.
Unauthorized drivers were able to upload their photos to others' accounts so that, on at least 14,000 trips, a driver other than the advertised one picked up passengers, the regulator Transport for London (TfL) said.
The ride-hailing firm immediately said it would appeal. The process is likely to include court action and could drag on for months, allowing Uber's roughly 45,000 drivers in London, one of its most important markets, to keep taking rides despite its license expiring on Monday. 
TfL said it had ""identified a pattern of failures by the company including several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk"", and that some journeys had been uninsured. 
""TfL does not have confidence that similar issues will not reoccur in the future, which has led it to conclude that the company is not fit and proper at this time.""
Uber, whose app-based ordering and demand-sensitive pricing have disrupted operators in many cities worldwide including drivers of London's ""black cabs"", said its systems were robust and that it would also introduce a new facial matching process.
""Over the last two years we have fundamentally changed how we operate in London,"" tweeted CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over weeks before Uber first lost its London license in 2017. 
""We have come very far — and we will keep going, for the millions of drivers and riders who rely on us."" 
Uber's shares fell by nearly 4% at the open in New York before largely recovering. 
The Silicon Valley company has run into regulatory barriers and a backlash in several markets, forcing it to withdraw completely from places such as Copenhagen and Hungary. 
In London, black cab drivers who see Uber as a threat to their hard-won livelihoods have blocked streets in protest, arguing they are being unfairly undercut by an inferior service.
LONG-RUNNING BATTLE 
The more than 22,000 ""cabbies"" are required to memorize the thousands of streets and landmarks within a six-mile radius of central London and pass a legendary test known as 'The Knowledge' in order to be licensed to pick up passengers on the street. 
A requirement since 1865, the process can be costly and takes on average three to four years to complete. Drivers for Uber and others such as Kapten and Bolt, helped nowadays by satellite navigation apps, face no such stipulation.
Despite the criticism it has faced, Uber is popular among many people for its convenient, cost-effective model. 
""Obviously it's going to be a big blow for a lot of people who find Uber so much more efficient and cheaper than taxis,"" said Londoner Rodney Brody. 
But the company and TfL have been at odds since the authority rejected a renewal request in 2017, faulting Uber's approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks, before a judge granted a probationary 15-month license in 2018. 
The roughly $50-billion firm, which went public in May but is not yet profitable, has implemented a series of changes including 24/7 telephone support and the proactive reporting of serious incidents to London police to assuage concerns. 
In September, TfL granted a two-month extension, far short of the maximum five years, and imposed further conditions. 
Ahead of the latest decision, Uber said it would improve drivers' safety training and provide a direct connection to emergency services.
Monday's decision comes around two weeks before a national election and less than six months before Londoners decide whether to re-elect Mayor Sadiq Khan, who is also chairman of TfL and a member of the opposition Labour party.
""I know this decision may be unpopular with Uber users, but their safety is the paramount concern,"" Khan said on Monday. 
Uber was first licensed in London in 2012, when the current prime minister, the Conservative Boris Johnson, was mayor.

Shaun Bailey, the Conservative seeking to replace Khan, said that ""London's reputation as a world-class city that is open for business has taken a hammer blow"".

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp agreed to pay $26 million to settle a nearly seven-year-old lawsuit accusing the fast food chain of underpaying U.S. staff at its corporate-owned restaurants in California.
The preliminary settlement resolves claims that the company used a timekeeping system that cheated workers out of overtime, barred workers from taking rest breaks during their shifts, and forced workers to clean and iron their uniforms out of pocket.
It resolves claims by about 38,000 cashiers and cooks in California, and is the largest wage settlement against Chicago-based McDonald's in the United States, representatives for the plaintiffs said.
The accord requires McDonald's to pay required overtime, track pay electronically, provide rest breaks during rather than at the start or end of shifts, and provide replacement work uniforms when old uniforms become damaged or worn out.
McDonald's denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The accord requires court approval.
In a statement, McDonald's said it still believes its employment practices complied with California labor law. It also said it is improving training at company-owned restaurants ""to promote continued compliance with all wage and hour laws.""
McDonald's has long been a target of labor organizers who claim it underpays workers and provides unsafe working conditions at company-owned and franchised restaurants.
On Nov. 12, the American Civil Liberties Union and workers in Michigan sued McDonald's for allegedly allowing sexual harassment to flourish at its restaurants.
Then on Nov. 21, a group of Chicago-area workers sued McDonald's and several franchisees over a recent restaurant redesign that they said left them vulnerable to physical attacks by angry customers.
Lawyers for the California workers may seek fees of up to one-third of the settlement amount, according to court papers.

McDonald's has roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants, of which approximately 95% are franchised. It has more than 38,000 restaurants worldwide.

945,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 11:25AM ET</span>",Eight electric pickup truck manufacturers to load up U.S. market by 2021,"By Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and his spacy Cybertruck have ignited a frenzy over electric pickups, and at least seven other U.S. automakers expect to build new battery-powered trucks by 2021.
The question is who will buy them.
Companies ranging from General Motors Co (N:GM) to startup Lordstown Motors Corp have said they plan to introduce electric pickups over the next two years, and are scheduled to build up to 250,000 a year by 2024, according to industry analysts.
Sales of those battery trucks, however, may not exceed 70,000 a year, even when many of the plants hit full production, according to AutoForecast Solutions analyst Sam Fiorani.
If demand falls that far short of production targets, ""there are going to be a lot of auto execs crying in their beer,"" predicts IHS Markit analyst Joe Langley.
Musk indicated on Twitter that Tesla has received 200,000 reservations, requiring $100 deposits, within 72 hours after unveiling its Cybertruck, and plans to build up to 50,000 a year. The wedge-shaped pickup is expected to go into production in late 2021, and to start selling for a price of just under $40,000.
The total U.S. market for conventional pickups powered by internal combustion engines is just over 3 million.
Many of the EV pickups are being touted by newcomers, including Bollinger Motors and Hercules Electric Vehicles, both based in the Detroit area, and Atlis Motor Vehicles, in Mesa, Arizona. Projected prices range from $45,000 to $125,000.
Lordstown Motors has a licensing deal with Ohio-based Workhorse to build an electric pickup called Endurance at GM's former assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Lordstown executives have said they plan to start production in late 2020, with prices starting at $52,500.
Perhaps the most important new electric pickup is the R1T from well-funded newcomer Rivian, the Michigan startup that includes  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) among its investors.
The R1T is slated to go into production late next year at a former Mitsubishi Motors plant in Normal, Illinois, and will be priced from $69,000. In its first full year of production, Rivian plans to build about 25,000 pickups, but is installing capacity to build up to 260,000 vehicles, including a companion electric SUV and an electric delivery van for Amazon.

GM and Ford both expect to begin building premium electric pickups in late 2021 at Detroit-area assembly plants. Each company expects annual electric truck production to hit around 40,000 by 2024, analysts said.

947,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 11:06AM ET</span>",EU close to addressing too-big-to-fail financial clearing house issue,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union governments are close to agreeing new rules for handling failures of clearing houses, increasing the burden on these firms to limit losses that might rock the financial system, EU documents and sources said.
The rules could set a global standard for regulators, which put clearing houses at the center of trading in over-the-counter derivatives and interest rate swaps after the 2008 financial crisis but did not agree on how to wind them down safely.
To lower risks in the multitrillion-dollar derivatives trade, clearing houses stand between both sides of a transaction and ensure its completion even if one side goes bust.
But the system is so reliant on them that they have become what analysts describe as ""too big to fail"", meaning they are so large that a collapse would send shock waves around the global financial system that could force governments to step in.
In what would be a major regulatory shift, EU governments are set to agree draft rules that would clearly define how to address clearing house failures, putting a higher financial burden on them and reducing costs for banks and other clients.
Draft documents prepared by the EU's Finnish presidency and seen by Reuters say clearing houses, also known as central counterparties, should use their own resources to cover losses ""before resorting to other recovery measures requiring financial contributions from clearing members.""
This would double clearing houses' contributions in a crisis to 50% of capital they are required to set aside by regulators against losses.
Finland has secured a broad consensus on the draft rules so they will be adopted by EU governments if no objections are raised by a large number of them by Tuesday evening, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The EU parliament also needs to approve the rules.
The clearing business is concentrated in a few houses primarily owned by the  London Stock Exchange  Group plc (L:LSE), International Exchange Inc (N:ICE) and CME Group Inc (O:CME). Most trades cleared through them come from about 10 big banks.
When one party in a transaction, whether a bank or fund, cannot meet its commitments, it is first to pay for its failure by using backstop capital set aside before the transaction.
If that is not enough, under existing rules, clearing houses contribute up to 25% of their capital, before a default fund financed by banks and other clearing clients is used.
The draft rules would force central counterparties to put up more of their own capital if the default fund was not sufficient to cover losses. Banks would need to pay extra cash only if this effort from clearing houses were still not enough.
But the draft does not explicitly require central counterparties to raise more capital after a recovery, leaving it unclear how they would close any gap opened by their crisis contributions.
It also remains unclear how the new rules would apply to Europe's largest clearing houses, which operate from London, after Britain leaves the EU."

The dollar was mixed.

The dollar turned higher against most of its major peers including the yen, though it weakened versus the British pound.
While doubts about the rally remain and haven investments such as bonds seem well-supported, stocks globally are approaching a third month of gains.

949,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 10:26AM ET</span>",LVMH aims to restore Tiffany's sparkle with $16.2 billion takeover,"By Sarah White and Gwénaëlle Barzic
PARIS (Reuters) - Louis Vuitton owner LVMH has agreed to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion in its biggest acquisition yet, as the French luxury goods maker bets it can restore the U.S. jeweller's lustre by investing in stores and new collections.
The $135-per share cash deal will boost LVMH's smallest business, the jewellery and watch division that is already home to Bulgari and Tag Heuer, help it expand in one of the fastest-growing industry sections and grow its U.S. presence.
It will have challenges to overcome too, as spending patterns shift and Chinese shoppers retreat from the United States to buy more at home, one of the side effects of a Beijing-Washington trade war that has weighed on Tiffany.
And the U.S. jeweller is still in turnaround mode as it tries to rejuvenate its image and lure shoppers online.
But the New York-based brand, founded in 1837 and known for its signature robin's egg blue boxes, still has a resonance as the go-to purveyor of engagement rings only a handful of rivals can match, such as Richemont-owned Cartier.
""It's an American icon, which is now going to become a little French too,"" LVMH's Chairman and Chief Executive Arnault told Reuters in an interview.
LVMH finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts that taking Tiffany off the stock market and investing in its products would help the company deliver its revival plan.
""We expect to bring Tiffany time and capital, which are two things that are not too easy to get when you report quarterly to the stock market,"" he said, adding LVMH would build on popular new Tiffany lines such as its more modern ""T"" jewellery ranges and saw potential for the brand in accessories like scarves.
The purchase crowns a string of acquisitions through which Arnault, France's richest man, has built up his conglomerate, including fashion brands like Christian Dior, wineries, and beauty retailers like Sephora.
Not all are profitable to the same degree - the group is still trying to revive its Marc Jacobs label - but Arnault cited the firm's 2011 acquisition of Bulgari as a model for Tiffany.
The group invested in store revamps, new product ranges and communication at the Italian jeweller, and lifted operating profits fivefold, Arnault said.
""I'm not saying we can do that (with Tiffany), but I think the potential is there,"" he added, saying the deal, to be financed with bonds and loans, would add 500 million to 600 million euros to LVMH operating profits in the first 12 month.
LVMH does not break out earnings for individual brands. The deal is expected to close in mid-2020.
COURTSHIP
LVMH shares were up 1.2% at 1430 GMT on Monday, while Tiffany's stock rose 6% in early New York trade.
Tiffany said in a joint statement with LVMH that its board of directors recommended shareholders approve the transaction.
The $135 per share bid is marks 7.5% premium over Tiffany's closing share price on Friday, and is more than 50% above where it stood before LVMH's interest emerged.
LVMH's official courtship of Tiffany lasted about five weeks after a first approach of $120 per share in mid October.
But LVMH has had eyes on the brand, also made famous by the 1961 movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn, for years, sources familiar with the situation said.
Tiffany, which has more than 300 stores worldwide and made almost half of its sales at home last year, has been struggling to win over young shoppers and its success outside of the United States has been uneven.
Like rivals, it is also likely to face a hit from street protests in Hong Kong, which has forced retailers to close stores. Tiffany reports third quarter earnings on Dec. 5.
Competition from lower-priced rivals such as Denmark's Pandora A/S and Signet Jewelers has muddied the waters in recent years, but LVMH is likely to want to position the brand at the higher end of the market, which is more profitable.
""Bernard Arnault will be able to invest massively in repositioning the brand, taking it more upmarket in the United States, and also pushing more in Asia and in Europe,"" one source close to the transaction said.
Growth in jewellery outpaced that of other luxury businesses such as fashion in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co, which forecast comparable sales in the $20 billion global jewellery market were set to grow 7% this year.
""Tiffany's brand equity and the strength of the image of its iconic 1837 Blue Box are more valuable than the current financials suggest,"" Jefferies analyst Flavio Cereda said in a note published just before the deal was confirmed.
""LVMH can leverage off these to launch a more concerted 'attack' on the Asian millennial market.""
Chinese consumers in their 20s and 30s are helping to fuel growth across the luxury goods industry.
LVMH has no short term plans to shake-up management at Tiffany, where ex-Bulgari executive Alessandro Bogliolo is now CEO, Arnault said, though he didn't rule out changes in the longer term.
Citi and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) advised LVMH, while Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) worked with Tiffany."

(Reuters) - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp (O:ADMP) said on Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve its opioid overdose treatment, Zimhi, sending its shares plunging 56%.
In a so-called complete response letter (CRL), the FDA questioned the treatment's chemistry, manufacturing and controls process, but not its safety or effectiveness, the company said.
The drug is a naloxone pre-filled single dose syringe used for emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, and investors hoped the treatment would help the San Diego-based company reduce its reliance on its emergency allergy shot, Symjepi.
Adamis Pharmaceuticals had revenue of about $5.9 million in the third quarter, a 54% jump from a year earlier on Symjepi demand.
Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Group analyst Jason McCarthy in a note, ahead of FDA's decision, estimated Zimhi to bring in peak sales of $70.8 mln in 2028.
""We believe the comments and recommendations stated in the CRL are manageable and plan to fully cooperate with the FDA,"" Adamis Chief Executive Dennis Carlo said in a statement.
The company said it will request a meeting with the FDA ""as soon as reasonably possible"" and plans to resubmit its application for approval.
Adamis is seeking to use Zimhi, which delivers high doses of naloxone, as part of the fight against the opioid crisis in the United States.
Opioids were involved in nearly 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last December had recommended prescribing or co-prescribing naloxone to high-risk patients for opioid overdose.
The company's shares were at 54 cents in morning trading. They had fallen 44% this year, through Friday's close."

Carolina Dybeck Happe will start in early 2020 and replaces Jamie Miller, whose departure was announced earlier this year as new Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp seeks to simplify operations and generate cash after booking billions of dollars in losses.
The company has been struggling with the fallout of a series of poor long-term financial bets, driving its share price as low as $6.4 last December from highs above $50 in 2000.
GE's aviation business has also come under pressure from the worldwide grounding of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX, for which it makes engines.
The company is betting on Happe's experience at Maersk, where her focus was on lowering costs, as it looks to stabilize its power business, which has long been a drag on earnings.
""The extent of the changes which are underway at the managerial and board level over the past 12-18 months bode well for a possible turnaround in the company’s culture, and eventually, in the operations,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note.
The analysts added that while Happe does not have much experience of highly levered turnarounds, her focus while working with Culp will likely be on improving margins and cash flow.
Other top executive appointments Culp has made since taking over as CEO in October 2018 include new heads for its gas power business and global supply chain.
However, Happe's departure comes at a bad time for Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping company, as it struggles with low freight rates and a slowdown in container shipping.
Maersk is still trying to find a firm footing more than three years after announcing a new strategy that would see it sell-off its oil and gas business and focus entirely on container and logistics services.

Shares of GE were marginally up in early trading, while those of Maersk were slightly down.

Market participants submitted $49.05 billion in bids for the Fed’s 42-day term repo operation, which matures Jan. 6, 2020. That was more than the $25 billion on offer. This was the first of three term operations to provide funding past the year-end period. The others will be held in the coming weeks.
Even with the Fed’s commitment to continue providing liquidity to the financial system around year-end, the market is still showing concerns. This is due to banks’ year-end balance-sheet constraints related to capital surcharges and other regulatory requirements.
“This uniquely provides funding over both November month-end and December year-end,” said Thomas Simons, a money-market economist at Jefferies. “This was a very attractive 42-day period to get cheap funding, for sure. The next few 42-day operations are smaller than this one, so there is some premium for ensuring that funding is secured early for fear of being outbid later on.”
The central bank has been injecting liquidity into the funding markets since Sept. 17, when the rate on overnight general collateral repo jumped to 10% from around 2%. The Fed has also begun buying Treasury bills to add reserves into the system.
The end of year repo rate in the market traded at 3.40% Monday, according to Curvature Securities. The current overnight rate for general collateral repo as about 1.59%, ICAP (LON:NXGN) data show.
At Monday’s term operation, the Fed accepted $19.25 billion of Treasuries at a stopout rate of 1.60% and the weighted average rate was 1.643%. It accepted no agency debt, but took $5.75 billion of mortgage-backed debt at 1.62%, with a weighted average rate of 1.632%.
For Jefferies’ Simons, Monday’s operation doesn’t indicate “near-term desperation for funding,” but with the risk of year-end being “a little bit sketchy,” it presented “a very good opportunity.”
The Fed also conducted an overnight operation Monday, injecting $68.5 billion into the system. This, like other similar operations conducted recently, was less than the maximum offering size of $120 billion.

ABU DHABI/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's executives met officials of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) on Monday to discuss a potential investment in the oil giant's share sale that could raise as much as $25.6 billion, three sources familiar with the talks said.
Aramco has struggled to attract a major cornerstone or anchor investor for its IPO, which could be potentially the world's biggest. It has also approached Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) and Singapore's GIC.
The meeting between Aramco and ADIA, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, was separate to an investor roadshow in Abu Dhabi, the second leg of a Gulf marketing effort by Aramco and its advisors.
A similar roadshow was held in Dubai on Sunday.
A spokesman for ADIA declined to comment. Aramco has said it does not comment on specific investor meetings.
""Aramco, have stepped up a gear this month, but the signs are that it is unlikely to be the blockbuster sale that the Kingdom once hoped for,"" said London-based Capital Economics in a note on Monday.
""And plans for this sale to be followed by an international listing seem to have lost momentum.""
The company has also canceled marketing roadshows for its listing outside of the Gulf because of the lack of interest from foreign institutional investors.
Some investors, who attended the Aramco roadshow in Abu Dhabi on Monday, also expressed mixed feelings about investing in the deal.
Aramco's future weight in the region's benchmark indices was a compelling reason for fund managers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to invest in its shares, a fund manager said after the roadshow.
But another fund manager said Aramco's dividend yield of 4.4% at the top end of its valuation was less attractive compared to other oil companies.
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) has a dividend yield of 6.48%, Refinitiv data shows.
Aramco is looking to sell 1.5% of the company in the deal, valuing the company between $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion. It has set a base dividend of $75 billion over five years.
The deal is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from its reliance on oil.
""For the biggest IPO in history, it is still a wait and see approach for us, how it will perform, who's going to make the market,"" said an investment advisor to high net worth investors in Abu Dhabi.
""The rich valuation, the recent attacks, the oil price, regional tensions – we are yet to get perspective on this.""

(TSX:KL) agreed to buy   Detour Gold Corp  . (TSX:DGC) for C$4.9 billion ($3.7 billion), furthering an M&A spree that’s swept the gold mining industry.
With an all-share deal, Kirkland will take advantage of a record stock price to acquire the company, which operates the Detour Lake mine in northeastern Ontario. The agreement values Detour at C$27.50 a share, a 24% premium to the closing price on Friday.
There’s been constant speculation about gold mining acquisitions after huge deals rocked the industry in the last year:  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM).’s acquisition of Goldcorp Inc. and Barrick Gold Corp.’s takeover of  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd. The two combinations created companies that dwarf the rest of the industry and mean that smaller miners feel the need to consolidate if they’re going to stay relevant to shareholders.
“The addition of Detour Lake provides an opportunity to add a third cornerstone asset that is located in our backyard,” Tony Makuch, chief executive officer of Kirkland, said in a statement.
Detour shareholstateders will receive 0.4343 share of Kirkland, according to the statement. After the deal is completed, existing Kirkland shareholders will own 73% of the new company, with Detour owners holding the rest.
Kirkland’s stock price has surged in the past three years, climbing more than 800%, as profits soared. That’s put the company in a strong position to expand.
The Detour Lake gold mine is expected to produce for more than 20 years and can generate 600,000 ounces a year. It’s about the same size as Kirkland’s biggest project, the Fosterville mine in Australia.
Detour shares have almost doubled this year, helped by a rally in gold prices. Paulson & Co. led an overthrow of the board in 2018 after a bitter proxy battle, in which he called for the company to put itself up for sale.
The new entity would have gold production of about 1.5 million ounces in 2019 and free cash flow of $700 million, Kirkland said.

961,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 08:26AM ET</span>","RBC’s $100 Billion Woman Buys More Stocks, Just Not in the U.S.","(Bloomberg) -- The manager of some of the largest investment funds in Canada is favoring European and Asian stocks over North American.
Sarah Riopelle, senior portfolio manager at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., boosted her equity allocation by 2 percentage points to 59% over the past month as she shifts her focus to markets outside of the U.S. and Canada.
“Valuations are very cheap, reasonable within Europe and fundamentals seem to be improving,” Riopelle, who oversees funds managing about C$130 billion ($100 billion), said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office.
More than one million Canadians are invested in funds she’s responsible for at the asset-management arm of Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s biggest bank by assets.
The price-to-earnings ratios for European and Asian benchmark equity indexes are at 14.5 and 13.7 times respectively, compared with 16.2 for the U.S. That coupled with improving economic indicators, monetary stimulus and the steepening of yield curves propelled these international markets to the forefront. Geopolitical concerns in Europe have also eased with the chances of a no-deal Brexit dropping.
Riopelle joins other strategists who have recommended buying euro-zone equities, citing the valuation discount and growth recovery prospects. EPFR Global data shows the fourth week of inflows for the region’s equity funds. Last week, the largest exchange-traded fund focused on European equities posted its biggest inflow since June 2017 in one session, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Portfolio flows to Asia also surged in recent weeks, pushing year-to-date equity inflows to the region’s emerging markets excluding China to about $23 billion.
After peaking at 61% two years ago, the funds had cut stocks “very gradually” to 57% this summer. “We are seeing signs that there’s some improvement in the economic metrics that make us a little bit more comfortable with a higher equity allocation. So we’ve been adding to stocks in two different trades,” Riopelle said.
She still sees value in U.S. stocks:
“We still think the U.S. market can generate positive returns over the next 12 months.”
On the long list of risks that Riopelle and her team monitor, protectionism and U.S.-China trade are a big focus. While U.S. politics hog the headlines, investors aren’t paying as much attention to it, she said. Canadian investors frequently ask about the housing market, interest rates and oil prices with half of the nation’s benchmark index heavily weighted to financials and energy stocks.
Riopelle oversees multiple funds under the Select banner, including the RBC Select Balanced Portfolio, the biggest investment fund in Canada with C$37 billion of assets. It’s returned 12% over the past 12 months, beating 88% of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Staying Competitive
As passive investing becomes increasingly popular, she’s also looking for new sources of alpha including private markets, which managers started entering about a year ago. The firm closed the first tranche for its RBC Canadian Core Real Estate Fund this month, raising C$1.25 billion, and has a C$8 billion mortgage business that she believes are good sources of alpha for clients.
“The traditional model of a fundamental portfolio manager picking stocks -- it’s going to be harder and harder to support that going forward,” she said."

(Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) said on Monday it will invest $400 million in a joint venture with Swiss drug company Ferring that is working on an experimental gene therapy for bladder cancer, the private equity giant's largest ever bet on drug development.
Investing in yet-to-be-approved medicines is a lucrative but also risky proposition for buyout firms, and only few have had the stomach to place such bets. Blackstone made its foray in the sector last year, acquiring Clarus, an investment firm specializing in life sciences.
For its part, Ferring will invest $170 million in the joint venture with Blackstone, dubbed FerGene, bringing its total funding to $570 million, the companies said in a statement.
FerGene is developing a gene therapy for bladder cancer patients with an aggressive form of the disease whose current options include having their bladder removed. The treatment works by entering the walls of the bladder where it releases a gene to trigger the patient’s own body to make a protein to fight off cancer.    
""We believe, and Ferring also believes, that this can change the standard of care in bladder cancer, a terrible disease,"" Nicholas Galakatos, senior managing director of Blackstone Life Sciences, said in an interview.
""Oncology is a new area for Ferring, but it is one that we as Blackstone Life Sciences have a lot of experience in""
The team assembled by Blackstone has worked at several of the world’s largest cancer drugmakers, including Roche unit Genentech,  Merck & Co  Inc (N:MRK), and Millennium Pharmaceuticals, now a part of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4502).
To minimize its risk, Blackstone invests in the late stages of drug development, when a medicine has already gone through important milestones. Late-stage drug development can also be expensive because of the clinical trials involved, something that Blackstone is seeking to capitalize on by partnering with pharmaceutical firms looking to share the cost burden.
FerGene's therapy, named nadofaragene firadenovec, is currently in the final stage of clinical research, results from which will be presented on Dec. 5 at the Society of Urologic Oncology's annual meeting.
Since it launched its life sciences unit, Blackstone has also formed a new company with  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) to study a type of heart drug. Blackstone invested $250 million in that venture."

The comments added to worries that a Chinese crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong could complicate the talks.
""A 'phase one' deal is now priced into markets; there isn't much upside that will come from that unless they announce something like a complete rollback of the tariffs imposed, (but) that doesn't really seem likely,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 06:56AM ET</span>","Britain's TSB to close 82 branches, slash costs in strategy overhaul","By Jesús Aguado and Lawrence White
LONDON/MADRID (Reuters) - British bank TSB will close 82 branches next year, about 15% of its total, as part of a turnaround plan aimed at achieving total cost savings of 100 million pounds ($128 million) by 2022.
The bank, whose roots go back about 200 years, was bought by Banco Sabadell for 1.7 billion pounds in 2015 as the Spanish bank sought to expand into Britain and secure higher revenues.
The move backfired when IT glitches sent TSB's costs spiraling, forcing Chief Executive Paul Pester to resign amid complaints from customers and lawmakers over the fiasco.
Under the new strategy, Pester's replacement Debbie Crosbie will follow a blueprint set by larger rivals like Lloyds (L:LLOY) and RBS (L:RBS), reducing branches and plowing money into digital channels to fend off upstart online rivals.
The bank did not give details on potential job losses from branch closures affecting its almost 8,000 staff in Britain.
Announcing its mid-term strategy for 2019-22, TSB said it expected savings to help improve its cost-to-income ratio by 15 percentage points by the end of the plan, as it attempts to turn a profit after last year's loss.
TSB said it was aiming for a profit after tax of 130 million to 140 million pounds by 2022, from a breakeven position now.
Restructuring charges will amount to 180 million pounds.
Since Sabadell bought TSB in 2015, the outlook has darkened amid uncertainty surrounding Britain's planned departure from the European Union and due to low interest rates, making it tougher to deliver a quick turnaround from last year's IT problems.
Sabadell Chairman Josep Oliu said this year TSB needed first to cut costs before potentially becoming a candidate for a sale or taking part in any consolidation in Britain.
Oliu said TSB was not expected to contribute positively to group's earnings until 2020.
TSB was hit by fresh IT problems on Friday that meant thousands of customers woke up to find wages and vital payments had not reached their accounts.
The IT failure came just days after TSB was heavily criticized in a law firm report for its handling of last year's crash, which locked nearly two million customers out of their accounts."

With the U.K. general election in full swing, an increasing number of equity market strategists and portfolio managers are turning their attention to the country’s equities, looking for opportunities after months of Brexit-induced underperformance.
In the coming days, traders’ focus will be on the sectors that could benefit the most from the Conservative Party’s election manifesto, unveiled on Sunday, such as construction and house-building companies.
Beyond that, the overall investor sentiment toward U.K. stocks is starting to change for the better, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists, who say the country’s shares are “potentially the best global equity opportunity for 2020.” They cite a much reduced risk of no-deal Brexit, relative valuations at 30-year lows, and very low positioning from asset managers who have shunned the market, spooked by all the political drama of the past year.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) strategists share this view, saying that British stocks are 14% undervalued according to their model based on lead indicators, sterling, crude prices and emerging markets.
The country’s small-caps look particularly attractive, Morgan Stanley says, given their high domestic exposure and low valuation in both absolute and relative terms. Indeed, the FTSE Small Cap index trade at a 35% discount to its 20-year average, and also at a 10-year low compared to U.K. mid-caps, despite the recent rise of the pound.
The case for U.K. stocks goes beyond valuation levels. The macro-economic picture could also become a catalyst for a recovery. Morgan Stanley economists expect the U.K. economy to rebound strongly next year, helped by substantial fiscal stimulus. They forecast GDP growth to rise from 0.4% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020 to 2.3% in the fourth quarter of the same year.
Credit Suisse also sees fiscal stimulus, of at least 1.5% of GDP, irrespective of which party forms the new government after the next election. Stimulus measures would potentially help consumer spending, which has been depressed since Brexit. This would be good news for the retail sector.
That’s for the medium-term outlook. For the time being, there aren’t clear signals of a rebound. Markit’s U.K. PMIs last week showed the U.K. economy’s performance this month was the worst since July 2016. The latest weakness was attributed to the uncertainty associated with Brexit negotiations and the general election.
For Mark Dowding, CIO at BlueBay Asset Management, although a Conservative majority is the most likely outcome, there is a sense that investors could be heading into December with a degree of complacency, pricing a clear Tory win by extrapolating national polls. When looking at polls seat by seat however, the race looks much closer, Dowding warns. This seems to have translated into FX markets: the pound has stalled lately, as did the unwinding of short positioning on sterling, as the chart below shows."

“It’s a smart move” that will help LVMH “launch a more concerted attack on the Asian millennial market,” Flavio Cereda, analyst at Jefferies International Ltd., wrote in a note. The deal also will likely lead to renewed speculation about other potential tie-ups among luxury players, including Richemont, privately held Chanel and Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA, Cereda wrote.
LVMH shares, which jumped to a record earlier this month, advanced as much as 2% in Paris and were the No. 2 gainer on France’s CAC 40 Index. The troubled Italian shoemaker Tod’s SpA (MI:TOD), often touted as a potential takeover target, climbed as much as 2% in Milan.
Relief over Sunday’s peaceful elections in Hong Kong and optimism about progress in China-U.S. trade talks also gave a boost to Europe’s luxury stocks on Monday.
Here’s what else analysts are saying about the LVMH-Tiffany deal:
Bryan Garnier, Loic Morvan (Buy on LVMH)
The deal should have a slightly enhancing impact on LVMH’s 2020 EPS (2.5%) and give a net debt/Ebitda ratio close to 0.9x by the end of 2020Acquisition will give LVMH a 20% share of the global jewelry market, “very close” to RichemontU.S. weighting in LVMH sales will increase to 26% from 23% given the U.S. weight in Tiffany’s sales (44%)Jefferies, Flavio Cereda (Hold on LVMH)
LVMH is the obvious acquirer for Tiffany, not only because of its deep pockets and annual EU5b in free cash flow generation, but also its status as a conglomerate and its need to bulk up its offering in hard luxury, which has grown organically since the 2011 purchase of BulgariWithout Tiffany, hard luxury would account for 9% of LVMH sales and 6% of Ebit in 2020; Tiffany would lift this to 15% and 11%, respectively -- so “still dwarfed” by soft luxury (42% and 66%), but attaining a “rather more relevant” roleDeal is a positive for LVMH as there are limited M+A opportunities of size in luxury generally; barring Rolex or Patek Philippe there are no others in hard luxury, the category LVMH needed to bulk up inBy contrast, it’s a negative for Richemont given that Tiffany allows LVMH to become a “far more credible competitor on its home turf, and one with deeper pockets and greater clout”RBC Europe, Rogerio Fujimori (Outperform on LVMH)
Sweetening the acquisition price to $135/share will require a bit more work from LVMH and a bit more time to generate a return on price paid in excess of the group’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) given multiples paid for Tiffany (3.7x sales, 16x Ebitda and 21x Ebit based on consensus estimates for fiscal year ending Jan. 2020)LVMH can still generate long-term value if it manages to reinvigorate Tiffany’s top-line story and improve profitability in the long termTiffany will probably require stronger initial reinvestment than Bulgari to reignite top-line growth, but should immediately benefit from back-office and distribution synergies as part of LVMH as well as the ability to explore faster the opportunities created by digitalRBC sees nearly 5% EPS accretion from deal in year 1 due to Tiffany’s profitable business model and LVMH’s low cost of debt in current ultra-low interest-rate environmentEven with the additional debt to buy Tiffany, LVMH’s balance sheet will remain strongLVMH Tiffany Tie-Up to Leader, Not All Bad for Richemont: BI React"

LVMH to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany
Shares in French luxury goods maker LVMH (PA:LVMH) rose after it said it has reached an agreement to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) for $16.2 billion, in its biggest acquisition to date.
The $135-per share cash deal will boost LVMH's smallest business, the jewelry and watch division and help it expand in one of the fastest-growing sections of the industry.
""The acquisition of Tiffany will strengthen LVMH's position in jewelry and further increase its presence in the United States,"" LVMH and Tiffany said in a joint statement.
Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said the transaction would ""provide further support, resources and momentum.""
Founded in New York in 1837 and known for its signature robin's egg blue packaging, Tiffany is one of the best-known names in the jewelry industry, but is in turnaround mode after struggling to win over younger shoppers in recent years.

Uber stripped of London license, again

Uber (NYSE:UBER) has been stripped of its London operating license for the second time in just over two years after the city's regulator said the global ride sharing company put passenger safety at risk.
A change to Uber's systems allowed unauthorized drivers to upload their photos to other drivers' accounts, meaning they could pick up passengers as if they were the booked driver, which happened in at least 14,000 trips, Transport for London (TfL) said.
Uber said it will appeal the ruling, which it called “extraordinary and wrong” and can continue to operate pending the outcome provided it launches official proceedings within 21 days.
3. Stocks set to rise on trade deal hopes
U.S. futures pointed to a higher open on Wall Street on Monday, at the start of a holiday shortened week, following reports that Washington and Beijing were nearing a trade agreement.
The Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper said on Monday China and the United States were ""very close"" to an initial trade agreement, adding to optimism from Friday, when the presidents of both the countries reiterated their desire for a deal.

Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein parent company PVH (NYSE:PVH) is due to report earnings ahead of the open, while HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) are scheduled to report after the close.
Jerome Powell speech
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce annual dinner later Monday and is expected to underline that the central bank is in no hurry to reassess the path of interest rates. The Fed has cut rates three times so far this year.
In congressional testimony on the economic outlook last week Powell said the impact of this year’s cuts were still to be fully felt and will let the central bank likely hit pause on further rate moves unless there is a “material” change in the economic outlook.
The Fed has one more interest-rate setting meeting before the end of the year, on Dec.10-11, but investors now see the Fed keeping interest rates unchanged until at least mid-2020.
5. Bitcoin extends slide to hit 6-month lows
Bitcoin extended a steep slide into a second week on Monday, falling below the psychologically important $7,000 level to plumb the lowest levels in six months following reports that Chinese authorities are cracking down on cryptocurrency operations.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency hit a low of $6,534.8, the weakest since May 11 and was trading at $6,940 by 5:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), according to the Investing.com Bitcoin index.
Bitcoin has fallen more than 26% this month but has still racked up substantial gains for the year after ending 2018 at $3,709.4. It hit highs of $13,929.8 in late June but was unable to sustain the gains made in the first half of the year and has been gradually declining since then.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>","China mandates 13 banks for U.S. dollar bond issue, seeks to raise over $3 billion","By Scott Murdoch and Andrew Galbraith
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's government has mandated 13 investment banks to lead a U.S. dollar sovereign bond deal, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters, its third since its international debt issuance program was revived two years ago.
A banker with direct knowledge of the transaction said China would likely seek to raise more than $3 billion, in line with the size of last year's deal.
The term sheet showed there will be four tranches of bonds, which have not been rated by any agency. A person familiar with the transaction said the tranches would be three-, five-, 10- and 20-years in maturity.
It would be the third transaction since 2017 when China launched its first U.S. dollar bond in 13 years.
The 2017 deal raised $2 billion while a separate transaction in 2018 raised another $3 billion.
Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore, said the deal would be closely watched by global investors. 
""The issuance will likely prove the popularity of China sovereign bonds, but more importantly, hard currency issuances help set up a benchmark for Chinese corporates to raise funds in foreign currencies,"" she said.
China sold its first euro-denominated bond in 15 years earlier in November, raising $4.4 billion and analysts believe the European markets will become a greater source of funds for the mainland in the future. 
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Tianhe Ji said the sovereign issue would also support the development of a U.S. dollar bond market for corporate debt issuers.
""The China offshore U.S. dollar bond market is increasingly mature, it’s necessary and valuable to have a full China sovereign US dollar interest rate curve,"" he said. 
The euro issuance was seen as a benchmark for Chinese issuers in the euro market, which could help steer corporate issuance away from dollar-denominated debt, at a time when China and the United States are embroiled in a protracted trade war.
The term sheet for the U.S. dollar transaction, which is due to begin Tuesday, shows the Chinese government has appointed Bank of China and Bank of Communications to lead the deal.

(Reuters) - French luxury goods group LVMH's deal to buy U.S. jewelry firm Tiffany boosted European shares to a one-week high on Monday, while optimism that Washington and Beijing would be able settle their trade spat also lifted investor sentiment.
Shares of LVMH (PA:LVMH) rose 1.8%, putting them on track for their best day in three weeks, as the French firm said it would buy  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF) for $16.2 billion. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.7%.
All the major European subsectors were trading higher, led by trade-sensitive miners (SXPP), which hit a two-week high after a report that China and the United States were ""very close"" to an initial trade agreement.
That added to optimism from Friday, when the presidents of both the countries reiterated their desire for a trade deal, helping the benchmark European index log its best day in three weeks.
""A 'phase one' deal is now priced into markets; there isn't much upside that will come from that unless they announce something like a complete rollback of the tariffs imposed (but) that doesn't really seem likely,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics.
Headlines surrounding the prolonged trade spat have dictated stock market moves this year, with the STOXX 600 index inching towards a record high on hopes the two sides would resolve their dispute, which has so far dulled sentiment and dented global growth.
A reading of the German IFO business climate index rose slightly in November from the previous month, but indicated that manufacturing in Europe's powerhouse was still stuck in a recession.
The numbers follow underwhelming PMI data on Friday, which showed business growth in the eurozone almost ground to a halt in November.
Investors have also looked to major central banks for clues on further monetary policy. ECB Chief Christine Lagarde said on Friday the central bank would continue to do its part to support the economy, but called on governments to strengthen domestic demand.
All eyes will now be on a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later on Monday.
UniCredit (MI:CRDI) rose 2%, fuelling a near 1% gain for Milan's bank-heavy FTSE MIB (FTMIB) index, after Italy's biggest lender confirmed it was in talks with Koc Holding over their joint venture in Turkey.

New investment deals by SoftBank are also under growing scrutiny after the group reported its first quarterly loss in 14 years, dragged down by an $8.9 billion hit at Vision Fund.
Paytm said on Monday it will expand into insurance, lending, stockbroking and investments and invest 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) over the next three years to bring in more users to its services.
""This new investment by our current and new investors is a reaffirmation of our commitment to serve Indians with new-age financial services,"" Paytm founder and chief executive Vijay Shekhar Sharma said in the statement.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2019 03:33AM ET</span>","Novartis takes on Sanofi, Amgen with $9.7 billion takeover of heart drug maker","By Silke Koltrowitz and John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) is betting on heart drug prospect inclisiran in a $9.7 billion takeover of The Medicines Co (O:MDCO) as it challenges cardiovascular medicines from  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN), Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O:REGN).
Novartis is paying $85 per share in cash, a 24% premium over The Medicines Co's closing price of $68.55 on Friday, to acquire the U.S. biotechnology company's lone drug, the cholesterol-lowering injection inclisiran. 
The deal shows Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan is ready to spend billions on not just rare disease treatments, as it did in 2018 when it paid $8.7 billion for gene therapy specialist AveXis, but also for cardiovascular medicines aimed at a market with potentially millions of patients.
Inclisiran, which still must win regulators' approval, is set to require twice-yearly injections by doctors, far less frequently than the 26-injection regimens of Amgen's Repatha and Sanofi's and Regeneron's Praluent cholesterol-lowering drugs.
""We believe that will lead to less patient abandonment,"" Narasimhan told investors on a call on Monday. ""Payers will have confidence knowing that physician administration will ensure patient compliance."" 
Novartis shares were seen up 0.2%, premarket indicators showed. 
Repatha and Praluent, which similar to inclisiran aim to inhibit PCSK9 proteins that lead to elevated levels of bad LDL cholesterol in people with heart disease, have struggled to gain traction due a demanding dosing regiment as well as objections to their price, which makers have been forced to slash to less than $6,000 annually. 
Narasimhan said he is confident that inclisiran can produce an attractive return on investment and contribute to sales starting in 2021, contingent upon regulatory approval and completion of the deal.
""We see returns well in excess of cost of capital,"" Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch said. Novartis plans to pay for with one-third cash and two-thirds long-term borrowings.
Inclisiran could become one of its best-selling medicines, Basel-based Novartis predicted, adding the transaction had been approved by the boards of both companies.
The acquisition would modestly dilute core earnings per share versus a no-deal scenario during the next few years, but should then be significantly accretive to group core operating income and core EPS in the medium term, Novartis said.
HEART DISEASE
Inclisiran, for use on top of statins by heart patients who struggle to lower their cholesterol levels with traditional therapy, is seen as complementing Novartis’s growing business with its heart-failure medicine Entresto, which topped the $1 billion annual revenue threshold last year.  
Narasimhan said the company can leverage the sales force it built up to help boost the initially slow Entresto sales to market inclisiran, too.
Novartis has historically had a strong cardiovascular drug franchise, but lost ground when Diovan, once a $6 billion-per-year seller, lost patent protection in 2012. It left the company without an immediate, innovative follow-up product.
The deal fits Narasimhan’s target of acquisitions of up to $10 billion to bolster the group's portfolio of medicines with new products or technologies.
Novartis' hunt for deals comes as billions in revenue is under threat from upcoming patent expirations including on Lucentis, for macular degeneration, iron overload medicine Exjade and $3.3 billion-per-year MS drug Gilenya.
Still, Novartis said it is confident that new products including inclisiran will help bolster growth and profitability.

It expects to expand core operating income margins in its Innovative Medicines division to the ""mid-thirties"" in the near term and to the ""mid-to high-thirties"" in the medium term.

(Reuters) - Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) must pay the price for giving ""a free pass to pedophiles"" as the corporate watchdog began investigating the lender over millions of breaches of money laundering laws.
Dutton is the third senior elected official to go on the offensive against the country's No. 2 retail bank after the financial crime watchdog accused Westpac of allowing payments between known child exploiters among 23 million transactions that violated anti-money laundering protocols.
After the financial crime agency AUSTRAC made the allegations in a lawsuit against Westpac last week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called on the bank's board to consider the CEO's future, while Attorney General Christian Porter described the alleged breaches ""off the charts"".
""It is clear ... that the Westpac Banking bosses, through their negligence, have given a free pass to pedophiles and there is a price to pay for that, and that price will be paid,"" Dutton told parliament on Monday.
The Australian government had ""no more important undertaking ... than to keep Australian children safe (and) it is clear that the Westpac Banking bosses have failed that obligation"", he added.
Westpac, which has an annual general meeting scheduled for Dec. 12, has so far resisted calls from politicians and investors for senior executives to be removed over the scandal which has so far wiped A$7.5 billion ($5 billion) from Westpac's market value.
In interviews with local media at the weekend, Westpac Chairman Lindsay Maxsted said firing CEO Brian Hartzer during the crisis would be destabilizing.
""For Brian not to be CEO would be an amazing piece of destabilization of a company. But we also understand, on the other hand, there is some destabilizing going on, possibly, by him being here,"" he was quoted saying in The Australian Financial Review.
Westpac has also said it would close its cross-border payment services that were named in the AUSTRAC lawsuit, and that its executive team would withhold all or part of their 2019 bonuses.
It has also said it will spend an extra A$80 million improving financial crime monitoring will in the 2020 financial year.
A Westpac spokesman did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Monday.
NEW FRONTS
Corporate regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, meanwhile, said it was investigating ""possible breaches of legislation it administers"" in relation to AUSTRAC's allegations. 
Law firm Phi Finney McDonald said it had been asked by institutional investors to consider filing a class action lawsuit against the country's oldest bank.
""Modern institutional investors take corporate governance issues extremely seriously,"" said lawfirm director Tim Finney. 
""The suggestion that a major bank could be so lax with its anti-money laundering systems that it potentially facilitated child abuse and exploitation is about as serious as it gets.""
Shares in Westpac closed down 1.3%, dropping for a fourth consecutive session and bringing its cumulative losses since AUSTRAC's accusations to 8%.

""Heads rolling would appease the market short-term and at least show that they are serious about changing the culture which clearly seems to have been at fault,"" said Henry Jennings, a senior analyst and portfolio manager at Marcus Today.

Musk, who has been regularly tweeting about the Cybertruck's features since its launch late Thursday, has also been updating his followers with the number of orders the company has received.
In an earlier tweet, Musk said the company had received 146,000 orders for Cybertruck, and tweeted again on Sunday saying ""200K"" - an apparent reference to the number of orders.
The company's website shows that an immediate payment of $100 is required to reserve an order for the Cybertruck, which has a starting price of $39,900.
The launch of its futuristic pickup on Thursday suffered a setback when the electric vehicle's ""armored glass"" windows shattered in a much-anticipated unveiling. The overall look of the electric vehicle had worried Wall Street on Friday, driving the automaker's shares to close 6.1% lower.
During the launch, Musk had taken aim at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when his boast about his new vehicle's windows backfired.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian airlines are cautious about the outlook for 2020 after trade disputes undermined confidence and led to economic growth below initial forecasts this year, the head of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) said on Monday.
Airline passenger growth in Asia has moderated this year to 4.4% in the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from 7.7% for the same period in 2018, AAPA statistics show. Asian cargo carriage fell 5.8% in the first nine months of the year amid a U.S.-China trade war.
""I think we need to be a little bit cautious,"" AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman told Reuters of the 2020 outlook after having met Asian airline chief executives in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
""If it turns out to be a bit better than expected then we will be ready to respond.""
AAPA moved the meeting to Kuala Lumpur after cancelling plans for a larger gathering in Hong Kong, citing the ""unpredictability"" of the situation following months of often violent protests in the Chinese-controlled city.
Several Asian airlines have cut flights to Hong Kong over the coming weeks as demand has fallen, which along with the grounding of the  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX have made growth more challenging.
Herdman said he believed the capacity adjustments to Hong Kong would be reversed once the political situation improved and tourists returned to the city.
Hong Kong's democrats romped to a landslide and symbolic majority in district council elections on Sunday in a rare lull in the unrest that has rocked the financial hub.
""The general feeling is Hong Kong will recover in due course,"" Herdman said. ""In the short term they (airlines) need to adjust to demand as they find it.""
AAPA on Monday announced Herdman, a former Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) executive, planned to depart in March after 15 years in his role. He will be replaced by Subhas Menon, a long-time executive at member carrier Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL)."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Monday said it will open a pop-up store on Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo Inc that will run until the end of December and carry a selection of about 1,000 products from overseas.
The move, which was initially reported by Reuters on Sunday, points to how the U.S. firm's China strategy is evolving after it decided earlier this year to stop operating a marketplace in the country for domestic-selling merchants.
In April, it said it would instead increase its focus on selling goods from abroad to Chinese buyers and on its other businesses in the country like cloud services. 
Amazon had found it difficult to compete with entrenched, home-grown players such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd's Tmall and its rival marketplace from JD.com Inc. In a sign of Tmall's dominance, Amazon opened an online store on the platform in 2015.
Its decision to open a store on Pinduoduo, however, points to how the four-year-old startup has disrupted Alibaba and JD.com's dominance of China's e-commerce market through its popularity with China's rural residents.
Competition between the three firms have heated up in recent months and Pinduoduo, which woos customers with deep discounts and group-buying deals, suffered an $11 billion slump in value last week after it posted a much wider-than-expected quarterly loss that stemmed from efforts to fight rivals with heavy subsidies.
""The Amazon Global Store pop-up store on Pinduoduo provides customers with a curated selection of about 1,000 overseas products with competitive prices, authenticity guarantee and convenient shipping,"" an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement.
""We look forward to enabling customers to enjoy cross-border shopping through this store, in addition to more deals and tens of millions of products available on z.cn,"" she said, referring to the website Amazon.cn.
A spokeswoman for Pinduoduo said that the initiative was part of an aim to ""offer equal opportunIties for our users to access global products"". 

""We are committed to working with our partners as part of our global outreach to offer best value-for-money products worldwide to our users,"" she said.

The Hang Seng Index surged 1.9% by 10:40 PM ET (02:40 GMT). Developers’ stocks outperformed as they are most sensitive to the demonstrations. Wharf Real Estate Investment Co Ltd (HK:1997) jumped 5.3%, while New World Development Co Ltd (HK:0017) climbed 2.7%.
The latest election will likely prompt the city’s government to respond to some key issues, analysts said. 
“If some of these issues could be handled peacefully and smoothly, then the market may have confidence that violence may stop in near future,” said Andy Wong, a fund manager at LW Asset Management in a Bloomberg report. 
“There is this relief that pro-democracy protesters are now being represented, and the government has to deal with this,” said Airy Lau, an investment director at Fair Capital Management Ltd. “I don’t think the government will respond in a harsh way.”
Meanwhile, Chinese state media continued to criticize the U.S. and accused it of meddling in Beijing’s internal affairs. Attempts to use Hong Kong “to contain China’s development is a pipe dream,” according to the People’s Daily. “Their evil hope is that Hong Kong will go down in chaos and become a card in their hands to hold back China’s development,” the state-run media said in a front-page commentary. 
Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday also called the U.S. the “biggest destabilizing element.”
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.4%, while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.6%.
Citing sources including U.S. and Beijing officials, lawmakers and trade experts, Reuters reported that a phase two trade agreement is looking less likely as China and the U.S. are struggling to even reach a preliminary phase one deal. Reuters previously reported that the signing of a partial trade deal might slide into next year. 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.8% higher. South Korea’s KOSPI advanced 1.0%.

Australia's financial crime watchdog ordered the company to conduct the independent audit earlier this year amid concerns over non-compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws.
The move caused ripples in a sector that has become a darling of stock analysts due to its global expansion and ability to benefit from online shopping growth..
The auditor found Afterpay was ""now appropriately aligned"" to AML/CTF rules, Afterpay said in a filing to the stock exchange. The company reiterated it had not found any money-laundering or terrorism-financing activity on its systems.
The regulator, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), would now consider the auditor's report and determine whether any further action was required, Afterpay said.
AUSTRAC ordered a similar audit of  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) in September, flagging concerns that reporting obligations had not been met.
Buy-now-pay-later companies let shoppers purchase products without paying upfront, and without the regulatory hurdle of applying for a credit card or loan, and typically make money by receiving fees from vendors.
Australia's financial sector is under mounting regulatory scrutiny after a series of scandals and revelations of widespread wrongdoing, including massive breaches of AML/CTF rules.
AUSTRAC last week accused the country's second-largest, lender Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), of failing to report millions of suspect transactions."

(Reuters) - Debt restructuring and investment banking advisory firm TRS Advisors LLC said on Sunday it has brought on distressed debt investor Sara Tirschwell as a consultant.
Tirschwell has worked on Wall Street for two decades, and became more widely known last year after filing a lawsuit against bond manager TCW Group Inc, which had hired her in 2016 to run a newly launched distressed debt fund.
The suit alleges TCW dismissed her in retaliation for complaining about being sexually harassed and coerced into sex by her boss.
TCW has said Tirschwell was let go because she had violated the firm's conflict of interest rules, denying it committed gender-based discrimination or harassment.
She is seeking damages of $30 million, the amount that, according to Tirschwell, she was told by TCW she could make running the new fund. The lawsuit is pending in court.
TRS, a New York-based firm launched last year by the former co-head of Rothshild's North American restructuring advisory business Todd Snyder, has brought Tirschwell on board on a month-to-month contract, Snyder told Reuters.
TRS has turned to Tirschwell to help build out its practice focused on assisting managers of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) deal with potential defaults.
""TRS Advisors is excited to be working with Sara to provide reorganization and restructuring advice to the CLO community,"" Snyder said.
TRS's introductory materials for prospective clients, seen by Reuters, name Tirschwell as one of two senior leaders, in addition to Snyder.
The materials make no reference to her tenure at TCW, but cite her experience of 11 years at hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, where she led distressed investments in savings bank Washington Mutual Inc, paper company Smurfit-Stone Container Corp, and pastry maker Hostess Brands, among others.
After leaving TCW, Tirschwell became interim chief financial officer at Foundation House, a transitional sober living program for men aged 17 to 35, according to the program's website.
Tirschwell said in an interview that she was worried she might never find a another salaried position in her field, as her network of hedge fund managers, bankers and lawyers stopped returning her calls.
""I had to conserve cash. I had my girls to think of and I had to put food on the table. I put my apartment on the market and I got rid of the parking garage,"" Tirschwell said.
TCW did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tirschwell's new role.
There has also been a lull in opportunities for distressed debt investors, due in part to a prolonged period of low interest rates, which have allowed many debt-saddled companies to refinance their debt. This could change in a potential economic downturn, creating opportunities for firms such as TRS."

Listed small and medium-sized banks have a limited ability to raise funds externally and have limited tools for issuing capital replenishment bonds, the commentary said.
""Regulators should consider designing diversified and differentiated means and indicators and implement differentiated regulation to better guide small and medium-sized banks forward on the road of differentiated development,"" it said.
Beijing is trying to soothe investor concerns about troubled smaller lenders as economic growth slows to near 30-year lows.
State-backed investors became key shareholders in  Harbin Bank  (HK:6138) this month in a $2 billion deal.
Earlier this year, regulators took control of Inner Mongolia's Baoshang Bank, citing ""serious"" credit risks and improper and significant illegal use of bank funds.

The personal computer maker said last Sunday it rebuffed Xerox's offer, and that it was open to exploring its own bid for the U.S. printer maker. Xerox had offered HP shareholders $22 per share, involving $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox share for each HP share, according to a Nov. 5 letter. 
""We reiterate that we reject Xerox's proposal as it significantly undervalues HP,"" HP said in a letter to Xerox made public on Sunday.
""There continues to be uncertainty regarding Xerox's ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration and concerns regarding the prudence of the resulting outsized debt burden on the value of the combined company's stock even if the financing were obtained,"" the letter added.
HP also said it was concerned that Xerox's exit from Fujifilm's joint venture earlier this month left a ""sizeable strategic hole in Xerox's portfolio"".

Xerox threatened on Thursday to take its $33.5 billion buyout bid for HP hostile, if the company did not agree to a ""friendly"" discussion and open its books before Monday.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2019 05:57PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Conditions may be set for Santa Claus rally,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - (This November 22 story has been refiled to add dropped word in paragraph 12.)
A year after the U.S. stock market plunged, many investors believe conditions are in place to avoid another year-end pullback and possibly set the stage for a rally to finish off 2019.
A more accommodative Federal Reserve compared with a year ago is an important argument for investors who are confident the market is unlikely to see a repeat of 2018's swoon.
Last year, investors were concerned the Fed was raising interest rates too quickly. By contrast, the Fed has been cutting rates this year, and while the central bank is not expected to lower rates again in December, it also is not expected to raise them.
Another change from a year ago, cited by investors: Stock markets globally are more synchronized in their strong performance.
""The prospects this year are better,"" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. ""It's not just the U.S. that's doing well right now. It's happening in lots of places around the globe, and that puts investors in a more risk-taking mood.""
One wild card for markets heading into year-end is the United States' trade war with China. The dispute remains unresolved, but there is optimism about a preliminary U.S.-China trade agreement that could also lift stocks into the new year.
Investors are still wary of last year's stock market collapse. The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) fell 19.8% - barely avoiding a bear market - between Sept. 20 and Dec. 24. 
The index's 2.7% collapse on the eve of the Christmas holiday marked the bottom, and the S&P 500 (SPX) registered its biggest percentage decline for a fourth quarter since 2008, the height of the financial crisis.
""It's in the back of everyone's mind. We're all worried if there's going to be another big selloff in December,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""We don't think so,"" he said. What's more, with the current strength in markets globally, ""you could have a chase into the end of the year.""
Equity indexes around the world have joined U.S. stock averages in recent weeks in setting new highs. So far this year, Europe's Stoxx 600 (STOXX) is up about 19% and recently hit its highest level in more than four years.
At this time last year, the S&P 500 was up about 1% for the year to date, but the European index was down about 9%. 
With stock performance at the very end of the year, there is often more at stake than just feeling good around the holidays.
The last five trading days of the year and the first two of the new year comprise the traditional Santa Claus rally, according to the ""Stock Trader's Almanac."" 
In 2018, the market bounced back after its Dec. 24 plunge, resulting in an overall gain of 1.3% for those seven trading sessions - right in line with the historical average, based on the almanac's data going back to 1950. 
But any absence of a Santa Claus rally could portend rough times for the market in the months ahead.
""Santa's failure to show tends to precede bear markets, or times stocks could be purchased later in the year at much lower prices,"" the almanac says.
A year-end rally could be derailed by any upset on the U.S.-China trade front.
""We're six weeks removed from the announcement there was going to be a trade deal between the U.S. and China, and it doesn't seem like we're necessarily closer to hearing about that deal or what it entails,"" said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen in New York. 
Yet, ""the market has continued to push higher on most days on optimism the two sides are still talking. So there's room for disappointment there for sure.""
Also, Nick said, the market could have trouble rallying into year end given the recent sharp move up. ""It feels like we maybe we got the Santa Claus rally a little bit early this year.""
Any sign of disappointing sales over Black Friday and the holiday season could be another risk, strategists said. 
But there are plenty who still expect holiday cheer for Wall Street this year, and upbeat news on trade would only add to that view. 
""Between now and the end of the year, I'm assuming there will be a Santa Claus rally,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2019 05:41PM ET</span>",SoftBank to go ahead with WeWork stock tender offer this week,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Anirban Sen
NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) will this week launch a previously agreed tender offer for as much as $3 billion of WeWork shares, including up to $970 million owned by the office sharing company's cofounder Adam Neumann, two people familiar with the matter said.
The tender offer to the founders, investors and employees owning stock was expected to launch earlier this month but was delayed after SoftBank sought technical revisions to the offer documents, according to the sources.
It will go ahead based on the previously announced terms at $19.19 a WeWork share as soon as Monday, these people said.
Last Thursday, Bloomberg reported that executives at SoftBank, the giant Japanese technology investment company, had been looking for a way to reduce the size of the offer, including limiting the amount paid to Neumann. The report said that some SoftBank executives felt the payout to Neumann was too generous.
The people familiar with the matter said there was no discussion between WeWork and SoftBank about changing the terms of the offer, which one of the sources said could have opened SoftBank up to lawsuits from Neumann and others.
Spokeswomen at SoftBank and at WeWork both declined to comment.
The offer is a crucial part of SoftBank's $9.5 billion rescue of WeWork agreed in October. SoftBank is also providing $6.5 billion in debt and equity financing to the company, which has been suffering huge losses and was fast running out of cash.
It lays the way for SoftBank to control about 80 percent of WeWork and is part of an agreement with Neumann that will see him give up voting control of the company and leave the board.
In addition to the money Neumann will get from selling his shares, SoftBank has given him a $500 million line of credit to help repay his bank loans and a $185 million advisory fee as part of the original deal. Neumann has already drawn about $400 million of the $500 million credit, according to the sources, and is obligated under the terms of the agreement to use any proceeds he receives from the tender offer to pay SoftBank back.
WeWork said on Thursday it is laying off around 2,400 employees globally as it seeks to drastically cut costs and stabilize its business after its dramatic fall from grace. The company had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others who work for affiliates.
After being valued at $47 billion in January and planning an initial public offering (IPO), WeWork quickly became a company that was facing a cash crunch and fighting for survival. It shelved its plans for the IPO on Sept. 30 because investors were wary of its growing losses, its business model and its corporate governance. Neumann had resigned as CEO the previous week.
Marcelo Claure, the new executive chairman of WeWork’s parent, The We Company, told WeWork employees last month he had “no idea” how many shares Neumann was going to sell in the tender.
Neumann has more than a 20 percent stake in WeWork but his real power came from super-voting stock that gave him control. His ability to use super-voting stock will disappear as part of the deal with SoftBank.
The size of Neumann’s potential payout at a time when the company is firing workers led Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is among the contenders seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, to tweet on Friday that ""this is another example of a rigged and corrupt system."" A spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment."

Some 9,000 employees of the publicly owned postal service Posti have been on a two-week strike against pay cuts and several Finnish employee unions are taking actions to support the strike.
Finnair said around 20,000 travelers would be affected by its cancellations, caused by the Finnish airport workers' union's decision to join the solidarity strike on Monday if no resolution to the postal service dispute was found by Sunday.
Finland's chief labor conciliator, Vuokko Piekkala, said on Sunday attempts to forge an agreement in the dispute had failed, after extensive negotiations over the weekend.
Piekkala said it was not immediately clear when negotiations would restart.
Finnair spokeswoman Paivyt Tallqvist said: ""Our current estimate is that we could operate some 120 of our 377 flights scheduled for tomorrow.""
Juhani Haapasaari, chairman of the Finnish Aviation Union, had told Reuters earlier this week that the strike would affect air traffic's ground services, including catering, technical services, cargo, security checks and consequently all airlines flying to and from Finland.
The solidarity strikes were expected to largely stall public bus transport in Finland's capital Helsinki on Monday, while the Finnish Seafarers' Union said it would stop all passenger and cargo vessels flying the Finnish flag in Finnish ports starting on Monday until further notice.
The strike has also led to mail deliveries being interrupted in Finland ahead of the busy Christmas season.
Apart from the postal strike, there might be more widespread strikes on the way, potentially affecting other Finnish industries, as three other employee unions called at least 85,000 workers to join a three-day strike starting December 9 in separate wage disputes."

(Reuters) - LVMH (PA:LVMH) is close to buying U.S. jewelry chain Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) for about $16.3 billion after sweetening its offer, sources said on Sunday, as the owner of Louis Vuitton and Bulgari aims to tap the fast-growing luxury jewelry market. 
The two sides are close to an agreement after the French luxury goods company raised its offer price for the company known for its engagement rings and ties to Hollywood glamor to $135 per share, sources familiar with the matter said.
The boards of both companies will be presented with the terms of the deal on Sunday, one source said. A deal could be announced later on Sunday or on Monday, two other sources said. 
It would be LVMH's largest takeover. 
The new price is up from $130 last week and $15 higher than the original all-cash offer delivered to Tiffany by LVMH managing director Antonio Belloni on Oct. 18.
It represents a 7.5% premium over Tiffany's closing share price on Friday and is more than 50% higher than where the price stood before LVMH launched its effort to woo the company.
The two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Aside from the price tag, the terms are not known.
LVMH, owned by Europe's richest man, Bernard Arnault, has eyed the company for years after buying Italy's Bulgari in 2011 for 3.7 billion euros, at the time the largest luxury goods deal in a decade. 
Tiffany will help grow its smallest business, give it a bigger share of the lucrative U.S. market and expand in jewelry, the fastest-growing sector in the luxury goods industry.
Known for its signature robin's egg blue packaging, Tiffany rebuffed LVMH's initial advance made just five weeks ago, arguing it significantly undervalued the company.
Reuters reported this week that LVMH had persuaded Tiffany to provide it with confidential due diligence after it raised its bid to $130 per share, worth almost $16 billion. 
The news of Sunday's boosted offer was first reported by the Financial Times. 
Tiffany, founded in New York in 1837 and featured in the 1961 movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn, had struggled with falling annual sales and profit since 2015, before a revenue turnaround in 2017.
Jewelry was one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the $20 billion global market were set to grow 7% this year. 
Under Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo, former head of fashion firm Diesel and a Bulgari alumnus, Tiffany has been building up its e-commerce business and is trying to court younger shoppers with more affordable pendants, earrings and new designs.

Unizo said it had received offers from four overseas investment funds and one Japanese fund as well as one domestic company, without naming the bidders.
Unizo said none of the offers would meet its demands.
The multiple offers may further complicate the takeover saga surrounding the hotel operator, which is already in talks with two top global investment groups - Blackstone and Fortress Investment Group.
Unizo in July became a target for a hostile bid by a Japanese travel agent H.I.S. Co (T:9603). Unizo at one stage turned to SoftBank Group-owned (T:9984) Fortress to fend off the bid. But later it withdrew its support for Fortress' white-knight offer.
Last month, Blackstone offered to buy the company at 5,000 yen per share, valuing Unizo at $1.6 billion.
Unizo said on Sunday it was positively engaged in talks with Blackstone. Blackstone on Friday extended the deadline for Unizo to respond to its offer..
Fortress is currently running a public tender offer to buy Unizo at 4,100 yen per share, valuing the company at $1.3 billion. Unizo said on Sunday it was asking Fortress to raise its bid price to 5,000 yen per share. Unizo said it wanted any bidder to make an offer at 5,000 yen per share or more.

997,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 24, 2019 07:31AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"Investing.com - It will be a short week in U.S. markets with Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday, but despite that it won’t be an uneventful one with traders continuing to monitor the latest trade developments, earnings reports and economic data, including durable goods orders and a second look at third quarter growth. Consumer confidence data on Tuesday and Black Friday will highlight consumer spending. Elsewhere, in the euro zone the focus will be on inflation. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Mixed messages on trade deal
The leaders of the U.S. and China on Friday both underscored their desire to sign an initial trade deal and defuse a 16-month tariff war that has roiled financial markets and acted as a drag on global economic growth.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing wants to work out an interim or 'phase one' trade pact but is not afraid to retaliate when necessary.
U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday a trade accord with China is ""potentially very close,"" before adding, ""The question is whether or not I want to make it.""
But negotiations could flounder if Trump signs into law a bill supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters or if U.S. warships keep sailing near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea.
U.S. economic data
Both manufacturing and consumption will be in the spotlight this week with investors monitoring regional manufacturing PMIs for any signs of a slowdown in the U.S. factory sector. Consumer confidence data on Tuesday, along with the start of the annual Black Friday retail extravaganza will give investors fresh insights into the resilience of consumer spending. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is to speak on Monday, but Wednesday’s data on durable goods orders for October will likely be the highlight of the calendar, while a second reading on third quarter GDP the same day is not expected to bring any significant revision.
Earnings results
There is a full slate of earnings reports coming out in the run up to the Thanksgiving holiday with global apparel company PVH (NYSE:PVH), which owns brands including Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, reporting ahead of the open on Monday. Cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is due to release its first fiscal 2020 earnings report after the closing bell the same day.
Retailers Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR),   Best Buy   (NYSE:BBY) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) are set to report ahead of the open on Tuesday, while Dell (NYSE:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ), which is being targeted by Xerox (NYSE:XRX) for an acquisition, will report after the close.
Agricultural machine maker Deere (NYSE:DE) is set to report on Wednesday. The Sino-U.S. trade war has pressured Deere amid persistent uncertainty over the outlook for the agriculture sector.
Black Friday
U.S. retailers launch annual Black Friday sales on Nov 29, ushering in the high-stakes holiday shopping season for store chains that are struggling to adapt to shrinking mall traffic.
The seismic shift in the consumer landscape has exposed a growing divide between retailers capable of adapting their bricks-and-mortar stores to the online world, and others struggling to keep customers coming through their doors.
Recent quarterly reports illustrate that divide. Shares in   Target   (NYSE:TGT) for instance surged to record highs after it raised full-year earnings forecasts, but department stores Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Kohls (NYSE:KSS) cut their outlooks ahead of the holiday season. Macy's shares extended their losses for 2019 to 50%.
But even with so many store chains struggling, U.S. retail stocks haven't done too badly. The S&P 500 Retailing index is up 21% for the year, not far behind the S&P 500's 24%.
Euro zone CPI
Friday’s preliminary data on euro zone inflation will be closely watched, not least by new European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde. Price growth in the bloc has undershot the ECB's target of close to but just below 2% since 2013 and is not expected to approach that level any time soon, let alone this month.
On the bright side, predictions are for annual inflation to have edged up in November for the bloc and in Germany. Lagarde has also pledged to review the ECB's inflation strategy, following in the footsteps of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Several ECB officials, including Chief Economist Philip Lane are also due to speak this week.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco met investors in Dubai on Sunday to market its initial public offering (IPO), after trying to secure demand from Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund for the deal, worth up to $25.6 billion, which relies heavily on local and regional buyers.
Top executives of the Saudi state-owned oil giant, including Aramco's Chief Executive Amin Nasser, met officials of Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund weeks ago, a source familiar with the matter said, confirming an earlier report on Sunday in the Kuwaiti newspaper Alrai.
Meanwhile, Aramco's management including its finance head and advisers met with institutional investors at an IPO roadshow in Dubai on Sunday, the second outside Riyadh after the company decided to cancel all roadshows in developed markets. 
The Kuwaiti newspaper said the Kuwait Investment Authority's (KIA) decision on whether to participate in the deal would depend on a ""study"" of the IPO.
Aramco said in an email it did not comment on specific investor meetings.
The KIA did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
In late October, the KIA's managing director Farouk Bastaki said Aramco had not approached the fund then, but that the KIA would look at the IPO like any other investment.
Talks have taken place with sovereign investors including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore's GIC and other funds, sources have told Reuters.
DUBAI ROADSHOW
Aramco has struggled to attract a major cornerstone or anchor investor for its IPO, which could be potentially the world's biggest.
An executive at a London-based fund, who attended the roadshow in Dubai, told Reuters he was interested in the IPO, but declined to provide more details.
Some investors asked Aramco about the sustainability of its dividend policy. Aramco has set a base dividend of $75 billion for five years.
A second executive at an investment firm said Aramco did not say whether that base level might grow.
The meeting was led by Aramco's senior vice president of finance, strategy and development, Khaled al-Dabbagh, and Yasser Mufti, the company's vice president of strategy and market analysis, sources said.
""The only thing left for comfort is the Saudi government, it’s fiscal policy and ability to sustain the dividends,"" said a fund manager. ""If you’re OK with that, you’ll invest.""
Over 20 people, wearing suits, walked into the presentation area at a luxury hotel in Dubai's financial district, but hotel security restricted entry for reporters.
Another roadshow is planned in Abu Dhabi on Monday.
""Looks like there's a lot of interest both from retail investors and institutions."" K. V. Vijay Raghavan, group finance director at Dubai-based investment firm Arenco told Reuters after attending the roadshow.
""I wish it was more like $1.4 trillion to $1.5 trillion, but this is what it is,"" he said, referring to the company's aim to achieve a valuation of $1.6-$1.7 trillion. 
However, he also said that looking at the investor interest, the IPO could hit the top end of the valuation range. 
Aramco plans to sell 1.5% of the company. The deal is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from its reliance on oil.

Saudi Arabia's central bank governor told Reuters on Sunday in Riyadh that it was monitoring banking indicators on a daily basis and was not seeing any impact on liquidity from the IPO.

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2019 05:49PM ET</span>","Elon Musk: About 150,000 orders thus far for Tesla Cybertruck","(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Saturday that there have been about 150,000 orders thus far for the electric carmaker's Cybertruck, which was unveiled late on Thursday.
""146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri & 17% single motor"", Musk said in a tweet, adding separately that the orders were achieved without any advertising or paid endorsements.
The launch of the Cybertruck pickup suffered a setback when its ""armored glass"" windows shattered in a much-anticipated unveiling. The overall look of the electric vehicle had worried Wall Street on Friday.
At the launch, Musk had taken aim at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when the windows of Tesla's new vehicle shattered while being tested.
The blunder overshadowed the launch, which was live-streamed from Los Angeles and made #cybertruck a trending word on Twitter.
Some Wall Street analysts praised the launch, but others doubted the futuristic design's mass appeal.
With a starting price of $39,900, the Cybertruck's angular body in gun-metal gray resembles an armored vehicle. Its website shows that an immediate payment of $100 is required to reserve an order for the Cybertruck.
Tesla plans to start manufacturing the truck around late 2021.
The U.S. pickup truck market is one of the world's most profitable vehicle segments and is dominated by  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU)."

The deal, in which Novartis has agreed to pay $85 a share, could be announced this weekend, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Going by a fully diluted share count, the agreement is worth about $10 billion, according to the report. 
Novartis declined to comment. The Medicines Co did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. 
The deal could broaden the Swiss drugmaker's cabinet of heart medicines and shore up growth threatened by patent expirations.
Novartis has been hunting for a $5 billion acquisition in the United States, two banking sources told Reuters earlier this week without identifying a target.
New Jersey-based The Medicines Co's top drug candidate is cholesterol-lowering drug inclisiran for heart patients. Novartis has historically had a strong cardiovascular drug franchise, but lost ground when Diovan, once a $6 billion-per-year seller, lost patent protection in 2012 and left the company without an immediate, innovative follow-up product.
Novartis has since been building up its portfolio, which now includes Entresto, a $1 billion seller for heart failure, as well as an experimental RNA-targeting molecule from Ionis Pharmaceuticals (O:IONS) that it licensed earlier this year for $150 million.

1002,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2019 05:38AM ET</span>",Take Five: A spanner in the global economic works,"(Reuters) -
1/TRADE WINDS BUFFET GROWTH
Can we have it both ways? For two decades, trade expansion has fueled rapid global economic growth. But with trade volumes contracting at a rate of more than 1% year-on-year and the Sino-U.S trade war nearing its two-year anniversary, world growth will plumb decade-lows next year, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development predicts.
As a Dec. 15 deadline for U.S. tariff hikes approaches, Beijing has reportedly invited top U.S. negotiators to talks. But it might call those off if President Donald Trump signs into law a bill supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters or if U.S. warships keep sailing near islands it claims in the South China Sea.
Growth has slowed to 30-year lows in China. U.S. new factory orders and shipments have slowed, while monthly job creation is running a quarter below last year's levels -- even after three interest rate cuts.
Ominously, the U.S. bond curve is flattening again. Ten-year U.S. government borrowing costs are 15 basis points away from tumbling below two-year yields, the so-called curve inversion witnessed a few months ago. A sustained inversion is a reliable predictor of recession, and more trade tensions could well take us there.
2/BLACK & BLEAK FRIDAY
U.S. retailers launch annual Black Friday sales on Nov 29, ushering in the high-stakes holiday shopping season for store chains that are struggling to adapt to shrinking mall traffic.
The seismic shift in the consumer landscape has exposed a growing divide between retailers capable of adapting their bricks-and-mortar stores to the online world, and others struggling to keep customers coming through their doors.
Recent quarterly reports illustrate that gulf. Shares in  Target  (NYSE:TGT) for instance surged to record highs after it raised full-year earnings forecasts, but department stores Macy's and Kohl's cut their outlooks ahead of the holiday season. Macy's shares extended their losses for 2019 to 50%. Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), GAP Inc and Kohl's shares are all down by more than 25% this year.
But even with so many store chains struggling, U.S. retail stocks haven't done too badly. The S&P 500 Retailing index is up 21% for the year, not far behind the S&P 500's 24%. And investors betting on Amazon's domination of the industry have been burned. An ETF called ProShares Decline of the Retail Store shorts a basket of brick-and-mortar store chains and has lost 3% this year.
3/INFLATION STATION
Flash readings of euro zone inflation due on Nov 29 will surely top new ECB chief Christine Lagarde's must-watch list. Price growth in the bloc has undershot the ECB's near-2% inflation target since 2013 and is not expected to approach that level any time soon, let alone this month.
On the bright side, predictions are for annual inflation to have edged up in November for the bloc and in Germany. Lagarde has also pledged to review the ECB's inflation strategy, following in the footsteps of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The problem is that many of the factors depressing prices are outside the ECB's control - demographics for instance, or the reliance on exports, in particular by German manufacturers, which leaves it exposed to the effects of a global trade war. Indeed, inflation expectations in the bloc closely track sentiment towards the U.S./China trade spat this year.
4/SEOUL SEARCHING
South Korea, a bellwether of risk in Asia, is digging into its coffers to get out of an economic rut. With Korean exporters hit hard by the Sino-U.S. trade war and declining global demand for their chips and ships, the government may be about to clear another massive spending increase for 2020.
South Korean blue chips such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) have done well but the broader equity index has trailed peers over the past 2-1/2 years. Economic growth is at its weakest in a decade and Korean workers have increasingly taken to the streets to protest job losses.
What Korea's vaunted tech industry needed was at least some sign of truce in the 16-month old trade spat. Without that business sentiment indicators, due in coming days, are unlikely to show improvement. The Bank of Korea has already cut interest rates twice this year but is unlikely to do so again at its Nov. 29 meeting as it waits to see what steps the government plans.
5/A REAL CRISIS?
Brazil's real has slumped towards record lows against the dollar, the latest South American currency to take a beating in recent weeks. It's down almost 8% this month and only the Chilean peso has performed worse.
But unlike its regional peers Argentina and Chile, Brazil hasn't undergone a radical government change recently or suffered a spate of social unrest. What's weighing on markets is this month's 'mega' oil auction, which failed to attract foreign demand - and the billions of dollars - many had banked on.
The currency selloff has so far been orderly, volatility remains low, and liquidity has not dried up. Nor is central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto sounding any alarms bells, saying currency market intervention was an option only if there was a lack of liquidity.
He may not need to worry either about inflation - at 2.54%, it's running well below this year's 4.25% target. Thursday will bring a fresh batch of inflation data which may show if the real tumble may impact inflation and Campos Neto's strategy."

The project based in the city of Zhanjiang will be China's first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex, for which a framework agreement was signed in January.
It will primarily produce engineering plastics and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and some petrochemical products widely used in automotive, electronics and new energy vehicles industries.
The project's first phase is expected to be launched in 2022, with production capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year (tpy), taking BASF's total capacity of engineering plastics and TPU to 290,000 tpy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The entire project is planned to be completed by 2030, the company said, making it the third-largest BASF site worldwide, following Ludwigshafen in Germany and Antwerp in Belgium.
BASF plans to employ a comprehensive smart manufacturing concept at the project, deploying automated packaging, high-tech control systems and automated guided vehicles, it added.
""(The project) will form a solid foundation for a world-class industrial cluster in Zhanjiang and establish stronger business connections between South China and other Asian countries,"" Stephan Kothrade, a BASF regional official in China, said in the statement.
The project is ""a signal showing China's efforts of further opening-up are taking effect,"" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said, according to a central government website.

In its manifesto launched on Thursday, Labour unveiled a plan to spend almost 83 billion pounds on a program of widespread nationalization and free public services with the revenue coming from taxes on high earners and corporations.
Labour said its ""Fair Tax Programme"" would ensure the City of London financial district, big businesses and those who dodged tax paid their share.
""Huge multinational companies often act as if the rules we all live by don't apply to them. They use loopholes to claim they don't owe tax and cynically push their workers to the limit,"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will say outside the Amazon (O:AMZN) depot in Yorkshire, northern England.
""The next Labour government will challenge head-on the tax and wage cheat culture of so many multinational companies, who use their power and our weak laws to rip off both the taxpayer and their workers,"" Corbyn will say, according to extracts released by his office.
Amazon said Corbyn's claims were false.
""The government wrote the tax laws and they are designed to encourage investment, and we are investing heavily in creating jobs and infrastructure across the UK - more than 18 billion pounds ($23 billion) since 2010,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. 
Labour is lagging Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party by about 10 points or more in the polls but it hopes that targeting ""vested interests"" will win over voters ahead of the Dec. 12 election.
The party has earmarked tech firms such as Amazon, Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL), and Facebook (O:FB) for additional taxes, saying it would bring in measures to stop multinationals avoiding tax through profit-shifting schemes. It said this would bring in 6.3 billion pounds in 2023-4. 
Other planned measures include establishing an inquiry into the finance sector, introducing a 20% Offshore Company Property Levy, and scrapping non-domiciled status which allows some people resident in Britain to limit the tax they pay.

Last month's ruling gave telecom operators three months in which to pay overdue levies and interest, putting at risk the operations of both Vodafone Idea and Bharti.
Bharti and Vodafone Idea have filed separate review petitions in the Supreme Court, the Economic Times newspaper said. The court has yet to decide on admitting the petitions.
The two firms did not immediately reply to emails from Reuters to seek comment.
In their filings, the companies seek review of the penalties and interest on the dues, and query why some revenue components should be included in calculations of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), on which the dispute centres, the paper said.
Telecom providers in India pay the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) 3% to 5% of their AGR in spectrum usage charges and 8% as license fees.
Companies have long argued that AGR should comprise just revenue accrued from core services, while the government says it should include all revenue, a position the Supreme Court upheld last month.
Officials of the DoT did not immediately respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment.
Telecom operators got some respite from the court ruling after India on Wednesday gave them until the end of March 2022 to pay for airwaves bought via auction."

The complaint and supplemental motion for discovery were filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims under seal, according to a spokesman for Amazon Web Services, a division of the online retail giant founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos.
The company did not explain the basis for its complaint.
The filings contain ""proprietary information, trade secrets, and confidential financial information"" that could ""cause either party severe competitive harm,"" Amazon said in a court document seeking a protective order.
""The record in this bid protest likely will contain similarly sensitive information,"" it said.
Last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper rejected any suggestion of bias in the Pentagon's decision to award Microsoft the contract after Amazon announced plans to challenge it.
""We believe the facts will show they (DoD) ran a detailed, thorough and fair process in determining the needs of the warfighter were best met by Microsoft,"" Microsoft said in an emailed statement.
Amazon had been considered a favorite for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract, part of a broader digital modernization project at the Pentagon, before software developer Microsoft emerged as the surprise winner.

Amazon has previously said that politics got in the way of a fair bidding process. Bezos, the chief executive officer of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post, has been an outspoken critic of U.S. President Donald Trump.

KUALA LUMPUR/LONDON (Reuters) - With Saudi Aramco yet to name any major foreign investors in its upcoming share sale, Malaysia's state energy company Petronas (PETR.UL) decided to take a pass on Friday.
Expectations that Aramco customers and allies around the world would take significant stakes in the company have so far not materialized, with the listing looking like it will be reliant on local retail and institutional investors.
Aramco, which kicked off the share sale process on Nov. 3 after a series of false starts, declined to comment to Reuters on the lack of any named anchor investors in its listing so far.
Last week Russia's second largest oil producer Lukoil (MM:LKOH) said it would not be investing in the initial public offering (IPO) which is likely to rank Aramco as the world's most valuable company.
Aramco has a joint venture with Petronas in southern Malaysia that is set to start commercial operations this year and Petronas said it had been asked to invest in the IPO.
""Petronas would like to confirm that after due consideration, the company has decided not to participate in Saudi Aramco's initial public offering exercise,"" Petronas said in an emailed statement.
Aramco is a major oil supplier to China, Japan and South Korea and their plans for the IPO are not yet clear, however, the head of Japan's largest refiner this month said that Japanese companies were unlikely to invest because it was difficult to ascertain Aramco's true value.
Aramco plans to sell 1.5% of the company, looking to raise up to $25.6 billion and giving the company a potential market value of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion.
It is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from its reliance on oil.
But the company has canceled marketing roadshows for its listing outside of the Gulf because of the lack of interest from foreign institutional investors.
That has raised questions about to what extent the listing can really diversify the country's economic interests.
""Just selling a 1.5% stake in an oil company is not really going to achieve an enormous amount,"" said Charles Hollis, a former UK-Saudi diplomat and director at intelligence consultancy Falanx Assynt.
Saudi Aramco said in a statement to Reuters that its listing was ""an important step in accelerating the Kingdom's economic growth and diversification"".
""It will increase liquidity in the Saudi capital market and elevate its position as an important international stock exchange"", it said.
Saudi Arabia's Samba Financial Group said on Thursday that the IPO has attracted about 73 billion riyals ($19.47 billion) in institutional and retail orders so far.
Although no major state company or fund has yet stepped forward, talks have been taking place with sovereign investors including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore's GIC and other funds, sources have told Reuters."

MONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An email sent by a Transport Canada official urging Boeing (N:BA) to remove an anti-stall system involved in two 737 MAX crashes reflects ""working-level discussions"" and were not reviewed by the Canadian regulator, the agency said on Friday. 
The New York Times reported that an engineering manager in aircraft integration and safety assessment at Transport Canada emailed international regulators on Tuesday saying: ""The only way I see moving forward at this point"" is that Boeing's MCAS system ""has to go."" 
The email was sent to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Brazil’s National Civil Aviation Agency, the New York Times said.
A person briefed on the matter confirmed the content of the email, but Reuters had not viewed a copy.
The anti-stall MCAS system was linked to MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people. The MAX has been grounded since March.
The MCAS system was designed to counteract the effect on handling of the new, larger engines on the 737 MAX, which had to be placed farther forward and higher on the wings because the 50-year-old 737 design sits relatively low to the ground. 
Boeing is working to win regulatory approvals for proposed fixes to MCAS and associated pilot training so the 737 MAX can fly again. 
“The email reflects working-level discussions between highly trained aircraft certification experts of key aviation authorities who have been given wide latitude for assessing all issues and looking at all alternatives for the safe return to service of the aircraft,"" Transport Canada said in a statement. 
""The views are at the working level and have not been subject to systematic review by Transport Canada.""
A senior industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity said removing MCAS from the 737 MAX would present only a “minor” risk, but doing so would not be tolerated under the strict rules regulating the aviation industry. 
Without MCAS, the plane was unlikely to comply with the regulations due to the handling characteristics the system was designed to address, a regulatory official said.
The FAA said in a statement that its international partners have ""engaged in robust discussions at various stages in this process as part of the thorough scrutiny of Boeing’s work. This email is an example of those exchanges.""

In a statement, Boeing said on Friday it ""continues to work with the FAA and global regulators.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday expressed concerns that enacting his administration's proposed ban on many flavored e-cigarette and vaping products would lead to people obtaining them illegally.
Trump also raised worries during a raucous meeting with public health and industry representatives that illegal e-cigarette and vaping products could be substandard.
""If you don't give it to them, it's going to come here illegally,"" Trump said.
Seated next to U.S. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who wants children protected from flavored vaping products, Trump listened to the back-and-forth for nearly an hour, peppering each side with questions to try to determine the best way forward.
The Trump administration said in September it would unveil a sweeping ban on most e-cigarette and vaping flavors seen as attracting young users to addictive nicotine products. But concerns about the potential loss of jobs has prompted him to revisit the issue.
The Trump administration's announcement that it would take action comes amid public alarm over a mysterious U.S. vaping-related respiratory illness that has sickened more than 2,000 people and killed 47.
On Friday, Trump, who is gearing up for a 2020 re-election race and trumpets the strength of the U.S. economy daily, was warned by an e-cigarette executive that a ban on the products could lead to a loss of at least 100,000 jobs.
Harold Wimmer, the head of the American Lung Association, pushed for a ban on all e-cigarette and vaping flavors.
""That's a big statement,"" Trump said.
Wimmer told Trump that his stance was comparable to what Trump had announced in September.
Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, accused the sector's critics of being funded by a billionaire politician and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.
""That's obnoxious,"" someone replied.
In September, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bloomberg's charity, announced it was launching a $160 million program aimed at ending youth e-cigarette use.
""This is one of the most important causes of his life and he will never back down in the face of their criticisms,” Jean Weinberg, a spokeswoman for Bloomberg Philanthropies, said in an emailed statement.
More than 27.5% of American high school students use e-cigarettes, up from 20.7% in 2018, according to a U.S. government study. Evidence has shown that youth exposure to nicotine affects brain development and makes them more susceptible to nicotine addiction in the future.
""It's the flavors that are drawing the kids in. It's a health emergency ... We have to put the kids first,"" said Romney, adding that half of high school students in his state use vaping products.
Romney, in a tweet later on Friday, said he would continue his own push for legislation to ban flavors, make vaping cartridges tamper-proof and bar e-cigarettes from schools. 
Trump reiterated on Friday that his administration was considering raising the age to buy such products to 21. But he indicated that no final decision had been made.

""We'll let you know ... We want to take care of our kids,"" he said.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 05:09PM ET</span>","U.S. banks cram for Fed risk test, with ripple effects in repo","By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New quarterly data from the biggest U.S. banks suggest that some will need to back away from short-term lending markets by year-end to avoid triggering requirements that they hold more capital.
The data, posted on Friday by the Federal Reserve, showed four of the six biggest U.S. lenders were above or close to thresholds that would increase their capital surcharges.
An easy way to get the scores down would be doing less lending through overnight repurchase agreements and foreign exchange swaps, said analysts who track the filings.
Those markets have experienced stress in recent months. Retreats by lenders would make them more vulnerable.
""If the economic narrative shifts in December, it could have a greater impact than if it were to shift at any other point in the year,"" said Josh Younger, a derivatives strategist at JPMorgan who is not involved in the bank’s lending.
Calculations from September data in the JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) filing, for example, indicate that its score as a Global Systemically Important Bank, or GSIB, was 751, or 21 points above the level at which its capital surcharge would be increased to 4% from 3.5%.
If JPMorgan doesn't get below 730 it will have to hold another $8 billion of capital, analysts estimated. That would dampen return on equity. The bank has said it will be under the threshold.
The Fed, similar to bank regulators abroad, began imposing GSIB surcharges in 2016. The aim was to make big banks bear the costs to others of their failure and force them to choose whether to shrink or hold more capital.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) needs to take at least 16 points from its score to avoid a higher surcharge and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) needs to shave eight points.  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) is two points under a markup, but could seek a wider margin because higher fourth-quarter stock prices are poised to add to all scores.
Backing away from certain short-term lending instruments, particularly swaps and other derivatives, is one of the easiest temporary ways to reduce scores, which are compiled from dozens of measurements and calculations.
Borrowers in the $3.2 trillion-a-day FX swap market are nervously looking toward year-end and having to decide between paying up or exiting positions.

The Federal Reserve has been stabilizing the repo market since mid-September when rates spiked to as much as 10% from about 2%.

1015,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 05:09PM ET</span>",Stocks - Market Rises Modestly on Trade Hopes (Again),"Investing.com - There was, for public consumption, talk about how U.S.-China trade talks were progressing, and that was good enough for the stock market to move higher Friday and break a multi-day losing streak.
The S&P 500 was up 0.2%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite rising 0.16%. The Nasdaq 100, dominated by big tech, added 0.08%. The S&P 500 and Dow broke three-day losing streaks. The Nasdaq indexes moved up after two days of declines.
 
The trade talk was just that, with Chinese President Xi Jinping saying the two sides were talking but vowing to walk away if he believes China's sovereignty is threatened. President Donald Trump said talks were progressing, but he believes the United States should come out ahead.
What does seem more likely is a deal isn't near and that more tariffs will be imposed on Chinese imports starting Dec. 15, although the stock market is clearly hoping for and betting on a phase one deal.
For the week, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq saw declines. The S&P 500's was its first weekly loss after six weeks of gains. The Dow's pullback was its first after rising for four weeks. The Nasdaq's loss came after rising for seven-straight weeks.
In that time, the stock market hit record highs, but, in the last week, it has given off signs it might be overbought. Relative strength indexes for the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq surged above 70 on Nov. 15, a warning of frothiness. Above 80 makes a big pullback extremely likely.
As it is, the averages are less than 1% below their record highs, which suggests there's not a lot of worry in the market yet. 
The market was led by gains in the S&P 500's financial, consumer discretionary, health and industrial sectors.
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and Macy’s (NYSE:M) both had strong days after Nordstrom earnings weren't as bad as feared. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was among the top Dow performers, up more than 1.3% as the company unveiled its 737 Max 10 jet, which can seat 230. The plane remains grounded, but many investors believe it will be flying again early next year. The stock contributed 33 points to the Dow's 109-point gain.
The Dow's percentage leader was   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE), followed by 3M (NYSE:MMM), Boeing,   Nike   (NYSE:NKE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS).
Banks were especially strong with US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) hitting a 52-week high. Airlines were gainers as oil prices fell back.
Lagging sectors included staples, technology and real estate stocks. Tech loses included Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 6.1%, worst among Nasdaq-100 stocks, after the company unveiled its new electric-powered pickup truck, with a less-than-stellar introduction. The vehicle is expected to be available starting in late 2021.
Oil prices moved lower as worries built about global oversupplies. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 81 cents to $57.77 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell 58 cents to $63.39. Interest rates and gold were basically flat with the 10-year Treasury yield at 1.772%.
Apparel retailers Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Macy’s (NYSE:M), L Brands (NYSE:LB) and Gap (NYSE:GPS) were among the top S&P 500 performers. 
Tax-software company   Intuit   (NASDAQ:INTU), oil-company Hess (NYSE:HES), footwear retailer   Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) and liquor-and-wine merchant Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) were among the S&P weakest performers in the index. "
1016,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 04:10PM ET</span>",Louis Vuitton Slashes Huge Staff Discounts After French Tax Scrutiny,"(Bloomberg) -- Louis Vuitton is curtailing hefty discounts for staff members and their families after a French tax authority decided that bargain prices on high fashion should be considered a taxable benefit, according to people familiar with the matter.
The LVMH brand agreed to put an end to staff discounts as high as 90% for unsold products, said the people, asking not to be identified because they were discussing an internal matter. The company is now capping the reductions at around 75%, which will more than double prices for French employees.
Limiting the cherished perk could also complicate Louis Vuitton’s policy of never selling at a discount in stores, because the internal sales have helped the brand clear away extra stock when items like 2,500 euro ($2,765) silk vests fail to find buyers. The maker of monogrammed handbags and trunks has boosted its range of seasonal products like ready-to-wear fashion and shoes in recent years, increasing the risk of excess stock.
LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault has long prided himself on never discounting his biggest brand’s items for consumers.
A Louis Vuitton spokeswoman declined to comment. The French tax authority did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
The limit on Vuitton’s staff discounts comes as fashion brands face public outcry and new regulations over another longstanding method for managing unsold products: destroying them. Image-conscious manufacturers have been known to burn products or bury them in landfills to avoid their wares being spotted in bargain bins. France’s Senate voted in September to ban that practice.
The French tax authority’s move could eventually be a boon to Vuitton staffers outside France, as the brand could be forced to send unsold products elsewhere if too many pile up in France, one of the people said."
1017,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 04:08PM ET</span>",Quarterly Handoff in Treasury Shorts Is Riskier Than Normal,"(Bloomberg) -- A decision that U.S. Treasury traders face every quarter around this time is more momentous than usual, in part because of speculation thatfunding-market strains will re-emerge in December.
Traders must decide when to move -- or roll, in market parlance -- short positions into the newest security, shifting out of the second-newest one. In the 10-year maturity, for example, traders are now assessing when to roll short positions in the August 2029 note, which debuted in August, into the one issued this month that’s due in November 2029.
Because of the auction cycle -- in which a new 10-year is sold every quarter and expanded via reopenings in each of the next two months -- there’s initially more of the old issue than of the new one. There’s about $93 billion of the August 2029 10-year note outstanding, versus only around $40 billion of the November 2029 securities. The relative scarcity of the newer ones could make it costly to borrow to cover shorts, but their superior liquidity makes them cheaper to trade.
Other factors can affect the decision of when to roll over shorts, however, and two big ones are inducing some traders to hold off.
The first is indications of a large quantity of shorts in the old 10-year, which raises the specter of the current one becoming unusually expensive to borrow once shorts have been rolled. The second is the prospect that shorts in the old 10-year could benefit from a potential surge in overall repo rates in December, similar to the one seen in September.
Market Mystery
The quantity of shorts in a particular issue is normally a mystery, but there are clues. The main one is its repo rate, the cost of borrowing that specific issue, relative to the general collateral rate. An issue whose repo rate is lower -- meaning the borrower receives a lower rate on a loan of cash collateralized by the security -- than the general collateral rate is said to trade special.
As an issue grows in size via reopening auctions, it becomes less likely to trade special. The old 10-year traded special for nearly the entire time it was the newest issue, said Scott Skyrm, who works in sales and trading at Curvature Securities LLC, a securities lending broker-dealer.
“For a triple issue to trade even a little bit special is a big deal,” he said. It’s an indication of a large short base in the old 10-year, which could overwhelm the new issue if it were all to be rolled in a short period of time.
So far that hasn’t happened for overnight transactions. The financing rate for that period for the new 10-year averaged 1.59% Friday morning, just a few basis points lower than the general collateral rate, Skyrm said. For the old 10-year it averaged 1.52%.
But in an indication that traders expect the overnight rate to slump, the rate for financing the new 10-year over a term ending Dec. 16, when its first reopening will have settled, fell below 1% this week.
Why an issue trades special is likewise often a mystery, Skyrm said. It can be because the supply becomes restricted if a large holder doesn’t lend it out. In the case of the old 10-year, financial-market volatility from August through October probably played a role, he said.
But also, despite the Federal Reserve’s efforts to ensure that the banking system has enough reserves on hand, the prospect of another surge in the repo rate for general collateral in December is emboldening traders to keep their shorts in the old 10-year. When repo rates soar, holders of securities are punished by higher financing rates, but traders who borrow them for shorts benefit.
While the general collateral rate stabilized after the mid-September surge, and has stayed within a few basis points of 1.60% since the Fed’s Oct. 30 rate cut, the forward rate for the turn of the calendar year exceeded 3.5% this week. That’s causing traders to suspect that volatility is ahead.
“If you’re long securities and trying to finance them and rates go higher, it’s going to cost you,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). “If you’re short it’s the opposite dynamic.”"
1018,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 03:26PM ET</span>",Shattered glass: Futuristic design questioned after Tesla Cybertruck launch,"By Nick Carey and Naomi Tajitsu
DETROIT/TOKYO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) launch of its futuristic Cybertruck pickup suffered a setback when its ""armored glass"" windows shattered, but it was the overall look of the electric vehicle that worried Wall Street on Friday, driving the automaker's shares down 6%.
In the much-anticipated unveiling to cheering fans late on Thursday, Tesla boss Elon Musk had taken aim at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when his boast about his new vehicle's windows backfired.
""Oh my fucking God, well, maybe that was a little too hard,"" Musk said, after his head of design, Franz von Holzhausen, cracked the driver's side window with a metal ball in a series of tests for the crowd at the event in Los Angeles. 
He allowed von Holzhausen another throw to the rear passenger window, only to see that crack as well.
""It didn't go through, so that's a plus side,"" Musk said, adding: ""Room for improvement.""
Musk singled out the Ford (N:F) F-150, the top-selling vehicle in the United States, to highlight the capabilities of the Cybertruck, showing an edited video of the two trucks in a back-to-back ""tug-of-war"" in which the Tesla truck wins. 
Some Wall Street analysts praised the launch on Friday, but others doubted the futuristic design's mass appeal. Tesla shares were down 6% at $333.41. 
Shares of Ford and General Motors rose about 2%. General Motors' first electric pickup will go on sale in 2021, around the same time as Tesla's, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors on Thursday.
""Musk has been enthusiastic about his Blade Runner-inspired design for months, but we were still surprised how futuristic he went with this one and believe it may shatter his dreams,"" Cowen analysts wrote in a note.
""While we are pleased to see Tesla enter the most profitable segment of the North American passenger car market, we do not see this vehicle in its current form being a success.""
The U.S. pickup truck market is one of the world's most profitable vehicle segments and is dominated by Ford, General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU).
Pickup buyers are fiercely brand loyal and are viewed as traditional in their choice of vehicle.
JP Miller, CEO of Paul Miller Ford in Lexington, Kentucky, sells an average of 100 new Fords a month, around 40% of which are pickup trucks. Many of them are work trucks, and Miller said when watching Tesla's unveiling on Thursday night he could not see any of his customers wanting a Cybertruck.
""I have to say, I was a little confused,"" Miller said. ""Pickup trucks are critical for building America and I couldn't see how that could apply to Tesla's truck.""
Friday's selloff dented a 40% rally in Tesla's shares that was sparked after Musk reported an unexpected quarterly profit on Oct. 23. That stock surge scalded traders betting Tesla will fail to survive an eventual wave of electric vehicles made by more established automakers. 
But even after traders recently cut their short bets against Tesla to 22% of its float from over 30% in August, its stock remains one of the most shorted on Wall Street, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. That level of short interest underscores widespread skepticism about Tesla's path to long-term profitability.
'UGLY'
Online critics also made fun of the pickup's space-craft style look.
""I wish Elon Musk hadn't blocked me on Twitter after I said his Mars colonization idea was dumb, so I could tell him how ugly his new #Cybertruck is,"" tweeted author @MarkDice, who has 1.5 million YouTube followers.
With a starting price of $39,900, the Cybertruck takes aim at the heart of Detroit automakers' profits, while drawing familiar support from Tesla watchers online.
""Yes, it looks like a retro version of the future. It's supposed to,"" said @AElchamaa.
To show off the robust design of the new pickup, Musk asked von Holzhausen to take a sledgehammer to the side of the vehicle, whose exterior will be made from the same stainless steel used in the Starship rocket developed by Musk's SpaceX aerospace company. 
The crowd cheered when the hammer bounced off the surface without leaving a mark.
But Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, said Musk was trying to sell too much - a new technology and an outlandish design.

""There are fans out there who'll buy anything with a Tesla badge on it, but this will unlikely pierce the meat of the truck market,"" Brauer said. ""Tesla is putting up too many barriers for people nervous about stepping out of their comfort zone.""

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 03:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: UniCredit clinches deal to cut exposure to Turkish lender Yapi Kredi - sources,"By Ebru Tuncay, Pamela Barbaglia and Valentina Za
ISTANBUL/LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit (MI:CRDI) has struck a deal to reduce its exposure to Turkey's Yapi Kredi (IS:YKBNK), three sources told Reuters, a move seen as a first step toward the Italian bank's full exit from the recession-hit country.
As part of the plan, UniCredit will sell its 50% stake in its joint venture Koc Financial Services - which controls Yapi Kredi - to its partner  Koc Holding  (IS:KCHOL), two of the sources said. They were speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.
UniCredit kicked off talks with Koc Holding earlier this year aiming to dismantle the joint venture and lay the groundwork to fully cash out of Yapi Kredi, the sources said.
The deal is the latest move in a string of disposals that UniCredit's boss Jean-Pierre Mustier has embarked upon since taking the helm of Italy's biggest bank by assets in 2016.
Koc Financial Services is a joint venture vehicle that owns almost 82% of Yapi Kredi and is equally invested by UniCredit and Koc Holding.
The deal will give Koc Holding a majority stake in Yapi, Turkey's third-biggest bank which has a market value of $3.7 billion, they said.
UniCredit is expected to retain a small interest in the bank with a view to selling it at a later stage without having to consult Koc, one of the sources said.
As of December the Italian lender - which has a market value of 27.7 billion euros - will no longer be invested in the joint venture, another source said.
UniCredit and Koc Holding declined to comment while Yapi Kredi was not available for comment.
UniCredit could unveil details of the transaction at a strategy presentation in London on Dec. 3, according to one of the sources.
The Milan-based bank has been invested in Yapi Kredi since 2002 when it entered the joint venture with Koc Holding in what became the first foreign partnership in Turkey's financial services industry.
But Turkey's economy slipped into a recession last year and the lira lost 30% of its value against the dollar, forcing UniCredit to write down its stake in Yapi by 846 million euros ($933 million) in the third quarter of 2018.
Asked about a possible exit from Turkey at a quarterly earnings presentation on Nov. 7, UniCredit boss Mustier said the bank would constantly review its capital allocation across ""clients, sectors and countries"".
The Frenchman, who has been working to bolster the bank's balance sheet, is pressing ahead with plans to dispose of non-core assets and reduce UniCredit's exposure to weak economies such as Turkey and Italy, sources have said.
The deal with Koc Holding comes just a fortnight after UniCredit's placement of its long-held stake in investment bank  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI), which raised 785 million euros.
Mustier put UniCredit's Polish unit Pekao (WA:PEO) on the block soon after his appointment and went on selling online broker FinecoBank (MI:FBK) and asset manager Pioneer."
1020,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 03:08PM ET</span>",Boeing's top communications official to retire as 737 MAX crisis drags on,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) head of corporate communications, Anne Toulouse, elected to step down from her role and would retire next year, the world's largest planemaker said on Friday.
Toulouse, a 30-year Boeing veteran, is the second high-ranking female communications leader to leave the embattled U.S. planemaker as it fights to rebuild trust with airline customers and the flying public after two recent crashes of its 737 MAX killed 346 people in the span of five months.
Boeing said it would name her successor in the near future.
""This past year has been all-consuming and profoundly difficult for all of us at Boeing - albeit nowhere close to the experience of the families affected by the MAX accidents,"" Toulouse said in a prepared statement accompanying a news release. 
""As we look ahead, I am confident the hard lessons learned will make Boeing better and that we will deliver on our important commitments,"" she said. ""As we move into that next phase, I can best serve the company by turning over the role to someone with fresh perspective and, therefore, made the difficult decision to retire.""  
It was not clear whether Toulouse's departure was the result of repeated criticism Boeing has faced over its public responses to the crashes. Some airline customers, corporate crisis experts, and victims' family members criticized the company's public comments as stilted and contradictory and appeared driven by company lawyers. 
Separately on Friday, Boeing revealed the longest version of its single-aisle 737 MAX family, the 737 MAX 10, at its Seattle-area factory. The jet rolled out of a paint hangar in Renton, Washington, as thousands of employees gathered to mark the milestone, Boeing said. 
The airplane, which can seat up to 230 passengers, will undergo system checks and engine runs prior to a first flight next year, Boeing said. 
Toulouse, 61, became interim senior vice president of Communications in September 2018. She took over the permanent communications role in February 2019. After joining the company in 1989, Toulouse was responsible for Boeing's brand strategy, global advertising, sponsorships, in-house creative team, and historical archives and corporate identity. 

Boeing said last week that Linda Mills, the chief communications official for Boeing's commercial airplanes division, was leaving the company.

(Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Friday with help from positive comments from Washington and Beijing about progress on efforts to reach a U.S.-China trade deal ,and from upbeat domestic economic data. 
U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox News a trade deal was ""potentially very close"" following remarks by President Xi Jinping that Beijing wanted to work out an initial agreement.
The S&P 500 and the Dow were on track for their biggest daily gains in a lackluster week marked by uncertainty about trade. In previous days, one report suggested the delay of a trade truce to 2020, while U.S. lawmakers backed two bills backing protesters in Hong Kong.

But investors were also showing skepticism as the Hong Kong situation added complexity, he said. 
Meanwhile, the latest economic data underscored a resilient domestic economy as U.S. manufacturing output accelerated in November to its fastest pace in seven months and services activity picked up more than expected.
But the benchmark S&P 500 index was on course to snap its six-week winning streak, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set for its first weekly drop in eight weeks. A largely better-than-expected third-quarter corporate earnings season has also contributed to the recent rally.

Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were trading higher, led by a 0.68% gain in financials (SPSY).
 Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) jumped 10.2% after the retailer raised its 2019 forecast and reported third-quarter profit above expectations. Gap Inc (N:GPS) shares were up 4.5% after it beat lowered quarterly profit estimates days after the retailer cut its annual forecast and replaced its longtime chief executive officer.

 Intuit  Inc (O:INTU) dropped 5.7% after the income-tax filing software maker forecast second-quarter profit below estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 49 new highs and 73 new lows.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 02:46PM ET</span>",Jet industry's grand masters fight to a draw in Dubai,"By Tim Hepher and Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - After insisting for 15 years that the superjumbo is the future, Emirates airline has been forced by the demise of the A380 to embrace smaller wide-body jets, resulting in a flurry of maneuvers between planemakers at this week's Dubai Airshow.
The 555-seat A380 is near the end of production, setting off a series of interlocking deals as top buyer Emirates reviews its fleet against the backdrop of fragmenting travel demand. Delays in the 406-seat Boeing 777X also weighed in the shake-up.
""We have to face the reality of the cancellation of the (A380) program and the effect it has on our network, which is why we conducted a root and branch (review),"" Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters at the airshow.
The double-decker A380 superjumbo and the big twin-engined Boeing 777, plus mid-sized 787s and A350s, were all spread out in front of VIP chalets - the queens, bishops and knights in a game of industry chess being played out across the globe.
Big jets tend to be profitable especially when full.
Periodically, the industry designs smaller planes that match both the range and efficiency of larger ones, allowing smaller pieces on the industry chess board to topple larger ones.
While reducing its remaining orders for A380s, Emirates placed an expanded order at the show for 50 Airbus A350s but shelved earlier plans to order the 330-seat A330neo, an upgrade of an earlier model.
It substituted part of an order for delayed 777X jets for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners - 10 fewer than originally planned in a tentative 2017 order - as part of a $25 billion order shake-up.
For passengers, the roughly 300-seat, lightweight mid-sized jets offer more choice and frequencies.
Many airlines say they can fly almost as profitably as the larger models but with less risk to the bottom line.
The downside? Planes fill more quickly and passengers can flee to other carriers. Airport congestion is also a concern.
Emirates insists the superhub model it pioneered - which takes advantage of Dubai's location to capture global traffic using large aircraft - remains intact despite the new twist.
But the smaller planes allow some of its rivals to fly profitably with fewer commercial risks and this week's deals imply Emirates no longer feels immune from such pressure.
""Given the changed environment, Emirates has been forced to adapt the tactics of some of the carriers they have been competing with,"" said analyst Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group.
STALEMATE
The shift sparked frantic talks by planemakers to ensure their models were included in the new mix of Emirates' mid-sized jets. Each suffered losses but the result was broadly a stalemate, analysts said.
Airbus suffered a setback with the loss of the A330neo at Emirates and may have to cut output, they said.
But it ensured its own A350 picked up the slack and won a ticket to any future contests to replace A380s still in service.
Boeing (N:BA) cemented a key win for the 787 after two years of uncertainty over the earlier provisional deal. But recent 777X delays opened the door to Emirates readjusting the blend in favor of the Airbus A350, at the expense of the 787.
Emirates' decision to expand its A350 order coincided with cancellations for the same jet at Abu Dhabi's struggling Etihad, prompting speculation of a politically balanced adjustment.
Airline officials strongly denied any link and Clark said planners had identified more room for future growth in revenues with the A350 than the A330neo, which would nonetheless remain ""in the mix"" for the future alongside more 777X purchases.
Analysts said the net result of reducing A380 and 777X orders and switching to smaller models was about 18,000 fewer seats on order than previously planned before the show,
which some analysts described as a response to overcapacity.
""Manufacturers have sold too many airplanes,"" Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president at consultancy AVITAS, said.
While the spotlight fell on the Emirates wide-body order rejig, the Dubai show highlighted Boeing's efforts to shore up confidence in its grounded 737 MAX with fresh sales and changes sweeping the narrow-body markets. Beefed-up single-aisle jets increasingly cover distances reserved for wide-bodies.
Sharjah's Air Arabia (DU:AIRA) ordered 120 Airbus including 20 of the long-range 200-240-seat A321XLR. Sources say it may leapfrog northern Africa to fly non-stop as far as Casablanca, a mission currently served from neighboring Dubai by an Emirates A380.
""The single aisles are the pawns of the industry but very effective ones,"" Rob Morris, head consultant at UK-based Ascend by Cirium, said."
1023,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 02:06PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Wall Street Throws Shade on Tesla's Cybertruck; Shares Sink,"Investing.com - Tesla’s electric pickup truck, the “Cybertruck,” seemed to have everything, with CEO Elon Musk claiming it is bulletproof car, can go from zero to 60 mph in about 2.9 seconds and tow up to 14,000 pounds. But those claims have come into question after its armored glass windows were surprisingly shattered in a demo, sending shares of the electric vehicle company sharply lower.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 6%.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled three versions of the Cybertruck: a low-end single-motor with a range of about 250 miles per charge, starting from $39,900, a dual-motor cost priced at about $49,900, with about 300 miles of range and a trimotor costing $69,900 with 500 miles of range.
Production of the lower-priced Cybertrucks should begin in late 2021 with the trimotor to follow in 2022, the company said.
But the skepticism from some on Wall Street is already flowing in.
“From a demand perspective this will be a more niche market, as we believe hitting the 150,000 to 175,000 unit threshold in its first full year of deliveries (likely 2022) is the line in the sand out of the gates and could be a tough bogey to hit,” Wedbush said in a note.
The Cybertruck has racked up the fanfare from analysts and auto enthusiasts alike, but Tesla’s efforts to keep up the recent uptick in Model 3 production remains the story for the stock.
“While this product announcement is long-awaited and exciting, the main focus for the stock over the coming months is around the recent strong 3Q results and whether that level of higher demand and profitability is sustainable going forward into 2020,” Wedbush added."

Volkswagen tapped former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive Markus Duesmann to take the helm at Audi from April next year after the German premium brand lost key engineering know-how and influence in the wake of the 2015 diesel-cheating scandal.
Weekly magazine Der Spiegel on Friday said Audi is pushing for 4,000 to 5,000 positions to be eliminated in negotiations, which are led by Audi's interim boss Bram Schot.
Audi, which has a 61,000 strong workforce in Germany, declined to comment, as did its works council.
A sticking point is the demand by organized labor to extend an existing moratorium on forced redundancies from 2025 until 2030, the sources said."
1025,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 01:31PM ET</span>","Airbnb business outside U.S., China had $46 million profit in 2018","By Jane Lanhee Lee
(Reuters) - Airbnb's business excluding the United States and China turned a net profit of $46.47 million in 2018 compared with a loss of $97.22 million the previous year, according to an earnings statement the company filed in Dublin, Ireland, and made public on Friday.
Airbnb International Unlimited Company is incorporated in Ireland and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Airbnb Inc. The filings are public for the first time following a change to the Irish Companies Act.
Revenue, which is only the fee collected by Airbnb and not the total collected from hosts, was nearly $2.42 billion in 2018, up more than 35% for the international business excluding the United States and China.
Reuters previously reported that Airbnb Inc's revenue for all of 2017 topped $2.5 billion, a more than 50 percent increase over 2016. The company has said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization were positive for 2017 and 2018. It has not disclosed revenue for 2018.
According to a report last month by The Information, Airbnb’s operating loss more than doubled in the first quarter this year, to $306 million year-on-year due to a sharply increased investment in marketing.
Airbnb has said it will go public in 2020, and its profitability is closely watched as many money-losing companies' initial public offerings have been big flops.
In an interview with the New York Times earlier this month, CEO Brian Chesky said Airbnb raised $3.2 billion from investors and that the company has ""more money in the bank than we’ve raised."""

(Reuters) -  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) pleaded guilty to spraying a banned pesticide on the Hawaiian island of Maui, and agreed to pay $10.2 million in criminal fines and other payments for the spraying and for illegally storing hazardous waste, U.S. prosecutors said.
The Department of Justice said late Thursday that Monsanto sprayed Penncap-M, which contained the banned pesticide methyl parathion, on research crops in 2014, despite knowing that the Environmental Protection Agency prohibited its use after 2013.
It also said Monsanto, now part of Germany's  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN), admitted it let employees enter the sprayed fields after seven days despite knowing it should have waited 31 days.
Monsanto agreed to plead guilty to the spraying, a misdemeanor, and enter a deferred prosecution agreement for two felony counts of illegally storing ""acute hazardous waste.""
The felony case will be dismissed if Monsanto honors the agreement's terms for two years, including by maintaining an environmental compliance program at its Hawaii sites.
U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in Los Angeles, who announced the settlement, said the payout includes $6.2 million of criminal fines and $4 million of community service payments to Hawaii government agencies. The settlement requires court approval.
Bayer said on Friday that Monsanto ""did not live up to its own standards or the applicable laws,"" and was unaware of any reported health or environmental problems from its conduct.
""As stewards of the land, it is our responsibility to use agriculture products safely and to manage our waste correctly,"" Bayer spokesman Darren Wallis said in a statement. ""We take this very seriously and accept full responsibility for our actions.""
Since acquiring Monsanto for $63 billion in June 2018, Bayer has been mired in litigation linking Monsanto's glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup to the cancer non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and has lost three U.S. jury verdicts in such cases.
Bayer's share price has fallen more than 30% over that time.
The company has defended Roundup's safety, and said health regulators around the world have concluded that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.
Last month, Bayer said 42,700 plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to Monsanto's glyphosate-based products had sued the company in the United States as of Oct. 11, up from 18,400 three months earlier."

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",Federal pension fund says bill banning China investment is discriminatory,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The group overseeing a large U.S. federal pension fund said recent legislation aimed at preventing it from investing in China-based companies will deprive its participants of a significant opportunity for retirement returns if passed. 
The legislation ""discriminates against 5.8 million employees, retirees, and service members by restricting their ability to direct their money and save for their retirement,"" the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) said in a Nov. 14 letter seen by Reuters. 
The FRTIB is an independent government agency that oversees the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement fund, which is similar to a private 401(k), and has around $600 billion in assets.
A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, introduced a bill on Nov. 6 that would prevent the FRTIB from shifting the benchmark its international stock investment fund tracks to one that includes, among others, Chinese-listed companies.
The senators on Friday urged the committee considering the bill to expedite it forward. That would ""ensure that the retirement savings of American federal employees and members of the armed services are not invested in China-based companies, including those involved in the Chinese government's military activities, human rights abuses and industrial policy,"" they said in a letter. 
An identical bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and the issue has gained traction among lawmakers at a time of high-profile trade tensions with China and efforts to limit the flow of U.S. capital to Chinese companies due to security concerns. 
But as currently written, the bill would not allow the FRTIB to offer its participants any international stock index fund, because there is no international index available that meets the bill's criteria, the agency said in the letter to the senators. 
Emerging market stocks have outperformed developed markets in recent years and nearly all other major public and private pension plans offer access to them, the FRTIB said.
The FRTIB's decision to use the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S.A. Investable Market Index, which represents 99% of the international equity market, as the benchmark for its international stock fund, came after recommendations from a consulting firm. 

The fund's current international fund benchmark represents just 58% of the international equity market, and excludes Canada, as well as emerging markets. That benchmark would not meet the requirements of the senators' legislation either, the FRTIB said.

Two months ago President Donald Trump's administration announced a sweeping plan to ban all e-cigarette and vaping flavors except tobacco, but a final decision has not been made.
Trump is set to meet with a range of groups including industry representatives on Friday to discuss tightening of e-cigarette regulations. 
Proponents of the ban have pointed to a dramatic rise in youths vaping, drawn by sweet flavors, and a surge in serious vaping-related illnesses.
More than 27.5% of American high school students use e-cigarettes, up from 20.7% in 2018, according to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
E-cigarette companies have, however, opposed the ban, saying their products are not for children and that it would hit several jobs the industry has created. 
If a ban on flavored vapes goes through, the majority of 13,480 independent vapor shops in the country would have to close, said the report by economist John Dunham & Associates, which was prepared for Vapor Technology Association (VTA).
Nearly 92% of vaping flavors in the independent distribution chain are those other than tobacco, said the report, adding the ban could also cost $22.4 billion in lost economic activity. 

The VTA, with over a thousand members, represents e-cigarette makers, as well as retailers and distributors.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 12:36PM ET</span>",EU to crack down on asset managers in 2020 after Woodford fund closure,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Market watchdogs in the European Union will launch coordinated checks next year on whether asset managers are flouting liquidity rules after the shuttered Woodford fund in Britain has raised questions, a top EU regulator said on Friday.
Steven Maijoor, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), said the checks were due to heightened attention over liquidity risks at EU-regulated funds known as UCITS.
Liquidity refers to the ability of a fund to easily sell its assets, such as stocks and bonds, to raise cash for meeting redemption calls from investors.
Former star U.K. stockpicker Neil Woodford was forced to suspend his flagship equity fund in June after being unable to meet daily redemptions from investors, who could lose more than 1 billion pounds ($1.28 billion).
The fund was later closed down and is being investigated by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority.
Maijoor said Woodford and other incidents have called the UCITS ""label"" into question.
""For this reason, in order to foster convergence and promote consistent supervision with regard to liquidity risks, ESMA will facilitate a common supervisory action on liquidity management by UCITS,"" Maijoor told a conference on Friday held by the European funds industry body (EFAMA).
The liquidity checks by national watchdogs across the EU will follow a common approach developed at ESMA.
FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey has called UCITS rules flawed, but Maijoor stopped short of calling for rule revisions.
Existing rules already require asset managers to manage liquidity risks appropriately to comply with redemption obligations, Maijoor said. They also address concerns that managers might invest in assets that are not liquid enough.
Woodford bust the EU cap on holdings of illiquid or hard-to-sell assets, and listed some assets on an exchange in Guernsey that were little traded.
""A listing on an eligible market does not automatically mean that all specific securities of such market are actually liquid,"" Maijoor said.
""Asset managers should ensure that the investment strategy and liquidity risk management are consistent with the redemption policy communicated to investors, in order not to raise unrealistic expectations.""
The Central Bank of Ireland said on Thursday that the Woodford closure was prompting it to take a closer look at liquidity in funds, many of which are managed from Britain.
The Bank of England and FCA are due next month to update markets on potential changes to better align timelines for redemptions with liquidity in a fund."

1035,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 11:14AM ET</span>",Sewing’s Deutsche Bank Cuts Bear Fruit With Eased Capital Hurdle,"(Bloomberg) -- Christian Sewing’s efforts to scale back   Deutsche Bank   AG (DE:DBKGn) are paying off, with authorities saying the lender is less of a risk to the financial system after the German lender announced plans to cut back its trading business.
The German bank moved down a notch in the Financial Stability Board’s ranking of risk, meaning it will probably face a lower requirement for the so-called leverage ratio, a list published on Friday showed. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)remained on the list as the world’s most systemically important bank while Toronto Dominion Bank (TSX:TD) was added to the list at the lowest level.
Sewing, Deutsche Bank’s chief executive officer, is rolling back years of breakneck expansion when it sought to go head to head with U.S. investment banks. In July he unveiled the most sweeping restructuring plan in decades, including cutting a fifth of the workforce through 2022 and exiting equities trading. The bank is also shrinking the fixed-income business, long one of its major areas of strength.
Deutsche Bank, which had flagged the potential change this year, acknowledged the new ranking in a statement. The change probably won’t affect its risk-based capital requirements because German regulator BaFin has its own measure. The FSB assessment suggests that the leverage ratio, a measure of bank’s balance sheet that doesn’t take account of its risk, will be 3.75% of 4% when the requirements take effect in 2022. The bank targets a level of about 5% by the end of that year.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
The FSB’s decision to move Deutsche Bank to Bucket 2 of Global-Systemically Important Banks from Bucket 3 is a modest credit-positive. The decision confirms DB’s reduced size and complexity.
--Jeroen Julius, BI credit analyst
That means the change may not not make Sewing’s overhaul much easier. He plans to use some of the bank’s risk-based capital to shoulder restructuring charges. Still, it may be viewed as an acknowledgement of Deutsche Bank’s efforts to become simpler and improve relations with regulators.
The rankings reflect an international consensus about the relative risk posed by the world’s biggest lenders. Banks included in the group face more stringent capital demands, requirements that they have more capacity to absorb losses in a crisis and more stringent supervisory expectations about risk management. The actual capital requirements are set by supervisors in a bank’s jurisdiction.
The FSB includes the representatives from authorities, including the European Central Bank and Bank of England, and is chaired by Randal Quarles, a vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve."

In a complaint filed on Thursday night, the bank said Kingate Global Fund and Kingate Euro Fund exhibited ""sellers' remorse"" by backing out of their 2011 agreement to sell the claims at 66 cents on the dollar, after the value of the claims had ""materially increased.""
According to Deutsche Bank, Kingate wrongfully concluded that the sale was no longer ""binding"" because too much time had passed and a related agreement had not been signed.
Deutsche Bank is seeking to enforce the sale, or else obtain damages, in its lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court.
Lawyers who have represented Kingate in related litigation with Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.
Based in the British Virgin Islands, the Kingate funds filed for protection under Chapter 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy code on Sept. 5, citing the risk of litigation by Deutsche Bank.
The Kingate funds were among ""feeder funds"" that supplied client money to Madoff, which he used to fuel his Ponzi scheme.
They reached an $860 million settlement in June with Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee liquidating the former Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Picard has said the Kingate funds sent Madoff more than $1.7 billion.
According to his website, the trustee has recovered $14.29 billion for former Madoff customers, more than 81% of the $17.5 billion he has estimated they lost in a decades-long fraud.
Madoff, 81, pleaded guilty in March 2009 and is serving a 150-year prison term."

That gives Rolls-Royce more time to sort out the durability issues in its Trent 1000 engines before Emirates believes a realistic competition can be held.
""Rolls have had a number of wake up calls and they really need to sort themselves out. I think the alarm clock has gone off a number of times,"" Emirates President Tim Clark said at the Dubai Airshow.
""If I were on the board, I would be looking to recognize the issues... and deal with them immediately, meaningfully, forcefully and drive change,"" he told reporters.
A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce said it was proud that Emirates had chosen to order 50 Airbus A350s, powered by Rolls' Trent XWB, in a deal announced this week. 
""We are confident in the reliability and performance of our engines, and in our commitment to meeting the high standards expected by our customers,"" the spokeswoman said.
""(Emirates) is one of the largest operators of our Trent engines in the world, and we are committed to maintaining our strong relationship with them.""
The Rolls-powered version of the 787 has been hit by repeated technical problems, leading to share price pressure and drawing criticism from airlines.
The engine maker's chief executive Warren East said on Nov. 7 that the company would spend more on parts and replacement engines to reduce the time aircraft are grounded while turbine blades are replaced. 
Clark said that the situation at Rolls was ""salvageable"" if board acted quickly and accepted the issues they were having.
""With the reputation that (Rolls) has for quality engineering and its excellence in the past, they must restore that as the gold standard,"" he said. 
He said his comments should not be read as a criticism of any individuals including East.
Clark has been a vocal critic of engine makers, saying in September he wouldn't take new planes unless their engines were ready and said he was ""a little bit irritated"" by delays at Rolls and GE. 
GE powers the 777X, which Emirates cut its order of on Wednesday after Boeing pushed back its entry into service, partly due to issues with its engines.

Clark said engine makers should only offer technology that was mature enough to work reliably in the demanding conditions of the Gulf, adding: ""Don't use (airlines) as guinea pigs"".

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 10:22AM ET</span>",AstraZeneca shares rise on early U.S. approval for leukemia drug,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (L:AZN) shares rose 2.7% on Friday after the British drugmaker won earlier-than-expected U.S. regulatory approval for a leukemia drug, in a challenge to rival AbbVie (N:ABBV).
AstraZeneca said late on Thursday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had given its go ahead for the company's Calquence drug to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), one of the most common types of leukemia in adults.
The drug was approved under a new speedy review program in collaboration with drug watchdogs in Canada and Australia, and was also approved to treat small lymphocytic lymphoma, a similar disease.
That will pit the AstraZeneca drug against AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) established CLL treatment Imbruvica.
The FDA's green light, which analysts at brokerage Bryan Garnier said came at record speed, adds momentum to Astra's growing cancer drug business with brands including Tagrisso and Imfinzi.
""Physicians are used to Imbruvica and we do not expect a rapid and massive shift towards Calquence but we do see it progressively taking market share from the leader,"" Bryan Garnier analysts said, adding that FDA tests had showed Calquence performed well in terms of side effects.
Astra shares were up 2.1% at 1415 GMT, outperforming a 0.7% gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care (SXDP) index.
Astra shares have risen 28% this year, boosted by revenue growth from new drugs.
Average analyst forecasts point to 2024 Calquence sales of almost $1.5 billion, up from a projected $160 million this year, according to Refinitiv data.
Abbvie and J&J chalked up 2018 Imbruvica revenues of $3.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.
Calquence had previously been approved for the relatively smaller group of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients that had received prior therapy."

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian broadcaster Mediaset will hold a special shareholder meeting to try and reach agreement with  Vivendi  over its plan to set up a holding company, the Italian firm said on Friday, as the pair head to court to try and resolve their dispute.
Mediaset (MI:MA) remains determined to push ahead with its plans for a pan-European holding company to drive international growth, despite objections from its No. 2 shareholder Vivendi (PA:VIV).
In a statement ahead of a court hearing to address a request from Vivendi to suspend the pan-Europe TV plan, Mediaset said an attempt at conciliation with the French group ""has not, as things stand, resulted in a positive outcome"".
However, in a sign it still hoped for a resolution to the dispute, it said a special shareholder meeting would be held on Jan. 10 to vote on a number of proposed amendments to the project that it hoped could break the deadlock.
The two groups were given until Friday by a Milan court to reach a compromise in the dispute.
Following a board meeting, Mediaset said plans for the new Dutch holding dubbed MediaForEurope (MFE) were a strategic priority and would go ahead, adding that ""the MFE Project is essential for the future of the Mediaset group"".
It said the importance of the project meant it was ready to accept suggestions received during the conciliation process and a number of amendments would be put forward for approval on Jan. 10.
""By acting this way ... the Board of Directors hope to gather the approval also by those shareholders who have elected to oppose the MFE Project,"" it said in a statement.
No comment was immediately available from Vivendi.
Vivendi is challenging the plan in the courts as it includes a governance structure that would help Fininvest, the holding company of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, to tighten its grip over Mediaset.
A source with knowledge of the case said the companies might ask a judge to give them extra time to negotiate. 
One of the main stumbling blocks has been price. A source on Thursday said Vivendi was prepared to sell the 20% Mediaset stake held by its Simon Fiduciaria trustee at a price of 3.25 euros each, below the 3.7 euros paid three years ago to build an overall 29% stake.
Mediaset has offered 2.77 euros to repurchase shares of investors wanting to opt out of its MFE plan.
Failure to reach a deal over its pan-European plan could complicate Mediaset's efforts to tackle increasing competition from streaming services such as Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon Prime (O:AMZN).
Mediaset shares were trading up 2.4% at 2.7 euros at 1410 GMT.

""We don't know what is going to happen in the next few hours or days, but today's press reports suggest a good execution of Mediaset's European project is now more likely,"" one Milan trader said.

The job cuts included employees impacted by idling of its two mines in Utica, Illinois and Tyler, Texas, the company said, adding that it expects to incur about $1.7 million in related severance costs in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Last month, U.S. Silica said it expects demand to slow down in the fourth quarter and reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss weighed down by lower prices.
Prices for the proppant used to crack the ground and extract oil have dropped in North America, as low oil prices and demands for higher investor returns stunted drilling activity.
The company had also forecast net sales and profits in its industrial business, which supplies sand to construction companies and glass manufacturers, to stay flat or rise marginally in 2020, hurt by trade tariffs and fears of a global slowdown.
""The difficult decisions announced today are an important element of our plan to protect margins and generate free cash flow in an increasingly competitive oil and gas completions market,"" Chief Executive Officer Bryan Shinn said on Friday.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian stock indexes have comfortably outperformed their emerging market peers in 2019 and with dividend yields high and perceptions of Russian risk improving, analysts say there is every chance the stock rally can continue.
Russia's economic growth has been sluggish since the imposition of western sanctions in 2014, but the absence of fresh sanctions, strong oil prices and an improved sovereign credit rating are attracting investors eager for risk.
The average dividend yield offered by companies listed on Russia's rouble-based MOEX index (IMOEX) surpassed yields on Russia's sovereign bonds in August. Fixed income investors may since have started viewing some stocks as ""quasi-fixed income instruments"", said Erik DePoy, equity strategist at Gazprombank.
The dividend yield has hovered at around 7% since May, compared with a yield on Friday of around 6.36% on Russia's benchmark 10-year OFZ treasury bond (RU10YT=RR).
The bond yield touched an 11-year low of 6.31% after the Russian central bank cut interest rates last month for the fourth time this year, lowering the key rate to 6.50%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
(GRAPHIC: Dividend yield versus bond yield - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/RUSSIA-STOCKS-YIELDS/0H001QXL59KG/eikon.png )
DECLINING RISK
The MOEX index has fallen away from a record high hit earlier in November, but analysts believe solid investor demand means Russian assets can bounce back.
""The cost of the risk premium that investors see in Russia has faded to levels before sanctions were imposed,"" said Iskander Lutsko, head of research at ITI Capital. ""The Russian market has the potential to renew these highs.""
Russia's five-year credit default swap price, a gauge of sovereign risk, closed at an all-time low of $70.43 on Thursday.
Sanjiv Bhatia, founder and CIO of Pembroke Emerging Markets in London, said his fund was ""super excited"" about Russia, but has invested up to 50% less there than it would have due to sanctions risk.
Corporate governance also remains a concern, said John-Paul Smith, of emerging market consultancy Ecstrat, known for predicting the 1998 Russian crisis.
(GRAPHIC: Russia stocks - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9068/8980/Russia%20stocks.png )
THE DIVIDEND FACTOR
Strong dividend returns have sent Russian markets soaring in 2019, with gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP), which makes up 10% of the index, up more than 80% up in dollar terms this year.
""You don't even need other things to do well if that happens, although other things have done well,"" said William Scholes, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Gazprom shares jumped after their dividend proposal in June, responding to pressure from Russia's finance ministry for state companies to pay at least 50% of net profits in dividends.
Slava Smolyaninov, chief strategist at BCS Global Markets, said sanctions had helped improve balance sheets because companies cannot build up excessive debt, thereby freeing up profits to put toward dividends.
According to Aton Research analysts, ""overly generous"" Russian dividend yields are far more lucrative than in other emerging markets, at around 4 percentage points higher.
Data from flow tracker EPFR showed that Russian stocks were among the top five gainers for global emerging market equity funds in 2019, with country allocations to Russia rising 0.45%.
Average weightings for Russia exposure among those funds has now risen to the highest level since the first quarter of 2014.
The RTS index's 36% gains compare to those of around 8% for the MSCI Emerging Markets index ."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union launched a complaint at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday against Indonesia's curbs on exporting nickel and other raw materials, which are designed to benefit its own smelting and stainless steel industries.
The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy in the 28-member EU, said the restrictions unfairly limited EU producers' access to nickel ore in particular, as well as to scraps, coal and coke, iron ore and chromium.
The Commission's complaint says the measures are part of a plan to develop Indonesia's stainless steel industry. The country is the world's largest miner of nickel ore and is set to ban exports for two years from 2020.
Indonesia has become the second-largest exporter of stainless steel and its share of the EU market has risen from near zero in 2017 to 18% in the second quarter of this year, European steel association Eurofer said.
It also says that the manufacturing methods used in Indonesia produce up to seven times more carbon dioxide than the processes used in Europe.
""The risk is that artificially cheap, highly polluting steel displaces cleaner steels from both domestic EU producers and traditional trade partners,"" Eurofer said.
China, the world's largest stainless steel producer, has stockpiled nickel ore ahead of the ban on shipments from Indonesia.
EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said Indonesia's measures put further jobs in the EU's already struggling steel sector at risk.
""Despite our concerted efforts, Indonesia has maintained the measures in place and even announced a new export ban for January 2020,"" she said in a statement.
The EU is also challenging a scheme that exempts Indonesian manufacturers from duties on certain imports for upgrading or building a new factory as long as local machinery and appliances make up 30% of content. The EU sees this as an illegal subsidy.
Indonesian government officials were not immediately available for comment.
Shares in European stainless steel producers were trading higher on Friday.  Acerinox  (MC:ACX) was up 1.0%,  Aperam  (AS:APAM) 0.6% higher and Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V) up 2.2%.
WTO complaints kick off with a 60-day period for consultations between the parties to settle the dispute. The complainant can then request a three-person panel to provide a ruling. That ruling would typically be at least a year away."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Makers of aircraft parts are making contingency plans for a prolonged grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX, with several expecting the jet's return to service to take longer than the planemaker hopes. 
The start date of deliveries of the MAX, grounded worldwide in March following a second fatal crash in five months, and the pace of production, which affects prices of aircraft parts, were key topics of discussion among suppliers at the Dubai Airshow this week. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) has said it hopes to begin deliveries of the jet next month after a software fix is approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, with pilot training requirements likely getting a nod in January. The FAA has said it has no timetable.
""Every three months (Boeing) have been kicking that can down the road, for nearly a year,"" said an executive with a maker of parts for cabin interiors.
He and others attending the show declined to be named for fear of antagonizing Boeing or other manufacturers, whose programmes dominate many suppliers' annual turnover.
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
U.S. airlines including Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (N:UAL) have extended cancellations of Boeing 737 MAX flights until early March.
Ryanair said February or the start of March is the most realistic timetable for it to start flying the grounded aircraft.
""Some airlines are telling us that the airplane won't be back before next summer,"" said the cabin supplier, adding that he had re-allocated some production capacity to Airbus parts.
Boeing cut production of the airplane in April, to 42 a month from 52. Before the grounding, it had been expected to rise to 57 a month this year, a target Boeing has said it is still aiming to hit by the end of 2020. 
Suppliers were already facing pressure on prices from both Boeing and Airbus while trying to keep up with record demand for production, which often requires extra investment. Many rely on boosting volumes to drive down unit costs. 
Investing is the only way to overcome challenges for sub-contractors, one supplier of electronic equipment for Boeing and Airbus said, but it has slowed this year due to the grounding of the MAX.
Even though Boeing has cut production at its own plants, it has kept part of its global supply chain running at the previous rate so it can ramp up quickly after the MAX returns to service.
But one supplier of a part that goes into the MAX said he had halted production and was replacing lost sales by focusing on replacements for older models, based on the possibility that the grounding could last beyond March.

""If you look back at what happened for the last nine months, I don't think Boeing gained points in terms of trust,"" he said. ""Their communication is probably not the best.""

The Dow was up 59 points or 0.2% by 9:49 AM ET (13:49 GMT), while the S&P 500 inched up 6 points or 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite gained 19 points or 0.2%.
Trump’s comments, made on Fox News, followed a carefully hedged speech from Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier in the day, who again pressed for a roll-back of U.S. tariffs on imports from China as a precondition for a 'phase-1' trade deal. 
Trump indicated he saw the bill passed this week by the Senate, tying Chinese trade preferences to its respect for Hong Kong's political autonomy, as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations. 
""We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi [Jinping], he’s a friend of mine,"" Trump said. ""He’s an incredible guy, but we have to stand…I’d like to see them work it out, ok?” 
Doubts over whether a trade deal will be reached by the end of the year have risen this week as China reacted angrily to the passage of the Hong Kong bill in Congress. 
""It's less likely the deal will be signed by the end of this year, but you may see the Dec. 15 tariffs postponed,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) fell 7.4% despite posting strong earnings, after executives reportedly expressed caution about the outlook for the current quarter.
Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) tumbled 19.6% after the data-storage company posted disappointing results and lowered its full-year forecast.
In commodities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1% to 98.015 and gold futures gained 0.2% to $1,465.85 a troy ounce. Crude oil futures fell 0.5% to $58.30 a barrel.

PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi's (PA:SASY) most senior strategy boss is set to leave by the end of the month, according to a memo seen by Reuters, in the first major management change under new chief executive Paul Hudson as he shakes up the firm's priorities. 
Muzammil Mansuri, head of strategy and business development and member of the French drugmaker's executive committee, will be retiring from the company, according to the note from Hudson sent to staff on Wednesday.
A spokesman for Sanofi confirmed the decision. 
Hudson, who took over as CEO on Sept. 1, is leading a strategic review and is expected to unveil the company's plan for the coming years at an investor day in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 10.
Mansuri had joined Sanofi in 2016 from Gilead Sciences (O:GILD) where he was in charge of research and development strategy and corporate development.
Hudson said in the memo that Alban de la Sabliere, currently head of business development, and Laurent Van Lerberghe, head of strategy, would take on more responsibilities as of Dec. 1 and report directly to him. 
Even though the group's new strategy is still in the works, Hudson has made no secret that significant changes were underway.
""I am bringing a little sense of urgency and prioritization. I have set a tone already that we can move a little bit faster,"" Hudson told reporters in October. 
""I think we have the right level of resources although perhaps not always in the right place.""
Sources have told Reuters Sanofi was contemplating a joint venture or an outright sale among options for its consumer healthcare unit. 
An initial public offering (IPO) of the business, which could be worth around $30 billion according to two sources familiar with the matter, is also potentially on the cards though they cautioned that no final decision had been made.
Analysts have argued a possible divestment or spin-off of Sanofi's consumer healthcare arm, whose revenue grew by 3% at constant exchange rates last year to 4.7 billion euros ($5.20 billion), would enable the group to invest more in internal research.
The future of Sanofi's ailing diabetes business - under constant pricing pressure in the United States, the world's largest health market - is also under the spotlight.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Airways (SAA) reached a deal on wages with two trade unions on Friday to end an eight-day strike that has weighed on the cash-strapped state airline.
Already reliant on government handouts to survive, SAA had to suspend hundreds of flights after the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) walked out on Nov. 15.
The airline said it might not make salary payments this month. 
SAA on Friday said the unions had agreed to a 5.9% wage hike retroactive to April, to be paid from next February if sufficient funds were available.
Consultations on planned job cuts have been deferred until Jan 31, it said.
""SAA will operate a near normal service on Saturday 23 November 2019,"" SAA said in a statement. ""On Sunday, 24 November 2019, SAA expects to operate its full schedule as usual.""
NUMSA union members had put their income on the line to achieve the deal, spokeswoman Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said. 
""As unions we fought very hard to negotiate a settlement which would be in the best interests of our members and we can honestly say this proposal is a reflection of that,"" she said. 
SAA on Friday also signed a wage deal with the National Transport Movement, a union which did not participate in the strike.
The government has spent about 20 billion rand ($1.4 billion) on support for SAA in the past three years.
But with ballooning state budget deficits and a sovereign credit rating teetering on the brink of ""junk"" status, officials are trying to rein in financial support for ailing state firms.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 07:27AM ET</span>","For British shoppers, November is the new Black Friday","By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - With harsh lessons learnt from past Black Fridays, British retailers are stretching promotions over several weeks, aiming to smooth out consumer demand and reduce the pressure on supply and distribution networks.
Brought over from the United States by Amazon (O:AMZN) in 2010, the annual event started as a single day of discounting before growing into a long weekend that took in 'Cyber Monday'. 
It then grew to a week or so either side and is now getting longer and longer, though after chaos and scuffles in stores in 2014 it is now predominantly an online affair.
“We’ve re-named Black Friday, November,” John Roberts, the chief executive of AO World (L:AO), the online electrical appliances retailer, told Reuters.
With recent consumer spending subdued, Brexit still unresolved and a looming national election creating new uncertainties, retailers are in need of a tonic.
AO went live with Black Friday deals, such as a KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer reduced from 449 pounds ($578) to 279 pounds, on Nov. 13 and some deals will run into December.
Dixons Carphone (L:DC), Britain's biggest electricals and mobile phones retailer, launched a first wave of promotions on Nov. 13 on products such as laptops, TVs and vacuum cleaners, and deals will run for a few days after Black Friday itself on Nov. 29. 
Amazon's Black Friday Sale runs for eight days from Nov. 22, but it has been running early Black Friday deals this week.
Argos, owned by supermarket group Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), and department store group John Lewis [JLPLC.UL] both launched their campaigns on Nov. 22.
LEARNING LESSONS
British retailers' early experiences of Black Friday, when stores were overcrowded, websites crashed and delivery operations were overloaded, showed the folly of concentrating a huge amount of business on one day and then having a relatively flat period afterwards.
“While this may ease the demand on logistics operations over the period, it will mean that shoppers demand ever steeper discounts during Black Friday as they expect something more from retailers during this time,"" said Zoe Mills, retail analyst at GlobalData, the data and analytics company.
It forecasts that UK shoppers' spending in the Black Friday period would rise 2.2% year on year to 4.3 billion pounds.
Black Friday, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, is so-called because it was historically the day when retailers would move into profit after months in the red. It traditionally marks the start of the U.S. holiday shopping season.
This year's sales drive, which is often make-or-break for U.S. retailers, falls a week later than last year, leaving U.S. retailers with a shorter holiday shopping period.
'BLACKVEMBER'
PwC, the advisory firm, reckons 52% of British consumers are either interested in buying or plan to buy something during Black Friday, with average spend forecast at 224 pounds. But it says consumers are increasingly cynical about the event.
""Some consumers doubt the quality of the deals on offer, with many seeing them as not especially good value or not worthy of interest, and this is likely to have been exacerbated as Black Friday deals have spread to the whole of 'Blackvember',"" said Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC.
Black Friday's popularity has meant Britain's Christmas trading season now has three distinct peaks - around Black Friday, the week up to Dec. 25 and the post-Christmas sales.
But nearly a decade after coming to Britain, the event's worth to retailers still polarizes opinion.
Supporters say carefully planned, targeted promotions in close co-operation with global suppliers allow retailers to achieve a sales boost while still maintaining profit margins.
Naysayers argue the discounts suck forward Christmas sales at reduced profit margins, undermine consumers' willingness to pay full price again before Christmas, and dampen business both in prior and subsequent weeks.
Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) has dabbled with Black Friday in the past but has opted out since 2015. CEO Steve Rowe says his focus is on improving M&S' value all year round.
“That’s the way to deliver great value for customers, not one off promotions, so we won’t be taking part.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks inched up on Friday, lifted by China's renewed offer to work out a trade pact with Washington and despite signs that manufacturing in major eurozone economies was grinding to a halt.
But gains were limited by uncertainty over how the 16-month-old U.S.-China trade war plays out and how much it may undermine the world economy.
Such jitters have put MSCI's index of global shares on course to snap a six-week streak of gains, with lackluster economic data and rising political risks in the United States and Britain also casting a pall over sentiment.
European shares rose off three-week lows touched on Thursday when it seemed that U.S. legislation on Hong Kong would undermine planned trade talks between the world's two largest economies. The broader Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.4% and London-listed shares (FTSE) outperformed with a 1% rise as trade-exposed miners, banks and energy companies recovered from falls earlier this week.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) edged down 0.02% after IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' index readings showed German business conditions continued to wane in November, although at a less fast pace than recently.
Business activity in the euro zone almost stopped growing altogether, with IHS Markit's flash November composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a reliable guide to economic health, sliding to 50.3 from October's 50.6, moving to within close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Wall Street futures were marked slightly firmer after China said it was willing to work with the United States to resolve core trade concerns, and the Wall Street Journal reported China had invited U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing.
But whipsawing hopes over reaching even a ""phase one"" deal before tariff hikes kick in on Dec. 15 have restrained markets.
""Markets are being held hostage by news - positive or negative - coming out of the United States or China. Even if the phase one agreement materializes there is no way I would believe that's the end of the story, it will just move to German cars or Japanese exports,"" said Marie Owens-Thomsen, chief global economist at wealth manager Indosuez.
Concerns linger, with U.S. President Donald Trump expected to sign into law two bills backing protesters in Hong Kong after the U.S. House of Representatives voted 417-1 for the ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"", which the Senate had passed unanimously a day earlier.
""If he's going to be forced to sign it, then it brings another (element) of uncertainty to this phase one trade deal, which then pushes back into next year,"" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at GAIN Capital in Singapore.
But Simpson said that in the absence of major news on trade, rangebound market moves are ""quite reflective of the small headlines coming through"".
Chinese blue-chip shares (CSI300) closed 0.82% lower and Asian shares ex-Japan firmed 0.3% after the previous day's steep falls. Yields on U.S. and German government bonds were a shade higher.
The failure to resolve the trade spat means the world economy is struggling to recover from its slowdown and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on Thursday forecast growth at a decade-low 2.9% this year and the next.

LONDON (Reuters) - Canada's Toronto Dominion Bank (TO:TD) has been added to a global list of systemic banks that must hold extra capital, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has dropped a rank within the list, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) said on Friday.
The international body based in Basel, Switzerland, was updating its list of systemic banks, introduced in the aftermath of the global financial crisis a decade ago when taxpayers had to bail out struggling lenders.
The addition of Toronto Dominion brings the total number of systemic banks to 30.
Systemic banks are slotted into one of five buckets, although the fifth - where banks would be required to hold an extra 3.5% of capital to risk-weighted assets on top of minimum requirements - remains empty.
 JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) remains the sole occupier of the fourth bucket, with a 2.5% capital surcharge.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and HSBC are in the third bucket, with a 2% surcharge.
Deutsche Bank has dropped from the third to the second bucket, which has a 1.5% surcharge, in a sign of how the struggling German lender is shrinking and simplifying its operations.
""This was primarily driven by reductions in leverage, strategic adjustments in the bank’s business and geographic perimeter and lower derivative volumes, together with wider industry developments,"" Deutsche Bank said in a statement.
Deutsche Bank is, however, still required to meet a 2% extra capital requirement as a ""domestic systemically important bank"", and therefore the overall capital buffer is expected to remain unchanged, the German bank said.
Toronto Dominion has been placed in the first bucket, with a 1% surcharge.
Changes to capital requirements come into effect in January 2021.
Banks on the list also face more onerous requirements for issuing special bonds that can be written down to replenish capital burned in a crisis to shield taxpayers."

1053,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 06:48AM ET</span>",China’s Xi Stresses Need for ‘Mutual Respect and Equality’ in Trade Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping said his nation wants to work toward a phase one trade agreement with the U.S. on the “basis of mutual respect and equality,“ his first comments on a partial deal that he could potentially sign with President Donald Trump.
“We didn’t initiate this trade war and this isn’t something we want,“ Xi reiterated in a Friday meeting with prominent international visitors to Beijing including former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. “When necessary, we will fight back, but we have been working actively to try not to have a trade war.”
Just a few days ago, U.S. President Donald Trump said China wasn’t “stepping up to the level that I want” in the negotiations amid doubts about whether the two sides can hammer out a written agreement. On Wednesday, China’s chief trade negotiator, Liu He, indicated he was “cautiously optimistic” about reaching the first phase of a deal.
Liu made the comments in a speech in Beijing on Wednesday ahead of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, which is being organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. Some of the foreigners who met with Xi on Friday were also in Beijing to attend the forum.
The Chinese leader spoke to more than a dozen people including former U.S. government officials such as Hank Paulson and Gary Cohn. Bloomberg LP Chairman Peter Grauer also attended the meeting.
Since Trump announced the phase one deal a month ago, markets have been whipsawed by comments from both sides, first indicating progress, and then the opposite.
The latest potential hurdle came after Liu made his dinner-time comments, when the U.S. House voted 417-1 for legislation supporting Hong Kong protesters that has already been unanimously approved by the Senate. It could go to Trump as soon as Thursday and he plans to sign the bill, a person familiar with the matter said.
Xi on Friday also shed some more light on China’s plans to open up its financial markets. He said the reforms set in motion will not stop, but that the nation needs to be careful and will also ensure its “financial sovereignty.”
“We are working to realize the Chinese dream of renewal of our nation,” he said. “It’s not a dream about hegemony, it’s not about replacing others. We are just trying to restore our place and role in the world rather than reliving the humiliating days of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal era.”
China has this year sped up the opening of its $40 trillion financial market, and will next year give the go-ahead for foreign securities firms to take full ownership of joint ventures they have in the country. Officials in Beijing are seeking to attract foreign investments to support economic growth, which in part has been hurt by a crackdown on lending at their local banks after years of rapid growth.
Top executives from banking firms such as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). were also in Beijing attending the forum, flagging they were preparing major investments and expansions in the country to capture an estimated $9 billion in annual profits.
Brock Silvers, managing director at Adamas Asset Management in Hong Kong, said Xi’s emphasis on financial sovereignty signals Beijing’s unwillingness to cede too much control.
“Where reform conflicts with state economic authority, the Xi Administration will continue to support the statist position,” he said. “This policy, which could effectively restrict larger systemic reform, also seems to be a major factor in the ongoing repatriation of China’s offshore listed giants like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).”"

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 05:32AM ET</span>",Tesla's electric pickup breaks the mould with angular design and armored glass,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Peter Henderson
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Thursday unveiled its electric pickup, a truck with a futuristic angular body in gunmetal gray that resembled an armored vehicle and takes aim at the heart of Detroit automakers' profits. 
Starting from $39,900, the Cybertruck is less expensive than initially flagged but its polarizing design could limit sales in a popular segment symbolic of a rugged, practical American lifestyle.
At a launch event in Los Angeles, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said other versions will be priced at $49,900 and $69,900 with the most expensive offering a range of more than 500 miles (800 km). By comparison, the current maximum range of a Tesla car is 370 miles for its long-range Model S sedan.
Production is expected to begin around late 2021.
Made from ultra-hard stainless steel which Musk claimed was bulletproof, the four-door six-seater truck's sharp geometric body was set atop massive tires. Its tinted windows were made from armored glass, while a single strip of white light wrapped around the truck's front, replacing headlamps.
""Trucks have been the same for a very long time, like 100 years,"" he said, as an audience of Tesla fans chuckled at a slideshow of pickup truck designs throughout the decades. ""We need something different.""
Musk's assertion that the Cybertruck's exterior ""won't scratch and dent"" appeared to be borne out after it was hit with a sledgehammer.
But in a snafu that invited much mockery online, the armored glass windows cracked like spider webs when metal balls were thrown at them. ""Room for improvement,"" Musk said, although he noted the glass had not completely broken. 
The truck marks the first foray by Tesla, whose Model 3 sedan is the world's top-selling battery electric car, into pickup trucks, a market dominated by Ford Motor Co's (N:F) F-150, along with models by General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU).
But analysts said its design meant the Cybertruck was unlikely to become more than a niche product and as such would have little impact on energy sustainability as Musk touted in his presentation.
""It feels like it's a truck for (Musk) and his friends in Silicon valley, not necessarily Joe the plumber who needs the truck to run his plumbing business,"" said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at automotive consultancy Edmunds.
The design of the truck, which can accelerate from 0-60 miles an hour in 2.9 seconds, was partly influenced by the Lotus Esprit sportscar that doubled as a submarine in the 1970s James Bond film ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" as well as by the movie Blade Runner.
Reactions on Twitter ranged from love to hate.
""I just watched tesla release the #cybertruck and honestly? My life feels complete,"" wrote @aidan_tenud, while @nateallensnyde wrote: ""Its nice to see Elon Musk make a cardboard box car he drew in kindergarten,"".

FORD, GM GEAR UP TOO
Tesla's focus on the high-performance end of the pickup market is only natural given the success of Ford's 450-horsepower F-150 Raptor truck, which launched in 2009 and whose sales have since risen annually.
Ford has never had to offer incentives on the model, which costs in the high $60,000 range, according to Ford spokesman Mike Levine. Ford also offers the more expensive F-150 Limited, its most powerful and luxurious pickup. 
Some analysts said they were concerned Tesla might not be able to deliver on its promised base price for the Cybertruck, given that it will be made from the same stainless steel to be used in the SpaceX Starship rocket and which could make it hard to keep a lid on production costs.
Ford and GM are also gearing up to challenge Tesla more directly with new offerings like the Ford Mustang Mach E electric SUV as well as electric pickups.
Ford aims to sell an electric F-series in late 2021, sources familiar with the plans said. GM plans to build a family of premium electric pickup trucks and SUVs, with the first pickup due to go on sale in the fall of 2021. 
In April, Ford invested $500 million in startup Rivian, which plans to build its own electric pickup beginning in fall 2020. 
Electric pickups and SUVs could help Ford and GM generate the significant EV sales they will need to meet tougher emission standards and EV mandates in California and other states.
The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.
Demand for full-size electric pickup trucks in the near term may not be huge, however.

Industry tracking firm IHS Markit estimates the electric truck segment - both full- and mid-sized models - will account for about 75,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 3 million light trucks overall. The Tesla truck is not part of that estimate.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 05:29AM ET</span>",Euro zone money market spike driven by French banks' contingency tests: traders,"LONDON (Reuters) - A sudden jump in the European Central Bank's new ESTR overnight interest rate this week was triggered by French banks bidding for extra cash as part of contingency tests, two sources familiar with the bloc's money markets said on Friday.
The euro short-term rate, ESTR, spiked around 3 basis points to -0.511% at Wednesday's fixing from the previous day . It had fallen back to -0.542% at Thursday's fixing.
The spike raised eyebrows in euro zone bond and money markets, where investors are assessing how the ECB's overnight rate responds to central bank's new tiered interest rate structure.
Two sources told Reuters that the jump in the ESTR rate was sparked by unexpected pressure from one or more French banks doing some contingency testing. That would involve the lenders bidding for additional cash in the overnight market.
""The French testing their limits in the system is the more correct reason for the jump in ESTR,"" said one money market source, who asked not to be named.
""I guess it makes sense to make sure there is enough debt in case you need liquidity.""
Another trading source said that while contingency testing is not unusual, the jump in ESTR may have come about because market liquidity has been thinned by banks parking excess cash at the ECB to take advantage of the new tiered rate policy.
The tiering system allows eligible banks a 0% interest rate on part of the reserves they hold at the ECB, rather than the deposit charge that equates to the bank's base rate of -0.5%.
""Because of tiering, when banks do this testing it's harder to find the liquidity,"" the trader said. ""But I don't think there will be a lasting impact."""

(Reuters) - European shares recovered on Friday, as better-than-feared manufacturing activity readings from major eurozone economies outweighed concerns about a U.S.-China trade deal that had sparked a selloff earlier this week.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) added 0.4% and London-listed shares (FTSE) outperformed with a 0.9% rise as trade-exposed miners, banks and energy companies rebounded from sharp falls earlier this week.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) gained 0.2% after IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' index readings showed German business conditions continued to deteriorate in November, although more slowly than recently.
Risk of a deepening German manufacturing recession amid a prolonged U.S.-China trade tussle, a struggling car industry and uncertainties over Britain's departure from the European Union has worsened sentiment among European investors.
However, Friday's readings came as a relief even as the broader euro zone business growth almost ground to a halt as the services industry increased at a much weaker pace than expected.
""What we see reflected in the PMIs is optimism and market expectations that a phase one deal is still a very real possibility,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank.
""But having said that, it remains to be seen what China's reaction will be to the Senate bill regarding the situation in Hong Kong. That will put negotiations under pressure and make them more complicated.""
Despite Friday's gains, the benchmark STOXX 600 index is set to close its first weekly decline in seven, retreating from near-record levels, as the standoff between the world's two largest economies, prolonged protests in Hong Kong and weak global economic data dulled investor sentiment.
President Xi Jinping said on Friday China wants to work out an initial trade pact with the United States, offsetting fears that the trade talks could flounder, with U.S. President Donald Trump expected to sign into law two bills backing protesters in Hong Kong.
Among individual stocks, Italian broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS) rose 2.2% after sources told Reuters that French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) is prepared to sell part of its stake in the firm at a loss in an attempt to reach a deal to end years of bitter legal disputes.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets gave up early gains on Friday as a closer look at preliminary purchasing managers indices for the euro zone showed no meaningful improvement in an economy still badly burdened by the U.S.’s ongoing trade conflict with China.
IHS Markit’s composite PMI for the euro zone fell to 50.3 from 50.6 in October, disappointing hopes for an improvement to 50.9. While surveys for France and Germany both showed pockets of life – the manufacturing PMIs were stronger than expected in both countries – service activity slowed more sharply.
IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson warned that the slowdown had broadened significantly both by sector and geographically.
“Resilient jobs growth had provided a key support to the more domestically-focused service sector earlier in the year, but with employment now rising at its slowest pace since early-2015, it’s not surprising to see the service sector now also struggling,” Williamson said in a statement. He added that the figures suggest an expansion of no better than 0.1% in the final quarter of the year.
Elsewhere, in her first keynote speech since taking office, new European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde appeared to promise continuity rather than any abrupt break with the policy of her predecessor Mario Draghi. Her speech stressed the importance of completing the euro zone’s institutional framework and the importance of raising productivity through more investment, notably by governments. Those are points on which Draghi nagged euro zone governments for years without much visible progress.
Lagarde repeated that she’ll be overseeing a strategic review of the bank’s monetary policy in the near future, which analysts say may challenge some long-held precepts such as the bank’s definition of “price stability”.
Bank stocks, at least, appeared reassured that there was no language which suggested any further near-term easing of monetary policy that would push interest rates further into negative territory and put even more pressure on their profits. The ECB's semi-annual Financial Stability Review, released earlier in the week, had warned with unusual frankness about the harmful side-effects of its interest-rate policy on the banking sector.
Spain’s   Bankia   (MC:BKIA) was the biggest gainer, rising 2.1%, while Santander (MC:SAN), BBVA (MC:BBVA),   ING Groep   (AS:INGA) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) all rose more than 1% initially before giving up some of their gains."

Lee Yuan Siong, a co-CEO at Ping An Insurance, will take over as CEO and president-designate from March 1, 2020, and will assume full responsibility from June 1, Hong Kong-headquartered AIA said in a statement issued to the stock exchange.
Before joining Ping An, China's largest insurer by market value, in 2013, Lee worked at  Prudential  Plc (L:PRU) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Lee will take over at AIA at a time when the insurer is facing slowing demand, with anti-government protests in Hong Kong hitting sales of insurance products to mainland Chinese visitors.
AIA and other insurers in Hong Kong get a large share of their sales from selling insurance products to China visitors seeking better products and overseas investment opportunities.
Anti-government demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled territory, which began in June, have resulted in a sharp drop in tourist arrivals, mainly from the mainland, hitting sales of luxury goods and insurance policies, among other things.
AIA posted its smallest ever quarterly growth in new business value in the September quarter and flagged concerns about the impact of the protests on domestic business, with the city slipping into its first recession in a decade.
The insurance firm, whose business was first established in Shanghai nearly a century ago, has a presence in 18 markets in the Asia Pacific. Hong Kong accounts for the biggest share of its new business.
Besides Hong Kong, AIA counts Australia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand among its other major markets.
AIA said Lee's service contract would be for three years, with an option to renew for a further three years. During his tenure, he will receive a total annual compensation, including incentives, of $7.03 million, the insurer said."

Zielke told prominent bankers at an annual conference in Frankfurt that the United States under President Donald Trump wanted to make deals, unilaterally if possible.
""We should not be tempted by the false slogan of 'Nation first' solutions. On the contrary, we should do all that is possible to overcome the deep divisions that we observe in some societies,"" Zielke said.

That points to a potential reversal in Ford's declining fortunes in the world's biggest auto market, as the U.S. auto maker has grappled with shrinking sales and problems such as an ageing model lineup.
The slide in Ford's sales has been unprecedented for a major global automaker in China. After a peak of 1.08 million vehicles in 2016, sales began faltering in late 2017, then nearly halved last year to 504,488, according to consultancy IHS Markit.

  Land Securities   (LON:LAND) said it has appointed Mark Allan to be its new chief executive officer. Allan is currently CEO of FTSE 250 member St. Modwen Properties (LON:SMP) Plc, a role he has held since 1 November 2016. TSt Modwen shares have risen over 50% during his tenure.
Allan will make the move at the end of May.
 
Online estate agent   Rightmove   (LON:RMV) said meanwhile that it has appointed former Shazam CEO and chairman Andrew Fisher as its new chairman. He'll succeed Scott Forbes at the end of this year.

Software group Playtech (LON:PTEC), which sells its services mainly to the gambling and spread betting industries, warned that full-year earnings are likely to be below consensus due to “highly challenging” conditions for its TradeTech unit and cut-throat competition in Asia.
The company said it’s “evaluating all options” for TradeTech and is also reviewing the Casual and Social Gaming business.
Playtech (LON:PTEC) said it now expects full-year EBITDA to be “a little below current consensus”, as its problems with TradeTech have been partly offset by a continued strong performance from the B2B Gambling and Snaitech units.
Revenue from Asia, where it has tried to expand market share in recent months is seen at 115 million a year at current run rates. It said market conditions are “highly competitive”.
FTSE 250 precious metals specialist Hochschild Mining (LON:HOCM) cut its forecast for output next year due to delays in obtaining permissions at the Pallancata mine in Peru.
Overall output is now seen as 432,000 gold equivalent ounces or 35 million silver equivalent ounces. That’s down from 457,000 and 37 million, respectively, this year.
“We have decided to give our brownfield exploration team more time to deliver additional resources,” CEO Ignacio Bustamante said.
Hochschild also expects costs to rise as a result of a one-off $22 million project to increase tailings capacity at the flagship Immaculada mine. The all-in sustaining cost from operations in 2020 is expected to be between $1,015 and $1,045 per gold equivalent ounce, or $12.5 and $12.9 per silver equivalent ounce.
Overall capital expenditures are seen at $115-$130 million, including the tailings project.

Under a joint stipulation filed in San Francisco Superior Court this week, the company agreed by Nov. 26 to respond to some of the document requests. It also agreed to a schedule to provide additional documents in December and January.
For California's document requests that remain in dispute, a judge will hold a hearing on Feb. 19.
Will Castleberry, a Facebook vice president for state and local public policy, said Thursday in a statement that the company has ""cooperated extensively with the state of California's investigation by providing thousands of pages of written responses and hundreds of thousands of documents over the past year. We look forward to continued cooperation and resolving the attorney general's remaining requests.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 15 U.S. senators urged the Commerce Department to suspend issuing licenses to U.S. firms that conduct business with China's Huawei Technologies Co, saying it could threaten U.S. security. 
In a letter on Thursday to President Donald Trump, the senators said the administration should halt issuing licenses until the administration provides Congress ""a report outlining specific criteria for determining whether or not the approval of any license poses a national security threat."" 
The Trump administration on Wednesday said it had begun issuing licenses to allow some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant after it was placed on a trade blacklist because of national security concerns six months ago. 
A U.S. official said on Wednesday that of roughly 300 license requests, about half have been processed, with roughly half of those – or one-quarter – approved and another quarter have received notices of intent to deny.
The letter, which was signed by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Senator Tom Cotton and provided to Reuters, demands congressional leaders ""be notified prior to the issuance of any licenses to U.S. firms to sell components to Huawei and its affiliates.""
It was also signed by Republicans Ben Sasse, John Cornyn, Josh Hawley and Rick Scott and Democrats Elizabeth Warren, Richard Blumenthal, Ron Wyden and Cory Booker. 
The letter warned the licenses will allow ""Huawei to continue to pose a serious threat to U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and national security more broadly.""
The White House declined to comment. A Commerce Department spokesman said the agency was ""issuing these narrow licenses to authorize limited and specific activities which do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.""
The department added that the licenses ""were approved through an interagency license review process"" that included Commerce, Defense, State and Energy department officials.
The license approvals came after the department renewed the so-called temporary general license for the company for a third time on Monday, extending permission for Huawei to engage in limited transactions to assist U.S. rural network operators. 
The Trump administration put Huawei on a trade blacklist, citing national security concerns, in May after trade talks with China broke down. Companies on the list are not allowed to receive shipments of U.S. goods without a special license from the Commerce Department.
The Federal Communications Commission plans to vote on Friday to designate Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) national security risks, barring U.S. rural carriers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment or services from them. The FCC also plans to propose requiring those carriers to remove and replace equipment from such designated companies.

All 347 passengers and 18 crew aboard Flight 113, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 777 widebody, are safe, an airline spokeswoman said. 
Pilots of flight 113 declared an emergency and reported a possible engine failure, Los Angeles International Airport said. A witness on the ground described ""bursts of flames"" coming out of an engine.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said the plane returned and landed safely. Television station ABC-7 in Los Angeles aired video of the aircraft after takeoff that showed flames and smoke coming out of the right engine.
The plane landed around noon local time (2000 GMT) and was met by the Los Angeles Fire Department, the airport said. The emergency landing did not affect other flights.
Although the cause of the apparent engine failure was not immediately clear, it comes as Boeing faces intense scrutiny over twin deadly crashes involving its 737 MAX single-aisle jetliner. The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since March. 
GE Aviation, a subsidiary of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), which makes the GE90 engine for the 777 twin-aisle jetliner, said it was aware of the incident and was ""working with the airline to determine the cause of the event and to promptly return the aircraft to service.""
Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""You saw bursts of flames, little flames shooting out from the engine,"" said Andrew Ames, a 36-year-old fitness professional in Los Angeles, who watched as the 777 ascended over the ocean after takeoff. ""It almost looked like backfire flames from a motorcycle or car."" 
""I had never seen a plane spew flames repeatedly. Then it stopped. As soon as it stopped, I saw the plane bank left, like it was heading back to airport,"" Ames said. 
The Philippine Airlines spokeswoman said the flight crew noticed smoke in the plane's second engine, declared an emergency and returned safely to the airport.
""All passengers are safe and sound,"" spokeswoman Cielo Villaluna said. ""They are all being assisted to another flight.""

Chinese stocks underperformed as there were no concrete signs of progress on U.S.-China relations.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.6% and 1.3% respectively by 10:50 PM ET (02:50 GMT). 
Trade tensions intensified this week after the U.S. Congress passed two bills to back protesters in Hong Kong and send a warning to China about human rights, a measure that angered Beijing and complicated the ongoing trade talks between the China and the U.S.
However, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He still invited top U.S. trade negotiators, including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing. 
The Journal’s report said that officials in the U.S. were willing to meet with their Chinese counterparts. 
“China is willing, on the basis of equal and mutual respect with the U.S., to work together to properly settle areas of common concern and strive for a phase-one trade agreement,” Gao Feng, China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesman, said at a regular press conference Thursday.
He noted that “external rumors” about the trade talks are not accurate, and noted that the two trade delegations remain in close communication.
Earlier this week, Reuters said a phase one trade deal might not be signed before the end of this year. 
“I think the phase one agreement is important. One, because it would put a trade truce between China and the United States. Two, it’d build a little confidence and certainty in the trading system,” Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told CNBC in an interview.
“It is a step in the right direction if the deal can get done,” Brilliant said.

SINGAPORE/PARIS (Reuters) - Societe Generale's regional heads of trade and commodities finance for Asia Pacific have left the Paris-based bank, raising concerns among Singapore-based shipping fuel traders that it may wind back financing services to the sector.
France's third-biggest listed lender said this year it would shrink or exit some businesses to cut costs at its investment banking unit, and has been hit by losses from trade financing in the Singapore bunker fuel market.
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), or SocGen, confirmed on Thursday that Damien de Rosny and Timothy Siow had left the bank, without providing further details.
De Rosny declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, citing a confidentiality agreement. Siow could not be reached for comment.
The bank, however, said it remained active in natural resources financing, one of its core areas of expertise.
""Societe Generale remains committed to trade commodities finance at the global level and in Asia,"" the bank said in an email to Reuters.
A SocGen source in France acknowledged that as the firm cut back on commodities trading it was also becoming more selective about counterparties in commodities trade finance.
The bank's reshuffle had sparked concern it could scale back, or even wind down, its financing services to Singapore's shipping fuel sector, five trade sources said.
Commodities trading relies heavily on credit lines provided by banks and Societe General has been a significant player in the sector, said the sources, who declined to be identified, citing company policy.
""Banks are certainly a lot more vigilant in the marine fuels sector at this time, and are asking themselves more questions as to the support they should be providing in light of a number of hits different banks have taken,"" said a risk management executive at a Singapore oil trader.
Singapore-based marine fuels supplier Inter-Pacific Petroleum Pte (IPP) this year lost its operating license and was placed under judicial management amid mounting financial stress.
Of IPP's more than $168.5 million in outstanding liabilities, more than $96 million was in trade financing from SocGen, court documents reviewed by Reuters showed. The bank did not confirm the losses.
In 2017, SocGen also incurred losses after one of Singapore's largest ship fuel traders, Universal Energy, was stripped of its operating license due to operational malpractice. (reut.rs/2Xy8XnI)

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs became the first major investment bank to cut its target price for Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) on Friday as Australia's No.2 lender faces allegations of massive breaches of anti-money laundering laws and billions of dollars in fines.
Goldman (N:GS) lowered its one-year share price target for Australia's oldest bank by a tenth, citing the contents of an explosive lawsuit from the financial crime regulator and potential knock-on effects including fines, class actions, loss of customers and capital concerns.
The regulator, AUSTRAC, this week accused Westpac of 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, including allowing payments between known child exploiters, triggering calls for the resignation of Chief Executive Officer Brian Hartzer.
""In all cases, banks underperform peers in the 12 months after the incident by an average of 18%,"" the U.S. investment bank said in its report about Westpac.
The downgrade struck another blow to shareholders of Westpac, with shares falling a further 1.6% on Friday, taking the total value of its losses to A$6.4 billion since the lawsuit was announced. The broader share market (AXJO) was slightly higher.
Bill Bovingdon, chief investment officer of debt fund Altius Asset Management, which manages over A$2 billion ($1.36 billion), told Reuters the company had cut its credit risk of Westpac to ""high"" from ""moderate"" and started reducing its exposure to the bank's bonds.
A Westpac spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Hartzer has said he accepted most of the regulator's assertions but ""at a senior executive level, for the board, for me personally, in no way have we been indifferent on this"".
Westpac had self-reported the breaches to the regulator and had since shut down the service at the center of the complaint which let customers and affiliate overseas banks process payments from Australia, Hartzer said.
The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported Westpac, which is scheduled to hold its annual general meeting in three weeks, had convened a board meeting on Friday, without providing further details.
SCALE OF WRONG-DOING 'INCREDIBLE'
Attorney General Christian Porter, meanwhile, said the seriousness of the Westpac lawsuit ""looks like it's off the charts"".
""You're obviously looking to ensure that whatever outcome occurs, that the people are held – and the organization is held – responsible in a big way for the size and scale of its misfeasance,"" the Australian Financial Review newspaper quoted Porter as saying in an interview.
""The size and scale of the wrongdoing here looks to be incredible.""
A spokesman for Porter verified the quotes without providing further comment.
Some of Australia's big pension funds said they have started reviewing their positions in Westpac.
A spokesman for Christian Super, which manages the retirement money of religious organization employees, said the AUSTRAC allegations were ""of significant concern (and) our team are currently reviewing the information available and will determine any actions in line with our investment framework"".
Stuart Palmer, Head of Ethics Research at investment fund Australian Ethical, which holds Westpac shares, said the allegations were ""very concerning, as are the delays in rectifying the issues once identified""."

""We don't have any plans at the moment to set up a production site in China for Tesla's Chinese business,"" CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told reporters at a strategy briefing on Friday.
""It is up to Tesla to decide whether it would use Chinese-made batteries from other manufacturers or get batteries from our Gigafactory 1 (in Nevada),"" he said.
The comments reflect Panasonic's growing caution about its joint battery business with Tesla, which has yet to show sustained profits. Tsuga earlier this year admitted he underestimated risks associated with Tesla.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) said on Thursday it had been granted a license from the U.S. government to export software to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
""On November 20, the U.S. Department of Commerce granted Microsoft's request for a license to export mass-market software to Huawei. We appreciate the Department's action in response to our request,"" a Microsoft spokesman told Reuters via email.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump said this week it would allow some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant, which was placed on a trade blacklist over national security concerns six months ago.
The Commerce Department confirmed it had begun issuing licenses for some companies to sell goods to Huawei, expanding the company's supplier base and providing long-awaited clarity to the industry that once sold it billions of dollars worth of goods.
On Wednesday, a U.S. official said it had received roughly 300 license requests, about half of which had been processed. Roughly half of those – or one quarter of the total – had been approved and the rest denied.
It was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to Huawei, which is the world's top telecommunications equipment maker and second-largest smartphone maker. A person familiar with the process said Wednesday that some licenses for sales of cellphone components and non-electronic components were approved.
Microsoft declined to comment beyond its statement on which products had been approved, and the Commerce Department declined to comment.
Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the license was most likely for the company's Windows operating system.
""This will be a major relief for Huawei after an arduous period with large technology players like Microsoft, Google and others restricted on the platform,"" Ives said.
Huawei has been anxiously awaiting a license for Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google to supply its mobile services to new models. Without access to Google services such as its Play Store for apps, Huawei phones will become harder to sell to consumers outside of China. Google declined to comment on Thursday.
The granting of licenses comes as the Trump administration is working to sign a phase one trade deal with China to end a tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hit global growth.
But the move immediately met with opposition. A bipartisan group of 15 senators urged the Commerce Department to suspend the issuing of licenses, saying it could threaten U.S. security.

In a letter on Thursday to Trump, the senators said the administration should halt issuing licenses until it provides Congress ""a report outlining specific criteria for determining whether or not the approval of any license poses a national security threat.""

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 06:02PM ET</span>","WeWork to lay off 2,400 employees in SoftBank revamp","By Sheila Dang, Carrie Monahan and Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork said on Thursday it is laying off around 2,400 employees, almost 20% of its workforce, as the office-sharing company seeks to drastically cut costs after it transformed from a Wall Street darling into a pariah in a matter of weeks.
The long-anticipated layoffs are the biggest move yet by Japanese technology conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp, which is providing a $9.5 billion lifeline and will soon own about 80 percent of WeWork's shares, to refocus the company on its core business. 
Under co-founder and ex-CEO Adam Neumann, WeWork had become bloated and was diversifying into all kinds of areas - including setting up a school and running apartment buildings - without any clear route to profitability. 
""As part of our renewed focus on the core WeWork business, and as we have previously shared with employees, the company is making necessary layoffs to create a more efficient organization,"" a company spokeswoman said in a statement. 
The job cuts are the latest sign of how much WeWork's prospects have deteriorated - from being worth $47 billion in January and planning in September an initial public offering (IPO), to a company facing a cash crunch and fighting for survival.
It shelved plans for the IPO on Sept. 30, a week after Neumann resigned as CEO. 
The layoffs began weeks ago overseas and continued this week in the United States, WeWork said. 
""This workforce reduction affects approximately 2,400 employees globally, who will receive severance, continued benefits, and other forms of assistance to aid in their career transition,"" New York-based WeWork added. 
The company had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others who work for affiliates. 
Staff in New York who were let go were offered six months severance if they had been with the company for at least four years, and four months severance for anything below that, one ex-employee said. 
Some employees who were laid off on Thursday laughed and took selfies as they exited the building. ""I'm feeling relieved, it's been a stressful time,"" a former employee said.
The layoffs come even as WeWork considers a change in CEO to replace current Co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, who themselves have only been in place since September.
The groups affected by the layoffs include WeWork's architecture unit, which has helped curate WeWork's distinctive shared office spaces known for their modern design, and its technology department, among which are coding and software teams, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Job losses in the technology department further undercut WeWork's central claim that it is primarily a technology company, not just a real estate firm, and therefore merits a much higher valuation. 
The perception that it was a technology company was central to the company attaining valuations in the tens of billions of dollars. 
In the aftermath of the announcement, WeWork's junk bond due in 2025 fell 1.125 cents on the dollar, sending its yield back to near a record high above 16%. 
Its spread over Treasury bonds, a measure of the additional premium investors demand for owning its risky debt rather than safer government securities, widened by 0.36 percentage point to 14.46 points. Before WeWork launched its failed IPO effort, the bond's spread was less than half that. 
MOUNTING LOSSES 
WeWork is still facing a litany of issues, the latest being an investigation by the New York State Attorney General. 
The company's losses are also continuing to mount, swelling to $1.25 billion in the third quarter, and it is burning through cash as it has committed to a big expansion in the number of sites.
As part of the restructuring, it is closing or selling peripheral businesses that it set up, including its private elementary school after the current school year.
A WeWork employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday that some employees at its residential living business, WeLive, had been told Thursday would be their last day.
Some WeWork employees have banded together into the WeWorkers Coalition, which is calling for severance pay and compensation for lost equity for laid-off employees. 
Alan Friedman, a WeWork software engineer who helped start the WeWorkers Coalition two weeks ago, described the long wait for the layoffs announcement, which has been widely discussed in the media for weeks, to be ""draining"" for staff morale.

Anticipation of the massive sale has already taken some of the shine from JBS’s rally, the best global meat performer in 2019. While shares of the meat producer have more than doubled in value this year, they have underperformed Brazilian peers in the past few weeks. The record profit before some items reported last week didn’t prevent the stock from falling 0.4%, leaving them down more than 20% since reaching a peak in September.
BNDES’s potential sale “is a large overhang for the stock in the near term,” according to a report signed by JPMorgan’s analyst Lucas Ferreira, who has an overweight rating and price target of 34 reais for the stock.
Santander’s Marcel Moraes, who has the highest price target for JBS among sell-side analysts tracked by Bloomberg, also listed the potential overhang if BNDESPar decides to sell its stake among the main risks to his view, according to a report from Nov. 18.
JBS shares have surged 131% in the past year on the back of pork-supply disruptions in Asia and strong results in the U.S. led by ample cattle supplies and rising beef prices.
The prospect for the next quarters is even better on an improving export outlook. China’s recent lifting of a ban on U.S. chicken is seen favoring its poultry shipments from the U.S., while pork sales may get a boost from the elimination of the feed additive ractopamine, banned by the Asian nation, on its U.S. supply chain from January."
1079,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 05:48PM ET</span>",Judge rejects U.S. move to disqualify states' lawyer in T-Mobile/Sprint lawsuit,"By Jonathan Stempel and Diane Bartz
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday rejected a U.S. government effort to disqualify a lawyer arguing for 15 states and the District of Columbia in their effort to block T-Mobile US Inc's (O:TMUS) planned $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint Corp (N:S). 
U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger said the Department of Justice waited too long to intervene in the case to try to disqualify Glenn Pomerantz, who had represented the department in 2011 when it stopped AT&T's purchase of T-Mobile, and his law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson.
Lehrburger ruled at a hearing in Manhattan federal court, less than three weeks before a scheduled Dec. 9 trial to determine whether T-Mobile, the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier, may go forward with its merger with Sprint, the fourth-largest.
Attorneys general from the 15 states and Washington, D.C. contend that the merger will boost prices and harm consumers, especially poorer ones. Pomerantz and his firm represent California, the largest of the 15 states.
Lehrburger said the Justice Department knew in mid-April about Pomerantz's planned role and should not have waited until a few weeks before the scheduled trial - and after the original Oct. 7 trial date - to speak up.
""The division could have, and should have, moved much earlier,"" Lehrburger said, referring to the Justice Department's antitrust division. 
Lehrburger, who handles many pre-trial matters in the case for U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero, said disqualifying the states' lawyers would cause ""extreme prejudice"" to both sides in a ""very complex"" merger case.
He also said it would prejudice the public, who had an interest in seeing a resolution ""sooner rather than later.""
Lawrence Reicher, a lawyer for the U.S. government, had argued that there was a ""substantial relationship"" between Pomerantz's work in 2011, when he had access to the government's files, and the current case.
""The United States' paramount interest is preserving our confidential information,"" he said.
T-Mobile's purchase of Sprint has won conditional approval by the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.
That approval requires the companies to divest Sprint’s prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television company Dish Network Corp (O:DISH) and provide it access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations. That transaction is worth about $5 billion.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he welcomed Lehrburger's decision. ""We will be relentless in this fight for consumer choice and real competition,"" he said in a statement.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 05:46PM ET</span>",Democrats urge U.S. Supreme Court not to protect Trump financial records,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic-led U.S. congressional committee and a Democratic prosecutor in New York on Thursday urged the U.S. Supreme Court not to prevent President Donald Trump's longtime accounting firm from handing over his financial records.
The House of Representatives Oversight Committee's filing followed Trump's request last week that the justices put on hold a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that Mazars LLP must comply with the panel's subpoena for financial records Trump has sought to keep secret. 
Separately, Manhattan prosecutor Cyrus Vance asked the Supreme Court not to block release of eight years of Trump's tax returns sought in a criminal investigation in New York, as ordered by lower courts. Trump has broken with decades of tradition by refusing to disclose his tax records as a candidate and as president, seeking to keep details of his finances confidential.
The Republican president said on Thursday he will release a statement on his finances before the 2020 presidential election, and asserted that it was up to him whether to provide such data.
Both cases represent an important showdown over the power of the presidency even as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry in the House.
The Oversight Committee has said the material it seeks is needed to determine whether Trump complied with laws requiring disclosure of his assets and to assess whether changes are needed in those laws.
On Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily put the matter on hold while the Supreme Court decides how to proceed.
The committee's lawyers said Trump is seeking to halt the functions of a co-equal branch of government ""by restraining a valid congressional inquiry and quashing a subpoena issued to a private accounting firm. That request should be denied.""
If the court does decide to hear the case, it should issue a ruling during its current term that ends in June, the committee's lawyers added.
The Supreme Court could act on Trump's request in the case at any time.
In the New York case, Trump last week asked the Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court's ruling that Vance can enforce a subpoena to Mazars demanding Trump's personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018.
Trump's lawyers have argued in the case for broad presidential immunity from any criminal investigation while he is in office.
Vance said in court papers the case does not concern Trump's role as president and hinges on his ""private interest in seeking his own and others' immunity from an ordinary investigation of financial improprieties independent of official duties.""
The justices are not likely to decide whether to hear the New York case until at least next month.

The court has a 5-4 conservative majority, including two justices appointed by Trump.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 05:27PM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler brushes off GM lawsuit, sees Peugeot deal by year end","By Giulio Piovaccari and Gilles Guillaume
TURIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Thursday brushed off a shock lawsuit from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and said it was confident of reaching a binding merger deal with Peugeot owner PSA Group by the end of this year to create the world's fourth-largest carmaker.
GM filed the lawsuit in the United States on Wednesday, alleging FCA had bribed United Auto Workers (UAW) union officials over years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars.
FCA said the suit, seeking substantial damages, was ""meritless"" and appeared intended to disrupt the Italian-American company's planned $50 billion merger with France's PSA.
""The GM lawsuit will be dealt with in appropriate places, but as we've said already it is absolutely groundless and so it does not worry us,"" FCA Chairman John Elkann told reporters at a strategy briefing for Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family which is FCA's largest shareholder. 
""Looking at how teams are working, both in FCA and PSA, I am encouraged to say that between now and year-end, we'll have a binding memorandum signed,"" he added. 
JP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a research note that GM could seek at least $6 billion in damages, but added a trial could be years away. He also noted that if GM's allegations were vindicated, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co could have a claim. Ford declined to comment.
At a  Barclays  (LON:BARC) auto conference in New York on Thursday, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra defended the lawsuit, noting she has often said: ""'Give us a level playing field, and General Motors will compete, and we'll win.' And so when we saw facts indicated that was not the case, we felt it was in the best interest of all of our stakeholders in the company.""
GM shares fell 1.7% to close at $34.67 on Thursday, while Fiat Chrysler shares fell 0.5% to $14.92 in New York. PSA closed nearly unchanged at 22.47 euros. 
PSA declined to comment on the lawsuit and any potential impact on the merger talks.
LONG-TERM INVESTORS
FCA and PSA announced plans last month to combine forces to better tackle the cost of new technologies such as electric and self-driving vehicles as well as a downturn in auto markets.
The merger would create a group with 8.7 million in annual vehicle sales, overtaking GM and putting it fourth globally behind Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota Motor Corp and the Renault-Nissan alliance.
In a letter to employees about the GM lawsuit, FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley said: ""We are astonished by this filing, both its content and its timing. We can only assume it was intended to disrupt our proposed merger with PSA.""
In September 2015, FCA's former chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, urged his GM counterpart, Barra, to consider a tie-up of the two carmakers. GM rebuffed FCA's advances.
GM on Wednesday alleged that after it rejected a merger bid from FCA, Marchionne conspired to negotiate a new four-year contract with the UAW ""designed, through the power of pattern bargaining, to cost GM billions."" Marchionne died in 2018.
FCA will vigorously defend itself against this ""meritless"" lawsuit, Manley said in the letter to staff, seen by Reuters. 
""We will not be slowed down by this act,"" he said, adding: ""Let’s keep the performance up as it has clearly got some of our competitors worried."" 
Manley was not named in the GM complaint and a source close to FCA said he was not linked to the case. 
Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family, also said Exor and the Peugeot family were committed to providing maximum support to the merged company and would provide stability for it in the years ahead. 

""We've been stable investors in the auto industry for the past 120 years, so, yes, I still see ourselves as stable investors in the auto industry in the next 10 years,"" Elkann said of Exor.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said Thursday it is giving free online trades to more customers and lowering the amount of money needed to open one of its robo-adviser accounts, as firms across the industry bow to pressure to reduce fees and account minimums.
The move means that people with as little as $500 can open a You Invest Portfolios account, and Chase customers who have at least $15,000 in their checking accounts or meet other key metrics can trade for free online and on the mobile app.
Kelli Keough, global head of digital wealth management at JPMorgan, said the bank lowered the barriers because it wants more Chase banking clients to be Chase investment clients.
It also comes about two months after the largest U.S. online brokerage,  Charles Schwab  Corp (K:SCHW), eliminated commissions and fees for most online trades.
Schwab is reportedly exploring a merger with rival TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD) in a bid to gain scale and more clients to support its new zero-commission business model.
You Invest Portfolios, which launched in July, previously required investors to have at least $2,500.
You Invest Trade, which launched in 2018, previously offered free unlimited trades only to sapphire banking customers, who keep at least $75,000 in their accounts, and Chase private client customers, who keep at least $250,000. Private bank and securities division clients were also eligible for free trades.
Premier plus checking clients received 100 free trades a year.
Starting on Monday, Chase customers with premier plus can place unlimited free online stock, ETF and options trades. Anyone else who opens a new You Invest Trade account will get unlimited free trades for one year.
""We've been seeing a nice uptake from our Chase client base - mostly younger and first-time investors,"" Keough said by phone.
On average, she said, You Invest Trade investors are over 15 years younger than clients of other investing divisions at the bank.
The bank declined to provide data on assets under management or number of clients for You Invest."
1084,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 05:23PM ET</span>","Stocks: S&P, Dow Slip as Trade Worries Drag On","Investing.com – The U.S.-China trade negotiations continued to hover over U.S. stocks, sending the major averages modestly lower on the day.
The S&P 500 and the Dow were each off about 0.2%, and the NASDAQ Composite slipped 0.24%, and the Nasdaq 100 index dropped 0.22%.
It was the third loss in a row for both the Dow and the S&P 500 and second in a row for the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100.
The Dow's three-day decline was its first since August. The S&P's 3-day decline was its first since September.
Going into Friday, all four indexes are down for the week. A weekly loss for the Dow would be its first after rising for four weeks. The S&P would see its first loss after six weeks of gains, and the Nasdaq's streak of seven weekly gains is threatened.
 
That the index changes on Thursday were so similar suggests that most of the buying and selling was being generated by computer algorithms and that many investors are waiting for a trade deal to get done.
This week's declines are not big. The S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are still trading within 1.2% of their all-time highs, but they have run into resistance this week. That could make stocks vulnerable to profit-taking.
The Dow ended the day with 15 stocks up and 15 stocks down.
The best news for investors was another gain for energy stocks, which were the best-performing S&P 500 sector of the market by far, rising 1.5% as oil prices moved more than 2.5% higher.   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) topped the Dow stocks with a 2.4% gain.
Pushing energy shares higher, according to Investing.com columnist Barani Krishnan, is Saudi Arabian moves to keep oil prices up ahead of the pricing for the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant. Aramco is expected to price its offering next month.
West Texas Intermediate crude rose $1.57 to $58.58 in New York and is up more than 5% since Tuesday. 
Tech stocks were the laggards, with chips hardest hit because of worries about the uncertainty surrounding the U.S.-China trade negotiations. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Visa (NYSE:V) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) also weighed on the market.
A bullish economic signal was a report that existing home sales rose more than expected in October. The National Association of Realtors said lower mortgage rates and tight supplies drove sales up by their highest rate in two years.
Only three of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher: energy, communications services and health care. The weakest were real estate, consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks.
L Brands (NYSE:LB), parent of The Limited;   Charles Schwab   (NYSE:SCHW),   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN) and   Noble Energy   (NYSE:NBL) were the top S&P 500 performers on the day.

Gap replaced longtime Chief Executive Officer Art Peck with Robert Fisher, a member of the founding family, as its interim head nearly two weeks ago and cut its full-year profit forecast, blaming weak traffic and operating challenges across key brands. 
""We continue to make progress against our separation plans, which will provide improved focus and a further catalyst for transformation,"" said Fisher.

""We are not pleased with the third quarter results and are focused on aggressively addressing the operational issues that are hindering the performance of our brands,"" Fisher said. 
The retailer in February said it would separate its better-performing Old Navy brand, giving investors hopes that the standalone company would be able to show better results than the Gap brand.

1. Manufacturing, Services, Consumer Data in Focus
The economic calendar on Friday includes manufacturing, services and consumer data that will likely offer clues on whether fears that fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth is set to slow have been misplaced.
IHS Markit will release its reading on November U.S. manufacturing and services PMIs at 08.30 ET (13:30 GMT).
The manufacturing PMI is forecast to inch higher to reading of 51.5 in November from 51.3 last month and the services to 51 from 50.6.
With the crucial holiday season just around the corner, the University of Michigan’s final results of its November consumer sentiment survey will likely draw added attention at a time when some fear last month’s fall in retail sales points to a slowdown in consumer spending.
The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, due at 10:00 a.m. ET is forecast to show a final reading of 95.7, up slightly from the previous reading of 95.5, while consumer expectations data will also be in focus.
2.Oil Rig Count Rolls In
The latest rig count data due Friday will be closely watched to gauge whether there has been any change in sentiment on drilling activity follow four-straight weekly declines.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 10 to 674. The count is off 24% from a year ago.
The continued decline in rig counts come as the low-price energy has deterred dented spending on exploration and production activity.
Still, U.S. production remains at a record 12.8 million barrels a day, the EIA reported earlier this week.
Crude oil rose 2.8% Thursday to settle at $58.58 a barrel.
3. Footlocker, JM Smucker Earnings Due
  Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) is set to release its third-quarter numbers before the opening bell.
The footwear retailer’s results are expected to receive a boost from the launch of new products from brands such as Jordan, YEEZY and   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) in the second half of year.
But Wall Street appears somewhat divided on whether new product offerings can boost same-store-sales growth to match guidance.
“The first half 2019 same-store sales increase of 2.8% means that  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) will have to produce second-half same-store sales of at least 4.3% growth just to get to the lowest end of the mid-single-digit increase for fiscal 2019,” Susquehanna said in a recent note.
Wedbush, however, has more faith in the potential boost from the product launches, forecasting Footlocker to generate same-store-sales growth of 4.9%, above Wall Street consensus of 4.8%.
 Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) is expected to report earnings of $1.07 on revenue of $1.94 billion. A year ago, the company earned 95 cents a share on $1.86 billion in sales.
Shares are down 22% this year.
JM Smucker (NYSE:SJM), meanwhile, is expected to earn $2.13 a share on revenue of $1.97 billion in its fiscal-second quarter. A year ago, JM Smucker earned $2.17 a share on revenue of $2.02 billion.
The food manufacturer has had a tough start to its fiscal year as falling peanut and coffee commodity prices have forced it to lower prices on its coffee and peanut products, keeping a lid on margins.
Its pet-food business has also seen margins compress as competition heats up.
“We did not fully anticipate how broad and aggressive some of the pricing actions would be on trial sizes,” for premium dog-food products, CEO Mark Smucker said during the company's fiscal-first-quarter conference call.
Smucker guided adjusted earnings per share for the full year in the range of $8.35 to $8.55, down 10 cents, and sales were forecast to be flat to down 1%, compared with a previous guidance of up 1% to 2%. Shares are up 11.4% on the year."

But China still invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources.
This was a day after stocks sold off on a report that a phase 1 U.S.-China deal was not likely to happen this year. As a result, investors were wary of putting further bets on a trade deal and keeping in mind that stocks are still near record highs.
""The fulcrum of this optimism see-saw is the prospects for the phase 1 trade agreement. Investors are pulling petals from a daisy saying, 'It'll happen this year, it won't,'"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
""They are basically saying 'We've pushed this as far as we can.' Valuations appear stretched at 18.5 times forward earnings compared with the 20-year average forward P/E Of 16.5,"" he said.

While the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits was unexpectedly unchanged at a five-month high last week, suggesting some labor market softening, U.S. home sales increased more than expected in October and house prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years amid lower mortgage rates and a supply shortage.

""This is a market in search of a catalyst,"" he said.

The Boeing-Embraer deal appears on a list dated Nov. 19 of transactions ""approved unconditionally"" that is posted to the website of the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation's anti-monopoly department.
The document gives no further details, only saying that the case was adjudicated 10 days earlier on Nov. 9.
Boeing, the world's largest planemaker, has been seeking to finalize its purchase of 80% of Embraer's commercial jet division in a bid to compete with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) in the market for planes with fewer than 150 seats.
China's approval comes as EU regulators have delayed a decision until both companies provide additional documents, which Embraer has said it is trying to do as soon as possible.
The companies originally said they expected to close the deal this year."

(Reuters) - Louis Moore Bacon, the billionaire hedge fund manager whose macroeconomic bets on currencies, interest rates and other securities earned his Moore Capital Management LP double-digit returns over 30 years, will stop investing for outside clients, according to a letter sent to investors on Thursday.
""Although this has not been an easy decision,"" Bacon wrote in the letter seen by Reuters, ""it will allow me the space to step away for significant periods of time when my other interests abound without the ongoing weight and responsibility of looking after public investors' capital.""
A spokesman for Moore verified that the letter was authentic but declined further comment.
The Financial Times had previously reported the development, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. 
After returning outside capital, the New York-based firm will continue to invest on behalf of Bacon, whose net worth was valued at $1.5 billion by Forbes, and other Moore principals, according to the letter.
Bacon, 63, acknowledged ""disappointing results"" for his main funds in recent years amid ""challenging trading conditions"" for his core strategy based on ""macro"" movements of currencies, interest rates and other securities globally. 
He also noted that competition for talent and pressure to lower fees had ""led to a challenging business model"" for funds like Moore. 
Moore is not alone. Raising and keeping capital and finding lucrative investment opportunities has become increasingly difficult for hedge funds this decade, amid fierce competition and central bank-fueled stock market gains. That environment have prompted a number of prominent fund managers, including Highfields Capital to Hoplite Capital, to shut.
Moore's main funds have returned low single-digits so far this year, according to the letter. Other global macro hedge funds have gained 5.33% in 2019, according to Hedge Fund Research, after low single-digit returns in 2016 and 2017 and a 4% loss in 2018. 
Despite recent setbacks, Bacon said he was proud of his long-term record of annualized returns of 17.6% and 15%, net of fees, for his main Remington and Moore Global Investors funds. 
Bacon wrote that the funds from which he was returning capital will have cumulatively paid out around $19 billion to investors, a massive sum that few hedge fund firms can match.
Moore managed $8.9 billion as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing, down from about $14 billion in 2010. The current percentage of outside capital was unclear.
'ONE OF THE GIANTS' 
Bacon, who founded Moore in 1989, has long been considered a legend among macro traders, along with billionaires Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and George Soros. Soros and Druckenmiller also returned outside capital earlier this decade.
""Louis Bacon will go down as one of the giants of our industry. He was one of the earlier innovators in the genre of Global Macro,"" Druckenmiller said in a statement to Reuters on Thursday. ""To not only survive, but thrive in our industry for 30 years is an outstanding achievement.""
Added hedge fund pioneer Julian Robertson: ""The hedge fund industry is losing one of its brightest stars.""
On Wall Street, Bacon is known to value order and efficiency. He has a reputation for quickly getting out of losing trades and keeping mum about his strategies. 
Bacon, originally from Raleigh, North Carolina, got his start in the 1980s as a clerk on the New York coffee, cocoa and sugar exchanges. He later moved to Shearson Lehman Hutton as a futures broker, where he got business from big names including Soros, whose global-macro investing style he adopted for Moore.
More recently, Bacon has helped a number of his investment staff manage their own funds. He plans to continue to launch in-house funds by Moore's best performing portfolio managers, the letter said.
Bacon is known as an environmental conservationist. He helped found clean water group Waterkeeper Alliance and has protected more than 210,000 acres (84,984 hectares) of land, according to his charitable foundation.
""This privatization,"" Bacon wrote, ""will allow me more personal time for a large family, philanthropic pursuits and to continue to develop a number of sports oriented properties - all with the flexibility to 'stay in the picture' or not as things develop.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) first electric pickup truck model will go on sale in the fall of 2021, the company's top executive said, around the same time that electric carmaker Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) own model is expected to debut.
""General Motors understands truck buyers and ... people who are new coming into the truck market,"" Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said at an investor conference in New York on Thursday. ""It will be a very capable truck, I'm pretty excited about it.""
The No. 1 U.S. automaker has so far given few details on its planned line of electric pickup trucks. 
Reuters reported last month that GM plans to build a new family of premium electric pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant beginning in late 2021, possibly reviving the imposing Hummer brand on some of them.
Until now, the automaker had not given a date for when its first electric pickup truck would hit the market.
Pickup trucks are one of the most profitable vehicle segments in the world. The U.S. market is dominated by GM,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU).
Ford also intends to sell an electric F-series pickup truck in late 2021, sources familiar with the plans have said.
GM's Barra spoke on the same day that Tesla was expected to give details about its long-anticipated pickup truck model.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company wants to add a pickup to its growing family of premium electric vehicles, but has not provided a specific timetable. Last month, Musk described the Tesla pickup as ""closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future."" 
Analysts have said they expect the Tesla pickup to debut in late 2021 or early 2022.
Separately, startup Lordstown Motors Corp said on Thursday it is now accepting pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, the Endurance, for $52,500 before tax credits.
The truck is due to go on sale in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
The company, which is 10% owned by Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS), recently bought GM's shuttered Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio.

Lordstown Motors said its initial focus will be to sell to corporate fleets, but the Endurance will also be available to consumers.

WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - Drugmaker Insys Therapeutics Inc outlined a deal on Thursday to divide its dwindling cash among governments, insurers, hospitals and individuals who accused the company of fueling the U.S. opioid crisis.
The company was largely adopting a plan it had filed in September, which now had the support of numerous groups that initially opposed it, said Brenda Funk, who represents the company, at Thursday's hearing before a U.S. bankruptcy judge Kevin Gross in Delaware.
The agreement addresses a problem that looms over the thousands of U.S. opioid lawsuits against some of the biggest drug companies - how to carve up the tens of billions of dollars from legal settlements among the plaintiffs.
The Insys agreement established the company owed various parties a combined $1 billion, well below the billions of dollars that could have been claimed. In addition, the Department of Justice would have a claim of $243 million, along with undetermined claims for forfeiture and restitution.
""I think this compromise is sufficiently bad for everyone, but everyone should go along with it,"" said Andrew Troop, who represents New York.
Most will get pennies on the dollar. Chandler, Arizona-based Insys has only $39 million in cash, according to filings.
Insys also has estimated it could receive $60 million from an agreement to sell its fentanyl spray Subsys, $56 million from insurance and funds from lawsuits.
John Kapoor, the founder and former billionaire, would seem a likely legal target. He was found guilty of conspiracy to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys and misleading insurers.
However, federal prosecutors have said they plan to seek $242 million in restitution from Kapoor. His lawyers say that demand exceeds his personal wealth. Kapoor also faces up to 20 years in prison.
Insys filed for bankruptcy in June just days after the company struck a $225 million settlement with the Justice Department that included an agreement by a subsidiary to plead guilty to fraud.
Insys, like numerous makers or distributors of opioids, also faced lawsuits by state attorneys general, local governments, health insurers, hospitals, guardians for children harmed by exposure to opioids in the womb and classes of individuals.
The opioid crisis has contributed to more than 400,000 U.S. deaths since 1997.
In September, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP also filed for bankruptcy and has proposed to settle its lawsuits for what it says is $10 billion. The judge overseeing that bankruptcy has warned the parties about fighting over the proceeds."

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Consumer goods giants  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and Henkel (DE:HNKG_p) and a series of buyout funds including Advent and Cinven are talking to U.S. cosmetics maker Coty (N:COTY) to submit bids for some of its most popular beauty brands, three sources told Reuters.
Coty, which has a market value of $9 billion and is majority owned by German conglomerate JAB Holdings, is expected to kick off an auction process in December to find a new owner for a portfolio of professional hair and nail care brands, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The portfolio, which includes Wella, Clairol, GHD and OPI among others, is worth up to $7 billion and has drawn interest from both industry players and financial investors, they said.
Colgate-Palmolive Co (N:CL) is among a number of consumer companies looking at add-on deals to grow their skin care units, the sources said.
New York-based Colgate Palmolive, which recently bought the skin care unit of France's Laboratoires Filorga Cosmétiques for 1.5 billion euros ($1.66 billion), is expected to enter the race for Coty's brands, facing competition from rivals Unilever and Henkel as well as heavyweight investment funds, the sources said.
The list of financial sponsors includes Advent, Blackstone (N:BX), KKR (N:KKR), CVC Capital Partners and BC Partners, they said.
One of the sources said Cinven was examining a possible joint bid for the brands.
Coty, Henkel, Colgate-Palmolive, Cinven, Advent, CVC and BC Partners declined to comment, while Unilever, Blackstone and KKR were not immediately available for comment.
Coty aims to complete the sale, which was announced last month, by the middle of 2020 and has hired  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to handle discussions with prospective bidders.
Confidential information packages are expected to be dispatched in December with a view to receiving non-binding offers early next year, the sources said.
Bankers advising the prospective bidders estimate the portfolio could fetch 10 to 12 times its core earnings of roughly $600 million, giving it a valuation of $6 to $7 billion, the sources said.
Coty's professional beauty unit, which primarily sells hair and nail care products to salons, accounts for about 21% of its total revenue, with annual sales of about $1.81 billion.
The unit, however, has seen falling sales in the last four quarters, prompting Coty's decision to reduce its exposure to the professional segment.
Coty also owns other cosmetic brands such as Rimmel and Max Factor as well as skin care firms Lancaster and Philosophy but has struggled for years to integrate such a wide range of products.
Its 2016 purchase of a slice of Procter & Gamble's (N:PG) beauty business, which included Covergirl and Max Factor, forced it to take billions of dollars in write-downs and outline a four-year restructuring plan.
Its debt load stood at $7.7 billion at the end of June.
Coty's boss Pierre Laubies said in October the sale would improve the company's ability to invest in areas with significant growth potential, but added that proceeds from any deal would be used to pay down debt and return excess cash to shareholders.

Declines slightly outnumbered gains on the S&P 500 Index. The dollar held steady and Treasuries dipped as China’s chief trade negotiator reportedly said he was “cautiously optimistic” about reaching a phase-one accord. Pessimists focused on speculation Donald Trump may sign legislation backing Hong Kong protesters, setting up further conflict between the nations. TD Ameritrade soared on reports that  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. is in talks to buy the brokerage.
Hong Kong’s deteriorating situation may prove crucial to the trade talks, and on Thursday a commentary from China’s state-run news agency accused the U.S. of applying a double standard. China has threatened to retaliate for the passage of the American bill and said supporting the protesters was a “gross” interference in Hong Kong affairs. With stocks still within 1% of a record high, traders will be watching for signs of progress ahead of a Dec. 15 deadline for further tariffs.
“Investors now are starting to worry again that we may not see that phase one in 2019,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “It’s going to be tough to have the next leg up without a trade deal.”

HP on Sunday rejected Xerox's offer of $22 per share, saying it undervalued the company, and that it was open to exploring its own bid for the U.S. printer maker.
""We are confused by this reasoning in that your own financial adviser, Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS), set a $14 price target with a 'sell' rating for HP's stock after you announced your restructuring plan,"" Xerox wrote in its letter to HP. 
The median price target on HP stock by 15 analysts is $20.
HP did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
""Unless you and we agree on mutual confirmatory due diligence to support a friendly combination by Nov. 25, Xerox will take its compelling case to create superior value for our respective shareholders directly to your shareholders,"" the company said in the letter. 
HP said on Sunday that, under Xerox's proposed terms, the combined company would be saddled with ""outsized debt"".
However, HP left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer of Xerox, and said it can evaluate the merits by accessing diligence information on Xerox.
Xerox on Thursday said it has accepted HP's request for due diligence, but that HP had refused to open its books to Xerox.
""Any friendly process for a combination of this type requires mutual diligence - your proposal for one-way diligence is an unnecessary delay tactic,"" Xerox wrote. 
Many analysts have said there is merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.
""Xerox's move could force HP to propose a higher acquisition price that would benefit HP shareholders, or potentially turn the tables and have HP look to acquire Xerox,"" Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said. 
Activist investor Carl Icahn, who took over Xerox's board last year with fellow businessman Darwin Deason, told the Wall Street Journal last week that he was not set on a particular structure for a deal with HP, as long as a combination is achieved. Icahn has a 4% stake in HP.

Xerox made the offer to HP, a company more than three times its size, on Nov. 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901) that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Firefly Value Partners on Thursday asked Gulfport Energy for a seat on its board and criticized the ""half-measures"" which the U.S. gas exploration and production company is taking to improve its financial performance.
On Monday, Oklahoma City-based Gulfport announced job cuts, board changes and an end to its share buyback program to focus on debt repurchases, to help reverse a more than 65% slide in its share price over the last 12 months.
But Monday's proposals failed to captivate investors who pushed the stock down further.
By Thursday, the New York-based hedge fund fired off a letter to the board in which it blamed the current directors for the company's failures and said these people could not be entrusted to ""clean up the mess they have made.""
""That is why we are asking that the board immediately fill one of the new director vacancies with a Firefly principal as a shareholder representative,"" the letter said.
Gulfport had said on Monday that Chairman David Houston would not stand for reelection next year, while two other directors - Craig Groeschel and Scott Streller - would step down from Gulfport's board by the end of this year.
Responding to Firefly's letter, a Gulfport spokesperson said its announced changes reflected the collective input from a number of large stakeholders in the business.
""While we disagree with Firefly’s demands for additional share repurchases at this time, we have repeatedly invited them to provide criteria and/or resumes for qualified new director candidates, which they have declined to do.""
The standoff between Gulfport and Firefly has been dragging on for nearly a year, ever since the two sides started private negotiations late last year.
In January, there was a brief public skirmish when Firefly pushed for a share buyback to boost the share price, with Gulfport announcing soon after a repurchase program - albeit smaller than requested by the hedge fund.
Firefly said in March it would not challenge the company after the buyback announcement and, until this week, things had been quiet. Now, Firefly insists nothing has been done to satisfy the need for a shareholder perspective in the boardroom. 
""In the middle of our most recent private discussions, instead of engaging with us in good faith to add true shareholder representation and necessary skills to the board, the company rushed out a press release with vague commitments on board refreshment,"" Firefly's letter said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A possible purchase by brokerage giant  Charles Schwab  Corp. (N:SCHW) of rival TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD) reflects a more relaxed mood under Trump administration regulators, which has helped unleash other big-ticket takeovers in the financial sector, analysts said.
CNBC and Fox Business reported on Wednesday that the two brokerages were in talks to ink a merger that Fox said could be valued at $26 billion. The companies did not respond on Thursday to Reuters requests for comment.
Regulatory filings show the U.S. Federal Reserve has partial oversight over both firms and may need to approve the deal, depending on how it is structured. The Fed declined to comment.
The regulatory path, however, looks smooth despite potential protests from Democratic lawmakers, who worry that the creation of more financial behemoths increases systemic risks.
""We could see some policymakers question the resulting company's growth in assets under management, but my sense is that overall interest in the deal will be low in Washington,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading.
Just two days ago the Fed approved the $28 billion marriage of BB&T Corp (N:BBT) and SunTrust (N:STI), quickly sealing the biggest bank tie-up since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. In March, the Fed approved U.S. regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp's (O:FITB) purchase of smaller rival MB Financial Inc for $4.7 billion.
Last December, the Fed quickly approved two of the largest bank mergers of the year, Cadence Bancorp’s merger with State Bank Financial Corporation and Synovus Financial Corp’s merger with FCB Financial Holdings.
Those deals were made possible by Congress' move last year to ease post-crisis financial rules and by the Fed's more relaxed attitude toward tie-ups under Trump-appointed officials.
Banking deals in particular had languished after the financial crisis as strict capital and liquidity rules were imposed on lenders with more than $50 billion in assets, making it unattractive for mid-size firms to acquire more assets. Regulators had also aggressively enforced rules that allow them to bar firms with compliance issues from expanding.
The number of U.S. bank deals fell in each of the four years to 2018, dropping 23 percent between 2014 and 2017, according to Reuters, even while overall M&A activity was rising each year.
Over the past few years, the Fed has expedited approvals for high-profile deals that tend to attract public and industry scrutiny. The approval period fell from an average of 297 days in 2015 to 135 during the first half of 2019, Fed data shows.
The central bank has also taken a more flexible approach on compliance issues, according to Fed officials and lawyers.
In the case of BB&T & SunTrust, for example, the Fed approved the deal in just nine months despite discovering some unfair and deceptive practices in SunTrust's business customer division. By contrast, it took M&T Bank (N:MTB) more than three years to complete its 2015 tie-up with Hudson City Bancorp after the Fed found problems with M&T's compliance systems.
Securities lawyers said it was also unlikely the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees brokers and has also been easing rules under Trump officials, would stand in the way of an Schwab-TD Ameritrade deal, although it might scrutinize the types of fees and services the new company provides.
""There is always going to be scrutiny, but I think we’re going to see folks say, 'OK, let's do it',"" said Alois Pirker, director of research for wealth management at Aite Group.
The SEC did not respond to a request for comment."
1102,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 01:57PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon aims to sell $25 billion of assets to focus on mega-projects - sources,"By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) plans to sell up to $25 billion of oil and gas fields in Europe, Asia and Africa in its biggest asset sales for decades, seeking to free up cash to focus on a handful of mega-projects, according to three banking sources.
The sell-off would be a marked acceleration of the U.S. oil major's previous divestment plans. It would represent an ambitious attempt by Chief Executive Darren Woods to catch up with competitors who carried out sweeping portfolio reviews and sold swathes of assets following the 2014 market crash.
Exxon's shares have underperformed its major rivals' in recent years. The disposals would help the company increase spending on new developments and appease investors unhappy with weak cash generation and oil output, which flatlined under Woods' predecessor Rex Tillerson.
The sales would see Exxon effectively quit its upstream oil and gas business in Europe, according to the three banking sources with direct knowledge of the plans. They would free up cash to invest in new developments in Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Brazil and the United States. 
An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on specific assets offered for sale but noted it has told Wall Street its asset sales could reach $25 billion through 2025.
Shares in the world's top listed energy company rose following the Reuters report and were up 1.5% at 1816 GMT.
In recent months, the Texas-based company has drawn up an extensive list of assets that it wants to divest, spanning at least 11 countries, the sources said. 
The list, details of which have not been previously reported, would easily exceed its current divestment target which envisages it selling about $15 billion of assets by 2021. 
Exxon has struck a number of deals in recent months including a $4.5 billion exit from Norway, and is also already offering assets in Australia, Nigeria, Malaysia.
The expanded plan will see Exxon also sell out of operations in the British North Sea, Germany and Romania, according to the sources. In Europe, that would leave it with production only in the Netherlands, where it holds a stake with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) in the giant Groningen gas field which the government plans to shut down in 2022.
The new plan would also see Exxon significantly pare back operations in Southeast Asia with the sale of its assets in Indonesia and Malaysia, the sources said.
In Africa, Exxon wants to sell its operations in Chad, Equatorial Guinea as well as parts of its Nigerian assets.
While Exxon is set to ramp up its spending sharply in the coming years to develop new oil and gas projects, most of its peers have more cautious spending plans due to an uncertain outlook for oil prices and growing pressure from investors to diversify away from fossil fuels toward renewables.
For a factbox on the asset sales
INVESTOR PRESSURE
Exxon responded more slowly to the 2014 oil price crash than some of its rivals that sharply cut spending, putting it under pressure from shareholders to reduce costs. 
Exxon's shares heavily underperformed relative to other Oil Majors over the past five years.
https://tmsnrt.rs/2LsEuoy
Unlike rivals such as Shell and  BP  (LON:BP), Exxon did not carry out major review of its portfolio in recent decades. BP sold over $65 billion of assets following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico while Shell sold over $30 billion after acquiring rival BG Group in 2016.
Under Woods, Exxon is set to sharply increase its spending in the coming years as it launches new, large oil and gas developments. In its 2019 investor day, the company said it planned to boost its annual capital spending from $26 billion in 2018 to $30-$35 billion between 2021 and 2025.
Building up its coffers via asset sales could help allay concerns that Exxon will ramp up its debt levels to fund new projects, particularly with oil prices remaining stubbornly close to $60 a barrel.
Moody's Investor Service on Tuesday changed Exxon's outlook to negative from stable due to its negative free cash flow and anticipated use of debt to fund its future capital spending.
Moody's has forecast negative free cash flow of about $7 billion this year and $9 billion next year. It warned the company's debt rating could be lowered next year if Exxon's financial metrics weaken further. 
By contrast, Exxon's biggest rival Shell has generated $21 billion in free cash flows so far this year and the figure is expected to rise further in the fourth quarter.

""The company's high level of growth capital investments cannot be funded with operating cash flow and asset sales at projected levels given ExxonMobil's substantial dividend payout, absent meaningfully higher commodity prices and earnings from downstream and chemicals,"" Moody's said.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 01:48PM ET</span>","U.S. vaping-related deaths rise to 47, cases of illness to 2,290","(Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Thursday reported 2,290 confirmed and probable cases and 5 more deaths from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, taking the total death toll to 47 so far this year.
Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded 2,172 cases and 42 deaths from the illness.
U.S. officials recently said vitamin E acetate — believed to be used as a cutting agent in illicit vaping products containing marijuana components — was found in all lung samples from 29 patients who were tested.
CDC has called vitamin E acetate a ""chemical of concern"" and recommended not adding it to e-cigarettes, or vaping products, while the investigation is underway. 
Investigators had earlier pointed to vaping oils containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, as being especially risky.
The spate of serious respiratory illnesses has led to U.S. officials urging people to stop vaping, especially those products containing THC.
As of Nov. 20, confirmed deaths were reported in 25 states and the District of Columbia, the CDC said. Louisiana became the newest state to report a death from the illness. 
The highest number of deaths were from Illinois, which has so far reported 5 deaths and 187 illnesses. 
The Trump administration announced a plan in September to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves, as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.
President Donald Trump will host a meeting on vaping at the White House on Friday with a range of groups, including industry and public health representatives, a White House spokesman said on Wednesday.

1104,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",StockBeat: AMD Slumps on Downgrade as Analyst Warns of Profit-Taking Ahead,"Investing.com - Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has racked up impressive gains this year. Before Thursday, shares were up more than 120%. But one Wall Street analyst downgraded AMD Thursday and warned that investors are likely to cash in on the chipmaker's rally in the year ahead.
AMD shares were down more than 4% Thursday afternoon after Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard downgraded Advance Micro Devices to market perform from outperform.
Richard said shares of AMD will likely continue to ""melt up"" for the rest of the year, but he cautioned against chasing the rally on expectations that profit-taking will occur in the year ahead.
AMD’s big move higher in 2019 has been helped by market-share gains in the PC and server market, particularly at the lower end of the CPU market in the absence of competition from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
In 2018, Intel decided to de-prioritize shipments of low-end CPUs after surging activity in its data center-related businesses weighed on its ability to churn out processors.
Intel's CPU shortages are expected to continue into 2020. The company recently conceded that sustained market growth in PCs in 2019 has outpaced its efforts to ramp-up CPU supply.
AMD’s unit share is now about 18% in desktop computers, 15% in notebooks and 5% in servers, Richard estimated, though he cautioned that the chipmaker is unlikely to keep up the pace of market-share gains.
“Due to Intel’s incumbency, share gains will come more slowly in all of these markets the more AMD’s market share expands,” Richard added.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares were up 0.3% Thursday afternoon."

(Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union international executive board will meet to name a new president, the union said on Thursday, a day after the previous president resigned following 17 months in office, but union officials said a date for the meeting had not been set.
The UAW confirmed that Gary Jones had resigned on Wednesday, as the union moved to remove him office and as U.S. prosecutors were widening a criminal investigation into illegal payoffs that so far has seen 10 people plead guilty.
Jones' lawyer Bruce Maffeo told Reuters in a statement Thursday that Jones believed ""that his continuing to serve will only distract the union from its core mission to improve the lives of its members and their families."" 
Separately, a union spokesman confirmed that acting UAW president Rory Gamble has named another union official, Jimmie Williams (NYSE:WMB), as his new chief of staff after Jones' previous chief of staff was assigned to new duties in the president's office.
The union constitution calls for its international executive board to meet and vote on a new president. A UAW spokesman said a date has not yet been set for the meeting.
Earlier on Wednesday the union filed charges under its bylaws against Jones, who had taken a paid leave of absence in early November, accusing him of ""false, misleading and inaccurate expense records.""
In late October, another UAW official was charged with embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars in an alleged scheme that a person familiar with the case told Reuters involved Jones.
In documents released Thursday, the UAW leadership said ""Jones has demonstrated he should be removed from office and expelled from membership.""
The union also filed similar charges against UAW board member Vance Pearson, who was charged in September with conspiring to embezzle union funds.

An attorney for Pearson, N. Scott Rosenblum, did not comment. The union charges against Pearson are still pending.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 12:28PM ET</span>",Charles Schwab in talks to buy smaller rival TD Ameritrade: CNBC,"By Tamara Mathias and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW), the largest discount broker in the U.S. financial world, is in talks to buy rival TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD), CNBC reported on Thursday, as profits in the industry come under pressure from a shift to zero commission.
CNBC did not provide any financial detail on the deal, but Fox Business pegged the value at $26 billion, citing sources. At that price, it would be a premium of roughly 18% to Ameritrade's market capitalization.
Shares of TD Ameritrade surged more than 26% to $52.54 in trading before the bell. Charles Schwab shares jumped 15% to $51.79. 
Neither companies responded to Reuters' requests for comment.
Pressure on the discount broker business model has been rising in recent years, as the increased use of technology required huge spends on platforms but also undermined the fees charged to administer equity trades.
With disruptors such as Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood Markets Inc rapidly gaining market share by eliminating stock trading commissions, this pushed the large brokers to do the same: Schwab was first last month, covering online trading of stocks, ETFs and options, with others such as Fidelity Investments, E*Trade Financial Corp (O:ETFC) and TD Ameritrade also acting.
Earning less cash from trading has placed increased focus on other areas such firms can make money, in particular managing the pool of customer assets which these firms control.
Schwab earned about half of its more than $10 billion in revenue in 2018 from interest earned. 
The combined company would have assets of around $5 trillion, according to Reuters calculations. 
The three interest rate cuts seen this year make income from investing customer balances less profitable, and negative interest rates would further impact this. 
""This is largely about scale,"" Argus Research analyst Stephen Biggar said. ""I believe a merger could present substantial cost synergies.""
ANTITRUST
While a potential deal could give Schwab an edge in the price war, it remains to be seen whether creating such a dominant player within the discount broker world would avoid scrutiny from antitrust regulators.
Under the Trump administration, oversight bodies have been more willing to approve big financial mergers: this week, the U.S. Federal Reserve cleared BB&T Corp (N:BBT) and SunTrust Banks Inc (N:STI) to combine, in the largest bank merger since the global financial crisis.
However, while there are still thousands of banks in the United States, the discount broker space is much more consolidated: for example, the combined company would have approximately 65% to 70% of RIA custody assets, according to a research note from KBW.
The timing of the transaction, so soon after the elimination of online trading fees by Schwab, could also raise questions about predatory pricing moves.
""Because Schwab just cut commissions to zero, then bid for their most hindered competitor, that could lead to legal challenges and will likely draw anti-competitive scrutiny,"" UBS analysts wrote in a research note.
The combined company is expected to be led by Schwab's Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger, according to CNBC.
This would solve TD Ameritrade's leadership quandary: CEO Tim Hockey is due to step down in February, and no replacement had been named.

The deal could also force E*Trade, the third largest discount broker, to look for possible acquisitions. Shares of E*Trade were down nearly 5% following the CNBC report.

The bill, which was passed 24 to 10 in the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, sent shares of Canopy Growth (TO:WEED),  Aurora Cannabis  (TO:ACB),  Aphria Inc  (TO:APHA) and  Tilray Inc  (O:TLRY) up between 8% and 15%.
""We think federal legalization would be a big positive for investor sentiment surrounding cannabis equities, which have been battered by oversupply and a steep price decline for the underlying commodity since becoming legal in Canada,"" said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.
The approval comes two months after the House passed a bill to advance legislation that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in states where it is legal.
The latest bill, which has more than 50 co-sponsors, enables states to set their own policies while allowing to expunge federal marijuana convictions and arrests.
Additionally, the bill will authorize a 5% federal sales tax on marijuana products that are manufactured in or imported into the United States.
However, analysts were skeptical about the future of the bill.
""It's such an early step in a long process that there are no near-term implications for cannabis stocks. The Senate isn't likely to approve it, even if the House were to do so,"" said Alan Brochstein, managing partner at New Cannabis Ventures.
Shares in the sector are down more than 25% this year, according to the alternative harvest ETF (P:MJ), which tracks cannabis-related stocks, taking a blow from a slow roll out of retail stores and oversupply in Canada, as well as uncertainties related to U.S. regulations.
Weed companies have been spending heavily to expand and strike partnerships in the United States, banking on more states legalizing cannabis for both recreational and medical use.
Currently, 11 U.S. states have legalized marijuana for recreational use, while 33 states have approved it for medical purposes."

(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) cut its annual profit forecast for the second time this year on Thursday, as the department store operator blamed weak international tourism, warm weather and sluggish mall traffic for the first drop in same-store sales in two years.
Shares fell 3% in morning trading. The company was the second major department store to cut its earnings outlook ahead of the critical holiday sales season. Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) did as well, citing weak apparel sales.
""The sales deceleration was steeper than we expected,"" Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said in a statement.
Even so, he told investors Macy's is positioned for a strong holiday season, citing an expanded assortment of gifts, improved customer service and more flexible pickup or delivery options. 
Department stores and apparel retailers are struggling to lure shoppers to malls and away from big-box retailers like  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and online giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Target on Wednesday posted another set of strong sales numbers and raised its full-year forecast, driven by demand for its apparel.
Comparable sales at Macy's owned and licensed stores fell 3.5% in the third quarter ended Nov. 2, as warm weather hurt demand for coats and sweaters. Analysts had expected a 1% decrease, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
A drop in international tourists, some of Macy's biggest spenders, also hit sales. The 161-year-old, Cincinnati-based retailer also experienced some issues with its website ""in preparation for the fourth quarter,"" it said.
Some analysts remain skeptical about Macy's and other department stores' prospects for the holiday season, a period that can be make-or-break for retailers.
""We expect a very competitive and difficult holiday quarter for the department store segment,"" largely due to steep promotions and discounts to drive traffic into stores and to digital, said research firm Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins. 
Many of the top gift ideas are electronic gadgets which Macy's does not sell, Perkins said.
Thanksgiving, the traditional kickoff of the U.S. holiday shopping period, falls on Nov. 28 this year, a week later than last year's Nov. 22, leaving retailers with six fewer days to make sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day.
The largest U.S. department store operator, which has closed more than 100 stores since 2015 and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic plummeted, has completed a revamp of about 150 stores with refreshed interiors. It has also expanded off-price ""Backstage"" departments into more stores. 
It has also upgraded its website and worked to clear excess inventory, he added.
Mattresses, fragrances, dresses, and fine jewelry performed well during the reported quarter, the retailer said, while men's and women's sportswear, handbags, housewares, and furniture performed poorly.
Macy's now expects 2019 adjusted profit of between $2.57 per share and $2.77 per share, compared with its previous forecast of between $2.85 and $3.05. 
It also projected full-year total comparable sales to fall between 1% and 1.5%, compared with a previous forecast of up to a 1% rise.
Adjusted net income attributable to Macy's shareholders fell to $21 million, or 7 cents per share, in the quarter, from $83 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected the company to break-even on a per share basis.

Rival  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) is set to report quarterly results later on Thursday.

1114,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 11:42AM ET</span>",How Negative Rates Can Send Bond Prices Soaring,"(Bloomberg) -- Pricing a bond that never matures is one of the more straightforward tasks in all of finance. Divide the annual interest rate by its prevailing yield and -- voilà -- price.
But if negative interest rates are really here to stay, well then, things could get crazy real quick. That, at least, is the conclusion of former Long-Term Capital Management co-founder Victor Haghani.
In a report published by his current firm, ElmPartners, Haghani and his colleague James White considered what would happen to the theoretical value of various long-term bonds if negative rates became a long-term economic feature rather than a short-term phenomenon.
For starters, take $100 worth of bonds that pay 1% in annual interest over a span of 100 years. If rates fell to -1%, the present value would soar to $200. A substantial gain for sure, but nothing the mind can’t comprehend.
OK, now stretch that maturity to 1,000 years. Instead of $200, your bonds are now worth a staggering $2.3 million.
And for bonds with no maturity date? The value suddenly races to infinity.
Of course, the authors concede no rational investor in the real world would ever pay the infinite sums that the cold, hard numbers dictate. And if predicting the course of interest rates in the next decade is a fool’s errand, trying to divine the path over millennia would seem preposterous. But if you think there’s even a remote chance sub-zero rates could persist for long periods of time, then paying what might seem like ludicrously high prices for long-term bonds, they argue, isn’t wholly without merit.
“We are not claiming that most people hold these beliefs ... but if you do (and we don’t think it’s unreasonable to do so), then you’ve got a paradox on your hands,” they wrote.
Haghani and White dubbed their thought experiment the “Perpetuity Paradox,” in a nod to the St. Petersburg Paradox, a conundrum related to probability and decision theory in economics. (For an explainer, click here.) Yet real-life parallels do exist, particularly in a world where the insatiable demand for safe assets has pushed yields on over $12 trillion of bonds below zero.
Take for example, the 3% bond issued in 1896 by the Netherlands, one of the few remaining perpetual government bonds.
That bond last traded at 330 Dutch guilders (yes, it continues to be priced in its original currency) -- nearly spot-on with the value you’d get in a simple online bond-pricing calculator if you input 1,000 years left to maturity and a market rate equal to the bond’s yield of 0.909%.
But what if you assume sub-zero rates have the power to stick around for a thousand years? Then that same Dutch bond now has a present value of over 100,000 Dutch guilders (or about $50,000).
Perhaps more realistically, consider Austria’s 100-year bond, one of the closest approximations to a modern-day sovereign perpetual bond out there.
The same bond-pricing calculator produces a price of 173 euros when you use its current yield of 0.95% as the discount rate, an indication the market expects interest rates to average about 1% over the remaining 98 or so years of the bond’s life. But assume the discount rate falls to -0.5% and then stays there, then the bond’s expected price shoots past 400 euros.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has settled more than half of some 118 cases related to the fatal crash of a Lion Air flight on a 737 MAX aircraft in October 2018, attorney Dan Webb said at a court hearing on Thursday.
Webb, a former U.S. attorney and veteran litigator, recently joined Boeing's legal team to defend the company in cases related to the Lion Air crash in Indonesia that killed all 189 on board and another deadly 737 MAX crash on a flight operated by Ethiopian Airlines five months later.
Webb said 63 or 64 of the Lion Air cases had settled or were close to settlement.
The second crash, which killed all 157 on board after nose-diving soon after take-off from Addis Ababa in March, led to a global grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and a crisis for the world's biggest planemaker.
Robert Clifford of Clifford Law Offices, which represents families of the Ethiopian crash victims, said 103 lawsuits have been filed against Boeing so far over the second crash. He said he is aware of more than 30 additional cases to be filed soon.
As of now, none of the Ethiopian Airlines lawsuits have been settled in the United States, Clifford said.
While some of the Ethiopian crash victim families are considering settlement, many are pursuing a jury trial.
Boeing is also being investigated by U.S. lawmakers, aviation and transportation authorities and is the target of a federal criminal probe.
It is also the target of lawsuits by shareholders over the drop in the stock price and by pilots over lost pay while the 737 MAX remains grounded.
Boeing has been working on fixes to software believed to have played a role in both crashes and on updated pilot training aimed at winning regulatory approval for the 737 MAX to fly again.
In its final report into the Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air crash Indonesia made recommendations to Boeing, the airline, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other agencies."

""They have it all - Money, Technology, Vision & Cook!"" Trump tweeted, without elaborating on how he expects the iPhone maker to contribute.
Apple is not known to have made any investments in 5G telecoms infrastructure to date and is yet to release a 5G device.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Trump met Cook on Wednesday during his visit to Apple's upcoming campus in Texas, in the latest sign of a close relationship between two of America's most powerful men. 
This is not the first time Trump has used his Twitter account to address Cook. In one of his latest tweets, Trump, who uses a government-issued iPhone, lamented the loss of the home button on some iPhone models because it forced users to swipe upward, rather than tap a button to unlock the phone.
5G RACE
Trump has earlier said that the United States intended to deploy 5G services rapidly and plans to cooperate with ""like-minded nations"" to promote security in next-generation 5G networks.
5G networks will offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than the current 4G networks, and serve as critical infrastructure for a range of industries.
Mobile operators have to upgrade their networks with 5G gear made by the likes of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (HK:0763), Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Finland's Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA). 
The United States has been pressing nations not to grant Huawei access to future 5G networks and alleged Huawei's equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese company has repeatedly denied.
The U.S. Congress has been considering legislation to authorize up to $1 billion for small and rural wireless providers to replace network equipment from companies such as Huawei.
Among U.S. firms, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc is the dominant player in radio chips that help mobiles connect to networks and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) that makes networking gear.
Some of Apple's rivals in the smartphone market — notably Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd — have already released 5G devices.
Apple, which is expected to release its first 5G phones in 2020, will be able to beat Samsung and Huawei to capture the top spot by the end of next year, according to research firm Strategy Analytics https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-release/devices/strategy-analytics-apple-capture-top-spot-5g-smartphones-2020. 
Many carriers that are investing heavily to build 5G networks are also likely to put their marketing efforts behind 5G phones.

1117,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>",McDonald’s Workers Sue Over ‘Daily Risk of Violence’ From Customers,"(Bloomberg) -- Current and former workers from 13 Illinois restaurants are suing McDonald’s Corp. for failing to adequately protect employees from customers who become violent.
“McDonald’s breach of duty was the in-fact and proximate cause of plaintiffs’ injuries,” according to the complaint, which was filed Thursday by 17 workers in Cook County court.
The lawsuit claims the workers “are regularly exposed to violent and criminal behavior by customers,” and that the defendants -- including McDonald’s corporation and franchisees who operate their stores -- “have been and continue to be negligent in failing to protect their workers” from a “daily risk of violence while at work.”
In response, McDonald’s said that it “takes seriously its responsibility to provide and foster a safe working environment for our employees.” The company and its franchisees “continue to make investments in training programs that uphold safe environments for customers and crew members.”
McDonald’s added it “maintains stringent policies against violence in our restaurants.”
The workers’ complaint alleges that after a customer threw a sandwich through a drive-thru window at an employee, a manager grabbed the worker’s arm to stop her from walking away. When an employee repeatedly complained about men harassing and exposing themselves to her while she was cleaning the bathroom, it says, managers told her to get a new job if she wasn’t satisfied. After a customer exposed himself to an employee and groped her in a bathroom, a manager laughed and dismissed the incident, and the man continued coming to the store and harassing her, according to the complaint.
Worker advocates say such incidents are part of a nationwide problem at the chain. In a study released in May, the National Employment Law Project counted 721 local media reports of violence at U.S. McDonald’s stores over the past three years, most of them involving guns. That count likely represents only a fraction of the incidents that occurred, according to Deborah Berkowitz, the former Occupational Safety and Health Administration chief of staff who wrote the report.
Increased Risk
Thursday’s lawsuit claims that the corporation has increased the risk of harm through choices like pushing stores to stay open late at night, a remodeling program that has stores tear down or lower counters that could have shielded workers from customers and failing to provide adequate safety and security training.
Workers in Chicago also brought a complaint in May to OSHA, and asked the federal agency to open a “systemic” investigation into McDonald’s Corp.’s handling of workplace violence throughout the U.S. OSHA declined to comment.
McDonald’s said in May that it was rolling out national workplace safety training programs at its company-owned restaurants.
That didn’t satisfy the company’s critics, who say McDonald’s requires its franchisees to adhere to detailed corporate guidelines in areas from bookkeeping to advertising, but chooses not to be equally stringent when it comes to anti-violence policies.
“McDonald’s controls everything that happens in its stores,” plaintiff Adriana Alvarez said in a statement released by the Fight For $15 and a Union, a Service Employees International Union campaign that’s been pressuring the corporation over issues including pay and sexual harassment. “But when it comes to our safety, it does nothing.”
Fight for $15 is not a named party in the suit, but is supporting it.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) employees on Thursday sued the fast food giant and several of its franchisees in Chicago over a store redesign that staffers say has made it easier for angry customers to leap over the counter and attack them.
The suit, filed in Illinois' Circuit Court of Cook County by 17 Chicago-area McDonald's workers, claims McDonald's has failed to protect them from a pattern of violence.
Employees have been threatened with guns, beaten with a wet-floor sign, had kitchen equipment thrown at them by a naked customer, been pepper-sprayed, been flashed and propositioned, and even urinated on, according to the complaint.
""McDonald's takes seriously its responsibility to provide and foster a safe working environment for our employees, and along with our franchisees, continue to make investments in training programs that uphold safe environments for customers and crew members,"" the company said in a statement that did not mention whether it planned to contest the lawsuit.
""In addition to training, McDonald’s maintains stringent policies against violence in our restaurants.""
The lawsuit targets McDonald's so-called ""Experience of the Future"" store renovations announced in 2017, part of a corporate turnaround plan that came after years of stagnant sales.
The company said last year that it and its franchisees would invest $6 billion to revamp most of its roughly 14,000 U.S. stores.
In October, executives said more than 9,000 stores had completed remodeling - about two-thirds of all U.S. locations - with more in development before year's end, and that the modernized stores had improved overall sales.
But the suit claims that the new design features split and lowered counters, creating easy access for customers seeking to harm employees on the other side.
Filed in conjunction with the Fight for $15 and a Union, the complaint alleges a nationwide epidemic of in-store violence, including an armed robbery at a McDonald's in Orlando, Florida when workers were held at gunpoint in a walk-in freezer.
In the Chicago area, there are more than 20 calls every day to emergency services from McDonald's stores, the suit said.
Plaintiffs claim that McDonald's ignores best practices that could make stores safer, especially at locations open overnight.
Those measures include drive-thru windows that block customers from entering the store, windows free of advertising materials that otherwise obstruct lines of vision and bathrooms that lock when workers need to clean them alone late at night."

OSLO (Reuters) - Airlines are confident of having sufficient supplies of biofuel-infused jet fuel to comply with a Norway requirement which takes effect next year, although they warn of additional costs.
From January, jet fuel suppliers in Norway must blend 0.5% of biofuel in all their aviation fuel, a policy Oslo hopes will boost supply and demand and lead to lower CO2 emissions.
Although aviation biofuel suppliers say it can cut the carbon footprint of airlines by up to 80%, it costs four times as much as normal jet fuel, which has so far curtailed usage and therefore demand for increased production.
And not all biofuels are equal when it comes to their environmental impact, both in production and transportation.
Norway's new rule demands that airplanes refueled in the country use a product made from waste fats and vegetable oil, although it excludes palm oil.
""There are not that many suppliers that supply that type of fuel. We have access and can buy these quantities at this stage. As we go into the future though we need more,"" Rickard Gustafson, chief executive of SAS, told Reuters.
The Scandinavian airline has set its own goal of powering all its domestic flights, which account for 17% of its total fuel consumption, with biofuel by 2030.
SAS expects Norway's 0.5% biofuel requirement to mean an additional 3 million euro ($3.33 million) in annual fuel costs.
It said it may source the biofuel it needs from AirBP, BP's specialist aviation division, and intends to buy more from Sweden's Preem, which is building new facilities.
But with Sweden and Finland considering following Norway's lead -- all three say that by 2030 they want to increase aviation biofuel use to 30% of total refueling -- there is a danger that demand will outstrip production.
""We have to create the market. There is strong demand for biofuel. But not enough is produced,"" Norway's Climate and Environment Minister, Ola Elvestuen, told Reuters.
Neste and Norwegian utility Statkraft [STATKF.UL] are also developing new plants, while similar projects have been announced by Air France KLM and AirBP.
Wideroe, a small Norwegian airline, welcomes Norway's requirement but called for other countries to follow suit.
""As a first step we would like to see national requirements of biofuel being replaced by international requirements. This would ensure a level playing field between airlines,"" it said, adding that it wants to use electric planes by 2030.
However, budget airline Norwegian Air said Norway was creating artificial demand which, even though it can be met initially, could cause a future fuel squeeze.
""With other (biofuel) volume obligations in the future, we could easily get a supply shortage,"" a spokeswoman said.
""In order to fulfil the mandate, imports from other regions might be necessary. How sustainable is biofuel that has been shipped half way around the world,"" she said.
Norwegian Air has been investing in more fuel efficient planes, which should be encouraged instead, she added.
Some in the airline industry market, including the SAS CEO, said some of the extra fuel costs may be added to fares.
Despite this, passengers at Oslo airport welcomed Norway's pioneering move.
""I do not mind if it will cost a little bit more. We have to clean up the world and do what we can do to have cleaner fuel,"" said 72-year-old Dag Christopherson."

RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - The institutional tranche of Saudi Aramco's initial public offering (IPO) has been oversubscribed while the retail portion has received a little more than 10 billion riyals ($2.67 billion) in orders so far, a banking source told Reuters.
Earlier on Thursday, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya, citing a banking source, said the institutional tranche of the deal had received more than 64 billion riyals, while the retail portion received 10 billion riyals.
Aramco, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, plans to sell 1.5% of the company, or about 3 billion shares, at an indicative price range of 30 riyals to 32 riyals, valuing the IPO at as much as 96 billion riyals and giving the company a potential market value of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion.
Representatives of the state-owned oil giant plan meetings with investors in Dubai next week, sources have said, for what is expected to be the world's biggest share sale.
Aramco has said at least one-third of the sale is expected to be covered by retail investors, who have until Nov. 28 to sign up for the IPO.
Institutional investors can subscribe until Dec. 4.
Aramco kicked off the sale process on Nov. 3 after a series of false starts. The deal is crucial for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to raise billions of dollars to invest in non-oil industries, create employment and diversify the world's top crude exporter away from oil."

Several Lebanese bonds made their biggest daily gains since early November. The 2032 and 2030 issues both rose by 1.4 cents to 44 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb data.
Bonds prices fell to record lows in recent weeks as anti-government protests brought the country to a political standstill following Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's resignation on Oct. 29. Parliament has not sat in two months, and a session was postponed on Tuesday due to protests.
However, parliament's speaker said on Thursday that a session would take place next Wednesday.
Some financial market observers have said the record low bond prices indicate the country may have to default on or restructure some of its debt.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. oil services company McDermott International (N:MDR) said on Thursday that its participation in a huge petrochemical project in Russia, announced this week, was in full compliance with the law and did not breach international sanctions against Moscow.
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) pulled out of the same Baltic Coast project in April, saying Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP) had changed its final concept for the project which initially had been designed to produce only liquefied natural gas.
Sources, however, said one factor behind Shell's decision was also that Gazprom had suddenly brought in another partner with links to businessman Arkady Rotenberg who is on a U.S. sanctions blacklist.
Houston-based McDermott will provide ethylene technology and extended basic engineering for two ethylene crackers at what is the largest ethylene integration project in the world, it said on Monday. It was awarded the contract by Baltic Chemical Company (BCC), which, according to its website, is 100% owned by RusGazDobycha.
RusGazDobycha's parent company, National Gas Group (NGS), was previously controlled by blacklisted Rotenberg, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, a spokeswoman for Rotenberg said on Thursday that he sold out of NGS in 2016 and has no stake currently in its subsidiary BCC.
The United States has imposed various sanctions against Russian enterprises and individuals following Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and accusations - which Russia denies - of meddling in the U.S. presidential vote in 2016.
""Since that time, and as of the time of our agreement, Mr. Rotenberg sold interests in BCC and no longer has ties to the company,"" a McDermott spokeswoman told Reuters in emailed comments.
""Our compliance team conducted a thorough review and due diligence which, together with certain control mechanisms in place, made us comfortable from a compliance standpoint.""
Two sources close to Shell told Reuters at the time that Gazprom had not consulted Shell about bringing in RusGazDobycha, but instead presented it with the plan as a fait accompli.
RusGazDobycha and Gazprom are equal partners in the wider Ust-Luga petrochemical complex, according to Gazprom's website.
Located near Russian shores on the Gulf of Finland, the natural gas processing chemical plant will be comprised of two ethylene cracking facilities, each with an annual capacity of 1.4 million tones, McDermott said.
McDermott's Lummus Technology will provide both the Process Design Package (PDP) Engineering and the license for olefin production and recovery technology, the company said.
Work on the project will begin immediately and the contract award will be reflected in McDermott's fourth quarter 2019 backlog.
RusGazDobycha has said the first line of the petrochemical complex is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2023, and the second line in the third quarter of 2024."

Daimler plans to roll out the Mercedes-Maybach GLS model, which is based on the Mercedes GLS-Class SUV, in the second half of 2020, Troska said, adding China is Mercedes-Maybach’s biggest market.
The move comes one day after James Bond's carmaker of choice,  Aston Martin  (L:AML), rolled out its first SUV model, the DBX. Luxury carmakers from Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) to Lamborghini launched ultra-luxury SUV models in the past year to boost their brand's overall profitability.
In 2012, Daimler, which owns the Mercedes-Benz brand, stopped making Maybach's iconic long limousines after the vehicles, which were based on a unique design and cost around $380,000, failed to sell heavily enough.
At the time, Maybach vehicles were marketed as a separate brand from Mercedes-Benz. Among the owners were oligarchs, rap stars, and royals including Russia’s Roman Abramovich, musician Jay-Z and King Juan Carlos of Spain.
When the joint Mercedes-Maybach brand was launched in 2014, Ola Kaellenius, then the Mercedes-Benz executive responsible for marketing and sales, said the brand was expected to sell well in China, the United States, Russia and Japan.
At the Shanghai autoshow this year, Daimler's Troska said demand for Maybachs was more than 600 a month in China."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) on Wednesday filed an antitrust lawsuit against Fortress Investment Group, alleging the SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) unit stockpiled patents to hold up tech firms with lawsuits demanding as much as $5.1 billion.
The suit follows an earlier case that Intel filed against Fortress in October. Intel withdrew that suit and on Wednesday filed a new version in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with Apple joining as a plaintiff.
Intel and Apple allege that Fortress and firms it either owned or whose patent portfolios it effectively controlled - and which do not make any technology products - stockpiled patents for the primary purpose of suing technology companies and did so in a manner that violated U.S. antitrust laws.
""Apple has suffered economic harm in the form of litigation costs and diversion of resources away from innovation to respond to these entities' serial nuisance suits,"" Apple wrote in the complaint.
Fortress and Japanese parent SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When Intel filed the similar lawsuit in October, a Fortress spokesman told Reuters the company was ""confident in our business practices and our legal position and view this lawsuit as meritless"".
In the filing on Wednesday, Apple said firms connected to Fortress had filed at least 25 lawsuits against the iPhone maker demanding $2.6 billion to $5.1 billion in damages. One of the suits, Apple wrote in its filing, alleged that Apple violated a step-counting patent in its devices with health-tracking apps.
Two Fortress-connected firms, Uniloc USA and Uniloc Luxembourg, ""have disclosed that they believe they are entitled to damages of between $1.41 and $2.75 per Apple product, for total damages in the range of $375 to $732 million,"" Apple wrote in its complaint.
""The apparent precision of the per-unit damages request is a facade; Uniloc USA and Uniloc Luxembourg simply adopted the amounts that Apple sought from Samsung in litigation for Apple's patents,"" Apple wrote, referring to South Korea's  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930).

FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) is considering a joint venture or outright sale among options for its consumer healthcare unit, sources told Reuters, as the French drugmaker prepares to present a new strategic plan next month.
An initial public offering (IPO) of the unit, which could be worth around $30 billion according to two sources familiar with the matter, is also on the cards. Sources cautioned that no final decision had been made. 
Recently appointed chief executive Paul Hudson, who took the job on Sept. 1, plans to meet investors for a capital markets day in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Dec. 10. 
Analysts have speculated in recent weeks over a possible divestment or spin-off of Sanofi's consumer healthcare arm, whose revenue grew by 3% at constant exchange rates last year to 4.7 billion euros ($5.21 billion), arguing proceeds would enable the group to invest more in internal research.
""Sanofi is looking at various options, joint venture, initial public offering, sale (...) They are talking to investments banks about options but have not taken a decision,"" one of the sources said.
The source added that forming a consumer healthcare joint venture with one of its large peers would allow it to benefit from cost cuts and later reap a higher valuation in a possible IPO or sale further down the line. 
Shares in Sanofi were up 1.45% at 84.08 euros at 1030 GMT, after Bloomberg earlier reported that the company was studying options for the consumer unit. 
A Sanofi spokesman had no comment.
Hudson said last month he and his teams would study the performances of every Sanofi division to decide where to invest.
""Prioritization will become increasingly important going forward"", Hudson told reporters in October. ""The reality in business is that some things are more important than others and we have to understand where we must win.""
Sanofi swapped its animal health unit with Boehringer Ingelheim for the German company's consumer healthcare operations in a $20 billion deal closed in 2017.
Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK), in turn, has created the market leader after agreeing to combine its consumer healthcare unit with that of U.S  Pfizer  (N:PFE) last year. The joint venture will be spun off and separately listed.
Analysts at Bernstein Research said in a September note that there was significant opportunity for consolidation because the top 10 players in consumer health only have a combined 23% market share between them.
The GSK joint venture has a global market share of 3.5%, with Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and Sanofi as close competitors.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks slid further on Thursday as the standoff between the world's two largest economies expanded beyond trade, reducing the odds of a ""phase-one"" deal this year and forcing investors to shed risky assets.
Investors had widely hoped for a U.S.-China trade deal by mid-November but the absence of one, and Washington's bill to support protesters in Hong Kong, has brought progress grinding to a halt.
With U.S. President Donald Trump seen as likely to sign the bill,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid said this ""could risk progress toward a phase one trade deal"".
European shares nevertheless bounced back from day lows in late morning trade as fresh reports emerged that China has invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing.
The trade-sensitive German blue-chip (GDAXI) index was down 0.2%, recovering from a 0.7% fall, after the Wall Street Journal reported Beijing hopes the round of talks can take place before next Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.
U.S. S&P 500 futures (ESc1) were marginally down, having dropped as much as 0.6% in Asian trade. The S&P 500 had hit a record high as recently as Tuesday on trade deal hopes, but Washington's move on Hong Kong derailed the rally.
""The cracks in equity market sentiment widened a little further yesterday, although this setback remains modest in the context of the index gains enjoyed so far in Q4,"" said Ian Williams (NYSE:WMB), economics & strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt.
Trade experts and people close to the White House said completion of a ""phase one"" U.S.-China trade deal could slide into next year, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks and the Trump administration counters with demands of its own.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, also the chief trade negotiator, said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" on a phase one deal, according to a report by Bloomberg.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 1.1% to a near three-week lows, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) tumbling 1.6% while Japan's Nikkei (N225) dropped 0.5%. Chinese mainland shares dropped 0.3% (SSEC).
Investors who had sought the safety of government bonds, the yen and gold in early trade shifted back from those positions after China reportedly invited U.S. negotiators for talks.
""Our short-term strategy remains fairly cautious, as markets are very narrowly driven -- every positive piece of news in trade negotiations sends markets higher, while any disappointment sinks,"" said Marija Veitmane, Senior Strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
""This makes it very hard for investors to build positions in risk trades.""
Spot gold  reversed gains to trade 0.2% lower at $1,468.91 per ounce as of 1127 GMT.
German government bond yields (DE10YT=RR) -- which move inversely to price -- bounced back from two-week lows, while the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to 1.7551% (US10YT=RR), off three-week lows touched earlier in the day.
The Chinese yuan meanwhile cut some losses after hitting three-week lows, and were last trading at 7.0210 to the dollar  in onshore trade.
The Japanese yen , which rallied almost 1% from more than five-month lows, was flat against the greenback.
The euro gained slightly and was last trading at $1.1083 (EUR=) ahead of the release of minutes of the European Central Bank's most recent policy meeting. 
Oil prices dipped, paring some of the 2% gains made on Wednesday after a better-than-expected U.S. crude inventories report and as Russia said it would continue its cooperation with OPEC to keep the market balanced.

Global benchmark Brent futures (LCOc1) dropped 0.4% to $62.08. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were down 0.4% at $56.73 per barrel in early Thursday trade.

Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said calls to oust Chinese companies from American stock indexes was contrary to the foundations of capitalism, as he warned against the dangers of decoupling the world’s two largest economies.
Paulson, who’s now chairman of the Paulson Institute, told Bloomberg’s New Economy Forum in Beijing that moves to reduce ties between the U.S. and China would weaken American leadership and New York’s leading role in finance. He said less cooperation between Washington and Beijing would also make it more difficult to tackle another financial crisis like the one he was forced to manage as treasury secretary in 2008.
“When the next crisis comes -- and a crisis will come, because financial crises are inevitable -- we will regret it if we lack mechanisms for the world’s first and second-largest economies to coordinate,” Paulson told the forum on Thursday, according to a prepared version of his remarks.
Paulson’s speech followed on from his warning at the same forum last year that an “economic iron curtain” was descending between the U.S. and Chinese economies. Since then, the relations between the two sides have grown even more strained by trade disputes, security spats and disagreement over human rights.
The Trump administration has been pressuring allies to stop using Chinese technology. U.S. officials are also discussing ways to limit American investors’ portfolio flows into China, Bloomberg News reported in September, citing people familiar with the internal deliberations.
The U.S. Treasury said that there was no plan “at this time” to block Chinese companies from listing on U.S. stock exchanges.
“Decoupling China from U.S. markets by delisting Chinese firms from US exchanges is a terrible idea,” Paulson said. “So is forcing Chinese equities out of the MSCI indexes. It is simply contrary to the foundations of successful capitalism for politicians and bureaucrats to instruct private American players how to deploy private capital for private ends.”
The New Economy Forum is being organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News."

From 2004 to 2013, the carmakers regularly met steelmakers and other companies in the supply chain to discuss uniform surcharges when purchasing steel, the cartel office said.
Unlawful prices resulting from the cartel were paid until at least 2016, it added.
The carmakers accepted the fines.
BMW said it would pay a penalty amounting to 28 million euros. Daimler will have to pay 23.5 million euros, a spokeswoman said.
Volkswagen, Germany's biggest carmaker, declined to comment on the amount it would pay but welcomed the end of the cartel probe and the legal clarity created.

The cartel office said that purchasing prices for long steel products - the steel type affected by the cartel and which is used for crankshafts, gearwheels or steering rods - account for less than 1% of a car's final value.

GUANGZHOU, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), the top foreign automaker in China, said on Thursday it expects the world's biggest passenger car market to stabilize next year with low growth levels likely for three to four years.
Hit by a slowing economy, the U.S.-China trade war and chaotic implementation of new emission rules, China's vehicle sales are expected to slide some 8% this year after a 2.8% fall last year to 28.1 million - the first decline since the 1990s.
""Next year we predict a stable total market environment, maybe moderate small growth,"" VW Group China CEO Stephan Woellenstein told Reuters at the Guangzhou autoshow.
""China might grow at a relatively low pace until around 2023 and 2024, until we come back to the level of 2017. Then we would also see a continuation of growth,"" he added.
Volkswagen has been one of the strongest performing automakers in China this year, having launched eight locally produced SUVs since the last quarter of 2018.
Its China vehicle sales jumped 6.7% in October. They are down 1.8% for the year to date but that is far better than a 12% decline in industry-wide China passenger car sales over the same period.
The automaker has made China a key battleground as it pushes ahead with electrification, pouring in billions of dollars in product development.
It expects to sell around 500,000 new energy vehicles per year in China by 2023, many of which will be part of it new ID. family of battery electric cars.
""We strongly believe ID. family electric vehicles will be new mass market cars for Volkswagen in China,"" Woellenstein said.
Two years ago, it unveiled a plan to sell 1.5 million new-energy vehicles, which also include plug-in hybrid cars, per year in China by 2025.
To that end, it has built a new $2.5 billion electric vehicle plant with partner SAIC Motor (SS:600104) that will have annual output capacity of 300,000 cars and which started trial production this month. It is also revamping manufacturing facilities in Foshan with partner FAW Group [SASACJ.UL] to build electric cars.
VW plans to invest over 4 billion euro in China next year, in line with spending this year.
As China rolls back EV subsidies, Woellenstein said the government needed to encourage the sector in other ways, such as not restricting EV purchases in crowded mega cities and offering EV owners in big cities more driving days than those permitted for gasoline cars."

The Dublin-based firm, which owns or manages 17 MAX jets, has 89 firm orders and is committed to a fleet of 133 in total, also said on Thursday the unwinding of its delivery backlog for the jet would take ""quite a bit of time.""
""We are taking a rather prudent view about how that is going to play out,"" Chief Executive Peter Barrett said in an interview.
""We think it is likely to be a Q1 ungrounding rather than this year. But ... whenever that happens there is also the challenge of getting them all in the air and returned to service and that’s going to take a lot of time,"" he said.
Earlier this month, Boeing said it expected the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to lift the MAX's grounding in mid December. The FAA said it would take whatever time was needed.
The MAX was grounded in March after two fatal crashes and Boeing has been upgrading an anti-stall system which inspectors believe had a role in the disasters.
Barrett said recent reports of structural issues on earlier versions of the 737 were normal for a maturing fleet and there had been no sign of lease rates weakening for such models.
SMBC, which also reported a 19% annual increase in pretax profit to $200 million for the six months to Sept. 30, said lease extensions linked to the MAX grounding and production delays at rivals would likely continue over the coming 6-12 months."

(Reuters) - European shares slid to near three-week lows on Thursday after U.S. legislation on Hong Kong added to concerns that a ""phase one"" trade deal between Washington and Beijing would not be sealed anytime soon.
Trade-sensitive sectors such as miners (SXPP), technology and (SX8P) industrials (SXNP) were particularly hit hard, with negative updates from Thyssenkrupp and  Fiat  Chrysler adding to the downbeat mood.
The German conglomerate (DE:TKAG) scrapped its dividend for the first time in six years and reported a full-year net loss that widened five-fold after failed attempts to turnaround its business. Thyssenkrupp's shares fell 10%, on track for their biggest percentage loss in over three years.
Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA) dropped 2.7% after General Motors (N:GM) filed a lawsuit, alleging that its rival bribed United Auto Workers union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages.
A Reuters report that completion of a ""phase one"" trade deal could slide into next year raised fears that a fresh round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in December could trigger a global slowdown.
Further adding to woes, U.S President Donald Trump is expected to sign two bills passed by Congress intended to support protesters in Hong Kong.
""Recently, we've seen optimism that at one point there will be a trade deal, but the news overnight shows that there is not much certainty to that,"" said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank.
""These moves are a reflection of some investors increasingly questioning whether there will now be a trade deal at all.""
Hopes that the two sides will be reaching a deal soon and somewhat better-than-expected earnings reports had driven European stocks to a four-year peak earlier this week.
However, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) slid 0.7% to its fourth day of losses, while trade-sensitive shares of Germany (GDAXI) and France (FCHI) dropped 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.
British postal company  Royal Mail  (L:RMG) slumped 17% to the bottom of the STOXX 600, after saying its plan to expand its parcels business internationally was behind schedule even as it posted a first-half operating profit.
French luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH) slipped 1.1% after Reuters reported it had persuaded U.S. jewelry chain Tiffany (N:TIF) to provide access to its books after it raised its bid to close to $16 billion.
Among a few bright spots was  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS), up 5.5% after the U.S. regulator dropped plans to sharply cut nicotine in cigarettes.
British utility  Centrica  (L:CNA) gained about 8% after saying it was on track to meet its full-year cash flow and earnings targets and raised its expected efficiency savings by 50 million pounds ($65 million)."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover's chief executive told Reuters he is open to more alliances to lower the costs of developing technology, but is not looking for a full-blown corporate merger.
""We feel the pressure"" from demands to slash carbon emissions and develop electric vehicles, Jaguar Land Rover chief Ralf Speth said in an interview on the sidelines of the Los Angeles auto show.
But to the question of whether the company and its parent,  Tata Motors Ltd . (NS:TAMO) are seeking a merger for Jaguar Land Rover, Speth said: ""The answer is no. We can really survive on our own.""
The British luxury sedan and SUV maker is ""always open"" to discussions of technology alliances and component sharing with other companies, Speth said.
Earlier this year, the maker of Jaguar sedans and Land Rover SUVs agreed with German luxury automaker BMW AG to develop electric car parts jointly.
Jaguar Land Rover currently sells an electric Jaguar I-Pace sport utility vehicle, and has said the next generation of its top-of-the line XJ sedan will be all-electric. The company has not said when it will launch the new XJ.
""There's no question in our mind that electric is the drive train of the future,"" Eberhardt said. ""But from a customer adoption point of view it takes longer than anticipated.""
Jaguar Land Rover has a product lineup, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles, which could meet tighter European CO2 emissions limits which begin taking effect next year, but compliance will depend on the mix of vehicles customers buy, Speth said.
""In Europe, the mix (of vehicles) is encouraging, but not at the moment at the level we can say we are compliant right at the beginning,"" he said. ""But there is time to go. We are cautiously optimistic.""
A lack of public electric vehicle re-charging infrastructure remains a challenge in selling electric vehicles in the U.S. and Europe, Eberhardt and Speth said.
Jaguar Land Rover was unprofitable through the first half of its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, hit by Brexit-related production shutdowns and weaker demand in China. But Speth said the second half of the year should be better than the first.
Demand in the Chinese market is volatile, though Jaguar Land Rover sales have seen ""double-digit growth"" in recent months, Speth said. But that growth has been from a low volume. Speth said he receives data on the Chinese market daily.
Speth and JLR North America chief Joe Eberhardt were at the Los Angeles Auto Show for the North American launch of the Land Rover Defender, a modern reincarnation of sport utility vehicles identified with African safari adventures and British country estates."

Diamond mining is the largest taxpayer in Namibia and generates 20% of the southern African country's export earnings.
Diamonds have been mined in Namibia since 1908, but land-based operations could end in 2023 as Namdeb says it is no longer economical to continue under the current tax regime.
 Anglo American  results show that its land operations in Namibia produced 209,000 carats in the first six months of 2019, 37% less than the first half of last year.
Namdeb currently pays a 10% royalty on its sales and 55% corporate tax on its profit.
Chief Executive Riaan Burger told reporters the royalty and tax regime for the diamond sector were fairly high.
""While that may be conducive or viable for new diamond operators, it might not be conducive to an aging marginal asset like Namdeb,"" Burger said, adding he was confident that the government would grant the company a waiver, particularly for the royalty.
""I think there is an understanding of the importance of Namdeb in the economy and in particular in terms of the jobs that are affected by the current short life of mine,"" he said.
Namdeb earlier this year sold its Elizabeth Bay Mine and associated marine assets to Lewcor, a Namibian consortium.
It had explored options to extend the life of the mine but could not find a way to make it profitable."

BMW said it had boosted its order with CATL to 7.3 billion euros from an original booking announced in mid-2018 that was worth 4 billion euros. It said the contract would last from 2020 to 2031.
BMW said it had also signed a battery supply contract with  Samsung SDI  worth 2.9 billion euros, valid from 2021 to 2031.
BMW said it would get the cobalt it needs for cell production from mines in Australia and Morocco and provide it to CATL and Samsung SDI. It said it would source the lithium from mines including in Australia.
BMW plans to have 25 electrified models in its offering by 2023, with more than half of them fully electric. It expects sales of electrified vehicles to double between 2019 and 2021.

Europe's auto industry is promoting zero-emissions cars as a way to comply with clean air rules, a strategy shift which forces carmakers to retool their supply chains to build electric, rather than combustion engine cars.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 04:06AM ET</span>","Alibaba, Aramco share sale bonanza fails to produce fee windfall for banks","By Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A late-year rush of giant global share sales led by Alibaba's $13 billion Hong Kong listing and Aramco's $26 billion initial public offering is failing to deliver an equivalent payday for equities bankers.
Filings on Thursday revealed 17 banks will split up to $32.3 million for  Alibaba  Group's (N:BABA) Hong Kong deal, which will raise up to $12.9 billion for the Chinese e-commerce giant.
Earlier this week, sources told Reuters that banks working on Saudi Aramco's IPO would split fees worth 0.35% of the amount raised, meaning at the top of its pricing range, raising $25.6 billion, fees would reach $90 million.
The numbers pale in comparison to the $300 million banks made from Alibaba's own record IPO of $25 billion in 2014. The record fee payout was the $550 million banks earned for the $19.6 billion IPO of Visa (NYSE:V) in New York in 2008. 
Equity capital markets activity typically accounts for about a quarter of global investment banking fees, but capital-raising in 2019 is running at its lowest level since 2012 as a series of high-profile pulled deals and soggy floats have weighed on sentiment even as many indices hit record highs. 
Worldwide, companies have sold shares worth $574.7 billion so far this year, according to Refinitiv data, 19.7% below levels this time last year. Those figures include Alibaba but not Aramco, which is yet to price its deal.
Office sharing start-up WeWork was forced to pull its IPO in September and seek a rescue deal after investors balked at its valuation.
The deal's failure was seen as a blow to other IPO hopefuls, already weakened by the performance of ride-hailing companies  Lyft  (O:LYFT) and Uber (K:UBER), which have both fallen by at least a third since their high profile flotations.
On Thursday, Czech consumer lender Home Credit dropped plans for an IPO in Hong Kong, which had been expected to raise more than $1 billion.
The poor reception for many IPOs comes despite strong stock markets. The S&P 500 (SPX) has risen 24% this year and sits just off an all-time closing high of 3122.03 reached earlier this week. 
""I'd expect volumes to pick up in 2020 compared to what we have seen so far this year,” one Hong Kong equities banker said. “I think you need to remember 2018 was a very good year, so I think 2019 has been a return to more normal levels."" 
ALIBABA LISTING
Until Aramco prices its IPO, Alibaba ranks as the world's largest ECM deal this year, ahead of Uber's New York IPO which raised $8.1 billion and paid banks fees of $106 million.
Sources involved in Alibaba's latest transaction said the Hong Kong listing was always going to pay far less than an equivalent IPO because of the company's high profile and five years of investor familiarity with it via its New York listing.
Alibaba also held no roadshow of investor meetings - a typical feature of large deals and an organizational headache for leading banks. 
""It’s one of the largest companies in the world, investors already know the story. The company had its quarterly results - people understand this company,"" said one banker involved with the deal.
China International Capital Corp (HK:3908) (CICC) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), lead the deal which launched last week and priced on Wednesday at a 2.9% discount to its U.S.-listed shares.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JP Morgan (N:JPM)  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) were joint global co-ordinators while HSBC (L:HSBA) (HK:0005) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (SS:601398) (HK:1398) (ICBC) also took senior roles. 
Thursday's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed Alibaba would pay investment banking fees of $28.1 million for the sale of 500 million shares.
This would rise to $32.3 million if a so-called overallotment of an additional 75 million shares are issued, which bankers think will occur.
The fee split between the banks was not listed in the SEC documents but it is accepted industry practice that co-sponsors are paid the most and the remaining banks' fees are dependent on the amount of shares sold.
Alibaba's Hong Kong stock is due to start trading next Tuesday.

While official talks haven't started yet, SoftBank has approached its main bank Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411), as well as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:8306) and  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group Inc (T:8316), the sources said.
All three sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the record. 
A SoftBank spokeswoman said that a loan was one of its options but nothing had been decided yet. All three banks declined to comment.
SoftBank agreed in October to offer a $9.5 billion lifeline to take control of WeWork.
SoftBank has provided Japanese banks with a rare profit opportunity at home, where they are largely hamstrung by ultra-low interest rates. But Japan's top three lenders have also become more cautious about financing the conglomerate, bankers say, given the turmoil over WeWork.
""We have to be very careful about this,"" one of the sources said. ""Especially if the money goes to WeWork, it will take a long time to conclude the process.""
SoftBank fell earlier this month to its first quarterly loss in 14 years, dragged down by an $8.9 billion hit at its giant Vision Fund, as CEO Masayoshi Son admitted poor investment judgment and turning a blind eye to problems at startup WeWork. 

The potential bank loan was first reported by the Nikkei.

1145,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 02:16AM ET</span>",Premarket London: Centrica Says It's on Track; Countryside Roars Ahead,"Investing.com -- Here is a summary of regulatory news releases from the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, 21st November. 
  Centrica   (LON:CNA), the owner of British Gas, said it’s on track to meet this year’s targets for net debt and cash flow after a “solid” performance by its key U.K. business in the four months through October.
Total accounts in the U.K. rose 136,000, with growth in services and home solutions more than offsetting a 107,000 reduction in energy supply accounts. “The rate of U.K. energy supply net losses was lower than in the first half of the year and significantly lower than in 2018, despite continued high levels of price competition and market switching,” it said.
In North America, accounts increased by 86,000 and CEO Ian Conn also noted that regional margins improved.
 Centrica  (LON:CNA) also said it has trimmed this year’s capital expenditure budget by 100 million pounds ($129 million) to around 800 million, and boosted expected cost savings this year by 50 million pounds to 300 million.
Home builder Countryside Properties (LON:CSPC) raised its dividend by 51% to 16.3 pence a share after reporting a 14% rise in full-year net profit to 170.4 million pounds on the back of a 33% rise in completions. It also said CEO Ian Sutcliffe would step down at the end of March and be succeeded by Iain MacPherson, who currently heads the company's Partnerships South business.
Sutcliffe said the new financial year had also started well, with net reservation rates for the first seven weeks ahead of the same period last year.
“With new site openings in the first half, we expect delivery to be weighted to the second half,” Sutcliffe said. “Potential economic and political uncertainty aside, we remain confident of delivering further earnings growth in 2020.”
The company said its forward order book had risen 30% year-on-year to stand at 1.17 billion pounds.

Metals group   Johnson Matthey   (LON:JMAT) said it’s on track to hit market expectations for profit in the year ending next March, after posting a 3% rise in underlying revenue to 2.12 billion pounds in the first six months.
However, underlying operating profit fell 5% to 265 million pounds and underlying earnings per share fell 12% to 95.8 pence. Net debt was higher than expected and cash flow slightly weaker than expected as surging prices for precious metals such as palladium saddled it with higher working capital requirements.
CEO Robert MacLeod said the group expects a stronger second half, free of one-off effects and is sticking by its medium-term target of “mid- to high single-digit growth” in annual earnings per share.

Water utility   Severn Trent   (LON:SVT) said underlying pretax profit fell 4.3% to 286.3 million as a result of increase investment, partly offset by a 20 basis point drop in its borrowing costs to 3.7%.

The company raised its interim dividend to 40.03p per share from 37.35p a year earlier, even though underlying earnings per share fell 9.7% to 68.8p.

Bookmaker   William Hill   (LON:WMH) said it’s on track to meet its targets for the year, with revenue growth of 4% in the 17 weeks through the end of October. Growth in its online business and expansion in the U.S. offset the decline of its chain of U.K. betting shops.
Retail sales fell 16% since its half-year update reflecting the impact of the introduction of a maximum 2 pound stake on fixed-odds betting terminals.
The budding U.S. business, by contrast, “has gone from strength to strength. We have excellent market access, a valuable partnership with Eldorado and we are excited about the potential that is presented by the combination with Caesars,” the company said.
U.S. net revenue rose 60% after the company launched services in Indiana and Iowa.
We expect our International Online business to benefit from a number of important product improvements that will be delivered over the coming quarters.” CEO Ulrik Bengtsson said, noting that the U.K. online business had stabilized its market share on the back of similar improvements.
  Royal Mail   (LON:RMG) posted an operating profit of £61 million in the six months to September, in line with its own expectations. Adjusted group operating profit was down 13% to 165 million pounds. 
The group said its letter revenue was the best for five years and will benefit from the upcoming general election.
It upheld its existing guidance of full-year operating profit between 300-340 million pounds.
The company announced a dividend of 7.5 pence a share.

1147,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 01:11AM ET</span>","Aramco Faces Serious Risks From Climate Change, Report Says","(Bloomberg) -- Climate change poses a serious risk to Saudi Aramco’s long-term business as rising sea levels and temperatures could damage infrastructure, curb productivity and even halt some of its operations.
Sea level rises pose the biggest threat to Aramco’s business and may lead to some of its refining facilities being underwater in the next few decades, making it more difficult for the company to operate, the Paris-based consultant Callendar, said in a report.
“The southern pat of Yanbu will probably be submerged within the coming decade,” Thibault Laconde, Callendar chief executive officer said in an interview. “Aramco have acknowledged that climate change is a risk but were vague. Is there something most people seem to be missing? They have a responsibility to assess the risk and I don’t think they are doing it.”
The report adds to questions surrounding the initial public offering of the state-run company, which has been scaled back amid concerns by investors about valuation and governance. It’s also a reminder that the world’s leading exporters of oil also will feel the impact of climate change as protesters in western nations raise the alarm about rising emissions.
Water levels in the Arabian Sea, near where much of Aramco’s infrastructure is located, are expected to rise by about 13 centimeters (5.1 inches) by 2030, the consultant said. As a result, some facilities such as Yanbu and the Ras Tanura refinery and terminal could face flooding and damage to equipment.
Aramco said in a statement it couldn’t comment on weather-related incidences but that “in order to achieve a low-carbon future, we believe it is necessary to meet both global energy demand and lower emissions.”
In its IPO prospectus, Aramco acknowledged the risk that concern over climate change could reduce global demand for hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products and that it may increase the possibility of litigation against the oil giant and its affiliated companies.
In the medium-term, the aridification of Saudi Arabia’s climate poses the most serious threat to its business and its midstream and downstream operations will be most at risk. This is as demand for water, which is essential for refining, increases and the kingdom will have to rely more on desalination plants. Saudi Arabia’s daily water consumption exceeds its storage capacity, and millions of people could go thirsty if the sprawling desalination plants, on which the desert nation depends, were put out of action.
Burning Up
Then there’s the heat. Average temperatures in Saudi Arabia increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius each decade between 1985 and 2010, the report said. This is expected to continue or even accelerate over the coming decades.
“The increase in temperatures is expected to be pronounced in onshore oil-rich areas exploited by Saudi Aramco,” such as Ghawar, Khurais, and Shaybah, the report said.
Temperature increases could significantly damage the company’s refining operations, impacting yield and its availability to process crude. Natural gas production would also be affected.
“Of course liquefaction is very temperature-dependent, like refining,” Laconde said. “Very quickly the infrastructure will have to be adapted which could be costly.”
There’s also the impact of heat stress on Aramco’s employees, reducing their physical capabilities - particularly if working outside -- and leading to a loss of working hours and, as a result, productivity for the company.
“There are things they can do,” Laconde said. “It may still be possible to adapt but it could be costly.”"
1148,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 12:26AM ET</span>","Competition intensifies in China's $100 billion, red-hot ETF market","By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's rapidly growing $100 billion market for exchange-traded funds is luring plenty of new entrants, intensifying competition in a market some predict will dethrone Japan to become Asia's largest in five years.
TaiKang Asset Management launched its first exchange traded fund (ETF) this month, just weeks after Tianhong Asset Management, controlled by Jack Ma's Ant Financial Group, made its foray into the ETF space.
The eye-catching ETF prospects in the world's second-biggest economy have also enticed global ETF giant Vanguard, which formed an investment advisory venture with Ant in June.
ETFs, which are low-cost investment funds that typically track an index and trade like stocks on exchanges, have caught on in China as stock-picking active fund managers increasingly struggle to beat the benchmark indices. Individuals are also embracing ETFs to diversify risks.
""Retail investors in China are finding it more and more difficult to make money through trading individual stocks,"" said Freddie Chen, a managing director at Vanguard, the U.S. pioneer in index investing.
""ETFs are also appealing to institutional investors as a handy tool for asset allocation,"" he added.
According to fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors, equity ETFs, the predominant form of ETFs in China, have almost doubled in size over the past year to exceed $70 billion. Assets of active equity and balanced funds rose only slightly.
Despite its rapid growth, China's ETF market is still 10 years behind the U.S. and represents a small fraction of the $5 trillion global ETF assets, said Philippe El-Asmar, head of Asia Beta Strategies at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
El-Asmar forecasts China's $100 billion ETF market will grow to $500 billion in five years, dwarfing Japan's $300 billion sector to become Asia's biggest. Hua An Fund Management Co predicts the market will grow 10-fold in a decade.
Lured by the rosy prospects, more fund managers are jumping onto the bandwagon, with over 100 new ETF products awaiting regulatory approval.
""Our vision is to be China's biggest provider of index funds,"" said Yang Chao, vice head of index investing at Tianhong, which launched its first ETF in September.
The asset manager, best-known for fostering the world's largest money market fund Yu'e Bao via internet platforms, aims to replicate the fund's success in the ETF arena.
Jason Hsu, Chairman and CIO of Rayliant Global Advisors, said innovation is the key to success for new products.
""You don't want to go to a price war with established players. You can't win,"" said Hsu, whose company has partnered with China Asset Management Co in designing so-called ""Smart Beta"" ETFs. Such ETFs seek to outperform the index using a rule-based system to exploit market inefficiencies, which Hsu said are still abundant in China.
J.P.Morgan's El-Asmar said there was huge potential as such 'Smart Beta' funds account for 20% of the U.S. ETF market, whereas in China, the ratio is just 2%."

The bankrupt utility giant had begun returning service late Wednesday, the San Francisco-based company said at a press conference. It had earlier plunged as many as 150,000 people into darkness amid high winds that threatened to knock down live wires. As of 8 p.m. New York time, about 48,000 remained powerless.
Improving weather conditions allowed the company to reduce the size of the blackout that, at one point, threatened to leave 800,000 people in the dark.
PG&E’s recent blackouts have provoked widespread outrage in California, triggering a state investigation and intensifying calls for a government takeover of the power giant. The company has carried out nine shutoffs this year alone. It’s taking extreme measures to prevent blazes from breaking out after its equipment ignited deadly fires in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. In January, it filed for Chapter 11 to deal with an estimated $30 billion in wildfire liabilities.
The National Weather Service said it’s still expecting gusts of up to 55 miles (90 kilometers) per hour in part of Northern California until 7 a.m. local time Thursday.
Wednesday’s shutoffs paled in comparison to the mass blackouts PG&E carried out last month, which plunged millions of people into darkness for days.

The Hang Seng Index fell as much as 2.2% Thursday amid signs of a widening rift between the U.S. and China, with President Donald Trump expected to sign a bill supporting Hong Kong protesters. Losses in the city were the worst in Asia, a painful reversal for investors who had chased its world-beating rally at the beginning of the week.
The lack of resilience in Hong Kong marks a departure from the start of 2019, where investors treated bad news as transitory and used declines as opportunities to buy the dip. Now, they’re shifting to sell the rally. That’s endangering this year’s gains, putting the Hang Seng Index at risk of posting its first back-to-back annual loss since 2002. It’s up just 2.4% for the year, down from 17% at its April high.
“If the bill becomes law, investors will be hesitant to take on the risk,” Hao Hong, head of research at Bocom International, said by phone. “There are too many moving parts, it’s very tricky. In the coming six months, the Hang Seng Index will be stuck in a range of 25,000 - 27,500.”
The U.S. bill is throwing another wrench into Hong Kong’s fourth-quarter stock performance. A weak yuan makes matters worse, as Hang Seng Index members get an average 64% of revenue from the mainland. Meanwhile, local firms are struggling as the city’s economy heads for a recession and retail sales plunge.
Trading volume in Hang Seng Index was around 28% higher than its 30-day average on Thursday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Property stocks bore the brunt of the selloff, with a gauge of related firms dropping as much as 3%.
Wharf Real Estate Investment Co. and Hysan Development Co Ltd. declined at least 3.7%. Implied volatility in the Hang Seng Index jumped 5.4%, the most in a week. Elsewhere, Cosco Shipping Ports Ltd. lost as much as 6.6%.

The Hang Seng Index fell 1.7% as of 10:28 a.m. local time, while China’s currency weakened 0.1%. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign a bill passed by Congress supporting Hong Kong protesters, a move which could derail a potential trade agreement with Beijing. Losses pared slightly after China’s chief negotiator Liu He said he remained “cautiously optimistic” about reaching a phase one trade deal with the U.S. The MSCI Hong Kong Index lost 1.7%.
“The market has been tortured by the back and forth of the trade headlines,” said Hao Zhou, a senior emerging markets economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). “At least one thing is clear: there remains a big gap between China and the U.S.”
A decline in the Hang Seng Index that pushed it below the 26,500 level is a turnaround from its performance on Monday and Tuesday, when it gained the most among major equity indexes. Now the risk-off sentiment is back, and the U.S. bill is throwing another wrench into Hong Kong’s fourth-quarter stock rebound. A weak yuan makes matters worse, as Hang Seng Index members get an average 64% of revenue from the mainland.
“If the bill becomes law, investors will be hesitant to take on the risk,” Hao Hong, head of research at Bocom International, said by phone. “There are too many moving parts, it’s very tricky. In the coming six months, the Hang Seng Index will be stuck in a range of 25,000 - 27,500.”
Donald Trump has been largely silent on the Hong Kong protests as they escalated into violence in recent weeks, even as lawmakers of both parties demanded action. Chinese officials quickly responded to the bill’s Senate passage Tuesday, saying Beijing “firmly” opposes the congressional action and calling it a grave violation of international law.

The suit is one of many J&J has faced in the United States, Canada and Europe over the implants, used to treat urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, in which organs shift from normal positions. J&J in October agreed to pay nearly $117 million to resolve claims in 41 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
Australia's Federal Court found that J&J subsidiary Ethicon had sold the devices without warning women about the ""gravity of the risks"", and was negligent in rushing the products to market before proper testing. The judge in the case, Anna Katzmann, has set February for the next hearing in the case, where damages will be discussed.
Ethicon said it was reviewing the court's decision and would consider its options to appeal.
""Ethicon believes that the company acted ethically and responsibly in the research, development and supply of these products,"" the company said in a statement.
Judge Katzmann ruled that much of the information the company provided about the devices was ""inaccurate"" and at times made ""false representations"".
""The question is whether this conduct considered as a whole was misleading or likely to mislead. I believe it was,"" Katzmann said in her judgment.
""The post-market evaluation of all the Ethicon devices was deficient,"" she said. ""It fell well below the level of care required of a reasonably prudent manufacturer.""
""The risks were known, not insignificant and on Ethicon's own admission, serious harm could ensue if they eventuated,"" the judge said in her ruling.
Patients said they had suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse after having the mesh surgically implanted.
Dozens of women involved in the class action welcomed the court's decision.
Julie Davis, the original claimant in the case, said she was ""incredibly pleased"" with the judgment but said it would not take away the pain and damage done to women.
""They have treated women essentially like guinea pigs, lied about it and done nothing to help,"" she told reporters at a televised media conference outside the court in Sydney."

The Hang Seng Index last traded at 26,450 by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT), down 1.6%. Tensions in the city rose after the U.S. chamber passed two bills to protect human rights in Hong Kong. 
One of the bill is the S. 1838, which would require annual reviews of Hong Kong’s special trade status under U.S. law and sanction officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses and undermining the city’s autonomy.
Another Senate bill, S. 2710, was also passed to ban the export of crowd-control items such as tear gas and rubber bullets to Hong Kong police.
In a statement following the House vote, Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Jim Risch called it “an important step forward in holding the Communist Party accountable.” Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who pushed for the bipartisan measure’s passage, said he urged President Donald Trump to “sign this critical bill into law as soon as possible.”
Trump now faces a dilemma, as the bills comes at a tricky time. The president has been pushing for a partial trade agreement with China and a confrontation at this period of time could imperil a long-awaited trade deal. 
Bloomberg cited a source familiar with the matter and reported overnight that Trump is expected to sign the bill, while Reuters said Washington and Beijing may not reach a phase one trade agreement this year.

An initial trade deal could take as long as five weeks to sign, U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/u-s-outlines-phase-1-trade-deal-with-china-suspends-october-tariff-hike-idUSKBN1WQ10Xlast month.
Just over five weeks later, a deal is still elusive, and negotiations may be getting more complicated, trade experts and people briefed on the talks told Reuters this week. 
Asked Wednesday about the status of the China deal, Trump told reporters in Texas ""I don't think they're stepping up to the level that I want."" 
Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that rolling back tariffs for a deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues will not be seen as a good deal for the United States, a person briefed on the matter said.
In a dinner speech in Beijing on Wednesday, Vice Premier Liu He said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" on a phase one deal, Bloomberg News said, citing people who attended the event ahead of a forum organized by Bloomberg LP. 
Liu, China's chief negotiator at the Sino-U.S. trade talks, separately told one of the attendees that he was ""confused"" about the U.S. demands, but was confident the first phase of a deal could be completed nevertheless, Bloomberg added. 
Officials from Beijing had suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump might sign a deal in early December.
Some experts said the next date to watch was Dec. 15, when tariffs on about $156 billion in Chinese goods are set to take effect, including holiday gift items such as electronics and Christmas decorations.
""If talks are really going well, that hike will be suspended,"" said Christian Whiton, a senior fellow for strategy and trade at the Center for the National Interest, and a former Trump and George W. Bush administration adviser.
""If not, the U.S. will implement them and that will throw the game into next year.""
U.S. stocks extended their fall Wednesday on the potential delay, with the S&P (SPX) last down 0.8%, while Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) dropped and the dollar (DXY) pared gains. 
""Negotiations are continuing and progress is being made on the text of the phase-one agreement,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email Wednesday afternoon.
The crackdown on protests in Hong Kong may also complicate the deal's completion.
The Hong Kong issue is definitely a negative factor in the trade talks, Zhang Yansheng, principal researcher at the state-affiliated think-tank China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said at the Bloomberg forum on Thursday.
A phase one deal is likely this year if there was ""no disturbance"", Zhang said, without elaborating.
The U.S. Senate passed a bill on Tuesday night condemning the crackdown and pledging support for Hong Kong, which was immediately criticized by Beijing.
""The violent crackdown against protesters in Hong Kong, which Beijing is directing, decreases the odds of a deal,"" Whiton said. ""Is Xi really going to be invited for a grip-and-grin with the president as his cops are beating students in Hong Kong?""
Negotiations also are complicated by conflicts within the White House about the best approach to China, and by the fact that Trump could veto any agreed deal at the last minute. 
The flare-up in tensions between Washington and Beijing helped knock global stock markets from 22-month highs reached in recent weeks when some sort of resolution on the trade war appeared likely.
Some China and trade experts briefed on the talks told Reuters they were still optimistic a deal might come together in the coming weeks, and Trump said on Wednesday his team continues to talk with China.
A Saturday call between Mnuchin, Lighthizer and China's Liu was described as ""constructive"" by state news agency Xinhua.
And the U.S. government has begun issuing licenses for some companies to supply goods to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker whose blacklisting by the administration has been another point of contention.
Nonetheless, Chinese pundits now also say they are pessimistic about a deal.
""Few Chinese believe that China and the US can reach a deal soon,"" Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-backed Chinese tabloid Global Times, said on Twitter on Wednesday.
The Global Times is not the official media outlet of the Chinese Communist Party - the People's Daily is - but Hu has described his role https://qz.com/745577/inside-the-global-times-chinas-hawkish-belligerent-state-tabloid as giving voice to what Beijing officials wish they could say in public.

Hu concluded: ""China wants a deal but is prepared for the worst-case scenario, a prolonged trade war.""

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 10:05PM ET</span>","GM sues Fiat Chrysler, alleging union bribes cost it billions","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday filed a racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, alleging that its rival bribed United Auto Workers (UAW) union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars.
GM also alleged that Fiat Chrysler's former chief executive, the late Sergio Marchionne, was central in the scheme.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it will seek ""substantial damages"" from FCA that it said would be reinvested in the United States to create jobs, but did not specify an exact amount.
The lawsuit comes at a delicate time for FCA, which is working on a planned merger with French automaker PSA and is negotiating a four-year labor contract with the UAW.
FCA said https://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=21397&mid=2 late on Wednesday that it would defend itself vigorously against the lawsuit.
""We are astonished by this filing, both its content and its timing,"" FCA had said in a statement earlier. ""We can only assume this was intended to disrupt our proposed merger with PSA as well as our negotiations with the UAW.""
FCA and PSA last month announced the planned 50-50 share merger to create the world's fourth-largest automaker, seeking scale to cope with costly new technologies and slowing global demand. 
GM's general counsel, Craig Glidden, told reporters at GM's headquarters that the lawsuit has nothing to do with the planned merger of PSA and FCA and the automaker does not intend to file suit against the UAW.
PSA declined to comment. 
The UAW has targeted FCA last out of Detroit's three automakers for contract talks. UAW workers at Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co ratified a new contract last week, while GM workers approved a deal in late October that ended a 40-day U.S. strike.
""It (the lawsuit) can't help but complicate the already difficult task of getting a UAW-FCA agreement in place,"" said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Michigan.
The UAW said in a statement, ""We are confident that the terms of those contracts were not affected"" by the actions of FCA or UAW officials. It said it was ""regrettable"" that these issues can cause doubts about the contracts.
The lawsuit also names as defendants three former FCA executives who have pleaded guilty in an ongoing federal probe into the UAW and FCA. GM said that probe, coupled with its own investigation, resulted in the lawsuit.
RACKETEERING
GM's Glidden said a ""pattern of racketeering"" by FCA from 2009 to 2015 left GM paying higher wages than Fiat Chrysler, and allowed the latter to use more temporary workers and lower-paid second-tier workers than GM.
""As part of this bribery scheme, and to lock in the competitive efficacy of the purchased benefits, concessions and advantages for FCA, GM was denied similar union commitments and support,"" the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit claims that among the ""benefits, concessions and advantages illegally purchased by FCA"" was UAW support for ""World Class Manufacturing,"" a version of Toyota Motor Corp's lean production strategy but adapted to the culture of Italian automaker Fiat.
That system has been credited in part for helping to turn around struggling operations like FCA's plant in Toledo, Ohio, that makes the popular and profitable Jeep Wrangler. 
The suit also claims that after a failed bid to take over GM in 2015, FCA corrupted the collective bargaining process by structuring terms through bribed UAW officials that ""forced unanticipated costs on GM."" 
The lawsuit says that under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), FCA would be liable to pay GM three times the actual damages caused, plus interest, punitive damages and attorneys' fees. 
GM alleges that FCA, under the leadership of former CEO Marchionne, used bribes to UAW officials to corrupt the collective bargaining process from 2009 through 2015. Marchionne died in 2018.
Fiat took control of Chrysler after it emerged from a U.S. government-funded bankruptcy in 2009.
""Marchionne was a central figure in the conceiving, executing and sponsoring of the fraudulent activity,"" Glidden said. 
When GM rejected a merger bid from FCA, the lawsuit alleges Marchionne conspired to negotiate a new four-year contract ""designed, through the power of pattern bargaining, to cost GM billions."" 
The UAW has been the focus of a spreading federal corruption probe.
Gary Jones, the UAW president who recently had taken a leave of absence, on Wednesday resigned effective immediately just hours after the union said it would seek to remove Jones from office, a union source told Reuters.
Jones' lawyer Bruce Maffeo told the Detroit News the decision was based ""on his belief that his continuing to serve will only distract the union."" A UAW spokesman could not confirm the resignation.
Last week, the UAW's acting president unveiled a series of reforms designed to prevent further scandals.

Glidden said the automaker supports those reform efforts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former foreign exchange trader at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) was found guilty Wednesday of conspiring to rig trades for his own benefit.
Akshay Aiyer was convicted of one count of conspiracy by a jury in federal court in Manhattan, court records show. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 3.
""This conviction serves as a reminder of our commitment to hold individuals responsible for their involvement in complex financial schemes which violate the integrity of the global financial markets,"" said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, of the U.S. Department of Justice, said in a statement.
A lawyer for Aiyer could not immediately be reached for comment.
Aiyer, who lives in New York, was indicted in May 2018. Prosecutors said he conspired from at least October 2010 to July 2013 to eliminate competition by fixing prices of and rigging bids for Central and Eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies. 
Aiyer was at least the sixth person charged in Manhattan federal court in connection with a wide-ranging U.S. probe into currency manipulation by major banks.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc and UBS Group AG have entered related guilty pleas, and been collectively fined more than $2.8 billion.
Prosecutors said Aiyer and his co-conspirators swapped trading positions, customer information and pricing of customer orders through chat rooms, phone calls and text messages, in an effort to coordinate their own trading and boost profit, the indictment said.
Those co-conspirators included former traders Jason Katz, who worked at Barclays and BNP Paribas, and Christopher Cummins (NYSE:CMI), who worked at Citigroup. Both pleaded guilty in January 2017 to conspiracy charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>",Some Huawei suppliers get U.S. approval to restart sales to blacklisted firm,"By Alexandra Alper and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday gave Huawei its second reprieve this week, allowing some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant after it was placed on a trade black list over national security concerns six months ago.
The Commerce Department said it has begun issuing licenses for some companies to sell goods to Huawei, expanding the company's supplier base and providing long-awaited clarity to the industry that once sold it billions of dollars worth of goods.
It was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to the world's top telecommunications equipment maker. But Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, also the second-largest smartphone maker, has been anxiously awaiting a license for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google to supply its mobile services to new models. Google declined to comment. 
A U.S. official said of roughly 300 license requests, about half have been processed. Roughly half of those – or one quarter of the total – have been approved and the rest have been denied.
A different person familiar with the process added that some licenses for sales of cell phone components and non-electronic components were approved.
""The Department is issuing these narrow licenses to authorize limited and specific activities which do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,"" the Commerce Department said in a statement, without providing further detail. 
The move came after the Commerce Department renewed the so-called temporary general license for the company for a third time on Monday, extending permission for Huawei to engage in limited transactions to assist U.S. rural network operators. 
The goodwill gestures come as the Trump administration is working to sign a phase one trade deal with China to end a tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hit global growth. 
Many China hawks have voiced fears that the administration could relax sanctions on Huawei to appease Beijing and score a win on trade. 
Republican Senator Marco Rubio said in a statement the company ""poses a clear and growing threat to the economic and national security"" of the United States and its allies.
""I strongly believe it's against America's national security interest to grant licenses for U.S exports that sustain or strengthen Huawei,"" he said, adding that the Commerce Department should inform lawmakers of what licenses were given. 
But the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, welcomed the Commerce Department's announcement, saying sales of the non-sensitive items help ensure the competitiveness of U.S. chipmakers, ""which is essential to national security."" 
""We hope license approvals continue to proceed in an appropriate and timely manner,"" the group added.
The United States has pending cases against Huawei for allegedly stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions. The administration has also lobbied U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure. Huawei denied the allegations. 
The Trump administration put Huawei on a trade blacklist, citing national security concerns in May after trade talks broke down. Companies on the list are not allowed to receive shipments of U.S. goods without a special license from the Commerce Department.
But in June, U.S. President Donald Trump said some sales would be allowed to the company, and U.S. officials urged firms to apply for licenses, noting that they would be granted in cases where the items were readily available and did not compromise national security.
But until Wednesday, there had been no responses on the license requests. 
Despite the good news, plenty of headwinds remain for Huawei, which is still awaiting rules from the Commerce Department that are expected to bar them from the U.S. telecoms network. 

""The White House isn't ready to pull the plug on Huawei because that would do almost as much harm to U.S. companies,"" said James Lewis, a technology expert with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But they're keeping it in reserve,"" he added.

The suspected gunman told police he was targeting ""Mexicans"" in the August shooting, which killed 22 people in total.
Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the lawsuit, which was filed in Texas state court in El Paso County, aimed to hold the retailer accountable ""for not taking reasonable and necessary measures to protect its customers."" 
""Through this lawsuit, the petitioners seek justice not only for themselves, but also security for the general public,"" the Mexican ministry said in a statement.
A spokesman for Walmart said the company had yet to see a copy of the complaint and would respond appropriately in court.
“We will never forget this tragic event, and our condolences continue to go out to the everyone who was affected,"" the company said in a statement. ""Safety is a top priority and we care deeply about our associates and customers.""
The suit is being handled by the Law Office of Lynn Coyle, an El Paso-based firm, in coordination with the Mexican consulate general in the city. Lawyers at the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It was not clear from the ministry's statement what relation the Mexican plaintiffs have to the attack, though the ministry noted that Coyle works with victims of the shooting.
The ministry's statement did not detail on what grounds the plaintiffs seek to hold Walmart responsible for the attack.
The carnage in El Paso, followed just 13 hours later by a mass shooting in Ohio, sparked a political outcry, with El Paso native and former Democratic Party presidential contender Beto O’Rourke demanding the mandatory confiscation of the assault-style rifles often used in mass shootings.
The Mexican government also condemned the shooting, describing it as an act of terrorism against Mexicans.
""The government of Mexico will continue to use all the resources at its disposal to prevent such incidents from recurring and repair the damages suffered by the victims,"" the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.

(This story corrects first sentence to say that Walmart did not do enough, not that Mexico did not do enough.)

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 08:21PM ET</span>",Trump considering whether Apple should be exempt from China tariffs,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday after touring a plant that assembles Apple Inc (O:AAPL) computers that he was considering whether to exempt the U.S. company from tariffs on imports from China.
""We're looking at that,"" Trump said in answer to a reporter's question about the tariffs, after touring a plant in Austin, Texas, with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook that assembles the company's Mac Pro desktop computers.
Cook, who has a strong relationship with Trump, has sought relief for Apple from the U.S. tariffs, which are part of a months-long tit-for-tat trade war between the world's largest economies.
""The problem we have is you have Samsung (KS:005930). It's a great company but it's a competitor of Apple, and it's not fair if, because we have a trade deal with Korea - we made a great trade deal with South Korea - but we have to treat Apple on a somewhat similar basis as we treat Samsung,"" Trump said.
Apple announced in September it would make its new Mac Pro computers in Austin. The announcement came days after U.S. trade regulators approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions filed by Apple amid a broader reprieve on levies on computer parts.
Earlier this month, Apple also asked the Trump administration to waive tariffs on Chinese-made Apple Watches, iPhone components and other consumer products.
Trump has made boosting the U.S. manufacturing sector one of the goals of his presidency, taking to Twitter to pressure U.S. companies into keeping jobs at home.
Earlier on Wednesday, Apple said it had started construction of a new campus in Austin that will employ 5,000 workers, with the capacity to grow to 15,000. It is expected to open in 2022.

1162,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 08:07PM ET</span>",Google to let sites block personalized ads under California privacy law,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Websites and apps using Google's advertising tools will be able to block personalized ads to internet users in California and elsewhere as part of the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit's effort to help them comply with the state's new privacy law, it told clients this week.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which goes into effect on Jan. 1, requires large businesses to let consumers opt out of the sale of their personal data. Lobbying by internet companies earlier this year failed to have the law exclude personalized ads, leaving the most popular and lucrative online ads in jeopardy.
Advertisers sometimes spend up to 10 times more money to place personalized ads, which take into account a consumer's browsing history, interests and past behavior when determining which message to display.
It is unclear how many publisher and advertiser clients will enable the new restrictions, as interpretations of the law may vary. Google declined to elaborate on whether further measures related to the new law were forthcoming.
Websites and apps selling ads through Google tools such as AdSense and Ad Manager are not required to make significant changes under the company's new compliance terms, which it posted online and sent to clients over the last three days.
But ad sellers can choose to stop personalized ads either to all consumers with internet addresses originating in California or to any individual worldwide that blocks the sale of personal data.
Google said that when the ""restricted data processing"" is triggered, ads will only be based off general data such as the user's city-level location or the subject of the page where the ad is appearing.
Additionally, Google will not record personal information for future advertising purposes in the restricted mode.
Advertisers using Google's tools also will have the choice to restrict data processing, though they would then lose features used to personalize ads to consumers that, for instance, have visited a particular store or installed a particular app.
The California law has been compared to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, a privacy law affecting European users that went into effect in 2018 and has become the basis of data privacy investigations targeting Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and other tech companies."
1163,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 07:56PM ET</span>",Exclusive: LVMH gets access to Tiffany's books after it raises offer - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) - French luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH) has persuaded U.S. jewelry chain Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) to provide it with confidential due diligence after it raised its bid to close to $16 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The development represents a key milestone in LVMH's bid for the iconic U.S. maker of engagement rings. Tiffany earlier this month rebuffed LVMH's initial $120-per-share all-cash offer, arguing it significantly undervalues it.
Tiffany agreed to provide LVMH with access to its books, after the latter sweetened its bid to close to $130 per share, the sources said. Tiffany plans to continue to negotiate for a better offer, and there is no certainty a deal will be reached, the sources added.
LVMH and Tiffany did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tiffany shares jumped 3.6% to $127.75 in after-hours trading in New York on the news on Wednesday.
Jewelry was one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the $20 billion global market were set to grow 7% this year.
Tiffany, founded in New York in 1837 and featured in the 1961 movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn, had struggled with falling annual sales and profit since 2015, before a revenue turnaround in 2017.
Under Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo, former head of fashion firm Diesel and a Bulgari alumnus, Tiffany has been building up its e-commerce business, and is trying to court younger shoppers with more affordable pendants and earrings and new designs.
However, LVMH believes Tiffany needs to spend more on reinventing and marketing its brands, and that it can achieve this only as a division of LVMH, according to the sources.
LVMH’s 2011 purchase of Bulgari boosted its smallest and newest business division, jewelry and watches, which also includes Hublot and Tag Heuer watches. Nonetheless, that business accounted for 9% of revenue and 7% of LVMH earnings in 2018, about only a fifth the size of its core fashion and handbag business, home to brands like Christian Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton.
Acquiring Tiffany would increase LVMH’s exposure to the bridal and diamond category, as well as to U.S. luxury shoppers. Should there be a deal, LVMH plans to keep the Bulgari and Tiffany’s brands separate, according to one of the sources.

In recent months, Tiffany and LVMH, as well as their peers  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and  Richemont  (S:CFR), have seen a dent in their revenue as a result of turmoil in Hong Kong, where anti-government protests have scared off tourists and battered spending in the Chinese-ruled city.

JDI said in a statement it had filed a criminal complaint against the former employee and that it was cooperating with police. The embezzlement was first reported by the Asahi newspaper on Thursday.
The employee had defrauded the company of about 578 million yen ($5.3 million) between July 2014 and October 2018 by arranging for payments to be made to a fictitious company, JDI said.
The revelation comes as the cash-strapped company is scrambling to clinch a bailout deal with Apple and other investors, seeking to raise at least 50 billion yen.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for Huawei Technologies Co Ltd asked a Canadian court to immediately stay proceedings seeking to extradite the company's Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to the United States, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.
Huawei spokesman Benjamin Howes said in an email that the company believes the extradition fails to meet the Canadian standard of double criminality.
The standard means the alleged conduct for which Meng was arrested in 2018 has to be illegal in both countries for her to be extradited.
Meng, 47, was arrested at the Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading the bank HSBC (L:HSBA) about Huawei Technologies' business in Iran. She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.
Howes said the company is arguing that because Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized commencing with the extradition process, double criminality cannot be met.
The application ""doesn't seek to challenge whether the facts behind the logic of this charge are true or not,"" Howes said, noting that the company would challenge this during a sufficiency hearing to be held in September 2020.
Canada's federal justice ministry was not immediately available for comment.
Meng's lawyers may have a sound argument, but it's premature, said Vancouver-based extradition lawyer Gary Botting who is not involved in the case.
""They're jumping the gun a bit, because the whole notion of a full extradition hearing is to determine whether or not there is dual criminality. The judge is bound to say, 'Hurry up and wait,"" Botting said.
Meng's arrest has strained China's relations with both the United States and Canada. China detained two Canadians - Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, and businessman Michael Spavor - just days after Meng's arrest. Spavor and Kovrig are still being held in China, despite diplomatic efforts on Canada's part to get them released.
Meng's lawyers say the United States is using the CFO for economic and political gain, noting that after her arrest, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would intervene if it would help close a trade deal. 
Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, spent 10 days in jail in December but was then released on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail and is living in one of her two multi-million-dollar homes in Vancouver.
Meng and her lawyers returned to a British Columbia court last month, requesting additional documents pertaining to Meng's arrest at the Vancouver airport. Meng's argument is part of a broader strategy to prove that her arrest was illegal and violated her rights according to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
If Canadian officials abused their authority, her lawyers say, the extradition proceedings should be halted.

Her extradition hearing is set to begin on Jan. 20, 2020.

DETROIT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Gary Jones resigned on Wednesday shortly after the union moved to remove him office amid a widening corruption probe from U.S. prosecutors, a union source told Reuters.
Jones' lawyer Bruce Maffeo told the Detroit News that the decision was based ""on his belief that his continuing to serve will only distract the union from its core mission to improve the lives of its members and their families.""
A UAW spokesman could not confirm the resignation. Maffeo did not respond to repeated messages from Reuters.
To date, 10 people have pleaded guilty in connection with the criminal investigation into illegal payoffs.
In late October, another UAW official was charged with embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars in an alleged scheme that a person familiar with the case told Reuters involved Jones.
Earlier on Wednesday the union filed charges under its bylaws against Jones, who had taken a paid leave of absence in early November, accusing him of ""false, misleading and inaccurate expense records.""
Maffeo told the Detroit News that Jones' decision to resign ""was reached before learning of the internal charges filed earlier today by the UAW.""
The union also filed similar charges against UAW board member Vance Pearson, who was charged in September with conspiring to embezzle union funds.
An attorney for Pearson, N. Scott Rosenblum, did not immediately comment. 
In late August, the FBI conducted searches at Jones’ suburban Detroit home and other locations. 
The widening probe has raised questions about whether the U.S. government might seek to take over the UAW. 
Earlier this month, former UAW vice president and former General Motors Co (N:GM) board member Joseph Ashton was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud.
The probe has also involved a number of  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) executives.
""This is a somber day, but our UAW Constitution has provided the necessary tools to deal with these charges,"" acting UAW president Rory Gamble said in a statement earlier in the day, before news of Jones' resignation. ""We are committed at the UAW to take all necessary steps including continuing to implement ethics reforms and greater financial controls to prevent these type of charges from ever happening again.""
Since assuming the interim role, Gamble has announced a series of ethics reforms to clean up the UAW.
Earlier on Wednesday GM filed a racketeering lawsuit against FCA, alleging that its rival bribed UAW union officials over many years to corrupt the labor contract bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars.
The lawsuit comes at a delicate time for FCA, which is working on a planned merger with French automaker PSA (PA:PEUP) and is negotiating a four-year labor contract with the UAW.

Maffeo did not respond to repeated requests from Reuters, and a UAW spokesman said he could not confirm the resignation. The decision came hours after the union filed charges under its bylaws against Jones in a move that could have led to his removal from office.

EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said that because a U.S. deadline for the tariffs came and went last week without any action, President Donald Trump would abide by an agreement reached with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last year that would forestall the levies.
“There were no tariffs imposed at the deadline last week. We haven’t seen any formal declaration for the decision on this, neither an informal one,” she said at a Centre for European Policy Studies conference in Brussels on Wednesday. “We assume that President Trump will stick to the agreement he made with President Juncker.”
In May, the Trump administration gave itself until mid-November to decide whether to impose levies on cars and auto parts from the EU on the basis of national security -- a justification used by the U.S. to slap import taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. The EU threatened to retaliate with tariffs on $39 billion of American goods if the president carried out his threat.
Trump and Juncker reached a political agreement in July 2018 to negotiate a slash in industrial tariffs between the two regions and suspend a U.S. threat to impose tariffs on European auto exports. Scant progress has been made in discussions, with the U.S. focusing more of its attention on the trade war with China.
Last year, Trump infuriated European leaders by imposing 25% levels on steel and 10% duties on aluminum shipments from around the world, including the EU. That prompted the bloc to retaliate with tariffs on American goods such as Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). motorcycles, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) & Co. jeans and bourbon whiskey.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, in an interview with Bloomberg TV earlier this month, signaled that a postponement of the tariffs was likely.
“Our hope is that the negotiations we’ve been having with individual companies about their capital investment plans will bear enough fruit that it may not be necessary to put the 232 fully into effect, may not even be necessary to put it partly in effect,” said Ross, referring to the national-security investigation under Section 232 of a 1962 trade law."
1169,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 06:09PM ET</span>",Chicago Trading Titan Don Wilson Says Libor’s Obituaries Are Premature,"(Bloomberg) -- Chicago trading legend Don Wilson suspects the scandal-tainted Libor interest-rate benchmark is going to stick around past its 2021 expiration date, defying the expectations of the Federal Reserve and other regulators.
In two years, banks will no longer be required to supply data used to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate. But that doesn’t mean they’ll stop, Wilson, the chief executive officer and founder of futures-and-options giant DRW Holdings LLC, said in an interview Monday at his office.
Assuming Wilson’s right and banks do keep feeding Libor, that means there’s a future, too, for eurodollars. Those contracts at CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME).’s exchange are futures on three-month U.S. dollar Libor, and they can’t exist in their current form without it. They’re also the most-traded rates contracts in the world and a staple of Wilson’s firm from the start, making this more than just an ivory-tower discussion about rates benchmarks.
Traders are gradually embracing products based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Libor replacement, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. But while SOFR has its place, Libor administrator Intercontinental Exchange Inc. has addressed the benchmark’s problems, and doing away with it would be a mistake, Wilson said. His view is informed in part by SOFR’s volatility during September’s upheaval in U.S. funding markets.
“SOFR is a useful risk-management tool, but SOFR is not a good replacement for Libor,” Wilson said. “Why do we want to start this kind of forced march towards the death of Libor when there are clearly some problems?”
He’s not the only one who thinks Libor will live on. “Whether Libor is going to be dead or not in a couple of years is yet to be seen,” CME CEO Terry Duffy said in an October interview. Accenture (NYSE:ACN) Plc released a survey in September revealing almost a quarter of global financial firms and corporate users expect Libor’s phase-out to be delayed.
Few voices are more prominent than Wilson’s on the subject of rates derivatives and their benchmarks. DRW is one of the biggest high-frequency traders in the world, and it’s a large player in eurodollar contracts, a primary way investors around the globe bet on or hedge against moves in interest rates.
The 51-year-old’s roots with those products are deep. He started working in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s eurodollar trading pits in 1989. From there, he grew DRW into a company with more than 1,000 employees that’s not only a huge market-maker in futures, options and other conventional financial products, but also a major presence in cryptocurrencies as well as a real-estate and venture-capital investor.
SOFR, “a wonderful tool if you’re hedging repo exposure,” can’t easily fill Libor’s shoes, Wilson said. As a secured rate -- because the loans it references are collateralized -- it lacks the credit component of Libor, which involves unsecured transactions. There’s no term structure for SOFR, or maturities beyond overnight. And it’s “affected by exogenous factors in a big way,” Wilson said. That vulnerability was exposed by the mid-September chaos in the U.S. market for repurchase agreements.
“We saw in September the repo market basically break, resulting in SOFR trading at a 300-basis-point premium for one night,” Wilson said. Borrowers who saw their interest expense spike because of such a jump would have good reason to be annoyed, he argued. “I just don’t think that that’s a great characteristic for our new benchmark rate to have.”
U.S. regulators are clear on where they stand. They want Libor -- which banks were caught manipulating -- gone and for SOFR to take its place. New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) is fond of counting down to the end of Libor. Speaking on Tuesday, he said the clock stood at roughly 775 days and “only goes one direction.”
Officials globally are working on similar transitions, and while details are still being worked out, “the one thing we do know is there’s some point in the future when Libor -- which doesn’t meet standards of a strong, robust reference rate -- won’t be around any more,” Williams said.
CME last week proposed plans for what it will do in the event that Libor becomes unavailable to settle eurodollar futures. Basically, it will convert them into SOFR futures, which began trading in May 2018.
“If I were running CME, I don’t think I would do anything different,” Wilson said. Volume and open interest for these SOFR products have mounted quickly, but remain dwarfed by eurodollar futures.
Williams dismissed criticism of SOFR in his appearance Tuesday. He said that while any transactions-based rate is vulnerable to spikes, SOFR on a three-month average basis “hasn’t been volatile at all.” The New York Fed’s plan to produce SOFR averages and an index by mid-2020 should address concerns, he said.
There’s a sense in which killing Libor now seems like a waste, Wilson said. ICE (NYSE:ICE) Benchmark Administration, which took over running the rate in 2014, “has put additional things in place to make the Libor reporting more robust,” he said. “Is the benefit of killing Libor -- i.e. moving away from something that is a little bit less tangible to something else -- really worth the risk?”
Either way, DRW is already preparing for December 2021. It’s trading CME’s SOFR contracts."

Warren and Blumenthal, who are Democrats, along with Cassidy, a Republican, were focused on a business partnership that Google formed with Ascension Health.
Ascension, which operates 150 hospitals and more than 50 senior living facilities across the United States, is Google's biggest cloud computing customer in healthcare, in a deal giving it access to datasets that could help it tune potentially lucrative artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
The lawmakers asked Google to provide information about other health systems which provide information to Google, whether Ascension clients will be allowed to opt out of the project and whether the data be used for advertising, among others.
Google said that it was happy to answer questions about the project. 

""We believe Google's work with Ascension adheres to industry-wide regulations (including HIPAA) regarding patient data, and comes with strict guidance on data privacy, security, and usage,"" the company said in an email statement.

1172,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 05:34PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here's a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. Data Deluge: Jobless Claims, Philly Fed, Housing 
The Labor Department at 08:30AM ET (13:30GMT) releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Nov. 16.
Economists forecast that initial jobless claims fell to 219,000 from 225,000 previously.
At the same time, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve will release its measure of manufacturing activity in the region. The report is widely seen as a proxy for U.S. manufacturing overall.
The Philly Fed index is expected to rise to a reading of 7.0 from 5.6 last month.
The latest data on pending home sales, meanwhile, is slated for 10:00 ET (15:00 GMT).The report is issued by the National Association of Realtors. 
On average, economists predict that pending home sales rebounded in October, rising 1.4%, to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.47 million units, compared with a 2.2% decline in the previous month.
2. Splunk Earnings Due
Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is slated to report earnings after the closing bell, with analysts keen for signs on whether its transition to a subscription-based cloud model has continued to keep a lid on cash flows.
The data analytics firm is expected to report earnings of 54 cents on revenue of $604.23 million. A year ago, Splunk earned 54 cents on revenue of $481 million.
In its second-quarter earnings statement, Splunk said it expects third-quarter revenue of about $600 million. The company raised its guidance on full-year revenue to $2.3 billion, up from a previous forecast of about $2.25 billion. 
3. Macy's and Nordstrom  Continue Retail Earnings Parade
Macy’s (NYSE:M) is expected to report third-quarter earnings of 1 cent on revenue of $5.33 billion before the market opens. A year ago, the retail giant reported earnings of 27 cents a share on revenue of $5.4 billion.
Sentiment on the retailer ahead of its results is far from positive after it recently cut its outlook on growth, forecasting earnings for the year in a range of $2.85 to $3.05 a share.
In the second quarter, the retailer’s results fell short of estimates, and there are few holding out for improved performance amid pressure from e-commerce competition and higher costs resulting from the U.S.-China trade war.
After the close, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), meanwhile, is expected to report earnings of 64 cents on revenue of $3.67 billion, compared with 67 cents a share on revenue of $3.75 billion a year ago. 
Performance in its off-price Rack stores, which accounts for roughly a third of Nordstrom’s total sales, is touted to rebound in the third quarter after sales dropped 1.9% in the second quarter.
“We look for slight upside to consensus for 3Q results at Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), driven mostly by strength at Rack, where we are seeing notable improvement in traffic and revenue correlated search interest data,” Wedbush said in a note to clients.
The retailer said it expected net sales guidance to decline by 2% for 2019, compared with previous guidance in the range of 0% to a 2% decline.
Analysts may question company management closely on the performance of the women's apparel store it opened in Manhattan last month."

Financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC began legal action on Wednesday, accusing Westpac of 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws and seeking fines of up to A$21 million ($14 million) for every transaction Australia's second largest bank failed to monitor adequately or report on time.
The allegations included money transfers involving child exploitation.
Hartzer said he accepted most of the regulator's assertions but ""at a senior executive level, for the board, for me personally, in no way have we been indifferent on this.""
Morrison said it was not up to the government to decide whether Hartzer should resign.
""These are things that the board and the management need to determine themselves,"" Morrison said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.
""But they should be taking this very seriously, reflecting on it very deeply and taking the appropriate decisions for the protection of people's interests in Australia - their safety,"" Morrison said.
""These are some very disturbing, very disturbing transactions involving despicable behavior,"" he added.
Hartzer on Wednesday said he had been ""disgusted and appalled"" by AUSTRAC's specific allegations and vowed to ""get to the bottom of why this was able to persist"".
Westpac had self-reported the breaches to AUSTRAC and had since shut down the service at the center of the complaint which let customers and affiliate overseas banks process payments from Australia."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Turkey's state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB), which U.S. prosecutors have criminally charged with helping Iran evade sanctions, said it should be able to challenge whether U.S. courts can hear the case at all before it entered a formal plea, according to a court filing made public on Wednesday.
The bank also rejected prosecutors' claim that it was a ""fugitive"" for refusing to appear in federal court in Manhattan to enter a plea, and said that appearing there might be construed as accepting the court's jurisdiction.
""As a corporation, Halkbank cannot be a 'fugitive' since it has no physical body to present,"" the bank said.
Halkbank also said it will ask U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who has overseen related litigation, to remove himself from the case.
A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan, who is not related to the judge, declined to comment.
The U.S. Department of Justice brought the criminal case on Oct. 16, in what the bank called an escalation of Washington's sanctions on Ankara for Turkey's military incursion in Syria. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called the case an ""unlawful, ugly"" step.
It is unclear why Halkbank is seeking the judge's recusal.
Judge Berman previously presided over a criminal case against Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab and Halkbank director Mehmet Hakan Atilla. Zarrab had moved for Berman's recusal on the grounds that he criticized Turkey's government while attending a 2014 symposium in Istanbul.
Zarrab pleaded guilty before testifying against Atilla, who was convicted and sentenced to 32 months in prison.
Atilla returned to Turkey this year after leaving prison, and was named general manager of the Istanbul stock exchange. U.S. prosecutors have said that Zarrab, Atilla, Halkbank and other Turkish officials schemed between 2012 and 2016 to help Iran spend revenue from oil and gas sales abroad using sham food and gold transactions, in violation of U.S. sanctions. Erdogan condemned the case at the time as a political attack on his government."
1177,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 04:57PM ET</span>",Stocks: Fear of Stalled China Trade Deal Slams Stocks,"Investing.com – Stocks fell back on Wednesday as multiple news reports suggested a U.S.-China trade deal won't get signed this year.
Reports that the talks were struggling or stalled altogether have been coming for the last few days and a Wall Street Journal report on the subject late Tuesday finally caused investors and computerized trading programs to react.
At the worst of the selling, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 260 points, or 0.9%. But assurances from the White House and President Donald Trump that the U.S. and China were still talking cut the loss by more than half.
The Dow closed down 0.4%, or about 113 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.38%. The NASDAQ Composite dropped 0.51%, and the Nasdaq 100, dominated by big tech stocks, slumped 0.66%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.16% and subtracted 11.8 points from the Nasdaq 100 index and 22 points from the Dow. Only   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD), down 2.2%, had a bigger negative impact on the Dow -- nearly 34 points.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the Dow leader, up 1.1%, adding 26 points to the blue-chip index. Only nine Dow stocks were higher on the day. The stock moved up on news it has signed a deal to sell 30 787 Dreamliners to Emirates, the Middle-East-based airline giant. The planes have a list value of $8.8 billion, although actual prices are usually lower.
At the same time, crude oil prices rallied as much as 3% after a weekly report showed U.S. oil inventories rising by a smaller amount than expected. The effect was to boost energy shares like   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) and   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) and slam airline stocks.   American Airlines Group   (NASDAQ:AAL) was the biggest percentage loser among Nasdaq 100 stocks.
The Dow suffered its second 100-point loss in two days, the first time that's happened since early October.
Interest rates moved lower on the selling. The United States 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 1.736% from 1.41% on Tuesday. Gold , however, was little changed.
The market has set record closing and intraday highs multiple times in the last week and into Monday, largely on the hopes a Phase 1 trade deal between the U.S. and China was about to happen. In the process, the major indexes and key stocks like Apple probably rose too fast and became vulnerable to selling if there was any bad news.
Retailer   Target   (NYSE:TGT), thanks to a strong fiscal-third quarter report and improved guidance, was the top S&P 500 on the day, followed by oil-service giant Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), medical technology Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX) and home-improvement retailer Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW). Lowe's reported strong earnings before Wednesday's open.
Despite Target and Lowe's, retailers were among the weakest sectors on the day. L Brands (NYSE:LB), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) (best known for its Michael Kors brands) and motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers."

BOSTON (Reuters) - A Florida-based charity will pay $4 million to resolve claims that it acted as a conduit for companies including Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) and  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients using their high-priced multiple sclerosis drugs, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.
The settlement with the patient assistance charity The Assistance Fund marked the third so far with a foundation linked to an industry-wide probe that has resulted in $850 million in settlements with drugmakers and charities.
TAF like the other foundations provide assistance to patients seeking to pay out-of-pocket costs for medications and says that since 2009 it has provided assistance to 78,000 people.
TAF did not admit wrongdoing. It said it fully cooperated with the investigators and is committed to operating in full compliance with federal guidelines governing how charities like it can provide assistance to Medicare patients.
Biogen, Novartis and Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA), which the department said also provided the charity money, did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the government's Medicare healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.
But the government has alleged that various drugmakers have used charities like Orlando, Florida-based TAF as means to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.
The investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, came amid growing attention to soaring U.S. drug prices. Co-pays are partly meant to serve as a check on healthcare expenses by exposing patients to some of a medicine’s cost.
The settlement with TAF centered on payments it received from three MS drug manufacturers, Teva, which sells Copaxone; Biogen, which sells Tysabri and Avonex; and Novartis, which sells Gilenya.
The government alleged that TAF engaged in practices that allowed it to coordinate with Teva, Biogen and Novartis from 2011 to 2014 ensure that it used the companies' money to support patients using their respective MS drugs instead of rival ones.
The department said that TAF also solicited and received payments from Teva for the years 2011 to 2015 that correlated with the charity's spending on patients using Copaxone."

For some strategists, that may be the perfect time to seek protection.
Macro Risk Advisors suggests a trade that involves selling a put option on the Cboe Volatility Index with a strike of 12, while buying a 20 call and selling a 22 call. Derivatives strategist Maxwell Grinacoff wrote in a note Tuesday that he backtested the strategy, both unconditionally and when VIX was below 13, and found it has performed relatively well since the beginning of 2018.
“We believe VIX has neared its theoretical floor for the year,” Grinacoff wrote. In addition, historical correlation trends in the S&P 500 around earnings season imply “a higher level of realized volatility going forward.”
These calls for vigilance are already bearing fruit. The VIX rose to its highest level in nearly a month on Wednesday after a report that the U.S. and China are unlikely to reach a trade deal this year.

Europe long volatility looks relatively attractive with the VStoxx Index so low, UBS Group AG strategist Stuart Kaiser wrote in a note Nov. 17. The European volatility gauge fell to 11.54 on Nov. 15, compared with this year’s mean of about 15.3. Kaiser also likes the iShares Russell 2000 ETF as a preferred medium-term growth-sensitive hedge.
Put-option strategies on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust are seen as the most attractive hedge by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
Evercore ISI agrees with that. The firm’s options team recommends buying SPY (NYSE:SPY) February $304 puts and selling $287 puts, strategist Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a note Tuesday, citing weakness in U.S. growth data, a slowdown in China and defensiveness showing up in VIX futures. The February expiry includes the U.S.’s advance fourth-quarter gross-domestic-product report on Jan. 30, he said.
“Since the S&P is making new all-time highs, now is an opportune time to hedge,” DeBusschere said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled approximately $3.4 billion out of mutual funds and exchange traded funds that hold U.S. equities last week, extending the largest sustained pullback from the domestic stock market in more than a year, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.
The outflows marked the seventh out of the last eight weeks that investors have pulled money out of U.S. stocks, pushing year-to-date losses for the category to nearly $129.7 billion.
Those declines have come despite the benchmark S&P 500 hitting a series of record highs due to optimism over a deal that could end the trade war between the U.S. and China. But concerns over the relatively high valuation of U.S. stocks during a rally in which the S&P 500 is up nearly 24% since the start of January have weighed on long-term investor sentiment.
Investors instead appeared to be seeking out more attractive valuations in world stock funds, which took in about $4.9 billion in new assets. The inflows were the largest weekly gain since March 2018, and marked the second straight week of inflows.
Fixed-income funds, meanwhile, added nearly $12.7 billion in new assets as investors sought out the perceived safety of bonds. The weekly inflow was the largest since early September and brought the year-to-date gain for the category to slightly more than $378 billion."

The U.S. Commerce Department in October said its final determination that Chinese exporters sold aluminum wire and cable at less than fair value in the United States. Such imports from China amounted to $115 million in 2018, it said.
The ITC said it would release a public report on its investigation backing the Commerce Department's findings on Jan. 6.
In its final determination, Commerce assigned a dumping rate of 58.51% to 63.47% for the wire and cable imports from China. It assigned a subsidy rate ranging from 33.44% to 165.63% to the Chinese producers.
U.S. producers Encore Wire Corp of Texas and Southwire Co of Georgia had petitioned for relief from what they described as subsidized imports from China.
The Trump administration has stepped up enforcement of U.S. trade law, focusing heavily on what it calls subsidized imports from China. In October, it said it had initiated 184 new antidumping and countervailing duty investigations since U.S. President Donald Trump took office, a 235% increase from the comparable period in the previous administration.
The ITC on Tuesday backed Commerce's finding of material injury from mattress imports from China.
The findings come amid strains in efforts by the United States and China - the world's two largest economies - to work out an interim trade agreement before the end of the year.
Completion of a ""phase one"" U.S.-China trade deal could slide into next year, trade experts and people close to the White House say, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and the Trump administration counters with heightened demands of its own."

(Reuters) - A little-used block of spectrum set aside for auto safety should be split to accommodate the rapidly growing number of wireless devices, the chairman of the U.S. telecoms regulator said on Wednesday, a plan that sets up a clash between two major industries.
A block of the 5.9 GHz spectrum band was reserved in 1999 for automakers to develop technology to allow vehicles to talk to each other, but it has so far gone largely unused.
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Ajit Pai proposed on Wednesday shifting more than half of that for Wi-Fi use, keeping the remaining spectrum for auto safety communications. The FCC will hold an initial vote on the proposal Dec. 12.
However, the U.S. Transportation Department reiterated Wednesday that the entire spectrum block is critical to future auto safety advances and should not be split. The auto industry has been developing technology to allow vehicles to exchange data about their location, speed and direction to help avoid accidents and to exchange information with infrastructure.
A group representing nearly all major automakers and including advocates for the blind and cyclists on Wednesday urged the FCC not to act until it could complete testing to establish if the spectrum can be shared safely, citing the 36,000 annual U.S. road deaths and more than 2 million injuries.
Prior government studies have suggested the technology, if widely adopted among U.S. vehicles, could prevent 600,000 crashes annually. The group says the technology applications require ""dedicated spectrum to make sure they work right every time without signal interference.""
Pai said the FCC had to make more spectrum available for Wi-Fi, which connects everything from ""TVs, thermostats, baby monitors, refrigerators, washing machines, toys, and even toilets.""
Previously, the FCC had explored if automakers and Wi-Fi devices should share the same spectrum block. Pai said ""further testing would be needed to carry out a complex sharing regime, and more testing would mean this valuable spectrum would likely lie fallow for several years."" 

Major cable and content companies have urged the FCC to open the spectrum band to Wi-Fi use. Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) said Wednesday, ""this spectrum is too valuable a national resource to lie fallow any longer.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare stocks, led by health insurers, have gained strength in recent weeks, buoyed by solid third-quarter earnings and investor comfort that political risks to the sector have eased. Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate could test their momentum.
The S&P 500 healthcare sector (SPXHC) has climbed 11% since hitting a recent low on Oct. 2, outperforming an 8% rise for the overall benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) over that time.
Still, healthcare remains a stark underperformer so far in 2019, rising 13% against a 24% gain for the broader market.
Investor worries that a Democratic president might usher in a Medicare for All health program that would decimate the role of private insurance and otherwise undermine the sector have clouded the stocks for most of the year. But some of those worst-case fears have been lifting, analysts said.
Healthcare investors have been ""coming to grips with 'you know what, we're probably not going to get the radical changes initially thought or feared,' and there's just way too much negativity priced in,"" said Sahak Manuelian, head of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.
Shares of health insurers have had a particularly strong run with the S&P 500 managed healthcare index jumping some 26% since early October, when the sector closed at its lowest point since the start of June.
Graphic: U.S. healthcare shares lag broader market, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8959/8871/Pasted%20Image.jpg
Healthcare stocks rallied sharply on Friday after U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the top Democratic presidential contenders and a Medicare for All proponent, revealed how she would implement her healthcare plan. It included a timeline that would initially retain many aspects of the current system, including employer-based private insurance, while transitioning Americans to the government health plan that currently primarily covers individuals 65 and older.
The overall healthcare sector rose 2.2% on Friday, its biggest one-day gain since January, with shares of insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) and Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) both climbing more than 5%.
""You took the worst case off the table that you'd put them out of business,"" Jeff Jonas, a healthcare portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds, said of the insurers.
A key for the stocks from Wednesday night's debate, Jonas said, is how prominent healthcare is as a topic and which candidate is perceived as likely to gain momentum in polls following the event.
Although worries about Warren's plan have receded, she and fellow progressive U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders are still seen as more negative for healthcare stocks than more moderate candidates.
""A lot of people still in the short term trade just based off those poll numbers,"" Jonas said.
Healthcare companies also are wrapping up a strong earnings season, with the sector overall posting earnings growth of 9.5% and revenue growth of 15.4%, both the highest rates of any S&P 500 sector, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of biotech companies have been strong of late, fueled by dealmaking and promising clinical trial results, Manuelian said.
""I think you are starting to see catch-up in healthcare broadly into year end,"" he said."

Bank of America upgraded  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) to buy from neutral, sending its shares more than 14% higher.
It was a little over two months ago that Bank of America found itself on the other side of the fence, downgrading its outlook on the cannabis producer over worries that its valuation was frothy at a time when cannabis orders from some Canadian provinces were slowing. 
The shares slumped from a high of $70.98 to as low as $18.23.
Much of the slowing orders were blamed on a lack of retail stores that had caused a glut in inventories. But that has since changed: Channel inventory is getting leaner, and margins are showing signs of growth, according to BofA.
Importantly, Canopy has undertaken measures to improve efficiencies that may for the first time in its history as a public company not only make its valuation reasonable but set it on a path to beat or at least meet the Street estimates, the bank added.
The bullish outlook on the cannabis producer comes in the wake of its second quarter, released last week, that missed analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
The company blamed the weakness on several factors, including reduced cannabis purchases and fewer-than-expected retail store openings. But tempered fears, characterizing the collective problems as a ""short-term headwind.""
Still, the vote of confidence from Bank of America triggered a wave of buying across cannabis stocks, with Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), Altria (NYSE:MO) and   Cronos   (NASDAQ:CRON) sharply higher."

Firings of S&P chief executive officers related to the social media movement accounted for five of 12 dismissals last year, according to the report, published on Wednesday. In contrast, just one CEO was dismissed for personal misconduct between 2013 and 2017, it said. 
The percentage of departures which were non-voluntary rose 8 percentage points from 2017 to 30.5%, the report added.
It also showed the number of women CEOs falling to 22 from a record 27 in 2017. Last year, Kathy Warden of  Northrop Grumman  (N:NOC) was the only woman appointed to a top job.
Scrutiny of executives and their treatment of employees has intensified in light of the #MeToo movement, which has spurred more scrutiny of top managers' relationships with employees.
The Conference Board said that departing executives had also tended to serve longer in their roles before leaving. In 2018, outgoing CEOs had been in their roles for an average of 10 years, compared to a low of 7 years during the financial crisis.

""The rate of succession among older chief executives continues to climb, and there are still more CEOs aged 75 and over than there are CEOs under the age of 45,"" said Matteo Tonello, the principal author of the report, who oversees the think tank's environmental, social, and governance research.

The Dow Jones industrials were off 0.84%, or more than 230 points at 1:22 p..m. ET (18:22 GMT). The S&P 500 was off 0.8%, and the NASDAQ Composite was down 1%. If the Dow's loss holds, it would be the first time since early October the blue-chip index had fallen 100 or more points on successive days.
The selling was prompted by reports from Reuters and The Wall Street Journal that the two sides have reached impasses on two key points: How much China will commit to spending on agricultural products and whether the United States will lift tariffs on U.S. imports. China won't commit to a specific dollar amount. The United States won't lift tariffs without commitments. Tariffs are to be expanded on Dec. 15.

Stocks surged to record levels on repeated assurances from Trump Administration officials that the deal was close to being finalized. Initial plans for a signing ceremony in October, perhaps before Christmas, have been put on hold.

The selling came despite bullish quarterly results from retailers   Target   (NYSE:TGT) and Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW).

(Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Ed Markey asked Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Wednesday to disable its ""Autopilot"" driver-assistance system until it installs new safeguards to prevent drivers from evading system limits that could let them fall asleep.
""Tesla should disable Autopilot until it fixes the problem, Markey said at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on advanced vehicle technologies.
Markey, who wrote to Tesla about the issue earlier this week, cited YouTube videos and press reports that suggested drivers could travel long distances without touching the steering wheel by using an object to defeat requirements that drivers should regularly touch the wheel ""even if they are literally asleep.""
Markey cited a local news report that said a driver had fallen asleep behind the wheel as a Tesla drove 14 miles on Autopilot. Other unconfirmed videos on social media appear to show drivers sleeping behind the wheel of Tesla vehicles.
""That's not safe. Somebody is going to die because they can go to YouTube as a driver - find a way to (get around safety requirements),"" Markey said. ""We can't entrust the lives of our drivers and everyone else on the road to a water bottle.""
Acting National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) chief James Owens told Markey at the hearing Wednesday the agency would be in touch with Tesla about the issue.
Tesla says drivers must keep their hands on the wheel at all times, but many owners say they can use the driver-assistance system to conduct other tasks behind the wheel.
Tesla did not immediately comment but said in September that since 2018, it has ""made updates to our system, including adjusting the time intervals between hands-on warnings and the conditions under which they’re activated.""
A series of crashes involving Autopilot has prompted U.S. investigations and criticism from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
In September, the NTSB said the Autopilot design was a key factor in a January 2018 crash of a Model S into a parked fire truck on a highway in California. The system’s design “permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task” in the 2018 crash and allowed him to remove his hands from the wheel for nearly all of the last 14 minutes of the trip, it said.

Tesla’s Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal U.S. crashes, and two remain under investigation by NHTSA and NTSB.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Malta's biggest bank failed for years to detect or address risks involving thousands of payments, the European Central Bank (ECB) said, detailing ""severe shortcomings"" that could have allowed money laundering or other criminal activities. 
A confidential ECB report seen by Reuters said Bank of Valletta (BoV) (MT:BOV) had not dealt with a litany of risk management failings despite repeated warnings from the Frankfurt-based regulator stretching back to 2015.
The report -- adopted by the ECB in the summer after an inspection late last year -- calls for remedial measures, including assessing if BoV's top managers are fit for their jobs and reducing exposure to risks posed by foreign clients by the end of this year.
BoV said it was strengthening its risk controls, governance structure and anti-financial crime defenses and said customers who operated in the gaming industry, a key business in Malta, were most at risk of being hit by remedial measures.
""The Bank is today engaged in a priority process - agreed with, and monitored by, its regulators - to deal with the legacy issues highlighted by the report,"" BoV said in an email on Wednesday.
BoV is the main financial pillar of the Maltese economy, whose growth has been fueled by attracting offshore gambling, financial and ship registration industries under the centre-left government of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat.
The Mediterranean island, the euro zone's smallest state, already faces questions over its ability to combat crime two years after journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who had reported on government corruption, died in a car bombing.
The 47-page ECB report highlights the vulnerability to suspicious transactions of the euro zone's financial system, which has already been rocked by widely-reported money laundering scandals at some of its top banks. 
A spokeswoman for the ECB declined to comment on Tuesday.
However, the ECB lacks power over anti-money laundering lapses, apart from the extreme measure of revoking a bank's license.
Malta's police, whose chief is appointed by the government, declined to say whether they were investigating BoV, while a spokesman for Muscat said the prime minister trusted the bank.
A senior ECB official said BoV had shown ""a change of attitude"" with its new ""de-risking"" plan launched in May, but warned that Frankfurt would consider restricting BoV's services to foreign clients and gaming companies if it again failed to shape up. It could deploy such measures as part of its remit to protect financial stability.
Italy's UniCredit (MI:CRDI), which owns 10% of BoV, declined to comment, adding that its stake was ""non-strategic"".
Although BoV is financially solid as most of its revenues come from local mortgages and deposits, it was exposed to disproportionate risks from its foreign clients, the ECB official said.
FOREIGN CAPITAL
With a population of only 420,000, Malta has sought to attract foreign capital with schemes such as a cash for passport program, although the EU has repeatedly warned of the risks of this attracting the proceeds of criminal activities.
Despite these warnings, the ECB report said that when foreign nationals seeking to buy passports under the scheme opened an account at BoV, the bank registered them as Maltese citizens, which reduced their risk profile.
The report said BoV's earlier de-risking strategy in 2018 had focused mainly on maintaining accounts and more than 13,000 suspicious payments, some dating back to February 2014, were still waiting to be assessed.
Meanwhile the number of high-risk foreign customers had actually risen and in many cases BoV had no information about the origins of their wealth. 
The ECB said BoV had no unit to identify bribery and corruption among international clients and did not keep a record of those who had payments blocked due to money laundering risks.
BoV declined to comment on specifics of its risk management systems or any customers named in the ECB report saying its dealings with regulators and clients were confidential.
ECB investigators identified a lack of checks over accounts held by Malta's Pilatus Bank, which was shut last year after its Iranian owner Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad was arrested in the United States on money-laundering and sanctions violation charges.
Despite warnings, BoV kept scant details about the source of wealth of Pilatus' directors and no documentation was provided when Ali Sadr opened an account in 2014, the report said.
Pilatus did not answer to repeated calls. A lawyer for Ali Sadr did not reply to questions.
In another case, BoV allowed CenturionBet, a gambling company which the ECB said had its license withdrawn in Britain in 2009, to continue transferring money even though its license had also been revoked by Maltese authorities in 2017. 

CenturionBet did not reply to Reuters questions.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 11:51AM ET</span>","Target sets upbeat holiday sales tone with raised forecast, shares surge","By Nivedita Balu and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (N:TGT) signaled a strong start to the holiday season and raised its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday, betting on its aggressive push into faster delivery and investments in store revamps, sending its shares up 13%.
The company also reported better-than-expected quarterly results on the back of strong demand for its apparel, in contrast with other retailers, which have cut their forecasts, triggering fears of weaker consumer spending.
Target has spent billions of dollars on building its private label business and opening smaller stores in college towns and urban areas to lure customers, helping it gain an edge over its rivals.
""Apparel saw the most dramatic share gains in the quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said. Comparable sales from the business jumped 10%.
Target's focus on same-day delivery services such as drive-up, click-and-collect and Shipt as well as a new loyalty program is expected to help the retailer win more customers during the Thanksgiving and Christmas shopping period.
The holiday season is crucial for retailers as it can account for as much as 40% of annual sales. The season has six fewer days this year, prompting retailers to be more aggressive with deals and deliveries.
""We're very excited about the opportunity this holiday season with the growth we've seen and the growth that's in front of us from a same-day perspective,"" Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan told analysts on a post-earnings call.
Target's investments in its same-day delivery services accounted for 80% of its digital comparable sales growth, which surged 31% in the third quarter. Its store traffic was up 3.1%. 
Overall same-store sales rose by a better-than-expected 4.5% and the company earned $1.36 per share on an adjusted-basis in the quarter ended Nov. 2.
Target said it now expects full-year adjusted profit of $6.25 to $6.45 per share, up from its prior range of $5.90 to $6.20 per share.
""Target continues to operate in rarified air, with Q3 results outstanding across the board,"" Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said.

Target shares, which have gained nearly 70% this year, rose as much as 14% to a record high of $126.06.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 11:42AM ET</span>",Italy's alarm over reform of euro zone bailout fund may be overblown,"By Jan Strupczewski and Gavin Jones
BRUSSELS/ROME (Reuters) - A political storm has erupted in Italy over reform of the euro zone's bailout fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
The main government and opposition parties, as well as the Bank of Italy, say the reform could hurt market confidence in Rome's debt and potentially make a debt restructuring or even default more likely.
Here are some questions and answers on the reform:
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REFORM?
The role of the ESM is being expanded to include backing up the European Single Resolution Fund (SRF) for banks in case the SRF runs out of cash in a particularly large bank crisis.
Under the reform, the fund would assess a government's ability to repay loans if it asked for a bailout and, if requested by governments, it would act as a mediator with investors in the case of a debt restructuring.
It would also, from 2022, oblige countries to issue bonds with conditions attached, known as ""single-limb Collective Action Clauses,"" which would make debt restructuring easier.
DOES IT MAKE DEBT RESTRUCTURING MORE LIKELY?
The introduction of single-limb CACs in all euro zone bonds will help prevent holdout investors blocking a debt restructuring to get a better deal. This would make a restructuring more orderly and predictable, but not, on the face of it, more likely.
""There is evidence – we looked at that very carefully – that the introduction of such CACs does not have any negative impact on bond markets,"" the head of the ESM Klaus Regling has said.
Neither should the ESM's role as a mediator in case of a debt restructuring make such an event more likely. The ESM can only act on the request of the government in question and on an ""informal, non-binding, temporary, and confidential basis,"" according to the proposed change.
Some Italian critics argue the very mention of debt restructuring for private investors -- so-called private sector involvement -- in the ESM treaty could trigger market panic. The ESM treaty does contain a paragraph which says:
""In exceptional cases an adequate and proportionate form of private sector involvement, in accordance with IMF practice, shall be considered in cases where stability support is provided accompanied by conditionality in the form of a macro-economic adjustment program.""
But it has been there since 2012 and has caused no panic.
WHY IS ITALY UPSET?
Part of the furor may be political opportunism to attack the government. Matteo Salvini, leader of the hard-right League party, says approving the reform ""would mean ruin for millions of Italians and the end of our national sovereignty.""
The League says the reform means Italy will only be able to obtain ESM funds if it agrees to restructure its debt. The reform does not entail this automatic conditionality.
However, Italy's central bank chief Ignazio Visco, its banking lobby, and prominent Italian economists have also expressed concerns.
Visco warned of the possible psychological effect on markets of any debt restructuring mechanism. This could ""trigger a perverse spiral of expectations of default, which may prove to be self-fulfilling,"" he said in a speech last week.
Giampaolo Galli, former chief economist of employer's lobby Confindustria, warned parliament that making debt restructuring ""too easy"" could have ""very negative contagion effects on the whole euro zone.""
The issue of debt restructuring is particularly sensitive in Italy. Its public debt, at around 135% of gross domestic product, is proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece's, and its sustainability is often questioned at times of rising bond yields.
WHEN WILL THE REFORM COME INTO EFFECT?
The ESM reform was broadly agreed politically in June, and is due to be endorsed by euro zone leaders at their summit in December. The updated ESM treaty will then have to be ratified by all 19 euro zone parliaments, which is likely to take a year.
WHY THE ALARM NOW?
Italy has woken up to the fact that euro zone governments will sign off on the reform next month, meaning there is little time left to try to block or change it. In addition the League, now in opposition, can gain political capital by attacking the government over the reform. The League was in power until August, when it quit the coalition.
CAN ITALY VETO THE REFORM?
As with every treaty change, the ESM reform requires unanimity and so Rome can veto it, even if it agreed to it in June. But that would mean also rejecting the ESM's role as a backstop for the bank resolution fund, which Italy wants.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR BROADER EURO ZONE REFORM?
Because the ESM reform is part of a bigger package of steps for deeper euro zone integration, Italian reticence about changes to the ESM may be linked to the parallel discussion on making euro zone banks more stable by limiting their exposure to a single sovereign and attaching risk weights to sovereign debt.
This is anathema to Rome, because most of Italy's sovereign debt, the biggest in Europe in absolute terms, is held domestically by financial institutions and households.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he will only sign off on the ESM reform as part of ""an overall package."""

MILAN (Reuters) - Small car platforms developed by France's  Peugeot  should be favored if plans to merge PSA (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) go ahead, PSA executive Gaetano Thorel told Reuters on Wednesday.
Managers on both sides are finalizing discussions to try and create the world's fourth-largest carmaker, a move that will result in choices being made about which technologies to adopt in the merged entity.
The platforms encompass the underlying structure of a vehicle, or the sets of parts that can be chosen from to build a car.
""On smaller segments PSA has the platforms which allowed the group to make the highest margins in Europe among all the automakers, so I find it reasonable that these platforms might be used in the future on some FCA models too,"" Thorel said.
""On the other hand FCA has got RAM and Jeep, and I find it reasonable that the new group might use those platforms in that segment,” Thorel, who is PSA's managing director for Italy, said. 
European labor unions have called on France's PSA and Italy's Fiat Chrysler to avoid job cuts and factory closures as the two major carmakers prepare to complete their $50 billion deal and aim for 3.7 billion euros in annual cost savings.
The firms have yet to outline how they can meet that pledge while working toward deadlines to meet stricter emissions goals in Europe, which is likely to add pressure on FCA to adopt PSA's more efficient engines. 
That is turning the spotlight on FCA's engine plants in Europe, including in Italy and Poland. 
Consultancy IHS Markit projected in a recent report that some 1.5 million FCA cars may shift onto the French carmaker's platforms in the region by 2025. 
FCA has become more heavily-geared toward pick-up trucks and SUVs since the 2009 tie-up between Fiat and U.S. centric Chrysler. 
But it does have a heritage in small cars too, including its Fiat Panda and Fiat 500 models. An electric version of the latter, developed with one of the company's own platforms, is due to be unveiled next July.
Depending on the production cycle, some FCA models like the Jeep Renegade, Fiat Doblo vans or the upcoming small electric Alfa Romeo SUV could be likely candidates to shift onto PSA vehicle structures, analysts have said. 
PSA recently launched production of the latest Opel Corsa models on the platform also used for its Peugeot 208, two years after the company bought Opel. 

FCA declined to comment.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates agreed to buy its first Boeing (N:BA) 787 Dreamliners in a last-minute, $9 billion deal at the Dubai Airshow on Wednesday while reducing its order for the U.S. planemaker's delayed 777X model.
The deal for 30 787-9 Dreamliners is part of a $25 billion shake-up of the airline's fleet involving overhauls of orders from both Boeing and Airbus as it reshapes its fleet to prepare for the demise of the soon-to-be-scrapped Airbus A380.
Emirates, the launch of customer for the 777X, will now take 126 of the long-range widebody jets, down from a planned 150, after tense negotiations on a parallel 787 deal that at one stage looked set to elude Boeing.
Emirates and Boeing announced the order on day four of the Middle East's biggest aerospace event after lawyers put finishing touches to the deal the same morning.
""The 787s will complement our fleet mix by expanding our operation flexibility in terms of capacity range and deployments,"" Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum told reporters at the airshow.
The deal resolves a complex set of interlocking Boeing deals with Emirates, the largest buyer of wide-body jets.
In a two-stage swap, Emirates will upgrade its six remaining orders for the current 777-300ER model to the larger 777X to bring its order total to 156. Then it will swap 30 of these for the newly ordered Dreamliners, which have a lower price tag.
The 777X has run into delays and Emirates says it no longer knows when it will get its first plane, which was supposed to be delivered in 2020. Boeing has said the 777X will be delivered from 2021.
Emirates will receive its first Dreamliner in 2023, around the time the airline expects to resume expansion which has recently slowed as passenger demand shrinks.
""We want to introduce it on to some of the thinner routes where the 787 comes on to its own both on the medium and long-haul operations,"" Emirates President Tim Clark said.
Boeing also secured deals for 60 of its 737 MAX airliner at the Dubai Airshow, including its first firm orders since the plane was grounded eight months ago.
The Emirates order was seen as a message of support for the troubled U.S. planemaker which has been weakened by the 737 MAX crisis, analysts said.
Emirates at its home airshow also revised deals with Boeing's European rival Airbus (PA:AIR).
Emirates ordered 50 Airbus A350s on Monday in a $16 billion revised deal that means it is dropping consideration of the smaller A330neo, at least for the time being.
The United Arab Emirates, which includes Dubai, is a close ally of the United States. Tensions between Iran and U.S.-backed Gulf Arab states provided a tense backdrop to the airshow."
1203,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 10:29AM ET</span>","Prosus, Takeaway trade barbs in battle for Britain's Just Eat","By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The two companies vying to purchase British food delivery service Just Eat traded barbs on Wednesday, as technology company Prosus and Takeaway.com each sought to win over a critical mass of shareholders.
Prosus said Takeaway.com's all-share bid, which runs from Wednesday through Dec. 11 and is recommended by the Just Eat board, presents ""significant risks"" and underestimates how competitive the British market is.
The broadsides came after a two-week period in which Takeaway's share price has rallied to a point where its offer nearly matches Prosus's 4.9 billion pound ($6.3 billion) cash bid, erasing the advantage Prosus hoped to gain when it first launched its unsolicited bid in October.
Takeaway's offer, which would see its founder Jitse Groen become CEO of the combined group, valued Just Eat at 698 pence or 4.76 billion pounds ($6.14 billion) as of the close of trade on Tuesday, according to Reuters calculations.
Just Eat shares traded at 753.4 pence at 1422GMT on Wednesday, signalling that shareholders believe a higher bid by one or the other side is likely. Prosus's offer also ends Dec. 11 and both are conditional on receiving 75% of shares.
Prosus, which is controlled by South African investment giant Naspers Ltd., said in a statement that Takeaway's offer ""takes a narrow view of the food delivery sector based principally on its experience in the Netherlands and Germany.""
These markets ""have so far been relatively insulated"" from competition of the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Deliveroo, it added.
In a response, Takeaway said it had become the biggest in seven of its markets ""fighting the same competitors Just Eat faces in the UK"".
Takeaway has played on its experience in the sector and argues its bid will create a global powerhouse in food ordering, and save the combined group 20 million euros in costs over time.
""Being an operator is clearly different from being a financial investor,"" it said in an emailed statement.
Just Eat's board has recommended shareholders reject the Prosus bid saying it ""significantly undervalues"" the company.
Prosus, which owns stakes in food-ordering companies around the globe, said on Wednesday it doubted Takeaway can roll-out its own delivery service in Britain with no impact on the bottom line and with only tens of millions of investment.
In a Nov. 12 statement, Takeaway forecast costs ""in the tens of millions"", to reposition the combined group for long term growth, including by strengthening its delivery service in Britain.
Groen's strategy in the Netherlands and Germany has centred on becoming the dominant platform for food ordering, with food delivery seen as a supplementary business with worse economics.
Takeaway shares have rallied 17% from a recent low on Nov. 5.

System Engineering, which makes assembly lines for the car, aerospace and battery industries, was one of three underperforming divisions the group has said needed major restructuring.
""Overall we believe in the future of our automotive engineering business,"" Karsten Kroos, head of Thyssenkrupp's automotive supply business, said. ""However, clear cuts and changes are necessary now to make the business competitive and profitable again.""
The cuts, which represent about 13% of the division's total staff, will be made in Germany, where System Engineering operates eight sites. The announcement comes a day ahead of Thyssenkrupp's annual press conference.
Automotive customers, which have been hit by a global car industry downturn, are Thyssenkrupp's biggest customer group and accounted for about 12 billion euros ($13.3 billion), or 28%, of its total sales in the last financial year.
Thyssenkrupp said it would stop unprofitable business activities at System Engineering while strengthening growth areas, for example electric mobility, resulting in about 100 new jobs over the next two business years."

BENGALURU/BEIJING - Chinese airlines are adding seats on short- and mid-range Asian flights in a strategic shift away from prestigious but loss-making North American routes to a market that promises better returns and growth.
Over the past decade, the number of seats on U.S. routes operated by China's top three state-owned carriers rose fourfold, but such breakneck expansion came at a price. The nation's international aviation industry has been in the red for at least three years, with losses reaching 21.9 billion yuan ($3.13 billion) in 2018, according to recent China Air Transport Association data.
In response, Chinese airlines are increasingly seeking growth closer to home. Out of 105 international routes that Chinese carriers plan to add to over 800 existing ones for the new winter-spring season, most focus on East Asia and Southeast Asia with some European routes also thrown into the mix. (Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/CHINA-AIRLINES/0H001QXKB9GY/index.html )
""Chinese carriers are now taking a more commercial approach to international services,"" said John Grant, senior analyst at aviation data firm OAG. ""If you could fly an aircraft for four hours and stay profitable compared to a 12-hour sector and not make any money, then you could do that thrice on a daily basis, thus making a better business sense.""
For example, China Eastern (SS:600115) has recently received approvals to open new routes from tier-two cities of Qingdao and Chengdu to South Korea's Cheongju-si and to Osaka in Japan. It will also fly Shanghai to Aomori Prefecture in Japan and from Xining to Japan's Nagoya.
Loong Air too received approval last month to open a new route linking Chengdu with Jakarta. Air China (SS:601111) has been operating a Beijing-Phnom Penh route since the start of this year and China Southern (SS:600029) has been flying from Guangzhou to Cebu in the Philippines since January.
The airlines have not responded to requests for comment.
And as demand on North American routes weakens, four Chinese airlines have dropped six U.S.-bound flights so far this year, according to aviation data provider Variflight. For example, Air China suspended Beijing-Hawaii flights in August while Xiamen Airlines suspended its Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle route.
FEWER VISITORS
After a decade of double-digit growth, Chinese visitor numbers to the United States have fallen last year and the U.S. National Travel and Tourism office forecasts another 5% decline this year as a combination of a stronger dollar, China's cooling economy and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington take their toll.
(Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/CHINA-AIRLINES/0H001QXK99GV/index.html )
U.S. Travel Association Chief Executive Roger Dow told Reuters the U.S. share of the global long-haul market has shrunk to 11.7% last year from 13.7% in 2015.
In all, while the number of seats on flights to North America operated by China's top three airlines, rose 2.9% in the past three years, the capacity on Southeast Asian and European routes jumped 30.6% and 34.6% respectively.
(Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/CHINA-AIRLINES/0H001QXKC9H1/index.html )
""The demand on North American routes is not as strong as before, so airlines are shifting their capacity on these routes to places like Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, to protect their fares,"" Luya You, transportation analyst at BOCOM International said.
She added Air China and China Southern management expected Japan and Korea to contribute most capacity growth next year with slower growth in North America.
Long-haul flights tend to be more lucrative for airlines because there is less competition from low-cost carriers than on short routes, which means higher fares can more than make up for higher cost of fuel, bigger planes and bigger crews.
However, as Chinese airlines, backed by state and local government subsidies, chased market share they have driven their long-haul rates so low that they stand to make more money on international routes closer to home, experts say.
OAG's Grant says they can do that without much additional investment because latest generation wide-body aircraft can also work well on shorter routes.
At the end of 2018, China's top three carriers had orders for 60 long-haul planes, mostly Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s and 777s and Airbus A350s, all of which can be easily reassigned.
""Undoubtedly, Southeast Asia is where they are going to reallocate their order over the next couple of years,"" Grant said."

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 09:38AM ET</span>",U.S. aviation regulator pledges rigorous certification for Boeing 777X,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The U.S. aviation regulator will ensure certification of Boeing's (N:BA) 777X wide-body jet is conducted rigorously, the agency's head said on Wednesday while reaffirming that its review of the grounded 737 MAX will not be rushed.
Problems with a number of aircraft models have led some airlines to accuse plane and engine makers of over-promising on performance capabilities, while the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX after two fatal crashes has increased scrutiny of testing and certification.
The comments from Steve Dickson, administrator of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), come a day after Emirates -- Boeing's largest 777X customer -- demanded that the aircraft be tested for at least 16 months to ensure it is safe to fly and meets performance expectations.
""I did meet with Emirates and we had excellent dialogue,"" he said at the Dubai Airshow when asked if the 777X certification would be tougher in light of recent events.
""Perhaps there will be more emphasis on making sure that the systems, as they evolve, are effectively integrated across the entire product and that we are not looking at issues in a fragmented fashion.""
On the continuing review of the 737 MAX, Dickson last week said his team would take ""whatever time is needed"", having previously pledged a data-driven methodical analysis, review and validation of the systems and pilot training required to safely return the MAX to commercial service. 
Dickson reiterated on Wednesday that the FAA is not following any timeline for the model's return to service, adding that time pressure cannot influence the regulatory process. 
""We are going to make sure we are very methodical and very diligent. We are not delegating anything,"" he told reporters at an airshow briefing.

Boeing has said it expects the FAA to issue an order approving the MAX's return to service next month, with pilot training requirements for commercial flights to be granted in January.

Trade union UFO said that if no progress was made during talks, it would announce next Thursday when and where strikes would take place and for how long they would last.
A Lufthansa spokesman said the airline would use the time to try to come to an agreement with UFO, adding that a solution could only be found in joint discussions and arbitration.
""You can't strike and arbitrate at the same time,"" the spokesman said.
Cabin crew held a strike over pay and pensions for two days earlier this month, resulting in the cancellation of one in five flights, affecting around 180,000 passengers and costing the airline 10-20 million euros ($11-$22 million).
Last week, Lufthansa and UFO agreed to enter large-scale arbitration talks over pay and pensions, averting further strikes.

(Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) raised its annual profit forecast on Wednesday, helping ease concerns over the health of the U.S. consumer after larger rival  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) cut its full-year sales estimates ahead of the all-important holiday season.
Shares of Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe's rose 5.8% to $119.94 in premarket trading and were set to hit a record high after open.
Fewer discounts lifted Lowe's profit margins in the third quarter, while an increased assortment of industrial products like drills and power saws attracted more high-spending builders and handymen.
Building contractors, plumbers and electricians are becoming increasingly more important to Lowe's and Home Depot as they look beyond their core do-it-yourself customers to new sources of revenue.
Lowe's retained its full-year revenue and comparable sales forecasts, in contrast to Home Depot, and Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison said a solid macroeconomic backdrop was boosting U.S. home improvement stores. 
Home Depot on Tuesday also reported disappointing quarterly sales, saying the integration of its online and brick-and-mortar businesses was not yet generating as much revenue as expected. 
""It's a relief that Lowe's wasn't as bad as some people may have expected given what happened with Home Depot yesterday,"" Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics, told Reuters.
Perkins added that investors were also upbeat about Ellison's initiatives gaining traction.
In line with Ellison's plan to improve profitability, Lowe's will close 34 underperforming stores and reorganize its corporate structure in Canada. 
The company has already shed its retail operations in Mexico and is cutting back on slow-moving inventory as part of Ellison's restructuring program. 
Fewer discounts on its top-selling items helped boost Lowe's operating margin to 8.96% in the third quarter ended Nov. 1, up from 5.50% a year earlier. 
But that also pushed more customers to look for deals at Home Depot during the quarter, according to a research by Jefferies analysts.
In October, for instance, Home Depot had about 7% of its products on sale, compared to just 1% at Lowe's, according to the brokerage.
That hit Lowe's same-store sales, which rose 2.2% but missed analysts' estimate of a 3.1% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.41 per share, beating estimates of $1.35.
Lowe's raised its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast to $5.63 to $5.70 per share, from $5.45 to $5.65 earlier.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 07:33AM ET</span>",Junk loan market tensions signal end of buyout-led binge,"By Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Many investors are shunning the riskiest corners of the junk-rated U.S. corporate loan market because of concerns about possible credit rating downgrades, putting the brakes on a run of leveraged buyouts and debt-funded dividends.
The push back against the riskiest corporate debt shows how the Federal Reserve has failed to alleviate fears about a recession next year that would trigger a cash crunch for heavily indebted companies, corporate financiers and analysts said.
Rock-bottom interest rates have fueled a boom in junk rated loans, with the U.S. market tripling in size to $1.3 trillion since 2010 as investors bet on riskier assets, allowing private equity firms to juice their returns and pursue even bigger acquisitions.
But some of these M&A deals look less feasible given the loan market's unease.
Drug store chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA), for example, got a skeptical response from private equity firms for its potential $70 billion-plus leveraged buyout, Reuters reported earlier this month.
Private equity investors use leveraged loans to fund purchases of companies with a lot of debt, resulting in credit ratings at the lower end of the spectrum.
But the more cautious mood in the market about where the U.S. economy is headed has made loan investors insist on stricter terms, including higher interest rates.
This could ultimately restrict access to capital for the most heavily leveraged companies, preventing them from refinancing their debt, capital markets experts said.
""It is not clear that there is a recession coming next year, but the loan market is positioning as if one is coming,"" said Rizwan Akhter, a managing director at credit investment firm York Capital Management.
The ten months to October was the slowest such period for U.S. junk-rated loan issuance since 2015, with volumes down by almost a third year-on-year, according to finance industry data provider Dealogic.
This is weighing on dealmaking. Leveraged buyouts hit their lowest level of activity in the first ten months of this year since 2016, while debt-funded dividends dropped to their lowest level since 2010, according to data from Refinitiv.
The leveraged loan boom led to a slippage in underwriting standards so that deals in the past few years tended to have higher debt-to-earnings ratios and often featured ""covenant-lite"" terms, giving investors fewer protections in a default.
If economic conditions deteriorate, these loans would be more vulnerable to ratings downgrades which could create problems for loan managers.
""Loan investors remain concerned with potential downgrades and companies at risk of missing estimates, both of which could lead to higher defaults,"" said Art de Pena, head of loan syndicate and distribution at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (T:8306).
RISK APPETITE
The dwindling investor appetite for the riskiest loans is making it more difficult for banks which mostly seek to sell on the loans once they are originated.
In the United States, Bank of America (N:BAC), JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) were the three biggest issuers of leveraged loans in the first 10 months of 2019, according to Refinitiv data.
Representatives for the three banks declined to comment.
Leveraged loans, unlike bonds, have a floating interest rate, which is less attractive in a falling interest rate environment. Junk bonds, in contrast, have been immune from the loan market's malaise because they are fixed-rate instruments.
Junk-rated bond issuance is up around 20% so far in 2019, driven by falling U.S. interest rates and the move out of loans. But for companies in search of cash, this has not been enough to offset the junk-rated loan slump.
In recent leveraged buyouts such as for art auction house Sotheby's and welding and valves manufacturer  Colfax  Corp (N:CFX), banks have had to adjust terms to attract buyers for the debt. This includes, for example, restricting a borrower's ability to pay dividends or spin off a business.
""We would not even look at B3/B- new issue loans unless pricing is Libor +400 or more, whereas last year deals were routinely getting done at Libor +350 or +375,"" said Akhter. Libor is a benchmark rate for trillions of dollars of debt.
In credit rating rankings, debt rated B3/B- is deemed speculative grade and is seen as more vulnerable to adverse conditions.
Investors are also becoming more skeptical about the anticipated improvements to a business' cash flow, which in the recent past has allowed private equity owners to load up companies they buy with more debt.
COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS
Investors shunning the riskiest corporate loans are managers of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). These are funds which buy the loans, package them and then sell different pieces to investors based on risk appetite.
The CLO managers are reluctant to buy loans rated B3/B- because these would be downgraded by credit rating agencies to ""C"" in a recession.
CLOs typically have a cap on how much C-rated debt they can hold equivalent to 7.5% of their total assets. If CLOs exceed this limit, they can be forced to take losses on their books, creating an incentive to sell under-performing loans.
The pressure is on, given that more than 18% of the CLO market's exposure was in B-rated loans at the end of June 2019, more than double at the end of 2017, according to S&P Global.
A loan sell-off by CLOs could further restrict the provision of junk-rated loans by banks, which would face the prospect of more debt stuck on their books, credit investors said.
""The most important risk is liquidity risk,"" said Michael Terwilliger, portfolio manager at Resource Credit Income Fund."
1215,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 07:21AM ET</span>",Special Report: Ex-workers say U.S. military landlord falsified records to get bonuses,"By M.B. Pell
SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - A U.K. company that provides housing to U.S. military families came under official investigation earlier this year, after Reuters disclosed it had faked maintenance records to pocket performance bonuses at an Oklahoma Air Force base.
At the time, Balfour Beatty Communities said it strove to correctly report its maintenance work. It blamed any problems on a sole former employee at the Oklahoma base.
Now, Reuters has found that Balfour Beatty employees systematically doctored records in a similar scheme at a Texas base.
In June, Reuters, working in partnership with CBS News, documented how Balfour Beatty Communities kept two sets of records at Oklahoma’s Tinker Air Force Base. The accurate records, not shared with the military but seen in part by Reuters, showed tardiness in making repairs at homes plagued by asbestos, leaks and mold. The other set – filed with the Air Force – was altered to show near-perfect performance in making repairs, helping the company earn millions in fees for a job well done.
Balfour Beatty has been pursuing a similar practice at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. With bosses pressing them to meet repair goals, two former Balfour Beatty employees said they were involved in forging records to make it appear their employer completed maintenance work on time at the Texas base, even as work lagged or was never finished.
Stacy Nelson, Balfour’s Lackland manager from 2013 to 2016, said she felt pressure to manipulate records to make it appear the company consistently hit maintenance goals. She said she went along with the effort because, diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, she needed to keep her job and benefits.
“You either make these numbers match so we can get the incentive fees, or you may not have a job tomorrow,” Nelson said, characterizing the pressure she felt she was under. “We fudged the numbers, and even now it’s not easy to say that. I hate to admit it.”
Another former worker, Teresa Anderson, who created maintenance records, said she doctored the completion dates and times. Balfour Beatty fired both employees, though for reasons unrelated to falsifying records.
Internal company emails and maintenance reports confirm their accounts of being pressured to hit goals. In one case in 2015, reports showed the company completed 69% of repairs on time. After a Balfour Beatty manager called for higher scores, the pair changed the rate to above 95%, records show, triggering the bonus.
Lackland and Tinker aren’t the only bases where Balfour Beatty faces accusations of falsifying its maintenance reports. In Montana, a former manager said her staff regularly doctored records at Malmstrom Air Force Base.
In all, five former Balfour Beatty employees, working at three different bases, have told Reuters they filed false maintenance reports to help the company pocket millions in bonuses.
In a statement, Balfour Beatty said it is working to improve the quality of service at all its bases. “We know we have to continue to demonstrate progress in order to rebuild confidence in our service, and we are determined to do so,” the statement said.
The company did not directly respond to specific questions about the falsification of maintenance and work-order records documented by Reuters in Texas and elsewhere.
Since the initial Reuters-CBS report from Oklahoma, Balfour Beatty says it has started an investigation into the fraud allegations, led by its outside counsel Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP. It has also sought an independent audit of the incentive fees approved by the Air Force. Auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers and law firm Hunton Andrews declined comment.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations are pursuing fraud investigations at Tinker and two other Air Force bases where the company serves as landlord, said John Henderson, the Air Force assistant secretary for installations. They are Travis in California and Fairchild in Washington state. OSI is investigating additional allegations at Mountain Home in Idaho.
Henderson said he is “concerned” about the latest Reuters findings at Lackland and has referred the matter to the Office of Special Investigations.
The Army is also investigating “allegations” against Balfour Beatty, said Lieutenant Colonel Crystal Boring. In August, Boring said the service’s Inspector General was examining the company; more recently, she said the IG is not involved in the probe, but that she could not name the investigating authority or discuss the broader inquiry because it is ongoing.
A series of Reuters reports in 2018 exposed slum-like conditions in family housing at many U.S. military bases, sparking action by Congress to crack down on the private landlords who run the facilities. In Washington, the Senate Armed Services Committee is working to upgrade military housing through the defense funding bill or standalone legislation, said committee chair Jim Inhofe. Balfour Beatty must fix substandard housing and, should any inquiries find wrongdoing, return any ill-gotten bonus payments, the Oklahoma Republican said.
“If Balfour Beatty proves they aren’t up to the challenge, we’ll find someone who is — someone who is committed to doing right by our service members and their families,” the senator said.
PERSISTENT LEAKS, DISAPPEARING PROBLEMS
Service families continue to report squalid conditions in their homes on military bases.
In June, Roxanne Roellchen, her active-duty husband and five children moved into a Lackland house with a leaking roof, mold and bugs. She said she found scorpions hiding among boxes and roaches crawling on the feeding tube of her son, 5, who requires treatment because he’s not growing. “Every day we were in that house, we were risking his health,” she said.
Balfour Beatty said it promptly and effectively addressed the family’s concerns and apologized for the inconvenience. The family said it took four weeks for the landlord to find them new lodging. The company, they added, did not submit work orders to remedy the mold and insects; while they waited, the company placed the family in a hotel and then temporary base housing, which also had roaches.
At the Texas base, Balfour Beatty has a history of maintenance problems. On any given day in 2015 and 2016, it routinely had hundreds of unfinished maintenance requests open, records show.
Persistent leaks plagued residents and workers alike. Staff logs documented the woes: “roof leak thru vent in son’s room,” “kitchen light fixture leaks when it rains” and “water pouring thru smoke detectors.” Other times, homes sat vacant for months or years, magnets for rodents, reports show. The company said it has demolished some homes and is targeting others in “due course.”
When Balfour Beatty filed maintenance reports to the Air Force, any open, late and unfinished jobs most always disappeared from the records. Quarter after quarter, the Air Force bestowed performance bonuses and, many times, praise on the company.
Balfour Beatty Communities, a unit of British infrastructure conglomerate Balfour Beatty plc, is among the U.S. military’s largest housing providers. The company runs housing at 21 Air Force bases as well as 34 Army and Navy bases.
It and other private real estate firms run 98% of military base housing in the United States. Many can earn “performance incentive fees” by meeting quarterly and annual goals, such as quickly responding to resident repair requests. The fees, based on reports submitted by the landlord, are a major source of income, generally worth about 2% of the total rent payments from base service families. At Lackland, the rate is 2.25%, records show.
There, from 2009 through 2018, Balfour Beatty received up to $3 million in management incentive fees. The Air Force department in charge of base housing oversight gave the company high grades in reports, applauding its “openness of honest communication.”
In reality, Balfour Beatty was cooking the books, Reuters found in a review of company records and emails, and through interviews with former staffers.
Every quarter, company leaders pressed on-base staff to hit the quotas so Balfour could collect incentive fees. Often, management demanded staff take whatever steps necessary to obtain the bonuses, including using loopholes to improve the numbers.
Former manager Nelson said she relayed pressure from above to her own staff. Email correspondence document some of the exchanges. “It's not only my ass on the line because of these WO's [work orders], but my boss AND her boss!!!” Nelson wrote to Anderson and other staff in May 2016. “Close the ones that need to be closed - TODAY! I don't care what it takes.”
Five months later, she was fired. The company said it dismissed Nelson for poor performance and that, since her departure, one metric of success, occupancy numbers, has improved from 89% to 98%. Yet records show the occupancy rate actually ranged from 95-97% under Nelson’s watch in early 2016.
Nelson said she tried to balance the need to make her bosses happy by securing the incentive fees, and residents happy by making fixes. She said she lacked the manpower or budget to fully do either.
“I was devastated when I was fired,” she said. “I thought everything I was doing was right; yes I was falsifying documents, but I was telling them, ‘You need to fix this.’ ”
FROM 'MAGICAL' TO WOEFUL
A former Marine, Nelson took her first job with Balfour Beatty in 2011 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. She found Vandenberg housing in good condition, and said Balfour Beatty provided resources to keep it that way. “It was magical,” she said.
In 2013, a Balfour Beatty vice president asked her to take on Lackland, one of the company’s problem bases. She quickly saw a much different picture in Texas. She found unpaid bills, she said, some more than a year old. Local contractors were wary of working for the company, she said. Employees weren’t always qualified to do the work they were assigned, like replacing toxic freon in air conditioners.
Balfour Beatty struggled to convince families to live on base, Nelson told a friend in an email. One in 10 of the 900 homes on base often sat empty, internal occupancy-rate reports say.
“My intention was to fix it,” Nelson said, leading to long days.
The quest to hit maintenance goals never eased. Lackland had eight to nine maintenance technicians, one for every 100 homes. By 2016, each tech was responsible for finishing 15 work orders a day; reports showed as many as 466 open work orders on a given day.
The number of maintenance workers per home is standard for the industry, but the number of open work orders was high, Balfour Beatty said in a statement. Another company base, the Fort Carson Army base in Colorado, had similar rates of open work orders in 2016, internal company records show.
In December 2014, after facing heat from a regional manager asking about unclosed repair requests, Nelson wrote an email to staff: “ARE YA’LL TRYING TO GET ME FIRED?!!!”
Company emails and reports from the first quarter of 2015 show how the records were massaged.
In March 2015, Balfour Beatty was far from hitting its Lackland goals, finishing only 69% of routine work orders on time, according to an internal company maintenance report obtained by Reuters. To pocket the full bonus, it needed to respond to and complete 95% of requests on-time.
Rick Cunefare, a Balfour Beatty area manager, emailed Nelson and others shortly after the close of the quarter. He wanted better numbers.
“We need to get this completed and ensure response and completion scores are over 95%,” Cunefare told Nelson and the managers at four other Air Force bases, including Vandenberg and three bases now under investigation by the FBI – Tinker, Travis and Fairchild.
Cunefare, who is no longer with Balfour Beatty, declined to comment.
Nelson said she knew changing the scores was wrong but was desperate to keep her job and medical benefits. She had just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord for which she was prescribed injections three times a week and routine assessment by neurologists. Her non-verbal, autistic son required costly therapies.
“I had my son’s health to take care of and my own health to take care of,” she said.
Less than two hours after receiving her instructions from Cunefare, Nelson emailed Anderson, the work order clerk, instructing her to change the maintenance records.
“I know you’re really busy, but I’m getting pressure about the Quarterly Maintenance Report and all the results being over 95%,” Nelson wrote. “Will you please take another look at it and make adjustments to ensure we are at 95% response/completion times in all categories.”
After receiving the email, Anderson dived back into the data and changed the completion dates and times to make sure 95% were on time, Anderson told Reuters.
A report submitted by Balfour Beatty to the Air Force states 95.9% of maintenance requests were completed on time during the first quarter of 2015. The Air Force paid the full potential bonus of about $75,000 for the quarter.
The story was similar in other quarters. Earlier, in January 2015, Nelson asked Anderson to change fourth quarter 2014 records, writing, “They need to be 95% or higher.” Later, in June 2015, she told Anderson, “Completion times in April need to be adjusted.”
Nelson was not the first base manager at Lackland to fudge reports, said Anderson, the work order administrator from 2012 until she was let go in October 2016. Anderson said she falsified records every quarter, either under the direction of the community manager or the facility manager, who could not be reached for comment.
Balfour Beatty said it dismissed Anderson for poor performance. Anderson said the company never told her that, telling her instead she was let go for failing to pay rent on the home she was living in at the base. When Reuters first asked the company about the dismissal, it said it was performance and rent-related; later, it changed its response, citing only performance issues.
PUSH FROM THE TOP
Across the company, say former managers, the pressure to meet maintenance goals started with Balfour Beatty’s corporate leadership and worked its way down.
Jennifer Benski was Balfour Beatty’s community manager at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana from 2011 until 2017. She said regional managers and executives scrutinized maintenance data used to determine bonus payouts: the number of open maintenance requests, the number of late requests and other details. She said her staff regularly closed out maintenance requests as complete before they were finished.
“There’s a lot of pressure from upper management to meet those goals, and I guess you could say it doesn’t matter how they’re met,” Benski said.
For the managers of Balfour Beatty’s 21 Air Force bases and two of the company’s Army bases, the pressure often flowed from the company’s Phoenix regional office.
In June 2015, the administrator in charge of quarterly reports in Phoenix emailed instructions to base managers on how to get “a better completion %” on the reports used by the Air Force to award incentive fees. The instructions suggested base managers make use of so-called exceptions.
When a maintenance request cannot be completed on time because of extenuating circumstances, landlords can file an “exception” so the work order doesn’t count against them. Examples include having to order special parts, jobs requiring multiple stages of labor, or cases in which residents requested a repair slot after a deadline.
In June, Reuters and CBS reported that a regional manager, Rebecka Bailey, directed the former manager at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma to use exceptions to help the company meet its goals in late 2016 and early 2017. Following the report, the Air Force suspended all incentive fees to Balfour Beatty pending the outcome of an independent audit. Bailey, who declined an interview request in May, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
The Phoenix regional office also told local managers to expect a quarterly report highlighting maintenance numbers they needed to “clean up.”
In October 2015, the Phoenix office sent Nelson one such report, highlighting the response-time metrics that fell short of meeting incentive fee goals. She was asked to “start reviewing/working” them and provide “explanations to increase % complete.”
When base managers hit their goals, the company applauded. “Thank you – well done! All above 95%!!” the Phoenix office wrote Nelson in October 2015.
Work order clerk Anderson said no one at Balfour Beatty or the Air Force inquired to see how the numbers always worked out. “They never questioned me on it,” she said.
WARNING SIGNS
The Air Force had been warned of problems with Balfour Beatty’s maintenance documents.
In a 2012 report, the auditing firm JLL, working for the Air Force Civil Engineering Command, said the Lackland housing office had “difficulty validating … the maintenance data submitted by BBC for its quarterly Performance Incentive Fee.” Balfour Beatty staff had entered incorrect or incomplete data, the auditor told AFCEC, which oversees Air Force landlords.
The Air Force continued to pay Balfour Beatty bonuses. From 2012 through 2013, the company received at least a portion of its incentive fees each quarter, the Air Force said. From the fourth quarter of 2013 through 2018, Balfour Beatty received 100% of the bonus fees.
Had the Air Force conducted a relatively simple analysis, it could have spotted how Balfour Beatty was backdating maintenance records, said several former company employees familiar with the maintenance data system. That system allows users to identify when completion times and dates are edited, along with identifying who changed them.
Instead, JLL and AFCEC were generally positive, praising Balfour Beatty for its work order system and its cooperation with the Air Force, site visit reports from 2012, 2013 and 2016 show. JLL declined comment.
All the while, Nelson said she found herself lying to service families to cover up problems. “I cried in front of residents because they showed me the mold,” she said, “and I couldn’t believe I was in charge of the plight they were going through.”"
1216,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>","Open homes, free rides: the people helping Hong Kong's protesters","By Sarah Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Mak's children ran to her when they awoke to find a young man sleeping on an inflatable mattress in the middle of their toy room surrounded by a miniature play kitchen, blocks, trains, cars and drums.
The legal professional had invited the man, a 21-year-old protester, to stay after he quit his job to devote more time to anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong and then didn't have enough money to pay rent. 
""There are people living in the same city who are in need and we can offer,"" Mak told her 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son when they first asked about the stranger living in their home. 
""I'd been thinking about what I can contribute,"" said Mak, who asked to be identified by her surname. ""I was aware of youngsters in the movement not having enough money or shelter or a place to take a rest. This is the minimum we can do."" 
Mak is one of thousands of Hong Kongers who support activists away from the front lines. They might be scared to participate themselves in largely unsanctioned, and increasingly violent protests, but they want to do their part for the movement. The protests erupted in early June over a bill that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to mainland China and that has since been scrapped.
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen of them, all of whom wished to remain anonymous or share only snippets of personal details, wary of scrutiny by police who have arrested more than 5,000 protesters in more than five months of unrest. 
In this distinctly Hong Kong take on the sharing economy, one driven by altruism rather than profit, the support they offer ranges from shelter to car rides after rallies that often block roads and force railway stations to close – acting, in the process, as free twists on Airbnb and Uber (NYSE:UBER). 
Their stories reveal the breadth of support for the movement, the toll the protests have taken on families and the community spirit kindled in the chaos. 
CRAMPED APARTMENTS 
In a city with some of the most expensive property per square foot in the world, many Hong Kongers, like Katrina, live in tiny, crowded apartments. 
But the 34-year-old church worker, who shares a dining-cum-kitchen-cum-living room, a bedroom and a small office with her husband and tabby cat, has opened her doors to seven protesters since July. 
""It's not a great environment, but if they really need shelter, it's better than out on the streets,"" said Katrina, holding out a blue sheet she uses to partition her living room when multiple protesters stay. To make more room, she threw out six dining chairs and on one particularly fraught night played host to four demonstrators, she said. 
Katrina and Mak are among nearly 90 people offering their homes to young protesters on one Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group, and there are at least two dozen more groups with thousands of members on the messaging app Telegram offering legal assistance, mass-transit travel cards, food vouchers and protective gear to protesters. 
There is no definitive measure of how many Hong Kongers support the protest movement, which has morphed into opposition to perceived Chinese meddling with freedoms promised to the former British colony. China denies such meddling. 
But more than 80% of respondents to a telephone poll of 750 people by the Chinese University of Hong Kong last month said they supported the protesters' demand for universal suffrage, up from 74% the previous month. 
A separate October poll showed that the city's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, had the lowest popularity rating of any post-colonial Hong Kong leader. 
Lam has acknowledged widespread discontent with her government but condemned escalating violence that in recent days has seen protesters locked in battle with police at a besieged university. Scores have been injured in the latest exchanges, amid barrages of tear gas, water cannons and petrol bombs. 
Katrina says she objects to violence but doesn't ask her lodgers what they do at protests. 
She said the bigger question for the government is why protesters feel they must resort to violence. 
""Carrie Lam says she is a mum and she treats Hong Kong youth as her kids. But you know why children do attention-seeking actions?"" she said of Lam, who had no comment on how she was characterized. ""Because you ignore them."" 
Just under 60% of respondents to a Chinese University of Hong Kong poll last month said violent tactics are justified when the government fails to respond to large, peaceful protests. Recent escalations – in which people have been beaten, knifed and even set on fire during protests – could affect this support but, for now, do not appear to have affected offers to help activists in online groups.
""Because they actually support the demands and they are angry about the government's responsiveness, it is hard for the public to condemn the protesters' violence,"" said Francis Lee, a journalism professor who conducted the poll. 
DIVIDED FAMILIES 
Sun remembers the night her mother kicked her out after learning she had been at a protest earlier that day. ""I left without anything, not even my shoes,"" said Sun, one of many young protesters who have left or been barred from their homes after disputes with their parents over their participation in the movement. 
""I felt hopeless. I didn't know what to do, except I knew I still needed to go to protests,"" she said. Months of protest have driven deep divisions in some families, with parents warning their children against taking part in the demonstrations, fearful that they will be arrested or ruin career prospects. 
Many young protesters say they now dread dinnertime, a cornerstone of family life in Hong Kong, because it usually degenerates into arguments over the demonstrations. 
Stress and trauma over the turmoil have created a mental health problem that medical and welfare services are not equipped to deal with. Several suicides have been linked to the protests, and this summer Lam pointed to ""fundamental deep-seated problems in Hong Kong society."" 
Nam, a 45-year-old worker at a teen outreach nonprofit, is in regular contact with more than 200 young, mainly working-class protesters whose parents have locked them out of their homes, cut allowances or refused to pay school fees. 
To raise awareness, Nam started sharing their stories on Facebook posts that quickly went viral. She said she has since received more than 10,000 messages from people wishing to help. 
""Some of the kids think it's all coming from me, but I say there's a lot of people behind me. They break into tears,"" Nam said. ""It's not just about the basic needs, but it's also about the love and care from a stranger."" 
GETAWAY DRIVERS 
Cheung, 27, works in a hostel in the Kowloon shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui – an area repeatedly hit by protests. The owner told staff to allow protesters to stay for free or store gear such as helmets, masks and shields to avoid detection from police, Cheung said. 
""I thought Hong Kongers were self-interested,"" she said. ""Now I can see that we're motivated by public interest. There's no me or you. It's for everyone."" 
Getting activists safely home from protest sites is the aim of many online chat groups that coordinate drivers from across class lines to ferry protesters in sleek luxury cars and rusty sedans alike. 
One such group, which they call Uber Ambulance and isn't connected to the company, has more than 32,000 members and uses code in its requests: Protesters are commonly referred to as students, protests as school, cars as school buses, drivers as parents and protest gear as stationery. 
One post seeks ""parents who can pick up students after school,"" for example. 
Eric, 34, a chauffeur by day who drives protesters after work, told Reuters he feared going to the front lines but wanted to help. 
One evening, three teenage boys he was driving from a downtown protest to the New Territories area of Hong Kong started talking excitedly about girls, he recalled. 
But the banter stopped abruptly when they received a message that some of their peers had been arrested. 
""They're evacuating from the protests, the police are at their back, but they have time to talk about girls,"" Eric said. ""Of course, they're teenagers. 

""Frankly, I'm very worried about the future. But the one thing that's for sure is that I will drive at every protest.""

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedbank's (ST:SWEDa) chief executive Jens Henriksson vowed on Wednesday to ""get to the bottom"" of an alleged funds transfer from a Russian arms company, which Swedish public service broadcaster SVT said may have violated U.S sanctions.
 Swedbank , which is already conducting an internal investigation into suspected money laundering, said it was not aware of such a violation. 
The allegation risks opening a new front in a scandal which has hammered Swedbank's shares and rocked the region's banks.
Swedbank shares were down 3.8% at 1110 GMT after SVT aired an investigative program which cited a list of transactions between Swedbank's Baltic branch and bank accounts in the United States provided by an unidentified Wall Street source.
The Swedish bank is already under investigation by U.S. authorities for its role in the Baltic moneylaundering scandal, but the new information risks exposing Swedbank to greater scrutiny from the United States.
U.S. authorities have levied billions of dollars in fines against European banks for illegal financial transactions that have violated its sanctions against a range of countries.
SVT alleged Swedbank transferred more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) from Kalashnikov Group to a U.S. subsidiary via the business network of a Russian oligarch who is a shareholder in the Russian arms firm.
Henriksson told SVT that Swedbank's own internal investigation is expected to be concluded in early 2020 and its conclusions ""will be communicated"", without specifying when.
Kalashnikov's Russia-based parent company was put on a U.S sanctions list after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. 
SVT said Kalashnikov's U.S-based subsidiary is permitted to sell arms it produces in the United States on condition it receives no financial transfers from its parent firm.
A Kalashnikov spokeswoman declined to comment.
Swedbank has lost around 40% of its market value since allegations surfaced that its Estonian branch processed suspect gross transactions of up to 20 billion euros a year from mostly Russian non-residents between 2010 and 2016.
The scandal started with Danske Bank, Denmark’s biggest bank. It is under investigation in several countries over 200 billion euros ($220 billion) in suspicious payments moved through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 in one of the largest money laundering scandals in history.
""I'm going to take this information and give it to our investigators and we'll take a closer look at it,"" Henriksson said, while not confirming the existence of such customers.

In October, the Estonian state prosecutor said it was opening a criminal investigation into Swedbank.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 06:52AM ET</span>",Shell UK gender pay gap widens slightly in 2019,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell's gender pay gap in Britain edged higher in 2019 following the acquisition of a utility company, with women earning on average 18.7% less than men.
This year's figure, which compares to 18.6% in 2018, comes after Shell (LON:RDSa) UK incorporated around 1,000 employees from First Utility which it had acquired in March, Shell said in a report.
Excluding First Utility, which was re-branded Shell Energy, the pay gap would have narrowed to 15.1%.
Gender gap pay is defined as the difference in the average pay and bonuses of all men and women across an organization.
""We have made good progress in building an inclusive and diverse workplace, and we have increased the proportion of women in senior leadership positions,"" Sinead Lynch, Shell UK Country Chair, said in a statement.
""However, we still have further to go and will continue to work to close the gender pay gap across all parts of the business.""
The oil and gas sector has traditionally had a much higher ratio of men to women. In April 2019, Shell employed more than 6,000 employees in Britain, of whom two-thirds are men.
Shell said its UK gender pay gap stems from having fewer women in senior leadership positions as well as in specialist roles attracting higher levels of pay such as trading.
""Our gender pay gap also reflects wider societal issues such as relatively fewer women studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects at university,"" Shell said in a statement.
Shell UK said it had achieved its ambition to reach 30% women in senior leadership positions by 2020 which it aims to increase to 35% by 2025.

“If we don’t make a deal with China, I’ll just raise the tariffs even higher,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. His comments spooked investors, who have been sensitive to trade developments. Beijing and Washington are working on a “phase one” deal to end their 17-month impasse but so far no details on progress have come forth. 
Tensions were exasperated by the U.S. Senate passing legislation backing Hong Kong protesters, that would ban the export of items like tear gas and rubber bullets to the city's police force, as conflict between the two sides escalated this week. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang lashed out against the vote, saying it “seriously violated international law and basic norms governing international relations.”
The Nasdaq 100 fell 41 points or 0.5% by 6:40 AM ET (11:40 GMT), while Dow futures lost 103 points or 0.4% and S&P 500 futures dropped 10 points or 0.4%.
Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN) tanked 16.1% after missing third-quarter profit and sales forecasts, with the brand name posting flat same-store sales growth. Pacific Gas & Electric Co (NYSE:PCG) fell 4.7% in premarket trading, while Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) was down 1.3%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds regained their appetite for equities in the third quarter, piling into passively managed stocks in the United States and equities in mainland China and elsewhere, according to eVestment data.
Passively managed S&P 500 funds -- those that buy a basket of S&P 500 stocks and hold them rather than trading day to day -- took in $1.09 billion from sovereign investors during the period, the first net inflow since the fourth quarter of 2016, after significant outflows in recent years.
In another sign of renewed interest in equities, sovereign investor inflows to global enhanced equity funds -- which are actively managed -- reached $1.05 billion, their largest since the fourth quarter of 2017.
""This is an indication that SWFs (sovereign wealth funds) have slowly seen their sentiment change in the near term to global equities, both to active and passive strategies, as they had been removing assets at an elevated rate in the three quarters prior to Q2 2019,"" said Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment, which collates data from firms managing money on behalf of institutional investors.
U.S. stocks have reached record highs as hopes have risen of a breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade discussions. At the same time, fears of a U.S. recession have eased, helping support forecasts for corporate earnings.
J.P. Morgan Asset Management this week raised its outlook on global stocks, while UBS moved its overall position on equities to neutral.
Allocations by sovereign investors to onshore Chinese stocks, or A shares, rose to a record level, with inflows of $1.12 billion during the quarter.
""It may be the case that while SWF's exposure to China will increase as a result of their exposure to passive global EM equity strategies, a segment to which they've allocated nearly $7 billion since the beginning of 2018, there is additional interest in supplementing that long-only index-based exposure to China with alternative approaches,"" Laurelli said.
China is stepping up opening its capital markets and foreign holdings of Chinese stocks rose to a record high at the end of September.
Global index provider MSCI said this month A shares will rise to a weight of 4.1% in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index from 2.55% currently, as part of its final step in the weight increase of Chinese shares in the emerging-markets benchmark."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) raised up to $12.9 billion in a landmark listing in Hong Kong, the largest share sale in the city in nine years and a world record for a cross-border secondary share sale.
The deal will be seen as a boost to Hong Kong following more than five months of anti-government protests and its recent slide into its first recession in a decade.
Alibaba said in a statement it had priced the shares at HK$176 ($22.49) each, a discount of 2.9% to its New York closing price, confirming information earlier reported by Reuters. 
The price means Alibaba will raise at least HK$88 billion ($11.3 billion) - a symbolic total because the number 8 is associated with prosperity and good fortune in Chinese culture. 
Alibaba has also chosen the stock code 9988 for its listing, which for Chinese speakers combines two of the luckiest numbers, together symbolizing long-lasting prosperity.
The total raised from the deal could eventually reach $12.9 billion if a so-called 'greenshoe' over-allotment option were exercised.
Alibaba shares closed in New York on Tuesday at $185.25. One of Alibaba's New York-listed American Depositary Shares (ADS) is worth eight of its Hong Kong shares. 
While the discount to Alibaba's last close was set at 2.9%, analysts noted the price represented a 3.7% discount to the Alibaba's share price on Nov. 12 - the day before the deal was launched. 
""I was expecting it to be done at around 4%-5% so this is about right,"" said Sumeet Singh, head of research at Aequitas and who publishes on research website SmartKarma.
""The deal represents just about 4.4 days of three-month average daily value traded and hence, relatively it's not a big deal for a stock of Alibaba's size.""
Alibaba's deal comes amid a late-year rush of share sales, with Saudi Arabia's state oil giant Aramco revving up to price an initial public offering so large it threatens to eclipse Alibaba's own record $25 billion float in 2014.
A deal at the top of Aramco's price range would raise $25.6 billion and value the company at $1.7 trillion - short of the $2 trillion it had originally sought.
HONG KONG BOOST
Hong Kong's army of small investors have welcomed the Alibaba deal, subscribing for 40 times the shares they were originally allotted, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the deal.
That represents the heaviest oversubscription rate for any multi-billion dollar share sale in Hong Kong in more than four years, according to Dealogic data.
Alibaba declined to comment on retail subscriptions.
Retail investors will now take 10% of the deal, up from the 2.5% they were originally allotted. Hong Kong operates a 'clawback' system where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them getting a greater share. 
The numbers imply retail investors collectively put up about $11 billion in the hope of getting shares in the Chinese ecommerce champion.
A float by Alibaba is seen as particularly significant to Hong Kong since it lost the company's IPO to New York in 2013 because the Asian financial hub would not then accept its unusual governance, where a self-selecting group of insiders control the majority of board seats. 
That decision ultimately resulted in Hong Kong rule changes last year that have allowed Alibaba to conduct this listing. 
Bankers hope other U.S.-listed Chinese tech giants will follow suit.
Alibaba's listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Stock Exchange next Tuesday and the event will be closely watched given the ongoing protests unfolding across the city.
China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are leading Alibaba's deal.

Developed-nation bonds in the region extended recent gains Wednesday, with yields on 10-year Treasuries sinking almost 20 basis points in the past two weeks. Australia’s have fallen even more. The Aussie dollar, a proxy to China’s economy due to the two nations’ close trade ties, has dropped versus all its Group-of-10 peers in November, while stocks have fallen from recent highs.
“Markets have been guilty for around 20 months of underestimating the risks of a trade deal being done at all,” said Stephen Miller, an adviser in Sydney at GSFM, a unit of Canada’s CI Financial Group. “Whether it’s Treasuries or stocks or currencies, investors are now repositioning their bets in case we see political dysfunctions persist and reach a tipping point that spills over to trade.”
The haven trade in the region gathered pace after the U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed a bill aimed at supporting Hong Kong protesters, spurring China to repeat a threat to retaliate. It would be difficult for the U.S. to sign a deal if the demonstrations in Hong Kong are met with violence, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said earlier this week.
Investors have been here before. The U.S. and China were said to be close to sealing a deal about six months ago, only for the U.S. to claim the Asian nation backed away from verbal commitments when the time came to sign the agreement.
“The market reaction could be much more negative if a repeat of May happens,” said Eugene Leow, a fixed-income strategist in DBS Bank in Singapore. Tensions in Hong Kong are also adding “another element of risk at a time when China-U.S. trade talks enter the crucial last stage,” he said.
Here are a range of market moves showing investors’ risk-off mood:
Treasury 10-year yields dropped as much as 4 basis points Wednesday to a two-week low of 1.74%Australia’s 10-year yield declined 5 basis points to 1.07%South Korea’s won, often viewed as a proxy for global trade, slipped 0.2%, extending this month’s decline to 0.6%A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) gauge of demand for emerging-market currencies has fallen for a second weekThe VIX Index, a measure of expected volatility in U.S. stocks, has risen more than 6% this week“The market mood is definitely shifting,” said Prashant Newnaha, senior strategist at TD Securities in Singapore. “There are a lot of questions on where this deal is sitting at the moment, and developments we’ve had in May are now putting some doubts on whether a deal can be signed at all.”"

The government proposes to provide the manufacturers land to set up a factory along with power, water and road access, according to draft of the document prepared by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade and Invest India. Other companies that officials will reach out to include Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) & Co., South Korea’s Hanwha Chemical Corp., and Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.
While the trade war has benefited countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia, rigid land acquisition rules and labor laws have prompted investors to largely ignore India when looking for alternatives to China. The latest proposal may reduce red tape, and set the nation, which expanded at the slowest pace in six years last quarter, on a path to double its gross domestic product to $5 trillion by 2025 -- a goal set Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Under the plan, the government will create a land bank for ready-to-move-in industrial clusters, offer investment and location-based incentives and rationalize anti-dumping duties. The proposal includes incentives for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, fuel efficiency and carbon taxation. For the electronics and telecom sector, flexible employment, manufacturing-related incentives linked to investments and value addition have been sought.
The country has made progress, rising 37 spots since 2017 in the World Bank’s ranking for ease of doing business, but it still comes in at 63rd, trailing not only China, but also Rwanda and Kosovo. At present, investors keen on setting up a factory need to acquire land on their own which, in some cases, involves a time consuming process of negotiating with small plot owners to part with their holding.
The Prime Minister’s Office is considering the proposal and a decision is expected soon. An email sent to the spokeswoman at the commerce and industry ministry wasn’t immediately answered.
Asia’s third-largest economy expanded 5% in the June quarter, with slew of data pointing to weaker economic activity.
Getting investment inflows and boosting exports is therefore high on economic agenda of the government. It has already slashed corporate tax rate, making it competitive with rest of Asia, and has relaxed foreign investment rules to attract fund inflows in the country."

The strike at the cash-strapped airline is entering its sixth day, compounding a dire financial situation. Initially the airline said the action cost 50 million rand ($3.4 million) a day, though that figure has come down as some canceled flights resumed.
Striking unions and SAA held talks on Tuesday that continued well into the night, but ended without agreement and with the unions working to follow through on a threat to shut down South Africa's entire aviation sector via a secondary strike. 
A spokeswoman for the National Union of Metalworkers South Africa, which called the strike over jobs and wages alongside the South African Cabin Crew Association, said there would be ""no surrender"". 
Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said a secondary strike notice and strike certificate had been issued for aviation catering firm Air Chefs and airline  Comair  (J:COMJ) respectively. Unions have 48 hours to issue a strike notice following a certificate. 
With no end in sight to the costly strike, SAA's future hangs in the balance. The government has said there is no more money in public coffers to save the airline yet again. 
Board member Martin Kingston said on Wednesday the airline had no cash in the bank and the action was accelerating its demise. 
""At the moment, Rome is burning. We don't have the time or the luxury to consider industrial action,"" Kingston said on news channel SABC.
""Unless we are able to secure guarantees from national treasury - and we're in discussions with them as you and I speak - then the board will have to recommend to government that actually it be placed in liquidation,"" he said.
""We need to be confident that we have the financial wherewithal to trade for the next 12 months on a solvent basis. That is not currently the case.""

Kingston said it would become apparent in the next month whether SAA could trade its way out of the current situation.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were knocked off 22-month highs on Wednesday as a renewed flare-up in Sino-U.S. tensions and the creeping return of U.S. recession fears fueled a bid for bonds and other ""safe"" assets such as gold.
European equities tumbled half a percent at the open, edging further off recent four-year highs hit when it had appeared Washington and Beijing were about to agree the first phase of a trade deal. Wall Street futures were marked lower while oil prices suffered their biggest daily loss in seven weeks.
The mood in markets soured after the U.S. Senate angered China by passing a bill requiring annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy and warning Beijing against violently suppressing protesters. China demanded the United States stop interfering in its internal affairs and said it would retaliate.
U.S. President Donald Trump also threatened to up tariffs on Chinese goods if a trade deal is not reached soon.
""Markets have taken a bit of a wobble due to the talk about Hong Kong, but they had rallied a lot in recent weeks on expectations of a (trade) deal,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier.
Ahmed said both sides needed a deal to be signed -- Trump cannot afford a recession because of his re-election bid next year, while China's economy is slowing markedly.
""I think we are looking at a short-term setback rather than a major issue that would derail the process. The bill still has to be signed into law by Trump so there's a high probability he will use it as leverage against China.""
MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) tumbled 0.7%, Japan's Nikkei (N225) fell 0.8% and Shanghai blue chips (CSI300) lost 1%. MSCI's global index (MIWD00000PUS) slipped 0.3%, ending a three-day winning streak.
Wall Street was tipped for a weaker start with futures (ESc1) down 0.2%.
U.S. shares closed just below record highs on Tuesday, however, and world stocks remain just 0.5% off all-time peaks hit last year.
""It was noticeable that fixed income markets rallied despite equity markets being stable, suggestive of a market that remains cautious about the growth outlook,"" ANZ told clients.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which have fallen in six out of the past seven sessions, slipped 5 basis points to 1.735%, a 2-1/2 -week low (US10YT=RR).
German bonds fell for the third straight day to touch a 2-1/2 week low (DE10YT=RR), shrugging off European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane's comment that the euro zone economy would not fall into a recession.
""It's all about sentiment on trade ... We have this classical risk-off trade taking place again,"" Rainer Guntermann, a rates strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said.
THE R WORD
Moves on commodity prices and bond markets imply fears of economic recession may be creeping back.
Japan's October exports fanned those fears further, tumbling at their quickest rate in three years, with shipments to China and the United States suffering big falls.
U.S. crude stocks rose far more than expected, the American Petroleum Institute said, driving Brent crude (LCOc1) into a 2.6% slide. Brent fell another half percent, inching towards the $60 mark last breached three weeks ago.
A marked flattening of the curve -- the gap between two-year and 10-year yields is at its narrowest in more than two weeks -- also hints at a return of recession fears. The curve inverted earlier this year, returning to normal only after three U.S. interest rate cuts.
But Federal Reserve officials have hinted there will be no further easing for now, a message the U.S. central bank may reiterate later in the day when it releases minutes from its last meeting. Markets are now pricing in just a 0.8% chance of a December rate cut .
Dour forecasts from retailers  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Kohl's also fueled worries about U.S. consumer spending, which has so far been extremely robust, in contrast to manufacturing.
""We've had a bit of topping out of the U.S. consumer in the past couple of months, possibly we are seeing some catch up between consumer and manufacturing sectors,"" Lombard Odier's Ahmed said.
On currencies, the dollar nudged lower versus the yen to 108.4 but firmed 0.13% versus a basket of currencies (DXY). Gold rose 0.4% ."

The IPO arrangers are indicating in private discussions that they already have nearly enough orders to cover the institutional portion of the deal, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. They still have more than two weeks to go, as fund managers can subscribe to the stock until Dec. 4, according to Aramco’s prospectus.
Building early momentum is important in large equity offerings, as investors are encouraged to jump in when they see other institutions rushing to buy shares. The precise amount of real demand will only become clear later once underwriters compare the orders they’ve received, the people said.
Saudi authorities have been pulling several levers to try and make the deal a success, pressuring the kingdom’s richest families to invest and loosening margin lending rules for banks. They’ve been negotiating commitments from the billionaire Olayan family, who own a major stake in  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, and Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.
Domestic Pitch
Aramco representatives have also been seeking investments from the Almajdouie family, who distribute Hyundai Motor Co. vehicles in the kingdom, and members of the Al-Turki clan, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund is seeking to sell about a 1.5% stake in Aramco at a valuation of as much as $1.71 trillion, with about a third of the offering set aside for retail investors.
Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., declined to comment.
The Wall Street banks working on the transaction are set to lose out on a highly anticipated fee windfall after the deal was pared back from a record global offering to a mainly domestic affair. The foreign underwriters will be compensated for costs but may not be paid enough to make a meaningful profit from the deal, people with knowledge of the matter said.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are among the banks that may miss out on the payday. Aramco was initially expected to pay $350 million to $450 million to the more than two dozen advisers on the deal, including banks, lawyers, marketing firms and advertising agencies, Bloomberg News reported in October.
After senior bankers delivered pitches that Aramco would be able to the achieve Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s $2 trillion target with a 5% sale, the Saudi government and Aramco management are frustrated Wall Street’s biggest names were unable to deliver on those ambitions.

1233,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 02:48AM ET</span>",Premarket London: Aviva to Sell Some Asian Ops; Kingfisher Gloom,"Investing.com -- Here is a summary of regulatory releases from the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday, 20th November. Please refresh for updates.

Retailer   Kingfisher   (LON:KGF) said like-for-like sales fell 3.7% in the third quarter, citing ongoing problems at its French Castorama and Brico Depot operations.

“My early assessment is that we have not found the right balance between getting the benefits of group scale and staying close to local markets,” said Thierry Garnier, who took over as CEO two months ago. “We are suffering from organisational complexity, and we are trying to do too much at once with multiple large-scale initiatives running in parallel. Altogether, this has brought disruption to sales and has distracted the business from focusing on customers.
He also noted that conditions in the U.K. market weakened. B&Q like-for-like sales were down 3.4% from a year ago. Screwfix provided a rare bright spot, sales growing 7.9% as it opened more stores.
One other bright spot was that it shaved transformation costs for 2019/20 to between 40-45 million pounds ($52-$58 million) from 50-60 million. It also said it expects exceptional transformation costs to be ""minimal"", having previously seen them as high as 40 million pounds.
Finally, it's also managed to settle a tax dispute with France for less than it had provided - 80 million pounds, rather than the 92 million contingent liability it booked previously.

Insurer   Aviva   (LON:AV) said it will sell its Hong Kong joint venture Blue to its partner Hillhouse, and is in talks to sell its operations in Vietnam and Indonesia too.

However, it’s decided to keep its profitable Chinese and Singaporean life insurance businesses and expects these to grow further in future.
The company said it’s on track to meet its previous profit guidance for this year and repeated that it’s targeting a 12% return on equity by 2022 to underpin a progressive dividend strategy.
For this year, stronger performance in Canada and bulk purchase annuities is being offset by weaker results at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors and its U.K. personal insurance business.
Software provider   Sage Group   (LON:SGE) said it expects recurring revenue growth of 8%-9% in the year through next September, down from just under 11% in the past 12 months. It expects an operating margin of around 23%, down fractionally from 23.7% in the year just ended.

Sage also said it expects to return 250 million pounds to shareholders after completing the disposal of its Sage Pay unit.


Caterer SSP (LON:SSPG) announced a share buyback of up to 100 million pounds after posting full-year results that showed a 12% rise in currency-adjusted underlying operating profit to 221 million pounds through September.
SSP said it planned to enter into three new markets in the coming year.
CEO Simon Smith said ""the new financial year has started in line with our expectations and, whilst a degree of uncertainty always exists around passenger numbers in the short-term, we continue to be well placed to benefit from the structural growth opportunities in our markets and to create value for our shareholders."" 
The group is largely dependent on tourist spending.

Underlying operating profit was 251 million pounds. The interim dividend was raised to 7.2 pence from 7.1p.
The firm said its outlook for the year was unchanged but announced a new training contract worth 300 million pounds with the Metropolitan Police. That brings the order book up to 18 billion pounds from 17 billion at the end of March.

The bank said its quarterly net profit totaled 736 million shekels ($213 million), down from 950 million shekels a year earlier.
It recorded a loss of impairment of about 63 million shekels from its investment in Bank Pozitif in Turkey. Excluding this, net profit would have totaled 798 million shekels.
Income from regular financing activity rose 1.3% to 2.4 billion shekels in the quarter. But that was hindered by a negative consumer price index that resulted in an expense of 76 million shekels compared with income of 19 million a year earlier, the bank said.

Hapoalim distributed a 1 billion shekel dividend from a capital surplus generated from the sale of a 65% stake in credit card business Isracard (TA:ISCD).

LONDON (Reuters) - Aston Martin, which has seen its share price plunge this year as sales failed to meet expectations after a stock market flotation, launched its first sport utility vehicle on Wednesday, hoping for a turnaround in fortunes.
The sports car maker, famed for being fictional agent James Bond's car of choice, has gone bankrupt seven times in its 106-year history and has had multiple owners over the last century including Ford (N:F).
Now largely owned by Kuwaiti and Italian private equity groups, Aston listed in October last year at 19 pounds per share but that has since plunged by around 75%, hit most recently by falling demand in Europe and for its Vantage model.
The firm, which reported a pre-tax loss of 92 million pounds ($118 million) in the first nine months of the year, has ploughed money into a new factory in Wales which will build the new DBX SUV model from next year.
""We're essentially holding the cost of a complete factory right now without the benefit of the revenues coming in ... so from that point of view of course it's a really important model,"" Chief Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters earlier this month.
Aston hopes to encourage more women buyers with its new offering and has received input from a female advisory body on the choice of certain features such as separate central arm rests and the design of the glovebox.
The first trial build of the DBX has been completed with production due in the second quarter of 2020 which the company hopes will contribute to a boost to its output, alongside sports cars made at its southern English Gaydon facility.
""If our volumes are slightly north of 6,000 this year, obviously you're adding another ultimately 4 or 5,000 so it's a big chunk of volume for us,"" said Palmer."

(Reuters) - Power supply to about 150,000 California homes and businesses is expected to be shut off on Wednesday, in the latest precautionary outage planned by utility giant PG&E against wildfire risks posed by extremely dry, windy weather.
Late on Tuesday, the company said it would go forward with the shutoffs from 9 a.m., with some customers likely to be unaffected until late afternoon.
The mass blackout will be the fourth imposed by Pacific Gas & Electric Co (NYSE:PCG), a unit of PG&E Corp, since Oct. 9, when about 730,000 customers were left in the dark as a preventive measure called a ""public safety power shutoff.""
A precautionary outage initiated on Oct. 23 hit an estimated 179,000 customers, while another run in phases from Oct. 26 through Nov. 1 affected a record 941,000 homes and workplaces, according to PG&E.
The latest mass shutoff is likely to run through midday Thursday and could ultimately affect 181,000 customers across portions of 16 counties in northern and central California, PG&E spokeswoman Katie Allen told Reuters.
The outages are a response to forecasts for humidity levels to drop and heavy desert winds to howl through the region, a scenario that strengthens the risk of wildfires ignited by downed power lines.
Wind gusts will reach between 35 mph and 55 miles (56 km to 89 km), with isolated areas of higher gusts, National Weather Service forecasters said.
PG&E, California's largest investor-owned utility, filed for bankruptcy in January, citing $30 billion in civil liability from major fires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018.
That tally includes the state's deadliest fire on record, the Camp fire that killed 85 people in and around the northern town of Paradise last year.
The recent wave of precautionary shutoffs has provoked criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom, state regulators and consumer activists as being too broad.
Newsom blames PG&E for doing too little to properly maintain and secure its power lines against wind damage and has accused the utility of poorly managing some of the mass outages.
Utility executives have acknowledged room for improvement while defending the sprawling cutoffs as a matter of public safety.
The California Public Utilities Commission recently opened a formal investigation of whether PG&E and other utilities violated energy regulations by cutting power to millions of residents for days at a time during periods of high winds.

Even as northern California braced for heightened wildfire risks, parts of Southern (NYSE:SO) California, including Los Angeles, were expected to be doused by their first substantial showers after months of little or no rainfall.

Gross non-performing assets assessed by the Reserve Bank of India were 32.77 billion rupees ($457 million) higher than Yes Bank had disclosed as of March 31, the Mumbai-based lender said Tuesday. The bank has already classified 12.59 billion rupees of the divergence as bad loans as on Sept. 30, it said.
An earlier dispute with the central bank over Yes Bank’s reporting of bad debts culminated in co-founder Rana Kapoor’s departure as chief executive officer at the start of this year. New CEO Ravneet Gill is trying to raise funds by December to revive growth and reassure investors that the worst is over for the bank, which has tumbled 65% this year.
Worst-Performing Bank Stock Is Now Seeing World’s Biggest Surge
Investors are likely to focus more on Yes Bank’s fund-raising plans than the latest asset-quality divergence, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Diksha Gera. “Its impending capital raise continues to be the biggest catalyst for the bank’s outlook,” she wrote.
Yes Bank said earlier this month that it has attracted $3 billion of proposals for a stake-sale offer. A board meeting will be called by the end of November to finalize raising of capital, the bank said Tuesday.
The RBI assessed that the bank’s non-performing assets stood at 111.6 billion rupees as of March 31, more than the 78.8 billion rupees Yes Bank had disclosed for the year, the lender reported.
The central bank also found a divergence of 9.78 billion rupees in provisions, the bank said. Yes Bank has made provisions of 3.46 billion rupees until Sept. 30 and has to set aside a further 6.32 billion rupees for 2018-19, it said.

1240,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 12:05AM ET</span>",U.S. Bill Throws Another Wrench Into Hong Kong Stock Rebound,"(Bloomberg) -- Analysts say Hong Kong’s position as a chip in the trade war is unhelpful for sentiment in the city’s stock market, though it’s unlikely to create panic for now.
China renewed threats to retaliate after the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bill aimed at supporting Hong Kong protesters that added to the risk-off sentiment in Asian markets Wednesday. The reaction was relatively tame in Hong Kong, where shares dropped 0.6% after surging in the past two days.
While Hong Kong stocks have seen a brief world-beating rally, sentiment has been beaten down in the last six months as protests continue to roil the city and its economy. Tourism has plummeted and Hong Kong entered a recession in the third quarter.
The move by the U.S. Senate could cause unrest in Hong Kong to escalate even more, said Raymond Chen, a portfolio manager with Keywise Capital Management (HK) Ltd. Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s government has said it may have to scrap local elections on Sunday if there is a renewed threat of violence.
The House unanimously passed a similar bill last month, yet slight differences mean both chambers still have to pass the same version before sending it to the president. President Donald Trump has not indicated if he will sign the bill.
Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners
China is likely to take offense and with that there will be negative effects for the ongoing trade war negotiations. China is already fighting fires on both fronts and the Senate’s decision is unlikely to be well-received. The market won’t receive this well either, given the uncertainty it creates.
Stephen Chiu, Asia FX and rates strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence
It may affect the trade talks, so really depending on how the trade talks proceed and how Trump will leverage this, he still has the final call to veto. I’d say it’s more like a continuation of the impasse in the U.S.-China trade talks, and Hong Kong is just one of the chips.
Raymond Chen, a portfolio manager with Keywise Capital Management
Now, because of the bill, protests can escalate further. If things escalate further, the impact on Hong Kong’s economy will be significant, it will put pressure on capital inflows. It makes me even more cautious when it comes to markets in Hong Kong.
Kevin Lai, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets
I believe Trump will pass it. The bipartisan pressure is too strong. Hong Kong and China individual officials will be sanctioned. It could create a split among the loyalists in Hong Kong. Other countries like the U.K. may follow. The implications will be much greater if Hong Kong’s special trading status is suspended or amended. That would undermine Hong Kong as an international financial center in the long term.
Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd.
The news may cause some mild profit-taking in the short term. If the bill becomes law, we will see more downside because China will further delay the trade deal.
Jessie Guo, equity research strategist at China Merchants Securities HK Co.
As far as Hong Kong is concerned, its economic situation has been badly impacted by the unrest. So the bill could bring a short-term headwind to the market."

Overnight, U.S. President Donald Trump he “will just raise the tariffs even higher” if China does not make a trade deal.

Beijing also wanttariffs imposed before that be lifted gradually.  Contrary to Trump’s comment, the article noted that the White House is debating internally to rollback certain percentage of tariff. The officials have differing views, but the internal figure under discussion ranges from around 35% to 60%, Bloomberg said. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.7%. Tension in the city intensified even further as the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bill supporting Hong Kong protesters, drawing criticism from China’s foreign ministry. The “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act” interferes in China’s domestic affairs, said foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang, according to an online statement in Chinese, which noted that China “strongly condemns and resolutely opposes” the act of interference.  The two chambers of Congress will have to work out differences between their bills before it can be sent to Trump and become law.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 10:18PM ET</span>",Australia's Westpac slapped with 23 million money laundering breaches,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Regulators on Wednesday accused Australia's Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) of 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws, saying the bank ignored red flags and enabled payments from convicted child sex offenders and ""high risk"" countries for years.
The oversight failure at Australia's second-largest bank led to deep systemic non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws, financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC said in a civil court filing. 
The regulator is pursuing fines of up to A$21 million ($14 million) for every transaction Westpac failed to monitor adequately or report on time.
The lawsuit dwarfs a case AUSTRAC brought against larger Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) which agreed last year https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-cba-moneylaundering/australias-commonwealth-bank-to-settle-civil-proceedings-by-austrac-idUSL3N1T50QC to pay a record A$700 million penalty after admitting to allowing 53,750 payments that violated similar protocols. It also brings fresh scrutiny to an industry still trying to rebuild community trust after a bruising public inquiry.
""These contraventions are the result of systemic failures in its control environment, indifference by senior management and inadequate oversight by the Board,"" AUSTRAC said in the court filing.
Westpac said it had self-reported the breaches to AUSTRAC and had since shut down the service at the center of the complaint which let customers and affiliate overseas banks process payments from Australia.
""These issues should never have occurred and should have been identified and rectified sooner,"" Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer said in the statement.
""It is disappointing that we have not met our own standards as well as regulatory expectations and requirements.""
The lawsuit sent Westpac shares down as much as 3% by midsession, outpacing a broader share market decline of 1.3%, as investors began counting the financial and reputational cost of the lawsuit.
CHILD EXPLOITATION RISKS
""Whatever penalty they get ... will be premised on the idea of causing them pain, that's what a civil penalty is,"" said Brian Johnson, a banking analyst at Jefferies Australia.
Most alarming were details on the failure to address risks of child exploitation, Johnson added.
The AUSTRAC filing said Westpac knew since 2013 about ""heightened child exploitation risks associated with people who made frequent low value payments to the Philippines and South East Asia"" but did not set up an automated detection system until 2018.
Even since then, Australia's oldest bank had not implemented automated detection systems to monitor for the known child exploitation risks through other channels, which meant it ""has failed to detect activity on its customers' accounts that is indicative of child exploitation"", AUSTRAC said.
The Sydney-based bank had failed to conduct due diligence on 12 customers who had made frequent low-value transactions over several years which suggested involvement in child exploitation, it said.
One customer who had served a prison sentence for child exploitation set up several Westpac accounts. Westpac detected suspicious activity in one account but failed to review the other accounts and ""this customer continued to send frequent low value payments to the Philippines through channels that were not being monitored appropriately"", AUSTRAC said. 
Westpac meanwhile maintained relationships with offshore banks without assessing their business relationships, products, customers or payments, even when those banks disclosed relationships with ""high risk or sanctioned countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Democratic Republic of Congo"".
""The risk posed to Westpac was that these high risk or sanctioned countries may have been able to access the Australian payment system,"" AUSTRAC said.
AUSTRAC declined to comment when asked by Reuters if it was conducting similar investigations on the other two of Australia's so-called Big Four banks, National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ).
Fourth-ranked ANZ declined to comment while NAB was not immediately available for comment.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which carries out a similar function to AUSTRAC in New Zealand, said it was in close contact with the Australian agency with regards to Westpac. Westpac is one of New Zealand's biggest lenders.
""Obviously it's appalling and distressing,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Brisbane, when asked about the Westpac lawsuit.

""It is a fairly damning indictment about some of the processes and procedures they've had in place.""

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>","OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma to pay states' lawyers, urged to help victims","By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP got court approval on Tuesday to reimburse millions of dollars in legal fees for states that back its proposed $10 billion settlement of opioid lawsuits, but with a condition meant to help victims of the addiction crisis.
Purdue had told Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain at Tuesday's hearing in White Plains, New York that paying the fees for seven firms that work on behalf of states and local governments would help bring structure to its Chapter 11 case and resolve it quickly.
Drain said he wanted reimbursement of the fees for four law firms, a financial adviser and two economic consultants conditioned on the parties reaching a deal on the quick release of emergency funds for victims.
Purdue proposed a $200 million emergency fund last month that could be spent quickly on addiction treatment while the parties resolve the entire bankruptcy case, a process that will take many months. Purdue has said the money has been tied up by disagreements among states, local governments and others parties over how to spend the funds.
Scott Bickford, who represents guardians of children born with neonatal abstinence syndrome caused by opioid exposure in the womb, urged Drain to reject the reimbursement request.
""It's difficult for me to explain to my constituents why states and government authorities which have the funds to pay lawyers get their fees paid when it could be used for a hospital,"" he said. ""We think it sends the wrong message to victims of the opioid crisis."" 
Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September in the face of thousands of lawsuits alleging it helped fuel the opioid crisis by playing down the addiction risks of its painkillers, which Purdue has denied.
The company entered bankruptcy with a framework settlement it has said is worth $10 billion, supported by about two dozen states and the local governments that filed the bulk of the lawsuits.
As governments perform due diligence on the settlement, Purdue will reimburse their reasonable fees, which could reach $20 million, a lawyer for the official committee of unsecured creditors said at Tuesday's hearing.
Purdue still faces significant opposition led by the attorneys general from New York and Massachusetts, who have said they want the Sackler family that owns Purdue to contribute more than the proposed $3 billion.
The Sacklers also have agreed to cede control of Purdue to those who are suing it, and sell overseas businesses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses ""aggregated data"" from sellers in its third-party marketplace to improve its overall business, the online retailer said in response to a congressional antitrust probe that could raise concerns with such sellers.
Such data, also culled from public sources and Amazon's first-party sales, is available to the company's retail and private brand teams, it said in an Oct. 11 document released by the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.
The panel, which is investigating potential breaches of antitrust law by big technology companies, also made public the responses from  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Data on individual sellers is not used to improve Amazon's business, the company said, and its teams do not use seller data to launch, source or price private label products, which number about 158,000.
Amazon's response offers a glimpse into how data from sellers, who compete with Amazon's retail business, informs the Seattle-based company's decisions. Merchants on Amazon's platform have long worried that the world's largest online retailer would use information at its disposal to undercut them. 
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. In the congressional response, it said use of public and aggregated sales data to spot in-demand products is standard practice in retailing, one of Amazon's many businesses.
In October, the committee said it expected a final report on its probe by the ""first part"" of next year. 
Amazon also said it may ask third-party merchants to lower prices on Amazon.com when it finds the sellers asking for less on a competing website.
Asked how it ranks shopping results on its website, Amazon said its algorithm does not consider factors such as whether it has a competing private label brand, if a competing third-party seller has purchased ads, or if the seller is enrolled in Amazon's logistics program.
It instead considers a product's availability, price and how frequently it was purchased.
Amazon did not offer details on several items requested by the subcommittee. These include how many of its private label products are sold at cost or below cost, how much revenue and profit Amazon makes from selling private brands, and its pricing rationale for third-party marketplace services.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 08:49PM ET</span>","Uber, distracted backup driver cited by NTSB in fatal self-driving crash","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. safety agency on Tuesday faulted Uber (NYSE:UBER) for inadequate attention to safety and decisions in the company's autonomous vehicle development in an investigation into the first-ever death involving a self-driving vehicle, which also cited the vehicle's distracted back-up driver.
The National Transportation Safety Board said state and federal regulators need to do more to safeguard drivers, noting a ""lack of federal safety standards"" for automated driving systems.
The crash in March 2018 killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she was walking a bicycle across a street at night in Tempe, Arizona. The crash prompted significant safety concerns about the nascent self-driving car industry.
""The collision was the last link of a long chain of actions and decisions made by an organization that unfortunately did not make safety the top priority,"" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said. The board criticized a series of decisions by Uber that it said were the result of ""ineffective safety culture"" at the time.
The NTSB voted 3-0 that the probable cause was the failure of the back-up safety driver to monitor the driving environment ""because she was visually distracted throughout the trip by her personal cell phone."" She was behind the wheel and was supposed to act in the event of an emergency.
In March, prosecutors in Arizona said Uber was not criminally liable in the self-driving crash. Police, who have said the crash was ""entirely avoidable"" and that the operator was watching ""The Voice"" TV program at the time of the crash, are still investigating.
Nat Beuse, head of safety for autonomous vehicle efforts of ride-sharing company Uber, said the company remains ""committed to improving the safety of our self-driving program"" after making significant improvements.
Uber made a series of development decisions that contributed to the crash's cause, the NTSB said. The software did not properly identify Herzberg as a pedestrian, it did not adequately assess safety risks, and did not address ""operators’ automation complacency."" It also deactivated the Volvo XC90's automatic emergency braking systems in the test vehicle and precluded the use of immediate emergency braking, relying instead on the back-up driver.
Volvo found in 17 of 20 simulation tests the crash was avoided, the NTSB said.
The board also cited the pedestrian’s crossing outside a crosswalk and Arizona's insufficient oversight of autonomous vehicle testing.
""SAFETY CULTURE"" CONCERNS
The NTSB urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to require entities testing self-driving vehicles to submit a safety self-assessment report to the agency and for the agency to determine if those plans include appropriate safeguards. It said states should do more to oversee the vehicles.
The NHTSA said it would carefully review the recommendations, adding, ""It’s important for the public to note that all vehicles on the road today require a fully attentive operator at all times."" The NHTSA is also probing the Uber crash.
The board said companies actually submit the assessments and some offer little useful information.
NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy said the NHTSA was failing to properly regulate automated vehicles. ""In my opinion they've put technology advancement here before saving lives,"" Homendy said.
While Uber has made significant improvements, Sumwalt will tell a U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday he has broader concerns. ""We remain concerned regarding the safety culture of the numerous other developers who are conducting similar testing,"" Sumwalt's testimony seen by Reuters said.
In the aftermath of the crash, Uber suspended all testing of self-driving vehicles. It resumed testing last December in Pennsylvania with revised software and significant new restrictions and safeguards.
Some critics have questioned the focus on a single pedestrian death when U.S. pedestrians killed in vehicle crashes hit a 30-year-high in 2018, to almost 6,300.
The board is also investigating several crashes involving Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's driver assistance system, Autopilot, including a fatal crash in March 2018 in California. The NTSB last year revoked Tesla's party status to the investigation after the agency clashed with Tesla and the company's chief executive, Elon Musk, abruptly ended a call.
Sumwalt praised Uber's cooperation.
""I did notice that when I talked to their CEO he did not hang up on me,"" he said. ""It would be easy just to thumb it off. Blow it off. Say, NTSB, they're wrong, they're bad, and hang up on us. But Uber has not done that."" 

Tesla did not immediately comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is not liable for punitive damages over accidents that occurred after its 2009 bankruptcy and involved vehicles it produced earlier, including vehicles with faulty ignition switches.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said on Tuesday that the automaker did not agree to contractually assume liability for punitive damages as part of its federally-backed Chapter 11 reorganization.
GM filed for bankruptcy in June 2009, and its best assets were transferred to a new Detroit-based company with the same name. The other assets and many liabilities stayed with ""Old GM,"" which is also known as Motors Liquidation Co.
Tuesday's 3-0 decision may help GM reduce its ultimate exposure in nationwide litigation over defective ignition switches in several Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn models.
It is also a defeat for drivers involved in post-bankruptcy accidents, including those who collided with older GM vehicles driven by others, as well as their law firms.
The ignition switch defect could cause engine stalls and keep airbags from deploying, and has been linked to 124 deaths.
A lawyer for the drivers and their law firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment. GM had no comment.
Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said GM's agreement to acquire assets ""free and clear"" of most liabilities excused it from punitive damages claims for Old GM's conduct.
He also noted that the judge who oversaw the bankruptcy concluded that the new company could not be liable for claims that the ""deeply insolvent"" Old GM would never have paid.
The decision upheld a May 2018 ruling by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan, who oversees the ignition switch litigation.
Drivers have sought a variety of damages in that litigation, including for declining resale values.
GM has recalled more than 2.6 million vehicles since 2014 over ignition switch problems.
It has also paid more than $2.6 billion in related penalties and settlements, including $900 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice criminal case.

The case is In re: Motors Liquidation Co, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-1940.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The American Medical Association (AMA) on Tuesday called for a total ban on all e-cigarette and vaping products that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as smoking cessation tools.
The AMA is urging regulators and legislators at the state and local levels to ban the sale and distribution of all e-cigarette and vaping products, and stipulates that those products should only be available by prescription. 
The group also called for more study on the use of drug and non-drug treatment strategies to deal with nicotine addiction, and is advocating for diagnostic codes for e-cigarette and vaping associated illnesses, which would help better identify patients with lung injuries associated with vaping.
""The recent lung illness outbreak has alarmed physicians and the broader public health community and shined a light on the fact that we have very little evidence about the short- and long-term health consequences of e-cigarettes and vaping products,” AMA President Dr. Patrice Harris said in a statement. 
Some 2,000 people have been sickened and at least 42 have died from vaping-related lung injuries, according to U.S. health officials. Most of those cases have been linked to vaping THC - the psychoactive substance in marijuana.
Separately, a federal proposal to ban flavored e-cigarettes has been stalled for more than two months.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the plan in September, saying a final decision was expected ""in the coming weeks,"" but so far no announcement has been made.
Democratic lawmakers and public health groups have pressured the administration to follow through on the flavor ban, accusing the administration of bowing to industry pressure.
The vaping industry has argued that such a prohibition could hurt Trump's re-election prospects next year.
U.S. e-cigarette market leader Juul Labs Inc pulled fruit, dessert and mint nicotine flavors from retail stores and its website in the United States, as it faces heightened scrutiny over the appeal of its nicotine products to teenagers.
The state of California on Monday sued Juul, alleging that the San Francisco company engaged in a ""systematic"" and ""wildly successful"" campaign to attract teenagers to its nicotine devices.
New York's attorney general filed a separate suit against Juul on Tuesday.
More than 27.5% of high school students in the United States use e-cigarettes, up from 20.7 percent in 2018, according to the CDC's National Youth Tobacco Survey.
At an AMA meeting in San Diego, physicians, residents, and medical students voted to adopt policies building on longtime efforts to prevent another generation from becoming dependent on nicotine.

1251,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 05:06PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed's Minutes in Focus
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday at 2 pm ET (19:00 GMT) will release the minutes of its October 29-30 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. 
At its October meeting, the FOMC cut interest rates, but expectations for further cuts were reined in after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the central bank would stand pat on monetary policy for rest of the year. He has repeated the position several times since, even in a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday. 
The policy statement following the October meeting showed both global trade tensions and subpar inflation growth were key concerns among Fed members.
2. Crude Oil Inventories Due 
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, will likely prove a welcomed distraction as the uncertainty around US-China trade deal has weighed on oil prices.
The EIA is expected to report a rise in crude stockpiles of 1.543 million barrels for the week ended Nov 10.
Ahead of the EIA report, however, the American Petroleum Institute released data - which, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels -- that showed weekly crude stockpiles rose by 6 million barrels last week.
Crude oil for January delivery fell 3.1% to $55.35 a barrel on Tuesday and drove energy stocks lower.
3. Lowe's and  Target  Earnings Put Retailers on Watch
Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) reports earnings before the bell Wednesday.
The home-improvement retailer's third-quarter earnings comes just a day after the rival   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) missed sales estimates and cut its forecasts for the year. That raised concerns somewhat that the pick-up in the housing market may not provide as much a boost to home improvement retailers than previously anticipated.
Lowe's is expected to report earnings of $1.35 a share on revenue of $17.69 billion, up from $1.04 a share in earnings a year ago on revenue of $17.42 billion.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT), meanwhile, is forecast to deliver third-quarter earnings of $1.19 a share on revenue of $18.44 billion. That would be up from $1.09 a share and revenue of $17.59 billion in the year-ago quarter.
The retailer has enjoyed a better year so far compared to some of its peers. Shares are up about 67% for the year, as efforts to boost in-store sales and ramp-up its digital offerings have boosted growth. 
As well as earnings and guidance, investors will likely parse the report and pay close attention to the earnings call for any clues on a potential partnership announcement after Target ended its relationship with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)."

1253,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 04:25PM ET</span>",‘America First’ No More as New Billions Flow Into World Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Faith in the world-conquering, relentless, sure-thing America First trade is fraying on bets world markets will turn the corner in 2020.
Risky assets outside the U.S. are seeing fresh flows as optimism over a trade deal buoys expectations for global growth. Stocks in Europe just took in money for a fourth straight week and emerging markets notched the strongest buying in 41 weeks, according to a Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). report citing EPFR Global data.
Meanwhile, U.S. equities saw outflows over the same period, with a similar phenomenon surfacing in credit. Strategists have long warned on the dangers of overweighting U.S. risk assets, citing leveraged balance sheets and the aging business cycle. But even with the bull market continuously defying the naysayers, conviction is growing on Wall Street that a rotation is afoot.
“Our preference for non-U.S. over U.S. equities is greater than before,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Andrew Sheets wrote in a note on Sunday. “Relative to past mid-cycle slowdowns, for example, U.S. equity markets are significantly more expensive, U.S. credit spreads are tighter and volatility is lower. In contrast, global equity valuations are in line with their average during past inflections of mid-cycle growth.”
Tailwinds for the rest of the world are multiplying. The world’s two economic superpowers are edging closer to a phase-one trade deal that will likely put a temporary end to tariffs. U.S. economic data are deteriorating faster relative to the world. And the revival in cyclical and volatile shares also points to improving risk appetite that should benefit stocks beyond America, especially emerging markets.
This year’s near-relentless rally of American shares and credit versus the rest of the world was looking shaky late summer, with the greenback subsiding from a two-year high and easing financial conditions across the world.
Indeed, the global catch-up trade has been on the up since late August, when pessimism over the global economy waned. But sentiment has whipsawed. Last week, an exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 bested a basket of non-U.S. equities by the most since July 26, which was an intermediate peak for the American benchmark.
But the valuation case looks compelling. The S&P 500 is 28% pricier than the rest of the world, compared with a 10-year average of 18%. Regions like Europe, which has seen equity outflows of nearly $100 billion this year, are especially under-owned by investors.
Traders are taking notice of the discount along with the brightening trade outlook. ETFs targeting non-U.S. equities have drawn $1.9 billion of inflows in the past week, compared with just $146 million for American shares, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Even in the bond market, demand is growing for debt in Europe and developing economies. In a sign of stronger risk appetite, emerging-market local-currency bond funds lured $3 billion over the past three weeks, the most since January 2018, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). European corporate bond funds posted inflows last week, while U.S. credit funds saw redemptions.
Still, for the shift to endure, a fundamental improvement in the global economic backdrop is needed, according to Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivatives strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA in London.
“This would have to coincide with a continued cyclical value recovery on the back of recovering PMIs and a rebound in global capex spending,” he said. “These are nascent trends, but need to be confirmed moving forward.”"

Rosenberg frequently appears on financial media to discuss markets and the economy, offering commentary that typically comes with a bearish tinge. He’s also well known for his daily “Breakfast with Dave” morning note, which is widely read on Wall Street, Bay Street, and outside North America.
“David is looking forward to focusing all of his time and efforts to providing independent, unique macro and market research, as well as actionable investment advice, to his clients,” according to the Toronto-based firm’s new website.
Rosenberg, reached by telephone, declined to comment. Calls to Gluskin Sheff and parent company Onex Corp., weren’t immediately returned.
Housing Call
Prior to his time at Gluskin Sheff, Rosenberg worked at Merrill Lynch, which was acquired by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) during the financial crisis. Rosenberg rose to prominence by having warned of the dangers posed by a U.S. housing bubble in 2005, which proved prescient when the ensuing bust landed. However, he stayed bearish long after the Great Recession had ended, with calls for a double-dip recession that failed to materialize. He began to turn more constructive on North American economies around the middle of 2012, but his stint as an optimist proved fleeting.
In October, he ascribed 80% odds to a Canadian recession within the coming year, and recently penned an op-ed in which he declared the global macroeconomic fundamentals “very poor.”
Onex, Canada’s biggest private-equity firm founded by billionaire Gerry Schwartz, bought Gluskin Sheff in June for about C$445 million ($330 million) and took the company private.
The chief economist and strategist will begin publication in the first quarter of next year and will write under the Gluskin Sheff banner until the transition is complete, according to his website."

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 03:01PM ET</span>","U.S. housing finance agency to revisit key Fannie, Freddie capital rule","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. housing finance regulator on Tuesday said it planned to re-issue new capital rules for mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac next year, in a development that is likely to slow the pair's removal from government control.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said it would again propose the rule first unveiled in July 2018 in light of the administration's decision to begin rebuilding the mortgage giants' capital bases as part of a broader plan to ultimately remove them from government conservatorship.
The decision means the proposed rule may be changed and would have to be submitted to another round of consultation and public feedback, before being finalized. The entire process could take several months.
""In fairness to all interested parties, the comments submitted during the previous rulemaking were submitted under a different set of assumptions about the future of the enterprises,"" said FHFA director Mark Calabria in a statement.
Fannie and Freddie, which guarantee over half the nation’s mortgages, have been in conservatorship since they were bailed out during the 2008 financial crisis, with their earnings being swept into the Treasury's coffers. Washington has since struggled to agree on a plan to get them back on their feet.
In September, the Trump administration unveiled a blueprint to recuperate them, with FHFA and the Treasury saying the pair would be allowed to retain a total of $45 billion in earnings going forward. Analysts estimate that the pair may need more than $100 billion in capital, although the final figure is largely contingent on the outcome of the FHFA capital rule.
Calabria has previously said he hopes the pair may be released from government control within the next five years."

""I'm used to Wall Street getting pelted,"" Blankfein said in an interview on CNBC. ""But going after specific individuals ... is that really good? I'm not so sure.""
Warren, a Democratic presidential hopeful and U.S. senator from Massachusetts, aired a television advertisement last week about her proposed 2% tax on wealth beyond $50 million. In it, she named several billionaires, including Blankfein, who was shown with a caption saying he ""earned $70 million during the financial crisis.""
In response, Blankfein tweeted last week that he was ""surprised"" to be featured in the ad, and that ""vilification of people as a member of a group may be good for her campaign, not the country. Maybe tribalism is just in her DNA.""
Asked on Tuesday if the comment was intended to be a dig at Warren's claims of Native American heritage, Blankfein declined to elaborate, saying people can come to their own conclusions.
Warren's staff did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Blankfein also said he understands the public support for a wealth tax, but called the policy ""completely unworkable"" because he said it would require annual assessments of the value of an individual's estate.
""You'd spend years fighting about it ... and next year, you'd have to do it again,"" Blankfein said.
Asked if CEOs make too much money, another thorny topic Warren has raised on the campaign trail, Blankfein said he did not think ""anybody should apologize"" for the result of how their pay is determined.
Blankfein, a registered Democrat who previously supported Hillary Clinton, declined to say which presidential candidate he supports.
On the ongoing trade dispute with China, Blankfein voiced support for President Donald Trump for ""taking on this issue of how to get China to conform to standards of international behavior,"" and said that tariffs may prove useful to achieving a positive resolution for the United States.
Blankfein also said he commends the efforts by his successor, current Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, to expand the bank's revenue, which has stalled in recent years."

Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that it would be difficult for the U.S. to sign a trade agreement with China if demonstrations in Hong Kong are met with violence.
“The president’s made it clear it’ll be very hard for us to do a deal with China if there’s any violence or if that matter is not treated properly and humanely,” Pence said during an interview with Indianapolis-based radio host Tony Katz.
The vice president said the U.S. is “taking a strong stand with China” while “currently negotiating a phase-one deal.”
Hundreds of Hong Kong demonstrators were hospitalized on Tuesday after a standoff with police, and protesters plan to block roads and disrupt rail service on Wednesday. The White House said in a statement on Monday that Chinese authorities should “protect Hong Kong’s freedom, legal system and democratic way of life,” and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said the U.S. is “gravely concerned” about rising violence in the city.
But President Donald Trump has spoken delicately about the protests while he attempts to close a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping that may wind down the trade war with Beijing.
Trump has yet to weigh in on an effort by Senate Republicans to pass legislation supporting the Hong Kong demonstrators, a measure that would risk angering Beijing.
Chinese officials expressed clear displeasure with the measure, calling it an improper intervention in their domestic affairs. The Foreign Ministry threatened “strong countermeasures” in response to the House’s vote last week and repeated the threat as the Senate prepared to cast votes on Tuesday.
The bipartisan Senate bill would sanction Chinese officials who are found to have violated Hong Kong’s “freedoms and autonomy” and require an annual review of Hong Kong’s special status under U.S. law.
Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that China is “going to have to make a deal that I like, if they don’t that’s it.”
But the president added that he is “very happy with China right now.” He made no reference to the Hong Kong protests."

The index from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). -- which falls when data prove worse than forecast -- dropped below zero on Tuesday, for the first time since December. It indicates that Canada’s growth might be slowing down at a faster pace than what analysts expect, fueled by trade war concerns. The Canadian dollar has also weakened against the greenback this month, making it one of the worst currencies against its Group of 10 counterparts.
The negative reading follows a series of disappointing economic reports this month including jobs, trade and housing starts, giving economists some pause on the extent of the country’s deceleration. Manufacturing numbers Tuesday, the most recent release from Canada’s federal statistics agency, were also weak. Despite a better-than-expected headline result, factory volumes and inventories declined.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday called on  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to redesign the fan cowl structure on all 737 NG planes and retrofit existing planes after an April 2018 incident in which a woman was killed on a Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) plane due to an engine failure caused by a broken fan blade.
The board said the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration should require Boeing to determine the fan blade impact location or locations on the engine fan case and redesign the structure to minimize the potential of a catastrophic failure. The board did not fault Boeing's analysis in the mid-1990s when it developed the plane.
The NTSB had been investigating a 2016 engine failure on another Southwest 737-700 at the time of the fatal incident. The incidents in both flights were what is known as a ""fan blade out"" (FBO) event.
Boeing said Tuesday it will work to implement improvements that address the NTSB’s safety recommendations, including improvements in ""the inlet and fan cowl designs to enhance their ability to withstand an engine fan blade out event.""
The FAA did not immediately comment.
NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt acknowledged the retrofit could be expensive.
""This accident underlines the vulnerability of the fan case to become separated when the fan blade detaches at a location that was not anticipated,"" Sumwalt said after the hearing. 
The NTSB did not call for the planes to be grounded and noted that airlines are now inspecting the fan blades on a more regular basis.
Southwest spokesman Chris Mainz said the airline would review the NTSB’s recommendations and work ""with the manufacturers to prevent this type of event from ever happening again.""
Jennifer Riordan of New Mexico, a 43-year-old  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) vice president and mother of two, was killed after the engine exploded and shattered a plane window on Flight 1380. She was the first person killed in a U.S. passenger airline accident since 2009.
The accident occurred 20 minutes into the flight when a fan blade fractured as a result of a fatigue crack on a Boeing 737-700 jet powered by two CFM International CFM56-7B engines after taking off from New York's LaGuardia Airport. The plane, bound for Dallas, diverted to Philadelphia International Airport. Eight of the 144 passengers suffered minor injuries.
The board noted that there are 14,600 CFM56-7B engines in service with 356,000 fan blades on the Boeing planes, with 400 million flights over more than two decades and two reported engine failures.
Tammie Jo Shults, the flight's captain, recounted in her book ""Nerves of Steel"" published last month, that the engine explosion felt ""like we've been T-boned by a Mack truck."" She said that the 737-700 rolled to the left and pulled into a dive, but that she and the co-pilot were able to level off the plane.
The engine on the plane's left side spewed bits of metal when it blew apart, shattering a window and causing rapid cabin depressurization, the NTSB said. In 2018, the NTSB said two passengers eventually pulled Riordan, who was buckled into her seat, back inside the plane.
CFM International, the engine manufacturer, is a transatlantic joint venture between  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF).

1262,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>",StockBeat – Slack Slumps as Competition From Microsoft Heats Up,"Investing.com – Shares of messaging platform Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) slumped on Tuesday on competition fears as a rival service from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be gaining momentum following a surge in active users.
Slack shares were down 9.7% at $20.86 at 2 p.m. ET (19:00 GMT).
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares, meanwhile, rose 0.3% after the software giant said its workplace communication software platform, Teams, saw daily active users (DAUs) jump 54% to 20 million in October from 13 million in July.
Slack, meanwhile, last month said it grew its DAU by 37% in a year. 
Underscoring the threat from Microsoft's Teams, Wall Street has, in recent weeks, opted for caution.
Just last week, MKM Partners cut its price target on Slack to $28 from $38, citing competitive pressures from Teams.
Wedbush, meanwhile, appears far less sanguine on the messaging platform, with a price target of $14 amid worries that Teams represents a ""major hurdle"" to Slack's future growth prospects.
Slack went public in June to much fanfare as it rallied 50% above its IPO price of $26, though the rally had raised valuation concerns. But shares have slumped pretty much consistently since the IPO and are now 26% below their IPO price.
The Wall Street Journal has also weighed in on the debate, warning earlier this year that shares of Slack were running too hot as there was little evidence that companies were adopting the messaging platform exclusively.
Slack in September reported second-quarter results that topped estimates, but its forecast for a slightly larger-than-expected loss for the third quarter stoked fears about its growth. The workplace-communications company said it expects to lose 8 cents to 9 cents a share, wider than the consensus estimates for 7 cents a share from Factset. "
1263,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 01:33PM ET</span>","Two Officials Say Trump Ukraine Call Was Unusual, Inappropriate","(Bloomberg) -- A decorated U.S Army officer who worked at the White House and a State Department official both said President Donald Trump’s conversation with Ukraine‘s leader was an unusual and inappropriate attempt to get another nation to launch a politically motivated investigation.
Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman said the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy so alarmed him that he reported it through legal channels.
“Without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel,” Vindman testified Tuesday as the House Intelligence Committee began a second week of public impeachment inquiry hearings.
Vindman appeared alongside Jennifer Williams (NYSE:WMB), a State Department employee assigned to Vice President Mike Pence’s office who also listened in on the call and viewed it as outside the bounds of typical interactions by U.S. presidents.
“I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter,” Williams said.
Three days of hearings this week will provide lawmakers and the public with testimony from witnesses with first-hand accounts of some of the events surrounding the question of whether Trump and his allies and aides tried to leverage delivery of U.S. aid and a White House visit for Zelenskiy in exchange for Ukraine opening investigations involving former Vice President Joe Biden that would the benefit the president politically.
Vindman helped prepare Trump’s talking points for the July 25 call based on issues central to U.S. policy toward Ukraine. That included cooperation on the reform agenda, anti-corruption and Zelenskiy’s efforts to end the war with Russia. Trump did not use them, which was his prerogative, Vindman said.
Trump instead made reference to a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian involvement in 2016 election interference and asked Zelenskiy to “look into” whether Biden stopped anti-corruption investigation when he was vice president and his son was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings. Vindman said such a request would not be consistent with U.S. objectives.
“It was inappropriate, it was improper for the president to request, to demand an investigation into an political opponent,” Vindman said. “Especially a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation.”
Because of Trump’s power over Zelenskiy, it was clear that “in order to get the White House meeting, President Zelenskiy would have to deliver these investigations,” said Vindman.
Vindman reiterated that he knows of no evidence that Ukraine interfered in the U.S. election, saying, “This is a Russian narrative.”
Lawyer Alerted
Vindman said he’d already alerted White House lawyer John Eisenberg to a conversation during a July 10 White House meeting when Trump’s envoy to the European Union Gordon Sondland pressed Ukrainian officials to open the politically tinged investigations being sought by Trump and Giuliani.He said he was “invited to follow up with any other concerns” and so didn’t hesitate to raise his concerns about Trump’s remarks on the July 25 call.
“It was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command,” Vindman testified.
The July meeting wasn’t the first time Vindman became aware of pressure being put on Ukraine. He said by March it had become clear to him that there were “non-governmental actors that were prompting the idea of investigations into 2016 Ukrainian interference” in the U.S. election.
Williams said the president’s request for a Biden investigation was “political in nature given that the former vice president is a political opponent of the president.”
Like Vindman, she also pointed out an omission from the memorandum of the call released by the White House -- a mention of Burisma. However Vindman said he didn’t necessarily see anything suspicious about the omission in the memorandum of the call released by the White House.
Williams was not involved in the decisions surrounding the events involving Ukraine, but she was able to give a view into how they were transmitted to other government officials.
Trip Canceled
She recounted a May 13 call from a White House official informing her that Trump had decided that Pence shouldn’t attend Zelenskiy’s inauguration. She said no explanation was given.
She subsequently learned on July 3 that a hold had been placed on aid to Ukraine by the White House Office of Management and Budget. Although the State Department and the Defense Department advocated releasing the aid at subsequent meetings, OMB officials reported that acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had directed that the hold remain in place.
Vindman said he spoke with Ukrainian officials in Washington in August about the hold on the assistance, and they wanted to know what he knew about it. He said he may have said he wasn’t aware of it.
He said he was concerned that Ukraine might lose bipartisan support. The assistance is a “significant” reflection of U.S. backing for Ukrainian sovereignty. Losing it might instigate more aggressive actions by Russia, he said.
Trump and his GOP allies have tried to discredit the witnesses, describing Vindman and Williams as “Never Trumpers” and questioned the loyalty of Vindman, a decorated combat veteran. While Vindman was testifying, the White House sent a blast email charging that Vindman has faced “accusations of poor judgment, leaking, and going around normal procedures.”
Republican Representative Jim Jordan questioned Vindman about a performance evaluation cited in the White House email. Steve Castor, the Republican counsel, questioned Vindman about an offer from the then-secretary of Ukraine’s defense council, Oleksandr Danyluk, to become the country’s defense minister.Vindman defended his record and pointed to an earlier evaluations from a previous superviser with described him as “brilliant, unflappable and exercises excellent judgment.”
He said he dismissed the offer of the Ukrainian defense post – which he called “rather comical” -- and reported the offer to his superiors and appropriate counterintelligence officials at the time.Democrat Representative Jim Himes ripped into Castor for the line of questioning, calling it an attempt to smear Vindman, who was born in Ukraine and came to the U.S. as a toddler.“That was designed exclusively to give the right wing media an opening to question your loyalties,” Himes said. “It’s the kind of thing you say when you’re defending the indefensible.”
In his opening statement Vindman defended his career of service and his loyalty to the U.S. He recognized his father who brought Vindman and his family from the former Soviet Union to the U.S. 40 years ago.
“Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth,” he said.
On Tuesday afternoon, the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting the hearings, will hear from Kurt Volker, Trump’s former special envoy to Ukraine and Timothy Morrison, the former top Russia adviser on the National Security Council. Volker was one of three officials who were delegated to work with Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine. Morrison also was on the July 25 call.
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said as the hearings got under way that Vindman has been subject to “scurrilous attacks” on his character despite his service to the country.
“Today’s witnesses, like those who testified last week, are here because they were subpoenaed to appear, not because they are for or against impeachment,” Schiff said.
Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the panel, used his opening statement to attack the media. He accused news organizations of being “puppets of the Democratic Party” pursuing another false narrative to harm the president.
Nunes spent much of his time questioning the witnesses about their knowledge about Biden and his son Hunter Biden and their activities in Ukraine. Though for the most part, Vindman and Williams had few answers because they weren’t involved in Ukraine policy at the time.
“I don’t know much about Hunter Biden” Vindman said during a round of Republican questioning about the matter.
Vindman’s identical twin brother, Yevgeny, also an Army officer assigned to the NSC, attended the hearing as a spectator. Alexander Vindman has testified that he consulted with his brother, a lawyer and ethics official, about his concerns about Trump’s call.
This week’s hearings -- running over three days with nine witnesses -- are crucial for both Trump and Democrats.
The House inquiry so far hasn’t caused any significant swing in public opinion about whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, nor has it so far broken a solid wall of support for the president among GOP lawmakers. Yet the live coverage and constant drumbeat of revelations could damage the president politically as he campaigns for re-election in 2020 with already low approval ratings."

Vindman helped prepare Trump’s talking points for the July 25 call based on issues central to U.S. policy toward Ukraine. That included cooperation on the reform agenda, anti-corruption and Zelenskiy’s efforts to end the war with Russia. Trump did not use them, which was his prerogative, Vindman said.
Trump instead made reference to a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian involvement in 2016 election interference and asked Zelenskiy to “look into” whether Biden stopped anti-corruption investigation when he was vice president and his son was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings. Vindman said such a request would not be consistent with U.S. objectives.
“It was inappropriate, it was improper for the president to request, to demand an investigation into an political opponent,” Vindman said. “Especially a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation.”
Because of Trump’s power over Zelenskiy, it was clear that “in order to get the White House meeting, President Zelenskiy would have to deliver these investigations,” said Vindman.
Vindman reiterated that he knows of no evidence that Ukraine interfered in the U.S. election, saying, “This is a Russian narrative.”
Lawyer Alerted
Vindman said he’d already alerted White House lawyer John Eisenberg to a conversation during a July 10 White House meeting when Trump’s envoy to the European Union Gordon Sondland pressed Ukrainian officials to open the politically tinged investigations being sought by Trump and Giuliani.He said he was “invited to follow up with any other concerns” and so didn’t hesitate to raise his concerns about Trump’s remarks on the July 25 call.
“It was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command,” Vindman testified.
The July meeting wasn’t the first time Vindman became aware of pressure being put on Ukraine. He said by March it had become clear to him that there were “non-governmental actors that were prompting the idea of investigations into 2016 Ukrainian interference” in the U.S. election.
Williams said the president’s request for a Biden investigation was “political in nature given that the former vice president is a political opponent of the president.”
Like Vindman, she also pointed out an omission from the memorandum of the call released by the White House -- a mention of Burisma. However Vindman said he didn’t necessarily see anything suspicious about the omission in the memorandum of the call released by the White House.
Williams was not involved in the decisions surrounding the events involving Ukraine, but she was able to give a view into how they were transmitted to other government officials.
Trip Canceled
She recounted a May 13 call from a White House official informing her that Trump had decided that Pence shouldn’t attend Zelenskiy’s inauguration. She said no explanation was given.
She subsequently learned on July 3 that a hold had been placed on aid to Ukraine by the White House Office of Management and Budget. Although the State Department and the Defense Department advocated releasing the aid at subsequent meetings, OMB officials reported that acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had directed that the hold remain in place.
Vindman said he spoke with Ukrainian officials in Washington in August about the hold on the assistance, and they wanted to know what he knew about it. He said he may have said he wasn’t aware of it.
He said he was concerned that Ukraine might lose bipartisan support. The assistance is a “significant” reflection of U.S. backing for Ukrainian sovereignty. Losing it might instigate more aggressive actions by Russia, he said.
Trump and his GOP allies have tried to discredit the witnesses, describing Vindman and Williams as “Never Trumpers” and questioned the loyalty of Vindman, a decorated combat veteran. While Vindman was testifying, the White House sent a blast email charging that Vindman has faced “accusations of poor judgment, leaking, and going around normal procedures.”
Republican Representative Jim Jordan questioned Vindman about a performance evaluation cited in the White House email. Steve Castor, the Republican counsel, questioned Vindman about an offer from the then-secretary of Ukraine’s defense council, Oleksandr Danyluk, to become the country’s defense minister.Vindman defended his record and pointed to an earlier evaluations from a previous superviser with described him as “brilliant, unflappable and exercises excellent judgment.”
He said he dismissed the offer of the Ukrainian defense post – which he called “rather comical” -- and reported the offer to his superiors and appropriate counterintelligence officials at the time.Democrat Representative Jim Himes ripped into Castor for the line of questioning, calling it an attempt to smear Vindman, who was born in Ukraine and came to the U.S. as a toddler.“That was designed exclusively to give the right wing media an opening to question your loyalties,” Himes said. “It’s the kind of thing you say when you’re defending the indefensible.”
In his opening statement Vindman defended his career of service and his loyalty to the U.S. He recognized his father who brought Vindman and his family from the former Soviet Union to the U.S. 40 years ago.
“Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth,” he said.
On Tuesday afternoon, the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting the hearings, will hear from Kurt Volker, Trump’s former special envoy to Ukraine and Timothy Morrison, the former top Russia adviser on the National Security Council. Volker was one of three officials who were delegated to work with Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine. Morrison also was on the July 25 call.
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said as the hearings got under way that Vindman has been subject to “scurrilous attacks” on his character despite his service to the country.
“Today’s witnesses, like those who testified last week, are here because they were subpoenaed to appear, not because they are for or against impeachment,” Schiff said.
Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the panel, used his opening statement to attack the media. He accused news organizations of being “puppets of the Democratic Party” pursuing another false narrative to harm the president.
Nunes spent much of his time questioning the witnesses about their knowledge about Biden and his son Hunter Biden and their activities in Ukraine. Though for the most part, Vindman and Williams had few answers because they weren’t involved in Ukraine policy at the time.
“I don’t know much about Hunter Biden” Vindman said during a round of Republican questioning about the matter.
Vindman’s identical twin brother, Yevgeny, also an Army officer assigned to the NSC, attended the hearing as a spectator. Alexander Vindman has testified that he consulted with his brother, a lawyer and ethics official, about his concerns about Trump’s call.
This week’s hearings -- running over three days with nine witnesses -- are crucial for both Trump and Democrats.
The House inquiry so far hasn’t caused any significant swing in public opinion about whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, nor has it so far broken a solid wall of support for the president among GOP lawmakers. Yet the live coverage and constant drumbeat of revelations could damage the president politically as he campaigns for re-election in 2020 with already low approval ratings."

1267,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 01:01PM ET</span>",NewsBreak: Trump Threatens to Hike Tariffs on China,"Investing.com – President Donald Trump threatened Tuesday to hike tariffs on imported goods from China unless Beijing makes a trade deal with Washington. So far, the threat hasn't cause a huge panic among investors.

Trump reportedly made the threat while speaking at the White House during a cabinet meeting, CNBC reported. 


Sentiment on a U.S.-China trade deal has soured in recent weeks amid uncertainty over whether Beijing will agree to consummate the Phase One trade deal, which was agreed to in October. China reportedly wants the U.S. to roll back previously imposed tariffs before it will ratify the terms of the proposed trade deal. Reports have also suggested that China's unwillingness to agree to commit to a sizable purchase of U.S. agriculture goods had also stifled progress on trade. Trump previously suggested that Beijing had agreed to purchase $50 billion worth agricultural goods. 


The market seems to have gotten used to Trumpian trade threats, with investors content to wait for a deal or an official collapse in talks. The S&P 500 was already struggling because of weak earnings from   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) and Kohls (NYSE:KSS) and losses among energy stocks because of lower oil prices. The index was off as many as eight points but was off slightly at 1:18 p.m. ET.

DUBAI (Reuters) - European defense programs should be issued with a single weapons export license so policy changes of an individual state do not affect the supply chain, the CEO of Italian defense company Leonardo (MI:LDOF) said on Tuesday.
Germany imposed a ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia in 2018 after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The ban has been criticized by Germany's European allies since it put a question mark over billions of euros of military orders.
These included a 10 billion pound ($13.27 billion) deal to sell Eurofighter Typhoon jets, built by a consortium of Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain, represented by Airbus (PA:AIR), BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Leonardo, to Riyadh.
Germany has not formally stopped existing deals, but equipment from other European countries with German parts has been held up.
The ban has highlighted how Europe's highly integrated defense industry supply chain can be disrupted by a single government.
Currently, each European company involved in a joint program must receive an export license from their respective governments. If one government withdraws or does not issue a license an export can be unilaterally blocked.
""We have to work on understanding how to have an export license that could be valid for many countries which are involved in the same program,"" Alessandro Profumo told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow.
""If there is a program where the value chain is integrated we need, in my opinion, the prime country, that at (under) certain conditions, can be the one who gives the authorization for all the others.""
European states are divided on banning weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. Some have banned sales to the country and its ally the United Arab Emirates over their involvement in Yemen.
Others have continued to export and argue decisions like the German ban are damaging to Europe’s defense industry.
Profumo said a single license would be a decision for European governments but said it was an important consideration for the continent's defense industry.
""It's not up to me to define how (it could work),"" he said."

Spending by visitors to France remains a major source of income for high-end brands, even if Chinese shoppers, the industry's number one clientele, are starting to buy more at home, encouraged by import duty cuts among other incentives. 
LVMH, behind fashion and accessories labels like Louis Vuitton, makes 8% of its sales in France alone, and already owns upmarket Parisian department store Le Bon Marche. 
Its latest venture, with 20,000 square meters of shopping space, will sit on the banks of the Seine, close to tourist magnets like Notre-Dame Cathedral. 
La Samaritaine is famed for its 1920-era building and gilded Art Deco facade but the revamped store will include a 100-metre airport-style moving walkway through a tunnel to nearby parking. 
""The environment in Paris is very competitive, we had to differentiate ourselves,"" Eleonore de Boysson, the Europe and Middle East head of DFS Group said in a presentation on Tuesday. 
DFS is a retail and airport duty-free group which is majority-owned by LVMH and primarily present in Asia, including Hong Kong, where operations have been hit by street protests.
Facing competition from online retailers, department stores are reinventing themselves as day-trip destinations. 
La Samaritaine, which expects just under 5 million visitors in its first year, will rival peers like Qatari-controlled Printemps and family-owned Galeries Lafayette. Some 37 million shoppers visit the latter's main store in Paris every year. 
LVMH, which first snapped up a stake in La Samaritaine in 2001, said it had spent 750 million euros ($830.70 million) on its makeover, which includes a contemporary, wavy glass exterior on one side by Japanese architectural duo SANAA. 
The store had to shut its doors in 2005 as its original glass flooring was not sufficiently fire-resistant.
Operators expects half of shoppers to be made up of tourists from overseas and other parts of France, who will account for a majority of revenue.
The complex will include a luxury rooftop hotel and be home to 96 flats under a social housing scheme.

1273,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 11:26AM ET</span>","Explainer: From pig power to cleaner stoves, the world of carbon offsets","By Susanna Twidale
LONDON (Reuters) - Carbon offsetting, already a multi-billion dollar industry, will get a major boost from the launch of an international scheme to offset aviation emissions, called CORSIA, in 2021.
British budget carrier easyJet (LON:EZJ) said on Tuesday it would go further than the scheme by offsetting all of its flights.
The global market for offsets of economy flights alone is set to reach $3.8 billion a year by 2025, analysts at Citi say. Aviation already accounts for some 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions and green groups have accused the sector of using offsets to try to buy out of the problem cheaply.
WHAT IS OFFSETTING AND HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN GOING ON?
Carbon offset schemes involve compensating for emissions of the gases which cause global warming by paying for emissions cuts elsewhere. They are measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent and can be awarded carbon credits.
The U.N.’s clean development mechanism (CDM), the first major offsetting scheme, was set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, in which 190 countries agreed country-by-country emission reduction targets.
The scheme was designed to help fund emission reduction projects in developing countries, while also providing offset credits to the developed world to help its Kyoto targets.
WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS QUALIFY?
More than 8,100 projects in 111 countries have registered with the CDM scheme, which has handed out over 2 billion carbon credits, called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), representing 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide reduction.
Projects registered under the scheme range from capturing and using methane gasses in pig manure to create electricity to replacing traditional wood and coal burning cookstoves with cleaner alternatives such as ethanol.
WHAT ABOUT CARBON SINKS?
Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, or REDD, allows developing nations to earn carbon offsets which they can then sell, for projects that preserve or rehabilitate forests.
Separately, new forestry and nature based projects generate offsets by planting which absorbs carbon dioxide as it grows.
REDD and forestry offsets are verified by organizations such as Verra, a non-profit group founded in 2005 by environmental groups and business to set carbon offset standards.
Any carbon offset awarded Gold Standard status must not only show it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions but also that it meets sustainable development goals. The Gold Standard was set up by NGOs such as the World Wildlife Fund.
DO THEY WORK? 
Proponents say offsetting can channel much-needed climate finance to developing countries.
Critics say offsetting emissions reduces incentives for the drastic emissions cuts needed to slow global warming and do not always bring the intended benefits; for instance, new trees may not grow as quickly as promised.

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 11:23AM ET</span>",Aramco IPO banks face pared payday of $90 million or less: sources,"By Saeed Azhar, Hadeel Al Sayegh, Rania El Gamal and Clara Denina 
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - After battling it out for a role in a giant IPO that promised to make history, and enduring delay after delay, investment banks advising Saudi Aramco are set to be rewarded with relatively slim pickings.
The 25 banks working on the listing will earn combined fees of $90 million or less, according to three sources involved in the deal, after the oil company scaled back its ambitions.
That fee pool is dwarfed by the $300 million paid out by Chinese retail titan  Alibaba  (N:BABA) for its 2014 listing in New York. It also significantly trails the estimated $176 million shelled out by Facebook (N:FB) for its 2012 IPO.
Almost four years since Saudi Arabia announced plans to list its oil champion, Aramco is finally going public, but in Riyadh rather than a global financial hub like London or New York. 
The company was always expected to pay less lucrative rates than the likes of Alibaba and Facebook, given it is a state firm and the initial public offering was seen as a gateway to other lucrative deals in the kingdom. But its sheer size, and anticipation that international investors would scramble for a slice of the world's most profitable company, meant banks would have expected a far higher return. 
However Saudi Arabia has pared back its own ambitions. 
Riyadh originally put the state company's value at $2 trillion, but this has been revised down to a maximum of $1.7 trillion. Aramco decided on Sunday that it also would offer only 1.5% of the company - below the expected 2%. 
The world's top oil exporter also canceled marketing events in developed markets like the United States and Britain, turning its back on most international investment and instead primarily targeting Saudi investors.
The banks will be paid 0.35% of the money raised, according to the three sources. This would be around $90 million if the company prices at the top of its range, raising $25.6 billion - still making it the biggest IPO in history.
If bankers had met certain milestones, including helping Aramco achieve a $2 trillion valuation and sell 2% of the company - now impossible feats - the banks would have been entitled to be paid 0.5%, the three sources said. 
That meant fees could have been in excess of $200 million. 
Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Alibaba had 35 banks working on its 2014 deal, and paid fees totaling 1.2% of the $25 billion raised. Facebook, meanwhile, paid around 30 banks 1.1% of the $16 billion raised in its IPO.
FIERCE COMPETITION
The lead nine lead banks will likely get the bulk of fees. They include Citi (N:C), Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), JPMorgan (N:JPM) as well as Saudi players National Commercial Bank (SE:1180), SAMBA Financial Group (SE:1090). 
Some of the international junior bookrunners could walk away with very little as share sales to non-Saudi investors will be limited. 
One of three sources said that Aramco on Sunday gave banks a 76-hour deadline to confirm whether they would stay on the deal. 
Some banks are still trying to secure investment from Western funds, a fourth source said, adding it was unlikely that Aramco would ditch any banks at this advanced stage unless they asked to drop out. 
One consolation could be that the listing will at least help their standing in equity capital market league tables. 
Investment banks have competed fiercely for mandates from Aramco ever since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2016 announced a plan to sell a 5% stake, including in an overseas listing, as a cornerstone of an ambitious drive to diversify the economy of the world's largest oil exporter. 
Aramco said it postponed a listing in 2018 to acquire 70% of petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries (SE:2010), a move seen as a bid to boost the firm's valuation. 
Preparations were revived this summer after the firm attracted huge interest in its first international bond sale, seen as a pre-IPO relationship-building exercise with investors, and the company began mandating the large number of banks.
NO GLOBETROTTING 
Bankers had anticipated spending much of this week globetrotting with Aramco management round meetings with investors – a presentation had been scheduled for Wednesday at London's Savoy Hotel and on Thursday at the St Regis in New York according to invitations seen by Reuters. 
But all marketing events outside the Middle East region were canceled on Saturday.
""Almost all of the book will be domestic, although some QFIs may come,"" a fifth source said, referring to Qualified Foreign Investors allowed to invest in Saudi securities.
However foreign funds do not tend to value Saudi companies as highly as local investors, partly because they are wary of regional risks, the source said.
Such risks came to the fore when Aramco's facilities were attacked in September, initially halving oil output. Saudi Arabia blamed arch-rival Iran, which denied involvement. 

Saudi banks such as National Commercial Bank, SAMBA and Al Rajhi (SE:1120) will cash in on selling the bulk of shares to locals and providing them with financing.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 11:16AM ET</span>","Kohl's, Home Depot forecasts quell pre-holiday cheer","By Praveen Paramasivam and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Retail heavyweights Kohl's Corp and  Home Depot  Inc sent a shiver through Wall Street on Tuesday, lodging weak results and annual forecasts that cast more doubt on the health of the U.S. consumer ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season.
Major chains have launched a raft of early promotions ahead of the Thanksgiving and Christmas period, which is six days shorter this year than last, worried about the impact of cut-throat competition and the shift to disruptive online players.
The ongoing U.S.-China trade war has also raised the cost of imported goods for many sellers as they fight to keep prices competitive, putting pressure on margins.
The No.1 U.S. home improvement chain (N:HD) cut its forecasts for both full-year sales and comparable store sales, while department store operator Kohl's (N:KSS) slashed its adjusted annual profit forecast range by at least 40 cents.
Shares in the two companies fell as much as 5.6% and 19% respectively, dragging down sector peers and weighing on Wall Street. 
""There's intense competition and it's extremely dynamic. Consumers are looking to put more money into savings than before,"" said Camilla Yanushevsky analyst at CFRA Research. 
According to a survey by the National Retail Federation, 79% of Americans are worried that tariffs will make their holiday shopping more expensive. The industry trade body has forecast U.S. holiday sales this year would rise about 4%.
Kohl's said on Tuesday the need to spend on promotions going into the holiday season would hurt annual earnings. 
""We fully expect (the environment is) going to maintain within the holiday period because it always brings a new level of promotions,"" Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said.
POCKETS OF WEAKNESS
While the U.S. economy continues to expand, doubts about the risk of recession have dogged financial markets all year and a Commerce Department retail report last week suggested consumer spending was slowing faster than economists had expected.
The report also pointed to more weakness in some sectors than others, and results from retailers so far have told a similar story. 
Food sales rose 0.5% in October and one of the country's biggest grocer, Walmart (N:WMT), last week said spending was healthy as it raised its earnings forecast.
(GRAPHIC: Retail sales are up but not across the board - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8892/8804/Pasted%20Image.jpg )
The Kohl's numbers, however, chimed with a 1% fall in clothing and apparel sales nationally. Sales of appliances and garden equipment in which Home Depot specializes were both down around half a percent in the Commerce numbers, although the chain itself said its own garden equipment and appliances sales rose. 
Another hint of the direction of travel was results from off-price retailer TJX Cos Inc (N:TJX), which turned in a strong quarter of growth in customer traffic and sales as shoppers were drawn by the promise of its hefty discounts on upscale but off-season apparel and other products. 

""In a soft economic environment, people are looking for bargains in retail,"" Yanushevsky said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A scheme for entrepreneurs founded by Prince Andrew has taken down the logos of its corporate sponsors from its website, as firms and charities distance themselves from the British royal over a sex scandal.
Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, denies an allegation that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured for him by his friend Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in a U.S. prison in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
The scandal has escalated since Andrew's rambling denials and explanations in a disastrous TV interview aired on Saturday left many viewers incredulous, and his apparent lack of compassion for Epstein's victims drew widespread condemnation.
The ""supporters"" page on the website of Andrew's Pitch@Palace program, which is intended as a platform to boost the work of entrepreneurs, was no longer available on Tuesday. 
Cached versions of the page, saved in June this year, showed it carried the logos of brands including KPMG, AstraZeneca,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO),  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and Bosch. 
Pitch@Palace did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. 
Insurance broker AON confirmed it had asked Pitch@Palace to remove its logo from the website. A spokesman said the logo had been placed on the site in error, as AON had no connection to the scheme.
KPMG, which was listed as a ""founding partner"" on the old supporters page, ended its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace on Oct. 31. Several national media in Britain reported the decision was linked to adverse publicity around Andrew at that time. A KPMG spokesman declined to comment.
Standard Chartered said it would not be renewing its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace when it expired at the end of the year.
A spokesman for AstraZeneca said the company's three-year partnership with Pitch@Palace was due to expire at the end of the year and was being reviewed.
Barclays, which has supported participants in the Pitch@Palace program for five years, declined to comment.
Separately, British charity The Outward Bound Trust has called a board meeting this week to discuss Andrew's patronage, a spokeswoman said. Other non-profit organizations are having similar internal discussions, British media said. 

In Britain, royal patronage is usually considered an honor and a boost for charities.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 09:57AM ET</span>",Emirates wants new Boeing jet put through 'hell on Earth' in testing,"By Alexander Cornwell and Tim Hepher
DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates, the largest customer of Boeing's (N:BA) upcoming 777x aircraft, wants the plane to be put through ""hell on Earth"" in testing to ensure it is safe to fly and meets performance expectations, the president of the Gulf airline said on Tuesday. 
Tim Clark was speaking at the Dubai Airshow after meeting the head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The testing and certification of aircraft has been under scrutiny after the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jet following two fatal crashes, while problems with a number of models have led some airlines to accuse plane and engine makers of over-promising on performance capabilities. 
""We need to be absolutely sure that as she comes together, as she starts flying, everything is done in a manner that it should be done,"" Clark said of the 777x.
""I want one aircraft to go through hell on Earth basically to make sure it all works."" 
A panel of international regulators last month heavily criticised the FAA's review of the MAX, while congressional committees have voiced concerns over a close relationship between the FAA and Boeing.
Boeing did not directly address the international regulators' findings, but said it was committed to working with the FAA to improve the certification process, while the FAA said it would take appropriate action following the recommendations.
""The FAA will take its time and do it the way it wants to do it rather than being guided by the manufacturer,"" Clark told reporters, after meeting the regulator earlier in the day.
The FAA was not immediately available for comment.
Emirates is the largest customer of the latest version of Boeing's popular wide-body 777 jet with an order for 150 signed in 2013. 
The 777x will be the first major new U.S. aircraft to be certified since the twin MAX disasters that have put pressure on the FAA to improve its processes. 
Emirates has demanded Boeing test the plane for at least 16 months, slightly longer than is typical for a new aircraft. 
Boeing has delayed the entry into service as it faces challenges in developing the new jet but still expects to start handing them over to customers next year. 
Emirates, the launch customer, sees the 777x as a potential replacement for its superjumbo A380s which Airbus (PA:AIR) will soon stop making. 
But the airline no longer knows when it will receive its first 777x. It was scheduled to start taking delivery next year.
Emirates could also change its order depending on the delivery schedule and possibly swap some 777x for Boeing 787 Dreamliners, Clark said.
An expected deal to finalise an agreement for 40 Dreamliners in exchange for a restructuring of the 777x contract has so far not materialised at the Dubai Airshow which ends on Thursday.

Barring surprises, no such deal is expected, air show delegates said.

(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) said on Tuesday the marriage of its online and brick-and-mortar businesses was not yet generating as much revenue as it had expected, prompting the retailer to cut its 2019 sales forecast for the second time this year.
Shares of the largest U.S. home improvement chain, which have risen nearly 40% this year, fell 4.5% to $228 in premarket trading.
To keep customers away from smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW), Home Depot invested heavily in its online business, primarily by adding automated lockers in stores for shoppers who want to pick up their orders rather than wait for them to be delivered.
The service, known as ""click and collect"", aims to draw in consumers who are generally wary of ordering expensive building materials or appliances without in-store advice on their installation and use.
Home Depot has also worked on its supply network to shorten delivery times and developed a more user-friendly website, under a program called ""One Home Depot"", first announced in December 2017.
At the time, Home Depot said the initiatives were aimed at increasing its sales by up to 6% to $120 billion by 2020, while still keeping its operating margins ""flattish.""
""We are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions,"" Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said in a statement.
Home Depot said it expected its fiscal 2019 sales to rise about 1.8%, compared to a prior forecast of a 2.3% increase. The new forecast implies revenue of $110.15 billion.
""This report could suggest that Lowe's is having a good time going after Home Depot's dominance,"" OANDA Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said. Lowe's is due to report its third quarter results on Wednesday.
The company had previously cut its full year sales forecast in August due to falling lumber prices as well as the anticipated impact new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports would have on consumer demand.
Same-store sales at Home Depot rose 3.6% in the third quarter ended Nov. 3, below expectations of a 4.7% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Home Depot's weak results also pulled shares of Lowe's down nearly 3% in premarket trading.
Net income fell to $2.77 billion, or $2.53 per share in the third quarter from $2.87 billion, or $2.51 per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of $2.52 per share."
1286,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 07:53AM ET</span>",Sales of grounded Boeing 737 MAX gather pace at Dubai Airshow,"By Ankit Ajmera and Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - Boeing's 737 MAX took center stage at the Dubai Airshow on Tuesday as airlines announced plans to order up to 50 of the jets worth $6 billion at list prices despite a global grounding in place since March.
Kazakhstan flag carrier Air Astana said it had signed a letter of intent to order 30 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8 jets for its FlyArystan subsidiary.
Air Astana, which operates Airbus and Embraer jets in its main network, said it was confident in Boeing's ability to resolve problems with the MAX.
Global regulators banned commercial flights of Boeing's fastest-selling jet in March after two fatal accidents. 
Plans for the jet's return to commercial service have been pushed back to early 2020 as Boeing finalizes software and training revisions that need regulatory approval.
""We are making flying affordable for the people of Kazakhstan,"" Air Astana Chief Planning Officer Alma Aliguzhinova told reporters, adding that budget carrier FlyArystan would start taking the jets in late 2021.
The airline plans to hold 15 aircraft directly and may finance the rest through a lease transaction, she said, adding that Air Astana would not change the composition of its main fleet.
Separately, another airline signed a firm order for 10 Boeing 737 MAX 7 and 10 Boeing MAX 10 jets, a person familiar with the matter said. The airline's name was not disclosed.
Boeing has used the past two major industry events to try to secure market momentum for the grounded MAX, which is seen as key to the planemaker's financial health over the coming decade.
A letter of intent between Boeing and British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) for 200 jets, which grabbed the spotlight at the Paris Airshow in June, has yet to be finalised as the European holding company discusses the fleet change with subsidiaries that currently use Airbus for medium-haul operations.
In other business coinciding with the largest Middle East air show on Tuesday, Saudi budget airline Flynas agreed to buy long-range A321XLR jets.
The airline's chief executive had said on Monday that Flynas was in talks to exercise purchasing options for some or all of 40 Airbus A320neo narrow body jets.
Airbus unveiled a provisional order in Dubai for 8 of its small A220 jets from Air Senegal. Britain's easyJet (LON:EZJ) exercised options for 12 more Airbus A320neo aircraft.
Also coinciding with the show, leasing giant GECAS was expected to confirm an order for 25 Airbus planes, including 12 A330neo jets powered by engines from Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), a competitor to GECAS parent company  General Electric  (NYSE:GE).
However, there were no immediate signs that Dubai's Emirates was ready to finalize a provisional order for 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, part of a complex set of interlocking deals driving fleet changes at the world's largest international airline.
The fate of the order hinges on negotiations over the larger Boeing 777X, for which Emirates is the largest customer. Emirates has indicated it wants to restructure the order after delays and sources say it could use the pending 787 deal as leverage.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 07:21AM ET</span>",Return of short-selling bans: market protection or 'war against truth'?,"By Lawrence Delevingne, Simon Jessop and Jonathan Spicer
NEW YORK/LONDON/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - New moves to curb short-selling in some countries have set the stage for a renewed battle between free market advocates and authorities aiming to check investors they see as profiteers who destabilize major companies.
Turkey's regulator banned short-selling of seven domestic banks last month after U.S. prosecutors charged state lender Halkbank (IS:HALKB) with Iranian sanctions violations.
South Korea is considering restrictions while European authorities are investigating short-sellers over alleged market manipulation - part of a nascent trend that Carson Block, founder of U.S. short-seller Muddy Waters Capital LLC, decried to Reuters as a ""global war against truth."" 
Meanwhile, as Brexit looms, authorities in Frankfurt, Rome and Amsterdam could temporarily curb short-selling of companies to counter price swings triggered by the European divorce, officials have told Reuters.
The effectiveness of such bans has been questioned by some academics and institutions including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But the global mood may be increasingly turning against short-sellers, who borrow shares and immediately sell them, betting the price will fall before they buy back the shares and return them, pocketing the difference.
Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war are among political and macroeconomic forces that have buffeted markets, posing new conundrums for regulators. South Korean officials, for example, cited the trade conflict as a reason for their possible shorting curbs.
Such prohibitions have declined significantly since 2008-2012, when authorities moved to buttress tumbling markets during the global financial and European debt crises. 
The former saw about 20 countries ban shorts of a total of more than 7,000 stocks, while the latter triggered bans of around 1,700, according to a 2018 study from the European Systemic Risk Board, which oversees the EU financial system.
""While short-selling can be a valid trading strategy, when used in combination with spreading false market rumors this is clearly abusive,"" the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in 2011 as short-selling bans swept Europe.
The EU agency said countries instituted the bans to restrict the benefits of spreading false rumors or to achieve a regulatory level playing field.
Critics of bans, however, say they undermine free markets, as well as limiting accurate asset-pricing and dampening trading volumes, raising transaction costs for all investors.
Richard Payne, a professor at London's Cass Business School, said that research suggested ""the real effect of these bans is simply to increase trading costs and reduce trading activity.""
'LITTLE IMPACT ON PRICES'
A New York Fed review https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci18-5.pdf of more than 400 U.S. financial stocks over the 14 days that short-sale bans were in effect in late 2008, for example, showed they did not have the intended effect.
Those shares had a average price decline of 12% during that period, largely in line with non-financial stocks not subject to restrictions. Meanwhile, trading costs for those stocks are estimated to have risen more than $600 million against averages, according to the 2012 report.
""Our analysis...suggests that the bans had little impact on stock prices,"" it said, acknowledging that the specific causes of the price movements were unclear. ""At the same time, the bans lowered market liquidity and increased trading costs.""
A 2017 analysis of short bans by ESMA also found there was no statistically significant impact on share prices or liquidity.
The EU agency, however, remains committed to select interventions. This year, it backed Germany's two-month short sale ban on payment firm Wirecard (DE:WDIG) following a disputed media report of financial irregularities as ""appropriate and proportionate to address the threat to German financial markets.""
Fabio De Masi, a left-leaning German lawmaker, told Reuters that short-selling bans could be legitimate policy tools for dealing with traders who unjustly sought profits and could trigger market panic, even if their efficacy could vary. 
He generally questioned the value of short-sellers and said that hedge funds should be regulated. ""Not every financial player or innovation is beneficial to our economy,"" he added.
The Turkish ban initially pushed up bank stocks (XBANK), helped by a broader market gain. While trading volumes dropped to lows for the year in the following days, they have since started to creep back closer to pre-ban levels. 
Financial regulators in Germany and France declined to comment for this story. Borsa Istanbul, the Turkish stock exchange and a financial supervisor, did not respond to a request for comment.
SHORT-SELLER DECRIES 'FAKE NEWS'
Short sale bans are not recent market phenomena; they have roots in the early 1600s, when authorities intervened to support shares of the Dutch East India Company. 
Some critics, like Block of Muddy Waters, see bans and other actions against shorts as part of a broader political narrative.
""The restrictions are a way of codifying the 'fake news' moniker that really means 'truthful but uncomfortable news',"" Block said.
He added that after Germany and France opened investigations into short-sellers for their bets against companies there, he hesitated to speak publicly about his short positions in both countries. 
State prosecutors in Germany, France and Italy have investigated short-sellers related to their research and bets against Wirecard, French retailer  Casino  (PA:CASP) and Italian bio-plastics maker Bio-on (MI:ON), respectively.
Dan David, another U.S. short seller, known for betting against Chinese companies, said he feared similar actions by global regulators if a recession hits. 
""This kind of intervention never works in the long term but never fails politically in the short term,"" he added. 
Khaled Abdel Majeed, founder of London-based hedge fund firm Mena Capital, said the Turkish ban was a sign of economic weakness and that he was inclined to stay out of the country.
""Any country that tries to influence the market by issuing new laws, that's not a good sign,"" he said.
Kerr Neilson, founder of $17 billion global equity investor Platinum Asset Management in Sydney, said that departures from global free-trade norms were accelerating, which could include more government action against short-sellers. 

""We're living in a world of interventions,"" he said.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - Specialized fund managers who pioneered green investing for decades are missing out on some of the spoils as the sector goes mainstream and large firms move in.
So-called sustainable funds, which pick stocks based on environmental, social or governance (ESG) criteria, are on track to take in more than $16 billion in net new deposits this year, triple last year's record of $5.5 billion, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc.
But the new money has largely gone to top asset managers like BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Vanguard Group, which were late to the sector. BlackRock's iShares ETF line had the most inflow, with $3.75 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, with Vanguard in third place with $2 billion of new money.
Meanwhile, several well-known socially responsible investment firms that began developing the sector as early as 1971 have had net customer withdrawals from their mutual funds this year, Morningstar found.
Those included Parnassus Investments and Pax World Funds. Another, Boston Common Asset Management, had net outflows through September but turned things around in October in its mutual funds, which account for only about 10% of its assets.
The main reason for the pattern is structural: the top firms have the scale to handle big institutional deposits, often in low-cost passive funds that track indexes and do not require active stock-picking.
""We're not getting those same kinds of flows and yes, that's a little frustrating,"" said Pax World Senior Vice President Julie Gorte.
She spoke during a sustainable-investing conference in Colorado last week, The SRI Conference, which drew a record attendance of about 900 people. Sustainable investing still represents just a small fraction of the $21 trillion U.S. mutual fund market but lately has proven popular, especially with young investors concerned about climate change and social issues.
To differentiate themselves, Gorte's firm and others say they are better activists and press harder for corporate policy changes compared with the index shops, which do not file shareholder resolutions, rarely single out companies for attention and hold oil and gas companies widely in their portfolios.
For instance, Pax World last week refiled a shareholder proposal asking  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) to report on gender pay equality, and Parnassus in September swore off investments in fossil fuel companies. For its part, Boston Common touts how it held talks with retailers like Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) and  Kroger Co  (N:KR) on nutrition and food waste.
""That's our core message, that we're an advanced authentic sustainability player,"" said Lauren Compere, Boston Common's director of shareholder engagement.
BlackRock and Vanguard argue that their approach resonates with clients. ""Sustainable investing has moved from a satellite allocation to the core of a portfolio for financial advisers and institutional investors,"" a BlackRock spokesman said.
Vanguard executives said the firm offers a wide range of products aimed at clients with many different views and financial needs. Some may want only to have certain sectors screened out of their index funds, while others ""may desire a more active approach,"" said spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann.
To be sure, Morningstar found other sustainable firms took in money this year, including Green Century Capital Management and Trillium Asset Management. They had $35.4 million and $16.6 million in net new deposits respectively through September, small amounts compared with the index firms.
Traditionally, socially minded funds had poorer performance. But that penalty has faded as top companies, including Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT), took steps like using more solar power, allowing sustainable funds to invest in them and to participate in the steady rise of their stock prices.
The $3.8 billion Parnassus Endeavor Fund (O:PARWX), for instance, was up 29% this year through Nov. 15, 2.27 percentage points better than its benchmark Russell 1000 index. Over the past five years its total annualized return of 11.75% beat 95 percent of peer funds, according to Morningstar.
Like other active funds, however, it has had some down years, which has steered investors to passive products with more consistent performance like the $6.7 billion Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund. (O:VFTNX) It is up 28% so far this year, 1.76 percentage points better than the benchmark Russell 1000 index. Its 5-year total annualized return of 12.07% beat 97 percent of peer funds.
Parnassus Chief Marketing Officer Joe Sinha said flows can return if markets turn choppy while managers use sustainability as a marker to pick well-run companies. Until then, his firm and rivals may face headwinds.
""We're not immune to the trend into passive investing,"" he said."
1289,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 07:02AM ET</span>",How to make the most of a zero-commission world,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - How interested are people in trading stocks for free?
Very.
In early October, after TD Ameritrade announced it was switching to zero commissions from $6.95 on most trades, client call volume increased 20% and new client call volume shot up 40%, the company said.
But that does not mean that there is a whole new cadre of day traders swapping exchange-traded funds every hour, even as the likes of E-Trade, Fidelity and Schwab joined the fray to offer zero commissions.
At Schwab, trading volume actually decreased in October, according to the company.
""We see zero commissions as a way to provide access and lower friction to people who want to buy in a brokerage account or elsewhere. We don’t think people will trade actively,"" said Rob Williams (NYSE:WMB), vice president of financial planning at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) and a certified financial planner.
As investors wade cautiously into this new world of free trading, here is how to make the most of it as well as what to avoid:
*Retirement accounts
Zero commissions will not make much difference in workplace 401(k) plans (or your college savings 529 account), which heavily favor target-date mutual funds that you typically set once and do not trade again until you cash out.
But you could change the way you deal with the existing balance in your rollover individual retirement account (IRA) or Roth IRA, and any new contributions you make, where clients lean more toward low-cost index ETFs.
If you are a once-a-year contributor, you might want to think about stretching that out - known as dollar-cost averaging - so you are not dependent on how the market is doing on any one particular day.
""I think this is a great opportunity for those folks to dollar-cost-average and invest in smaller increments and get involved in stocks that you might not have gotten involved in before,"" said Josh Rowe-Heupler, general manager of investing for LendingTree.
You can also save money rebalancing, which you need to do if market forces sway your portfolio away from your long-term goals.
At the investment management firm Rebalance, clients are saving about $35 a pop for twice yearly rebalancing, said Mitch Tuchman, managing director and chief investment officer.
""The end of commission marks the end of a conflicted way of doing business that has been in place since the beginning of the stock market. We can now put a stake in the ground and say it's dead,"" Tuchman said.
* Investing small amounts
Before October, if you had $100 to save, your options were not good for investing because even a $4.95 transaction fee would eat significantly into your potential returns. You might be discouraged from doing positive things, like saving in your triple-tax-free Health Savings Account or putting just a little bit of money into a Roth IRA.
""Many times customers don’t realize that they leave their money in cash for a long time - longer than they think,"" said Ram Subramaniam, president of Fidelity Brokerage Services, where cash in brokerage accounts earns 1.33% at the moment. ""One of the first do's is to make sure whatever cash you have works for you.""
* Emergency funds
Not all cash is meant to be invested, however.
""It’s very prudent to have emergency funds,"" said Steve Quirk, vice president of trading and education at TD Ameritrade. But, that said, investors know how little interest they earn on cash. When they see the S&P 500 up more than 20% for the year, they want to participate in that.
""Now you can, at least in a portion,"" Quirk said, because with ETFs you can get in and out in milliseconds for no cost.
As for those who worry about investors hooked on trading, Quirk draws the analogy with exercising: ""If health clubs were suddenly free, are we nervous that people will overexercise? You just have to do it in a prudent manner.""
(The story corrects that 'most' trades are free instead of 'all in the 3rd paragraph.)

However, the unions said that once the merger deal was signed, they would be seeking detailed information about the plans for the combined company.
At a PSA works council meeting, all trade union representatives on the council voted to give a favourable opinion on the merger.
""We will remain vigilant about the social impact and await a clearer and more detailed picture of the plan's implications for plants, volume, and how much work will be given to the foundries,"" said Franck Don, representative of the CFTC union.
""But the project in the form it's been presented makes sense because the two groups complement each other, are in good financial health, and thanks to the new format will attain a critical size which is vital in the auto business today.""
The merger would help the firms pool resources to meet tough new emissions rules and investments in electric and self-driving vehicles, as well as counter a broader downturn in car markets.
Securing support from Europe's powerful trade unions will be critical for the merged company, which will employ more than 400,000 staff and operate hundreds of factories worldwide.

The deal has stirred concerns in Germany and Britain where plants making Opel and Vauxhall cars have seen jobs cut in recent year as part of a cost-cutting drive.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 06:43AM ET</span>","A year after arrest, Ghosn seeks trial date, access to evidence","By Naomi Tajitsu and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - A year after his arrest, Nissan ex-Chairman Carlos Ghosn remains stuck in Tokyo under stringent bail conditions and without a trial date as he seeks access to a trove of Nissan emails and other evidence to fight charges of financial misconduct.
His lawyers have asked a court to grant access to 6,000 pieces of evidence collected from Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) such as electronic communications, which they say is crucial for a fair trial, showed an Oct. 4 court filing seen by Reuters.
The once-feted executive has spent 129 days in detention since his arrest shortly after his private jet touched down at a Tokyo airport on Nov. 19, 2018. He faces four charges - which he denies - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.
Nissan sacked Ghosn, saying its internal investigations revealed misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.
An earlier court ruling allowed prosecutors to hand back evidence to Nissan during pretrial wrangling over witnesses and evidence similar to the U. S. discovery process.
If prosecutors are ""given the freedom to unilaterally delete the collected evidence and return it to relevant parties, this is equivalent to granting the investigative agencies the right to destroy evidence,"" showed the filing to the Tokyo District Court.
The lawyers also asked the court to rescind the earlier ruling, saying some evidence could be erased by Nissan to protect confidential business information.
They argued the ""ruling deprives Mr. Ghosn of his right to receive a fair public trial by an impartial court"", as it enabled prosecutors to view and use the evidence and withhold it from the defense.
Prosecutors are not required to hand over all evidence they or the police gather during investigations unless ordered by the court, unlike in the U.S. discovery process where prosecutors and defense lawyers disclose the evidence they intend to present in court.
A spokeswoman for the Tokyo prosecutors' office said the office could not comment on individual cases. A Nissan spokeswoman declined to comment.
Ghosn's lawyers have also asked the court to dismiss all charges against him, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the automaker by French alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), of which Ghosn was also chairman.
""Tokyo prosecutors have repeatedly and systematically denied Mr. Ghosn fundamental rights of due process and turned the presumption of innocence on its head,"" Ghosn's legal team said in a statement to mark the anniversary of his arrest.
As well as a defense team of four attorneys in Japan led by Junichiro Hironaka, known as the Razor, Ghosn hired nine other lawyers in Europe and the United States to help prepare for a trial they estimate may not start until April at the earliest.
In Japan, suspects who deny charges brought against them are often detained for long periods and subject to intense questioning without a lawyer present, a system some observers have criticized as ""hostage justice"".

Japan's prosecutors have repeatedly dismissed that criticism, saying Ghosn has been treated well and in accordance with the law.

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 06:18AM ET</span>","One week in, Netflix's stock is weathering Disney+","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street's reaction so far to Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) long-awaited streaming service suggests investors believe the competition may not be as crushing as expected for entertainment rival Netflix Inc (O:NFLX). 
Shares of Disney have surged 8% since the launch of Disney+ a week ago, helped along by 10 million sign-ups for the service in its first day. But during the same period, Netflix's stock recovered from an initial slump and is now up nearly 3%, with some investors betting the two companies' streaming offerings may be able to coexist.
On Monday, Disney rose 2.1% to $147.65, just shy of its record high close on Nov. 13, while Netflix climbed 2.6% to its highest close since August. 
""I’m a consumer of both services and I can tell you that what my kids watch on Netflix is not what they watch on Disney+. Now I get it, and the market is reacting to that, appreciating the shares of both companies,"" said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.
Baker Avenue owns shares of Disney and recently began buying Netflix shares.
Investors for months have viewed the looming launch of Disney+ as the most dangerous challenge yet to Netflix's dominance of an increasingly crowded video streaming market. Disney's stock has risen 27% since April when Disney+ was unveiled, while Netflix remains down 18%.
(GRAPHIC: Disney vs Netflix - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8835/8749/DIS%20vs%20NET.png )
Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings warned in September that competition arising from the entrance of Apple (O:AAPL), Disney and NBC to the global streaming market would spark a surge in content costs, adding to worries about Netflix's already slowing subscriber growth.
Apple earlier this month launched its streaming video service, with a slim offering of original shows, for $5 per month, compared to Netflix's $13 per month standard price. AT&T's HBO Max is set to launch in early in 2020.
Disney's $7 per month service includes family-friendly new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the world’s most popular entertainment franchises. But Disney+ steers clear of content aimed at more mature audiences, often popular on Netflix, giving consumers reasons to pay for both, Lip said. 
Following its recent surge, Disney’s stock is trading at 23 times expected earnings, its highest forward earnings valuation since 2004, according to Refinitiv data. As investors reconsider the value of Netflix, its forward earnings multiple has been trading at under 60 since September, far below its average of 148 over the past five years.
Chuck Carlson, chief executive of Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana, has been advising clients to avoid Netflix due to its valuation, rising production costs and concerns about weak subscriber growth.

""Because Netflix is the leader, it has the most to lose, and now we are going to start seeing pretty steady data points coming out from all of the other streaming services,"" Carlson said. ""It still seems to be a tough story for Netflix.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - A string of powerful typhoons that struck Japan has left scars on the country's non-life insurers, with industry giants likely forced to pay a combined $8 billion in insurance payments in the current fiscal year that ends in March.
Japan's top three non-life insurers -  MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings  (T:8725), Sompo Holdings (T:8630) and Tokio Marine Holdings (T:8766) - said on Tuesday that insurance payments for damages from two recent strong typhoons will reach a combined 868.8 billion yen ($8 billion).
That followed a hefty 1.5 trillion yen in insurance payments in the previous year, when torrential rain in western Japan led to severe flooding and landslides that killed more than 200 people in the country's deadliest weather disaster in 36 years.
Sompo Holdings downgraded its net profit estimate for the current fiscal year to 118 billion yen, down 19.5% from the previous year and a turnaround from an initial estimate of a 14.6% profit increase on last year.
The rising risk from natural disasters has become hard to ignore for Japanese companies. Some non-life insurers are considering raising insurance fees to make up for the cost.
""We'd like to consider raising fees"" in response to a series of big natural disasters in the current year and a rising number of old houses suffering from water leaks, said Hirokazu Fujita, senior managing director of Tokio Marine.
Last month, Typhoon Hagibis caused 71 rivers to burst 140 levees over vast areas in eastern Japan, following massive floods and power outages from Typhoon Faxai in September.
The scars of the powerful storms, as well as occasional earthquakes, have shed light on the vulnerability of corporate Japan to the fallout from huge natural disasters.
Three quarters of Japanese companies have been hurt by natural disasters over the past two years, suffering damage to factories, office buildings, distribution networks and supply chains, a Reuters survey found."

These companies mostly beat lowered market expectations as consumer spending remained strong, boosted by Chinese shoppers who opted to buy at home than to travel abroad, as a weaker yuan inflated travel costs.
Profits at Chinese companies grew 10% in the July-September period, beating the 2% growth rate analysts had predicted, and ahead of China's slowing economic growth rate. Only companies with a market capitalization of over $1 billion and tracked by at least three analysts are covered in this analysis.

Full-year profit before tax at EasyJet (LON:EZJ) will be between 420 and 430 million pounds ($554-$557 million), the airline said after what it called a ""solid performance in the fourth quarter with robust customer demand"", despite storms across Europe and operational issues at Gatwick Airport.
The effects of the economic slowdown, which has exposed the sector's excessive investment in growing capacity in recent years, were clearly visible in the airline's preliminary update. The airline's load factor fell 1.4 points from the 2018 fiscal year to 91.5, as an 8.6% rise in passengers to 96 million failed to keep pace with a 10.3% rise in available seat-kilometers.
The airline also reported a 12% rise in unit costs for the year due to higher fuel costs (1.42 billion pounds in total, including emissions trading system costs), as well as foreign exchange headwinds of 14 million pounds.
EasyJet is cutting capacity growth to only 2% in the first quarter of the new fiscal year. Bookings are in line with the same time last year, it added.
 
Struggling commercial landlord   Hammerson   (LON:HMSO) said it had sold a retail park in Gloucester to a local authority for 54 million pounds, the latest in a series of planned disposals aimed at raising cash and strengthening its balance sheet.
The company said it has now raised 577 million pounds in disposals this year, well ahead of its 2019 target of 500 million.
The sale price was some 8% below the asset’s book value and will give the buyer an initial net yield of 8.5%.
CEO David Atkins hinted in a statement that the company would use any spare cash to invest in its City Quarters project pipeline “which is core to the future direction and success of our business.""
  Drax   (LON:DRX), the company transforming England's biggest coal-fired power plant into a biomass operation, upheld its profit guidance for the full year ahead of a capital markets day.
The company confirmed EBITDA expectations for the full year. The latest analyst consensus is around 409 million pounds. Around one quarter of that will come from assets it bought last year from Spain's   Iberdrola   (MC:IBE). It noted a particularly strong performance from the acquired pumped storage business.
However, it noted that coal operating conditions remain ""challenging"". U.K. coal plants are spending ever-longer periods in mothballs due to the growing share of renewables in the U.K. power mix.
Much of Drax's expected profit is due to payments from the U.K.'s backup capacity market which had been frozen due to a EU antitrust investigation. Drax expects 75 million of payments for that to hit its books in January.
The company said it's also made progress in lightening its debt burden after refinancing the credit facility it used for the  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) deal, lengthening the group maturity profile to 2029. The new facility also becomes cheaper if Drax outperforms a benchmark tracking its carbon emissions. 
  Melrose   (LON:MRON), the corporate buyout specialist that acquired engineering group GKN (LON:GKN) last year, said trading had been as expected in the four month through October, with better-than-expected sales growth of 5% at its aerospace division offsetting a temporary slowdown in the automotive unit caused by the lengthy strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM).
The powder metallurgy unit saw sales fall 13% on the year, due to the same strike, but were otherwise in line with expectations.
Automotive profits and margins were still higher than a year ago, the company added.
“The improvements in the businesses are being delivered at pace and the Melrose Board is confident this will unlock significant further shareholder value,” the company said in its statement.
CORRECTION: The initial version of this story incorrectly reported Drax's expectations for full-year group EBITDA."

(Reuters) - Growth-dependent cyclical stocks drove European shares to a four-year high on Tuesday as a temporary reprieve for China's Huawei from U.S. sanctions encouraged bets that the world's largest economies could reach a trade truce.
After a hesitant start, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.5% to its highest level since July 2015, with cyclical sectors rallying. The index is now flirting with record highs hit in April 2015.
Automakers (SXAP) rebounded from their worst session in six weeks as data showed passenger car registrations in Europe rose to their highest since 2009 in October, driven by robust demand in Germany and France, and a rebound in demand for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
Volkswagen shares rose 2%, while trade-reliant miners (SXPP) and industrials (SXNP) gained between 0.9 and 1%.
The Trump administration on Monday issued a new 90-day extension allowing U.S. companies to continue doing business with China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
The report soothed nerves after a report on Monday that said Beijing was pessimistic about the prospects of sealing a trade pact with Washington.
""The daily (gain) for stock markets shows investors are not necessarily buying the negative headlines,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London. ""There seems to be a general feeling of when, rather if at all, a deal will be struck.""
After a shaky few months for stock markets, worried by the prospect that the trade issues would drive the world economy into recession, third quarter corporate results over the last month have proved less bad than feared, fuelling a new rally.
Most sectors in the benchmark European index rose, with media stocks (SXMP) one outlier due to a 19.7% slide for Luxemburg-based satellite provider SES (PA:SESFd) after Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said he backed a public rather than private auction of spectrum for next-generation 5G wireless networks.
Another macro-driven sector, travel & leisure (SXTP), gained 1%, powered by a 3.8% jump in shares of Britain's easyJet (L:EZJ) after it posted full-year profit towards the top end of expectations.
In corporate M&A, shares in Germany's TLG Immobilien (DE:TLGG) rose 2.4% after announcing an all-stock merger with fellow real estate firm Aroundtown SA (DE:AT1).
 Halma  Plc (L:HLMA) led gains on the FTSE 100 (FTSE) after the British safety equipment maker posted upbeat first-half results.
 Intermediate Capital Group  (L:ICP) jumped 7.7% to a record high as the alternative asset manager posted robust first-half results and a 50% increase in dividend.
London's domestically focused midcap index (FTMC) rose 1% after latest polling by ICM for Reuters showed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party had extended its lead over the opposition Labour Party in the past week."
1302,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 05:18AM ET</span>","Tata Steel to Cut 3,000 Jobs as Crisis Rips Through Europe","(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
Tata Steel Ltd. plans to cut as many as 3,000 jobs across its European operations to cut costs in the latest blow to the region’s industry, with the move coming amid a heated general election campaign in the U.K.
About two-thirds of the reductions would be office-based staff, the company said in a statement. Tata Steel -- which has steel-making facilities in the U.K. and the Netherlands, as well as other manufacturing operations -- didn’t give a detailed breakdown of where the job losses would be made.
“Stagnant EU steel demand and global overcapacity have been compounded by trade conflicts, which have turned the European market into a dumping ground for the world’s excess steel capacity,” Mumbai-based Tata Steel said.
The European steel industry has faced growing headwinds this year amid declining demand, slowing economic growth and the consistent threat of overseas supplies, including exports from Turkey, Russia and China. British Steel Ltd., the U.K.’s No. 2 steelmaker was put into liquidation in May, and has been taken over China’s Jingye Group Co. Apparent demand in the European Union will contract 3.1% this year, lobby group Eurofer warned last month.
The steelmaker’s European operations are facing conditions that are “unprecedented,” said Henrik Adam, chief executive officer of Tata Steel in Europe. Other steps to improve performance include boosting sales of higher-value steels, aiding efficiency and cutting procurement costs.
General Election
Voters in the U.K. go to the polls next month in a rare winter general election, and Tata Steel’s move is likely to feature as an issue in the showdown, which has been dominated by the Brexit crisis. In the contest, Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson is squaring off against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Tata Steel, which bought Corus Group Plc for about $13 billion in 2007, has been closing and selling plants in the U.K. since the 2008 financial crisis to make the business more profitable. The company is focusing on growing in India, where Chairman N. Chandrasekaran aims to ramp up capacity as the nation’s demand is set to expand as much as 7% in the coming years.
Tata Steel Europe’s Ebitda sank 90% to 31 million pounds ($40 million) in the first six months of the current financial year from April on revenue of 3.25 billion pounds, according to the statement. The job cuts and other moves target positive cash flow by the end of the year to March 2021.
‘Difficult Market’
“Europe remains a difficult market but this is how they can deal with the challenges there,” Amit A. Dixit, an analyst at Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd., said from Mumbai, citing problems also faced by peers including ArcelorMittal. “The market will likely react to this proposal in a hugely positive way.”
Earlier, Tata Steel had tried to address its position in Europe through a proposed venture with German rival Thyssenkrupp AG (DE:TKAG). But that initiative was blocked by the EU’s antitrust officials, who said allowing the deal would have reduced the number of suppliers and increased prices.
In a measure of the challenge facing local mills, steel production in the EU slumped in August to the lowest since the financial crisis amid a record jump in imports. The bloc’s output dropped to 11.45 million tons that month, according to World Steel Association data. That’s the lowest level since 2009.
ArcelorMittal, the world’s top steelmaker, said this month that European steel consumption will drop by up to 3% this year, the most since 2012. Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine AG has also been lowering its profit outlook as the industry downturn spreads.

Catalonia has been back to the forefront of Spanish politics since protests broke out in the wealthy northeastern region last month after nine separatist leaders were given long prison sentences for their role in an illegal referendum and declaration of independence in 2017.
""The impact on the economy and businesses becomes worrying when this lasts for a long time,"" Jordi Gual told a conference in Madrid.
A snap national election on Nov.10 with inconclusive results has left the ruling Socialists courting Catalan separatists as they are trying to win enough support in a fragmented parliament to sustain a coalition government with the far-left Unidas Podemos party.
""We have lived tough times and we call for dialogue because the current situation is not good for the output sector,"" said Gual, who added Caixanbak had not weighed so far the impact of the Catalan environment on the bank's business.

Last month, Bank of Spain governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said any further political uncertainty in the region could affect private sector investment decisions, posing another potential risk to the Spanish economy.

Popeyes signed a lease in Shanghai for its first store in China on Monday, which is slated to open next year.
The company outlined plans in July to build 1,500 restaurants in China in the coming decade, becoming the last of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International Inc's (TO:QSR) main brands to enter the country.
By contrast, Yum China's (N:YUMC) KFC has some 6,300 stores. Yum has said it is acutely aware there is more opportunity to expand in China, noting that while it was in 1,300 Chinese cities, there are still 700-800 cities without a KFC store.
Popeyes' July plan was ""just really to put a framework on the short-term potential business"", Jose Cil, RBI's CEO said in an interview in Shanghai.
""I think we can be the no.1 Chicken brand here in China and all around Asia,"" he said, adding that consumers in the region were looking for options. He dismissed concerns that a slowing China economy and trade tensions had dimmed prospects for growth in the long term.
Cil's remarks comes as the Cajun-inspired fast food chicken chain experiences a surge in popularity in the United States after a newly launched fried chicken sandwich went viral on social media. Demand was such that Popeyes had to stop taking orders after only two weeks before relaunching it this month.
The sandwich will also be offered in China, he said.
Cil noted that RBI's other two main brands had seen rapid growth in China.
Burger King has expanded to around 1,100 stores in China from less than 100 in 2012. ""We think we'll keep growing at a steady pace,"" Cil said.
And Tim Hortons, its Canadian coffee chain, just opened its 28th store in China after launching here in February.
""We are preparing ourselves to be able to accelerate growth in the coming years,"" Cil said of the brand."
1305,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 04:07AM ET</span>",Shares push to 22-month high as trade hopes endure,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares touched their highest in nearly two years on Tuesday as investors maintained bets that the United States and China can reach a deal to end their damaging trade war. 
The world's two largest economies are in talks on an initial deal to end an 18-month trade dispute that has damaged supply chains and upset global markets, with Washington due to impose a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods from Dec. 15. 
A lack of clear news on the progress of talks has not deterred investors emboldened by a growing sense that risks of a recession, a specter through the year, have receded. 
Looser monetary policy from major central banks like China has also helped bolster expectations for equities. 
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.1% to touch its highest since January last year. 
European shares also moved up, with the broad Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) adding 0.4% to move to its highest since July 2015. Indexes in Frankfurt (GDAXI) and London (FTSE) gained 0.4% and 0.5% respectively.
Wall Street futures (ESc1) indicated a positive start, too, adding 0.2%.
Investors said assumptions that an initial trade deal would be reached had outweighed any creeping doubts on progress in talks that stemmed from a lack of clear news, with a growing sense of positive economic fundamentals ahead. 
""Consensus is assuming that there will be a cyclical upturn,"" Stéphane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist at Makor Capital Markets. ""It's like the market lowered its guard on the big risk metrics -- and that has triggered a reweighting of funds from bonds to equities."" 
Hopes that Beijing will deliver some economic stimulus in addition to Monday's surprise cut to a closely watched lending rate provided a boost to sentiment in Asian markets. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.6%, with Shanghai blue chips (CSI300) gaining 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) up 1.4%. 
On the trade front, CNBC had overnight reported the mood in Beijing was pessimistic about prospects of sealing a trade agreement with the United States, buffeting the dollar.
But signs that suggested growing detente between the sides clouded the picture: a new extension granted by Washington to let U.S. companies keep doing business with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei suggested a possible olive branch.
That lack of clarity did unnerve some investors.
""The longer we go on, the more concerns will arise. The reality is the clock is ticking,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.
DOLLAR STABILIZES 
The listless mood in share markets was reflected by tepid moves among major currencies. 
The dollar stabilized against a broad basket of other currencies on Tuesday after three consecutive days of losses, with investors awaiting the release of the minutes of the U.S. central bank meeting at end-October when policymakers had cut interest rates.
The dollar index (DXY) against six major currencies was little changed at 97.807, close to a two-week low after weakening 0.6% in the last three days.
""Trade headlines are dominating sentiment but in terms of the key event risk, the release of the Fed minutes will be a big one for market participants,"" said Morten Lund, a senior FX strategist at Nordea.
The British pound  settled at $1.2953 after hitting a one-month high overnight as opinion polls showed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party on course for victory at the Dec. 12 election.
In commodities, crude futures (LCOc1) fell, losing 0.2% to $62.29 a barrel, with a combination of jitters over trade and expectations of a rise in U.S. inventories jangling nerves.

(Reuters) - The state of California on Monday sued e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc, alleging the San Francisco company engaged in a ""systematic"" and ""wildly successful"" campaign to attract teenagers to its nicotine devices.
The lawsuit draws on internal correspondence and other evidence, asserting the company did little to prevent sales to underage customers. It also claims that Juul used a ""flawed"" age-verification process for online sales.
Filed in California state court in Alameda County, the lawsuit also cites passages from a recent Reuters investigation that documented how Juul disregarded evidence soon after its launch in 2015 that teenagers were attracted to the product. (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/juul-ecigarette/)
The Reuters story documented how Juul rarely mentioned nicotine in early consumer marketing, while at the same time pitching retailers on Juul's unique addictive power.
Juul spokesman Austin Finan said the company had not yet reviewed the complaint. ""We remain focused on resetting the vapor category in the U.S. and earning the trust of society by working cooperatively with attorneys general, regulators, public health officials, and other stakeholders to combat underage use and convert adult smokers from combustible cigarettes,"" he said in a statement.
The lawsuit seeks monetary damages based on violations of state laws governing false advertising and unfair competition, among others.
Other lawsuits brought so far on behalf of teenage Juul users and other plaintiffs focus on the company's early youth-oriented advertising and social media campaigns. The state of North Carolina filed a lawsuit against Juul earlier this year.
Juul, the U.S. market leader in e-cigarettes, has come under intense scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers and attorneys general over the surging popularity of its products among teenagers in recent years. More than 27% of U.S. high schoolers used an e-cigarette in the previous month, according to a federal youth tobacco survey released in September, up from 11.7% two years ago.
A recent study found that nearly 60% of high schoolers and 54% of middle schoolers who use nicotine vaping products said Juul was their usual brand.
The company stopped selling many of its most popular flavors in the United States in recent months, including mint and mango, as research showed those flavors were highly popular among teenagers.
The lawsuit brought by California alleges that customers who failed Juul's online age verification process could create multiple accounts to circumvent the system or ask Juul customer service employees to adjust the address or name to try again.
Sales records in California, according to the suit, show the company sent thousands of Juul devices and pods to fictitious names including ""Beer Can"" and ""Patricia Juul,"" and to addresses such as ""no signature needed, Palo Alto.""
The lawsuit quotes correspondence earlier this year from a Juul senior developer, Frederic Boivin, agreeing with another employee that the company shouldn't be allowed to edit customer information because it risked ""huge compliance violations.""
Referring to a specific case, he added: ""For all we know this is an underage person,"" according to the suit.
Boivin went on to tell Eadon Jacobs, a director of digital product at Juul, that ""you can edit everything,"" according to the suit. Jacobs responded with one word: ""Shit,"" according to the complaint.
Boivin and Jacobs did not respond to requests for comment.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said on Monday that Juul ""targeted underage Californians with its marketing and sales practices,"" and is engaging in business practices that are ""endangering lives, especially of our children."""

The gains were modest, however, because of unease about whether a U.S.-China trade deal really will get done.
The S&P 500 hit a new high of 3,124.17 before falling back to a 1.6-point gain, or 0.05%, to 3,122.03. The index was held back by slumping energy stocks.
The Dow was up 0.11% after peaking at 28,040.97 in the morning. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 were up 0.11% and 0.16%, respectively. Both hit new highs earlier in the session.
In addition to the China concerns, the market was held back by declining energy stocks after oil prices fell. Also declining: industrial and pharmaceutical stocks.
Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) were among the Dow leaders.   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX),   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) and   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) were the weakest Dow stocks.
The U.S.-China negotiations appeared to be stalled, despite Trump Administration assurances last week that negotiations were progressing. Reports from Bloomberg News and CNBC over the weekend and Monday morning painted more complicated pictures of the status of the talks, with intense disputes in the Administration and Chinese pessimism a deal can be done.
The Administration did agree to a new 90-day extension that lets U.S. companies continue doing business with China's Huawei Technologies Co. as U.S. regulators continue crafting rules on telecommunications firms that pose national security risks.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) were among stocks hitting new highs Monday.
U.S. stocks have been pushing higher because of strong consumer spending and low unemployment, coupled with low inflation.
The Dow finished Monday up 20.2% for the year after falling 5.6% in 2018. The S&P 500 is up 24.5% after a 6.2% gain in 2018. The Nasdaq's 2019 gain is now 28.9% after a 3.9% decline in 2918. The bulk of the stock market's 2018 losses came in the fourth quarter. 
Bulls are very confident about the market going forward. Volatility indices have fallen 50% this year.
But the major averages are showing signs of getting ahead of themselves. Their relative strength indexes, a momentum gauge, are all above 70, with the Dow finishing Monday above 76.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) unveiled its first Japanese store on Tuesday in Tokyo's trendy Shibuya shopping district, in a step towards greater commercialization of its cast of popular characters. 
The Nintendo Tokyo store in the fashion-focused Parco department store marks the latest move into the mainstream for Japan's gamer culture and gives Nintendo a key location to attract more casual fans. 
The store - previewed to the media on Tuesday ahead of its public opening on Friday - offers a range of goods featuring prized characters including Italian plumber Mario, adventurer Link and pink alien Kirby, with exclusive products from Legend of Zelda-branded ties to Animal Crossing-themed oven gloves.
The Kyoto-based company will look at how the store performs before considering further openings, a spokesman said. 
""Nintendo is a company that thinks over a very long time-horizon,"" said Hirokazu Hamamura, head of game magazine publisher Famitsu Group. 
The Kyoto-based company, which already operates a store in New York, is building on the success of the Pokemon Center retail chain, which will also have space on the 6th floor of the new Parco. 
That chain is managed by the Pokemon Company, which was set up with investment from gaming companies Nintendo, Game Freak and Creatures to help manage the franchise. 
Pokemon's broad offering spanning video games, movies and soft toys, has made the franchise a home-grown contender for a Disney-style pop-culture empire. 
That contrasts with Nintendo's tight grip over its characters, with moves to broaden its appeal including Super Nintendo World, a new attraction set to open at the Universal Studios Japan theme park in Osaka next year. 
The new outpost of Pokemon Center, which last month proved wildly popular when it opened a pop-up store in London, features black walls and graffiti-splashed Pikachu toys in a nod to its location in Shibuya - a street-fashion mecca. 
Parco's 6th floor also features stores from companies such as games maker Capcom Co Ltd. 
Nintendo's push to drive sales beyond hardcore gamers comes as two Pokemon titles received a positive reception when they launched for the Switch console last week, bringing a game with full Pokemon battling mechanics to the device for the first time.

The game is expected to drive demand for the Switch and the lower-cost Switch Lite into the year-end shopping season.

The news comes as a shrinking workforce and changing values about work-life balance in Japan have meant companies are increasingly found responsible for workplace-related suicide.
Toyota City's labor standards officials had been investigating the 2017 suicide of a Toyota Motor employee, a spokesman at the automaker confirmed to Reuters.
""It's true that the labor authority determined it was a workplace injury, but we cannot comment further as discussions between representatives are ongoing,"" the spokesman said.
Daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, which was the first to report the officials' conclusion, said that the employee's supervisor had called him an ""idiot"" said he was ""better dead"".
The worker committed suicide in a company dormitory at the age of 28, the newspaper reported. The worker's family plans to sue the automaker, the newspaper said.
Labor officials declined to confirm their decision to Reuters, saying they could not comment on individual cases.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing to improve workplace practices in favor of workers' rights, with issues such as parental leave increasingly in the spotlight."

Ant did not disclose whether it is seeking a retail or wholesale license, but is “actively looking into this opportunity,” the company told Bloomberg in an interview.

Ant SME Services, a sub-unit of Ant Financial, recently received a permit from Hong Kong authorities to operate a virtual bank in the city. 
 
Ant Financial is ranked as the world’s most valuable tech start-up, with a valuation of about $150 billion. There has been speculation about an IPO for the company in Shanghai's new Science and Technology Innovation Board.
 
The company has said in March that it has kept an eye on China’s launch of the new board, but there was no timetable for listing.

1315,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 10:48PM ET</span>","Tata Steel Will Axe 3,000 Jobs Across Europe as Crisis Bites","(Bloomberg) -- Tata Steel Ltd. plans to axe about 3,000 jobs across its European operations to cut costs in the latest blow to the region’s industry, with the move coming amid a heated general election campaign in the U.K.
About two-thirds of the reductions would be office-based staff, according to a statement. The company -- which has steel-making facilities in the U.K. and the Netherlands, as well as other manufacturing operations -- didn’t give a detailed breakdown of where the job losses would be made.
“Stagnant EU steel demand and global overcapacity have been compounded by trade conflicts, which have turned the European market into a dumping ground for the world’s excess steel capacity,” Tata Steel said.
The European steel industry has faced growing headwinds this year amid declining demand, slowing growth and the consistent threat from supplies from overseas, including exports from Turkey, Russia and China. British Steel Ltd., the U.K.’s No. 2 steelmaker was put into liquidation in May, and has been taken over China’s Jingye Group Co. Apparent steel demand in the European Union will contract 3.1% this year, lobby group Eurofer warned last month.
The steelmaker’s European operations are facing “unprecedented severe market conditions,” Henrik Adam, chief executive officer of Tata Steel in Europe, said in the statement. Other steps to pare costs included boosting sales of higher-value steels, increasing efficiency and cutting procurement costs.
General Election
Voters in the U.K. go to the polls next month in a rare winter general election, and Tata Steel’s move is likely to feature as an issue in the showdown, which has been dominated by the Brexit crisis. In the contest, Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson is squaring off againt Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Tata Steel Europe’s Ebitda collapsed 90% to 31 million pounds ($40 million) in the first six months of the current financial year, which started in April, on revenue of 3.25 billion pounds. The program of job cuts and other moves targets positive cash flow by the end of the year to March 2021.
In a measure of the challenge facing local mills, steel production in the EU slumped in August to the lowest since the financial crisis amid a record jump in imports. The bloc’s output dropped to 11.45 million tons that month, according to World Steel Association data. That’s the lowest level since 2009.
ArcelorMittal, the world’s top steelmaker, said this month that European steel consumption will drop by up to 3% this year, the most since 2012. Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine AG has also been lowering its profit outlook as the industry downturn spreads.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - KKR & Co. (N:KKR) has tapped Hong Kong's CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd (HK:1038) and buyout groups including Blackstone (N:BX) and Sweden's  EQT AB  (ST:EQTAB) to gauge buying interest for Singapore-based Goodpack, an intermediate bulk container maker, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Working with advisors, private equity group (PE) KKR has reached out to more than a dozen potential buyers as it seeks bids for a deal that could give Goodpack a valuation of at least $2 billion, the sources said.
If successful, this would rank as one of the largest PE-backed sales in the past few years in Asia, excluding Japan and Australia, according to data from Refinitiv.
The names of the potential bidders have not been reported previously. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
KKR, EQT and Blackstone declined to comment, while there was no immediate response from CK Infrastructure, which is part of an empire founded by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing.
""There are a lot of parties looking at this high-profile auction. This is not a small and cheap deal, so people are keen to do a lot of work on this one,"" said one banker familiar with the sale process.
Indicative bids are due in early December, they said.
KKR acquired Goodpack for about S$1.4 billion ($1.03 billion) in 2014 and delisted it from Singapore Exchange. Since then, Goodpack changed its senior management, expanded into new markets such as food and chemicals and opened new offices in Europe and the United States.
One source said KKR was seeking a price above $2 billion, given the rise in valuations of infrastructure assets in the past few years and Goodpack's expansion.
Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, a subsidiary of  Macquarie Group  (AX:MQG), and U.S.-based Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, that has raised billions of dollars, are among those eyeing Goodpack, the sources said.
Macquarie Group declined to comment, while there was no response from Stonepeak.
Sources said some of the interested parties have held meetings with Goodpack and KKR's management to get a better understanding of the business.
Goodpack caters to global customers in the rubber, chemical, automotive and food-processing sectors. It has a fleet of four million steel intermediate bulk containers, with operations across 80 countries and a network of about 5,000 delivery and collection points.

The Shanghai Composite traded 0.4% higher by 10:25 PM ET (02:25 GMT). The Shenzhen Component jumped 1.4%.
Citing a government source, CNBC reported that China is pessimistic about a trade deal and found U.S. President Donald Trump’s comment that he did not agree on cancelling tariffs troubling. 
Trump’s comments contradicted with remarks made by Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson Gao Feng earlier this month, who said that the two nations had reached an agreement on the tariff rollback.
Hong Kong stocks rose again despite further unrest in the city. Overnight, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Trump to speak out on behalf of the protesters in Hong Kong and make the city’s autonomy a focus of America’s bilateral engagement with China.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) sustained part of a bid protest from Blue Origin that argued the Air Force's decision to pick just two of four competing rocket companies to launch the country's next lineup of defense satellites for the next five years is ""flawed"".
Bezos' Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also challenged the Pentagon's recent decision to award a $10 billion cloud computing contract to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), claiming politics spoiled a fair contracting process.
Blue Origin, founded by Bezos in 2000, filed its protest in August, claiming the Air Force program ""contains a number of flaws preventing offerers from intelligently preparing their proposals"" and ""squashes nascent competition by locking out non-selected providers for over 5 years.""
The total contract value for the program, called Launch Services Procurement (LSP) Phase 2, is unknown but is expected to be worth billions of dollars, assigning the Pentagon's next 34 launches of defense satellites from 2022 to 2027 to two companies.
The GAO said Monday the Air Force program's ""basis for award is inconsistent with applicable procurement law and regulation"" and recommended the agency change the rules of its solicitation.
If the Air Force disagrees with the GAO's recommendation, it would be the first time an agency did so since 2015, setting the stage for the U.S. Congress to intervene. Of the nearly 2,000 protest affirmations from the GAO since 2015, only one agency formally declined to implement GAO's recommendations.
The Air Force has said it ""does not plan to revise the terms of the LSP solicitation due to this protest,"" believing its current approach is best for national security and open competition.
Congress in 2014 moved to wean the U.S. off its dependency on rockets using Russia's RD-180 engine for military launches before 2022 by initiating the Air Force LSP, which expects to pick the two award winners by the end of 2020.
United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) whose Atlas 5 rocket uses the RD-180, has long dominated the military launch market, lofting the bulk of U.S. defense satellites to space since its formation in 2006.
Elon Musk's SpaceX sued the government in 2014 over a multi-billion dollar ULA deal with the Air Force for 36 launches. SpaceX dropped the lawsuit after the Air Force agreed to open up competition.

 Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC), SpaceX and ULA have also submitted rocket proposals to the Air Force which is expected to make a final decision by the end of 2020.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 07:50PM ET</span>",Beyond Meat vs Zhenmeat: The battle for China's meatless market,"By Pei Li and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. plant-based ""meat"" makers targeting China like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc will need to battle homegrown rivals which are developing local favorites such as dumplings and mooncakes to nab a share of the lucrative market. 
China's meat substitute industry has seen a surge in interest in recent months, with startups, traditional food businesses and investors betting trend-loving Chinese consumers will take to plant-based protein like their U.S. counterparts.
A devastating pig disease and bruising Sino-U.S. trade war that have combined to push up meat prices are also playing a role.
Among the new players are names like Zhenmeat and Starfield, while long-time plant-based companies including Whole Perfect Food are rolling out new products. 
Ham producer Jinzi Ham saw its share price soar 50% in a week after it announced in October it would start selling meat made out of plant protein that it developed with Danisco (China) Investment, a unit of U.S. firm DuPont (NYSE:DD). 
Local firm MYS Group has also announced it is conducting research into similar products.
But unlike Impossible Foods or Beyond Meat, most Chinese companies are not making burgers, instead focusing on local dishes such as dumplings, mooncakes or meatballs, and opting for pork rather than beef flavors in recognition of local palates. 
""American and European companies have rich experience in frying, roasting, and baking, we have a different dieting culture and cooking recipes,"" said Zhou Qiyu, a marketing executive at Whole Perfect Food.
LOCAL TASTES 
One-year-old Zhenmeat, whose name translates to ""treasure meat"", for example, was touted by Chinese state media as the country's answer to Beyond Meat after it used ""meat"" made out of pea-based protein in its mooncakes, a popular snack eaten during the country's Mid-Autumn Festival. 
Zhenmeat's co-founder Vince Lu said the company, which has partnered up with noodle manufacturer Yantai Shuangta Foods, was looking into making meatballs and dumplings.
""We are analyzing the flavoring behind pork meat, and we are taking on that to make a difference between our competitor from the U.S.,"" he said. 
Whole Perfect Food, which for the last 20 years has mainly catered to China's mostly vegetarian Buddhists, recently rolled out a range of sausages made from soy and pea-based protein. The sausages come in 40 varieties, including spicy Sichuan and soy-seasoned beef.
Zhou said the firm was open to working with foreign companies. It had earlier this year conducted a trial partnership with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) which has since ended but has partnerships with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding's Hema chain and Tencent-backed retailer Yonghui Superstores.
China's ""free from meat"" market, which includes plant-based products meant to replace meat, has grown 33.5% since 2014 to be worth $9.7 billion last year, according to Euromonitor. It predicts that the industry will be worth $11.9 billion by 2023. 
Impossible Foods has identified mainland China as its No.1 overseas market for future expansion and says its Impossible Burger product can we easily adapted for use in Chinese cuisine.
This month showcased the use of its plant-based meat in dishes such as ""Impossible Lion's Head Dumpling in Broth"" at a high-profile Shanghai import fair. It says it is developing prototypes of many different products including pork but has no immediate plans to commercialize them. 
""We have tons of inbound interest. They are just waiting for us to get clearance to sell in China,"" said its CEO Pat O. Brown, when asked if Impossible Foods had been meeting with retailers and restaurants. 
Beyond Meat's executive chairman Seth Goldman told Reuters it plans to customize its pea-based meat for the Chinese market to make dumplings and other products. The company is aiming to start production in Asia by the end next year before eventually expanding to China.
""It's the same palate. There’s nothing about what we’re doing that prohibits us from making a product that would have appeal in the Chinese market,"" he said. 
TASTE IS KING
China is no stranger to food using vegetarian ingredients to give a meat-like flavor, for years consuming tofu and similar ""mock meat"" products made out soy beans. 
Matilda Ho, managing director of Bits x Bites, a Shanghai-based food tech venture capital fund, says first and foremost, companies will need to make products tasty to shift consumers from real meat.
""If you simply use pea protein, or soy protein, and then add a lot of additives to make them stick together and then sell to the market, there is no real innovation, the taste is really bad, from a consumer perspective, we don't believe the demand will be able to meet that oversupply.""
Textures are also key, said Zhang Xinliang, founder of six-year-old plant-based meat manufacturer Ningbo Sulian Food, citing differences between Chinese and Western cooking. 
""The texture of Yangzhou-style meatball is very dimpled, while hotpot meatballs are crispy,"" he said. ""Foreign plant-based food might not succeed in China because they don't fit Chinese stomachs.""
SWINE FEVER FACTOR
The sheer size of the market means ample opportunities are likely, and the timing looks good.
China is currently grappling with surging prices for pork, its mainstay meat, after culling an estimated half its herd due to an epidemic of African swine fever. A bruising trade war with the United States has also raised prices of beef and other meat products. 
""We believe this is a huge driver for the trend of plant-based protein happening in China, but again, it's slow,"" said Ho of Bits x Bites.
Producers can rely on demand from younger Chinese consumers, many of whom are avid followers of food trends and love to try new cuisines. 
Among them was 23-year-old Liu Dongyang, a vegetarian who traveled 160 km (100 miles) from her home in Guangzhou to try Impossible Foods' meatless burger patty in Hong Kong.
She says the buzz over plant-based trend has sparked an interest in vegan diets from her meat-eating friends.

""My friends used to think vegetables and meat are completely different kinds of food. But now when we go to restaurants that serve plant-based food, they are very delighted and interested.""

LISBON/BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian tribe that has been fighting for 15 years to preserve land they use to gather food won a victory on Monday when public pressure made Portuguese hotel group Vila Gale cancel plans to build a 500-room luxury resort on the Bahia coast.
Indigenous group Tupinambá de Olivença, numbering 4,631 people, has been fighting for the land to be designated as a reserve since 2003. Brazil's indigenous rights agency Funai approved the request in 2009, and Brazil's second-highest court unanimously voted in favor of the Tupinambá in 2016.
But the tribe still requires final sign-off from the Ministry of Justice and the president himself for the protected status of the territory to become official. Despite multiple requests from the tribe, nothing has happened since 2016.
Last week, Brazil National Human Rights Council urged the Bolsonaro government to speed up the final demarcation of the Tupinambá land, which is located in the coastal Atlantic forest in southern Bahia, known for its coconut tree-lined beaches that attract millions of tourists each year.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has not yet made a decision on the specific case of the Tupinambá but stated on multiple occasions that he does not intend to sign off any more territory for indigenous groups, saying earlier this year there is ""too much land for too few indigenous people.""
Vila Gale said a local businessman offered them the land in 2018. Regional and state government representatives approved of the project, as did Embratur, Brazil's tourism agency. The company put the project on its website, with a note saying it was due to open in 2021.
The company's CEO Jorge Rebelo de Almeida consistently denied that there were any traces of an indigenous population on the territory in question, a claim repeated in the company's statement to Portuguese press on Monday.
""In the region and in a radius of many kilometers, there was no sign of any occupation or utilization, nor signals of any extractive activity from anyone. There is no indigenous reserve in this area, nor will there be,"" the statement said.
While the Tupinambá do not live on the land, they use it for gathering food. Portuguese anthropologist Susana Viegas, who has led studies on the Tupinambá since 2003, said access to the land was ""essential for the community's survival"". Tupinambá chief Ramón Tupinambá said at a meeting in Brasilia in late October that there would be ""war"" if Vila Gale followed through.
Pressure on the company, Portugal's second-largest hotel group, to retract its plans began to grow after a letter published in the Intercept on Oct. 27 showed Brazil's tourism agency urging the government to cancel the process of classifying the land as indigenous territory on the grounds that the hotel could bring $200 million of investment and generate 2,000 jobs.
In response to numerous articles in the Portuguese press following the Intercept's leak, pressure from Portugal's third-largest political party Bloco da Esquerda, and multiple requests from Portuguese anthropologist Susana Viegas, who studied the Tupinambá for Funai since 2003, to retract their plans, the company insisted they would wait until the Ministry of Justice and president made the final call.
But in its statement on Monday, the company changed its mind, saying it did not want the hotel to go ahead ""in this atmosphere of war"", and so despite viewing the accusations levied against it as ""unfair"" and ""baseless"", it canceled its plans.
Under Brazil's 1988 Constitution, which guarantees the rights of indigenous people to their ancestral lands, and a presidential decree in 1996, any building on land where the boundaries have already been drawn by the Funai faces confiscation with no compensation.
""This is totally illegal. The land rights of indigenous people take precedence over any other rights,"" said Juliana Batista, a lawyer for the Brazilian Socio-Environmental Institute, an NGO that defends indigenous rights. She said local authorities had gone ahead and licensed the hotel project without involving federal agencies."

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) this week will present to the board of its largest 737 MAX customer, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), an overview of its plans to return the grounded jet to service, a spokesman for the airline said on Monday.
The meeting on Wednesday and Thursday comes after Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said last month that the airline could look next year at diversifying its fleet beyond Boeing 737 aircraft. Budget-friendly Southwest has structured its business model around flying only 737 aircraft for the past 50 years and bet its entire growth strategy on the 737 MAX, the latest iteration of Boeing's narrowbody workhorse.
With the MAX parked since mid-March following crashes on Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines that together killed 346 people, Southwest has had to scale back its growth plans and cancel north of 100 daily flights, wiping $435 million from its earnings between January and September.
Kelly, who is also Southwest's chairman of the board, invited Boeing to address the timing and logistics of dozens of 737 MAX deliveries that it was supposed to receive this year. The meeting will also give Boeing a chance to defend its product and the steps it is taking to restore public confidence after the two fatal crashes, sources said.
""It's an overview of the Return to Service Plan, timing, and plans moving forward,"" Southwest spokesman Chris Mainz said. ""Just a good chance for our Board to hear directly from Boeing, but nothing more to it than that."" 
It is not the first time that Boeing has presented to a regularly scheduled board meeting, he said.
Southwest had 34 MAX jets in its fleet when global regulators grounded the aircraft in March. The airline was supposed to receive 41 more 737 MAX planes before the end of the year, but most of those deliveries are now scheduled for 2020.
Hundreds of undelivered 737 MAX jets are parked at Boeing facilities in Washington state, where the planemaker is facing a delivery logjam once the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration gives approval for them to fly commercially. 
While Boeing is targeting approval in December, the FAA has pushed back on any fixed timeline.

Southwest has removed the 737 MAX from its flying schedule until early March. The airline has said it will need one to two months to train its pilots and prepare the jets for flight once regulators approve new software and pilot training.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 06:09PM ET</span>","California to stop buying GM, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler vehicles over emissions fight","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California said on Monday it will halt all purchases of new vehicles for state government fleets from GM, Toyota,  Fiat  Chrysler and other automakers backing U.S. President Donald Trump in a battle to strip the state of authority to regulate tailpipe emissions.
Between 2016 and 2018, California purchased $58.6 million in vehicles from General Motors Co (N:GM), $55.8 million from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), $10.6 million from Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and $9 million from Nissan Motor Co (T:7201).
Last month, GM, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and members of the Global Automakers trade association backed the Trump administration's effort to bar California from setting its own emission standards, which are significantly stricter than the Trump Administration proposal's preferred option. 
GM spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said in a statement it was unfortunate that California will stop buying its electric Bolt.
""Removing vehicles like the Chevy Bolt and prohibiting GM and other manufacturers from consideration will reduce California's choices for affordable, American-made electric vehicles and limit its ability to reach its goal of minimizing the state government's carbon footprint, a goal that GM shares."" 
The other automakers declined or did not immediately comment.
Starting in January, the state will only buy from automakers that recognize California's legal authority to set emissions standards. They include  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co (T:7267), BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), which struck a deal with California in July to follow revised state vehicle emissions standards.
In August, the Justice Department opened an antitrust probe into the deal and last month sent subpoenas to the four companies.
""Car makers that have chosen to be on the wrong side of history will be on the losing end of California’s buying power,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.
California purchased $69.2 million in vehicles from Ford over the three-year-period, $565,000 from Honda and none from the German automakers.
The state also disclosed it will immediately no longer allow state agencies to buy gasoline-powered sedans, with exemptions for certain public safety vehicles.
California's vehicle rules have been adopted by 13 other states.
On Friday, California and 22 other U.S. states challenged the Trump administration's decision to revoke California's legal authority to set vehicle tailpipe emissions rules and require a rising number of zero emission vehicles (ZEV).
The move follows a separate lawsuit filed in September by the states against the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration seeking to undo a parallel determination.
In August 2018, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, reversing planned 5% annual increases.
The Trump administration's final requirements are expected in the coming months and are set to modestly boost fuel efficiency versus the initial proposal, with several automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%. That would be less stringent than the Obama rules or the California compromise rules.

CalMatters, a non-profit California journalism website, reported California's decision to stop buying some vehicles earlier.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 06:06PM ET</span>",T-Mobile CEO Legere to step down next year,"By Sheila Dang and Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) Chief Executive Officer John Legere will step down next year, the company said on Monday, less than three weeks before it goes to trial to determine the fate of its planned $26.5 billion merger with smaller rival Sprint Corp (N:S). 
The third-largest U.S. wireless carrier will go to trial on Dec. 9 to fight a state attorneys general lawsuit that alleges the merger would be harmful to consumers.
T-Mobile said Legere will remain CEO until April 30, and will be succeeded by President and Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert. Legere will continue to be a member of T-Mobile's board.
Legere, the outspoken architect of the marketing and business strategy that helped T-Mobile become known as an innovator in the wireless industry, said the succession plan had long been in the works. 
""A CEO with a board that doesn't have a good succession plan, fails,"" Legere said on a conference call with analysts. ""It's Mike's time. He's ready.""
T-Mobile remains focused on closing the merger with Sprint, Legere said.
""I feel quite good that we have the basis for settling this deal, and I feel equally good, if not better, about winning this trial,"" he added.
T-Mobile has also been in talks with Sprint to extend their merger agreement, which had expired Nov. 1. A reduced price for Sprint could potentially be part of the negotiations.
Legere said Monday the company's shareholders were working on a new agreement, but said he could not provide a timeframe.
Legere also said he had never been in discussions to run WeWork, saying the news reports had created an ""awkward period of time"" for T-Mobile. Japan's Softbank Group Corp (T:9984) is the controlling shareholder for both Sprint and WeWork.
Sievert, also a member of T-Mobile's board, has worked alongside Legere for the last seven years.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 05:31PM ET</span>",Lawsuit against Boeing seeks to hold board liable for 737 MAX problems,"By Tom Hals and Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - A shareholder lawsuit filed on Monday accused Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's board of doing nothing to investigate the safety of the 737 MAX until the fast-selling plane suffered a second deadly crash in five months.
The lawsuit is the latest legal challenge facing Boeing over the 737 MAX crash in Indonesia in October 2018 that killed all 189 passengers and crew and another in Ethiopia that killed all 157 people in March.
The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since the Ethiopian crash as Boeing seeks regulatory approval for updates to software believed to have played a role in both crashes.
Monday's lawsuit, filed in the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Boeing is incorporated, said the first crash was ""the biggest red flag an airline manufacturer can face.""
The lawsuit, brought by the Kirby Family Partnership, a Boeing investor, alleges the directors breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders and seeks to hold them personally liable for damage caused to Boeing, which could run into the billions of dollars.
Boeing declined to comment. 
The Kirby Family Partnership obtained internal corporate records that show the board did not take action to ensure the safety of the 737 MAX until after the second crash, according to the complaint, which includes numerous redactions.
The lawsuit is a so-called derivative complaint, meaning the shareholder seeks to act on behalf of the corporation to hold the directors and officers liable.
Unlike shareholder class action cases seeking to recover losses from falling stock prices, derivative cases are often settled for commitments to change corporate governance.
Two other derivative lawsuits have been filed against Boeing's board, both last month. The Kirby Family Partnership also filed one in Cook County, Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, and individual investor Arthur Isman filed a case in Delaware's Court of Chancery.
Boeing is already defending itself against lawsuits by families of passengers killed in the crashes, by shareholders over the drop in the stock price and by pilots over lost pay.
Airlines with 737 MAX jets are also demanding compensation for the cost of the global grounding, now in its ninth month. 
The company is also being investigated by U.S. lawmakers, aviation and transportation authorities and is the target of a federal criminal probe.

Boeing's shares, which have lost 12 percent since the second crash, closed down 0.6% at $369.46 on Monday.

(Reuters) - Burger King was sued on Monday by a vegan customer who accused the fast-food chain of contaminating its meatless ""Impossible"" Whoppers by cooking them on the same grills as its traditional meat burgers.
In a proposed class action, Phillip Williams (NYSE:WMB) said he bought an Impossible Whopper, a plant-based alternative to Burger King's regular Whopper, at an Atlanta drive-through, and would not have paid a premium price had he known the cooking would leave it ""coated in meat by-products.""
The lawsuit filed in Miami federal court seeks damages for all U.S. purchasers of the Impossible Whopper, and an injunction requiring Burger King to ""plainly disclose"" that Impossible Whoppers and regular burgers are cooked on the same grills.
Burger King, a unit of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International Inc, declined to comment, saying it does not discuss pending litigation.
Its website describes the Impossible Burger as ""100% Whopper, 0% Beef,"" and adds that ""for guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-broiler method of preparation is available upon request.""
Williams' lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the disclaimer or the available cooking options.
Impossible Foods Inc, which helped create the Impossible Whopper, has said it designed the product for meat eaters who want to consume less animal protein, not for vegans or vegetarians.
""For people who are strictly vegan, there is a microwave prep procedure that they're welcome to ask for in any store,"" Dana Worth, Impossible Foods' head of sales, said in a recent interview.
Burger King began selling the Impossible Whopper in August.
Restaurant Brands also owns the Canadian coffee and restaurant chain Tim Hortons, and is overseen by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.

The case is Williams v Burger King Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of Florida, No. 19-24755.

In the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Detroit, the auto parts supplier said Volkswagen extracted written agreements from suppliers not to sell themselves to Prevent Group.
Volkswagen did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The company, which is seeking damages in excess of $750 million, said that after the diesel emissions scandal, Volkswagen used its market power to squeeze smaller suppliers and stop any acquisitions to cut costs.
Volkswagen's lower-tier suppliers had no choice but to suffer bankruptcy or comply with Volkswagen's ""unfair terms and prices"", Prevent said in a statement.

In 2016 https://reut.rs/2OnW5fN, Volkswagen and two of its suppliers, a part of Prevent, resolved a contract dispute that had hit output at more than half of the automaker's German plants and threatened to undermine its recovery from the diesel emissions scandal.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 04:37PM ET</span>","With stores burned and looted, Walmart seeks police protection in riot-hit Chile","By Aislinn Laing
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Walmart has sought court orders for police protection in protest-wracked Chile after more than 120 of its supermarkets were looted or burned.
The Chilean subsidiary of the U.S.-headquartered retailer (N:WMT) lodged orders with courts in six Chilean cities, saying the attacks on its stores had put its staff's safety and jobs at risk, ""gravely"" affected its ability to operate in the country and caused it ""enormous economic damage"". 
""The state of Chile has failed to fulfill its duty to guarantee public order and internal public security,"" it said in court documents submitted on Wednesday and made public on Monday. 
It said the state had failed to protect its premises and staff with a ""lack of timely reaction to evident vandalism"". The stores operate under the brandnames Lider, Express, aCuenta and Ekono in Chile.
Karla Rubilar, a representative for the Chilean government, told journalists on Monday that it had worked hard to safeguard business interests amid the unrest. 
""We worked from day one not only with this company but with all companies and especially small- and medium-sized enterprises to guarantee public order and security,"" she said. ""We will always be available to work with whoever want us to."" 
The court action - in the Chilean cities of Arica, Puerto Montt, Concepcion, Chillan, Temuco and Valdivia - comes after a month of violent riots and protests across the country that started over a hike in public transport fares and broadened to address simmering grievances over endemic inequality.
The protests have left at least 23 dead, 2,365 civilians hospitalized and as many as 14,000 arrested, according to police, prosecutors and human rights groups. The finance minister put the damage to property and public transport at $3 billion.
Walmart Chile, the local subsidiary of the world's largest company, said in a statement it had experienced 1,200 episodes of lootings and fires at 128 of its approximately 400 stores. It said 34 supermarkets had been set on fire, and 17 of them destroyed. 

The company said it had sought the protection orders to ensure its stores could continue supplying customers and will not seek reimbursement from the government for the damages.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's three main indexes on Monday barely extended the previous session's closing records as investors waited for concrete progress on U.S.-China trade relations after mixed headlines. 
The market appeared to welcome Washington's extension for U.S. companies to do business with Huawei after the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker was put on a U.S. blacklist in May.
But investors were concerned about a CNBC report that the mood in Beijing over the potential for a trade deal was pessimistic due to President Donald Trump's reluctance to roll back tariffs.
This was after Chinese state media said on Saturday that the two sides had ""constructive"" trade talks, after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said they were close to a deal.
""Markets are very focused on trade because it's still not clear whether or not the U.S. and China can reach an agreement. If it was easy to reach an agreement they would've done so many months ago,"" said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""At least for today there's not a lot in terms of market moving data or information ... There's no reason to buy or sell aggressively."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 31.33 points, or 0.11%, to 28,036.22, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.57 points, or 0.05%, to 3,122.03 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 9.11 points, or 0.11%, to 8,549.94. 
""Investors are being patient because they don't want to chase new all-time highs too far until they have clarity on trade,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. 
Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were trading higher, with defensives such as consumer staples (SPLRCS) and real estate <.SPLRCR> leading the percentage gains. 
The energy sector (SPNY) was the biggest percentage loser dropping 1.33% as oil prices fell. 
Trading was relatively slow with 6.55 billion shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 6.93 billion average in the last 20 sessions.
""We're sort of in a vacuum of information and news. That's why the market is very sensitive to what's happening on the trade front,"" said Lefkowitz of UBS, noting that the earnings season was mostly done. 
Later this week, the Federal Reserve will release minutes from its latest policy meeting, where the central bank cut interest rates for the third time this year. Also ahead are results from U.S. retailers, including  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD), Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT).
 Coty Inc  (N:COTY) gained 2.60% after the cosmetics maker said it would pay $600 million for a majority stake in Kylie Jenner's make-up and skincare businesses.

Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said the government would ask for the consent decrees, which have no expiration dates, to be terminated.
The agreements regulating relations between movie studios and theaters, which the industry calls the 'Paramount' consent decrees, were reached in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when movie theaters had just one screen, televisions were not universal and online streaming was decades into the future.
Before the rules took effect, studios commonly sold multiple films to theaters as a package. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1948 ruled against the practice, called ""block booking,"" and others that favored studios, leading the plaintiff, Paramount Pictures, Inc, and its peers to sign consent decrees with the Justice Department that banned such deals over the next few years.
Delrahim said he would ask for a two-year sunset period on block booking, in which studios forced theaters to take unpopular films in order to get blockbusters, and circuit dealing, in which one license covers all theaters in a theater circuit.
""The sunset period will allow the defendants and movie theaters a period of transition to adjust to any licensing proposals that seek to change the theater-by-theater and film-by-film licensing structure currently mandated by the decrees,"" Delrahim said in a speech to the American Bar Association's fall antitrust gathering.
The Justice Department has been reviewing more than 1,000 consent decrees affecting a range of industries, which have no expiration date, with an eye toward cancelling them.
The National Association of Theater Owners, which represents movie theater companies with 33,000 screens across the United States, urged the department to forbid movie studios to return to the practice of block booking."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Gulf airlines Emirates and Air Arabia spent a combined $30 billion at list prices on Airbus (PA:AIR) jetliners as the Dubai Airshow burst into life on Monday, while Boeing (N:BA) won a symbolic first official order for the 737 MAX since its grounding in March.
Emirates threw its weight behind the Airbus A350 with an expanded order for 50 jets worth $16 billion, but shelved plans to order the slightly smaller A330neo as the Middle East’s largest carrier embarked on a more diversified fleet structure.
The firm order, signed in front of reporters on day two of the Nov 17-21 show, drew a line under the A380 superjumbo, the world's largest airliner which Airbus had decided earlier this year to close, prompting Emirates to order mid-sized planes.
Under its original plans tentatively announced in February, Emirates would have ordered 40 upgraded A330neos and 30 slightly larger A350-900s. It decided instead to opt for 50 of the lightweight A350s, citing in part the impact on lower emissions.
""Together with the A380, the A350 will give us more capacity and flexibility. We will be able to expand to new markets with these aircraft,"" Emirates Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said.
Analysts said the deal cemented the position of the A350 at Emirates after it canceled a previous order for A350s in 2014.
But it also raised questions over production rates for the once highly profitable A330 family, which has been aiming for a new lease of life after switching to new Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) engines.
Shares in Airbus fell 1.5%, lagging a slightly weaker European market.
Airbus builds 50 A330s a year or 4.2 a month. That figure could slip closer to 3 a month from 2022, one analyst said.
NO 'A350NEO'
The A350 gives Emirates greater room for growth than the A330neo though the airline has not definitively shut the door on the jet, an update to A330 models it has operated before.
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury denied reports that Airbus is also looking at a future engine upgrade of the A350, something experts warn might dampen current demand for the jet.
But Monday's business left unanswered questions over the fate of 40 competing Boeing 787 jets also provisionally ordered by Emirates.
Sheikh Ahmed said Emirates remained in talks with Boeing on firming up the order. But industry sources said that could come at a cost to Boeing since Emirates would in exchange reduce an order for 150 Boeing 777X after deliveries were pushed back by a year, which the airline complains is holding back its growth.
Reflecting growth among budget carriers, Sharjah-based Air Arabia ordered 120 Airbus A320neo and A321neo jets in a deal worth around $14 billion, the biggest in terms of units so far at the Middle East's largest aerospace event.
Airbus and Boeing are pushing for order endorsements from customers that have been frustrated with plane and engine makers over delays in deliveries and engine issues. 
Airbus last month cut its full-year delivery goal for commercial jets due to production glitches. Faury told reporters on Monday A321neo deliveries should return to normal in 2021.
Boeing is trying to turn the corner over the grounding of its top-selling 737 MAX after two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people within a span of five months.
Turkey's SunExpress (IS:THYAO) announced a $1.2 billion deal for 10 more 737 MAX 8 aircraft, on top of 32 already ordered. 
It was the first firm MAX order since it was grounded in March and confirmed a Reuters report that a deal was close.

British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) signed a surprise letter of intent in June to order 200 MAX, dropping its medium-haul supplier Airbus, but the deal has not yet been finalised.

1335,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 03:18PM ET</span>",FCC Chairman Calls for Public Auction of C-Band Airwaves,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Communications Commission moved Monday toward controlling a lucrative airwaves sale in a public auction rather than letting Intelsat SA and SES SA conduct a private sale of the frequencies as they had proposed.
The plan, which could slash the satellite companies’ payout by billions of dollars, was announced in a tweet by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who, according to agency officials, had earlier discussed the matter with President Donald Trump. The FCC could vote to adopt the plan early next year.
“I’ve concluded that the best way to advance these principles is through a public auction,” Pai said in a tweet. He didn’t say if any proceeds would be earmarked for the companies.Pai said the sale should free airwaves for 5G wireless use, do so quickly and generate revenue for the U.S. federal government.
The satellite companies signaled resistance, saying in a statement they would work toward an alternative and calling Pai’s plan “a significant departure” that “does not address the critical involvement of the incumbent satellite operators” in reconfiguring airwaves uses.
“Intelsat is significantly over-levered, they need a major spectrum windfall to right-size their balance sheet and end up with a capital structure that’s tenable,” said Stephen Flynn, a telecom analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The more uncertainty and the longer it takes, it adds more risk.”
Intelsat was down 38% to $8.31 at 2:35 p.m. in New York. It was was the biggest decliner on the Russell 2000 Index.
Intelsat and SES -- both based in Luxembourg -- want to sell some of the airwaves they now use to send shows to TV stations across the U.S. Wireless providers gearing up for fast 5G networks are seeking additional capacity and might buy them. The satellite companies plan to retain enough airwaves to continue servicing TV stations.
The satellite providers’ plan provoked opposition among lawmakers who expressed concern about European companies profiting from the sale of U.S. airwaves, including Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican who said he called Trump to raise an alarm. Trump called Pai on Oct. 30 and while the issue was discussed, the president didn’t direct the agency on what to do, said an FCC official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Also Monday, leading Republicans introduced legislation requiring a C-band sale to begin by the end of next year, with taxpayers getting at least 50% of the airwaves’ market value.
“This legislation would get crucial mid-band spectrum into the market to benefit the American people and secure our position as the leaders in the race to 5G,” Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said in an emailed news release.
FCC officials declined to discuss what portion of sales the satellite companies might get under a public auction. They said the agency intends to begin the sale in 2020.
Intelsat wants to use proceeds to reduce some of its $14 billion debt load, otherwise its leverage could rise to a potentially unbearable level by the end of this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
Intelsat bonds led high-yield declines, with its 9.5% bonds due February 2023 falling 7.75 cents on the dollar to 73.75 cents. Its 8.125% notes maturing June 2023 dropped 5.4 cents on the dollar to 64.1, and its 5.5% bonds due August 2023 dropped 2 cents on the dollar to 87 cents.
On Nov. 15, the C-Band Alliance group made up of Intelsat, SES and Ottawa-based Telesat offered to voluntarily pay the U.S. Treasury 30% to 75% of the billions of dollars they could reap if they’re allowed to sell airwaves in a private auction.
The airwaves in question are in the 3.7 gigahertz-to-4.2 gigahertz area of spectrum, known as the C-band. Intelsat and SES dominate that patch of airwaves, which are considered well-suited for 5G networks.
Proponents say the frequencies are needed to help the U.S. beat China in a so-called race to 5G. The alliance that includes Intelsat and SES said its proposal would be quicker than an FCC-run auction.
The C-Band Alliance in its statement Monday said that to “the full cooperation of the satellite operators will be required to ensure the successful clearing of the C-band while protecting the incumbent broadcast services enjoyed by millions of U.S. households.”

MONTREAL/WINNIPEG (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal government sent two ministers on Monday to meet with representatives of Canadian National Railway Ltd and its largest union, as already hard-hit shippers pleaded for government intervention to avert a strike planned for early on Tuesday.
The threatened strike by 3,000 workers with Teamsters Canada comes after CN, the country's largest railroad operator, said on Friday it would cut management and union jobs, as it grapples with softer economic conditions.
Labor Minister Patty Hajdu and Transportation Minister Marc Garneau were to meet with representatives from CN and the union in Montreal, Hajdu's press secretary Veronique Simard said, following a stalemate in contract talks.
CN said it believes a strike can be averted ""with the assistance of federal mediators,"" after Teamsters declined to submit to binding interest arbitration.
""We expect talks to continue up to Nov. 19,"" CN said.
Teamsters and CN reached a last-minute deal in 2017 that averted a planned strike.
Canada, one of the world's biggest exporters of farm products, relies on its two main railways to move canola and wheat over the vast distances from western farms to ports. Crude oil shippers in Alberta have also used trains in the past two years to reach U.S. refineries as an alternative to congested pipelines.
Alberta wheat and barley commissions, representing farmers, urged Ottawa to intervene, as they are already facing difficult harvest conditions because of weather.
""There are a lot of farmers who already have a significant amount of their income trapped under snow,"" said Gary Stanford, Alberta Wheat Commission chair. ""Now adding insult to injury, we’re looking at possible CN rail strike action too.""
CN was expecting slightly lower fourth-quarter crude shipments from the third quarter, officials said on an Oct. 22 conference call.
Slumping commodity prices, congested oil pipelines and a dispute with China that has hampered Canadian agriculture exports have pressured the economies of resource-rich western provinces.
Teamsters Canada spokesman Christopher Monette said the planned strike by its conductors, train personnel and yard workers comes because workers are ""hitting a wall on issues related to health and safety.""

Video of the scene showed heavy police presence around a car riddled with bullet holes in the Walmart parking lot in Duncan, Oklahoma. A white sheet, covering what appeared to be a body, was laid next to it, with blood stains visible on the ground. 
The bodies of one woman and one man were found inside the car, with another dead man found outside the car, the Duncan Police Department said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). A handgun was found on the scene, police said. 
The shooter was among the dead, the Duncan Banner newspaper reported citing police.
Duncan is a town of roughly 22,000 people located about 80 miles (129 km) south of Oklahoma City.
The incident came the day after another shooting in Fresno, California, that saw at least four killed as people gathered in a backyard to watch a football game, with at least one shooter still unaccounted for.
California was also hit by a school shooting in Santa Clarita last week in which a 16-year-old boy shot and killed two classmates before turning the gun on himself, and a San Diego shooting on Saturday that saw a man kill his estranged wife and three of their young sons before killing himself.
In August, a man killed 22 people at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart and injured 26 others. He is accused of deliberately targeting Mexicans and has pleaded not guilty.
In July, a Walmart employee killed two co-workers and injured a police officer.
Walmart reassessed the security of its stores, adding third-party security or uniformed off-duty police officers at times, following the El Paso shooting and another at a Mississippi Walmart in which an employee shot and killed two colleagues.
In September, following the El Paso shooting, the company said it would no longer sell .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber ammunition that is often used the sort of rifles with large-capacity clips that have been a major factor in some of the nation's deadliest mass shootings.
Walmart also stopped selling handgun ammunition and AR-15 and other military-style rifles.
The store also asked its customers to no longer openly carry weapons into their stores in states that allow the open carrying of firearms.

(Reuters) - Boost Mobile founder Peter Adderton is willing to pay up to $2 billion to buy back the prepaid wireless brand from Sprint Corp (N:S), he told Reuters on Monday, a significant potential premium to what satellite TV provider Dish Network (O:DISH) agreed to pay for Sprint's entire prepaid wireless business.
U.S. regulators approved Sprint's $26.5-billion merger with larger rival T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) in July. As a concession to regulators, the companies agreed to sell Sprint's prepaid wireless business, which includes the Boost and Virgin Mobile brands, to Dish for $1.4 billion, as well as sell some wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, to Dish for $3.6 billion.
The merger still faces a lawsuit by state attorneys general that alleges the merger is harmful to consumers.
T-Mobile and Sprint are currently re-negotiating terms of their merger agreement, which had expired on Nov. 1, providing a window of opportunity to make the offer, Adderton said.
T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere earlier this month declined to rule out requesting the $26 billion price be reduced as part of the negotiations.
Ever since the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint was announced last year, Adderton has been outspoken on Twitter that the combination would harm lower-income consumers who depend on prepaid phones, where users pay for phone service at the beginning of the month and are not required to pass a credit check.
Adderton has also questioned Dish's commitment to serving Boost customers, as the satellite company has focused its priorities on building a next generation 5G wireless network.
Adderton originally founded Boost Mobile in his native Australia and sold its U.S. business to Nextel in 2004, which was later acquired by Sprint."

The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrials, the NASDAQ Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes hit new intraday highs. The S&P 500 was up nearly 0.1% or 3 points at 2:50 p.m. ET (19:50 GMT). The Dow had added 0.1% or 28 points. The NASDAQ Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes were up 0.2% and 0.3%. The gains came after a strong rally Friday that pushed stocks to record highs.


The U.S.-China negotiations appeared to be stalled, despite Trump Administration assurances last week that negotiations were progressing. But reports from Bloomberg News and CNBC painted more complicated pictures of the status of the talks, with intense disputes inside the Trump Administration and Chinese pessimism a deal can be done. Still, Wall Street is assuming a deal, even a modest one, will get done.


The Administration did agree to a new 90-day extension that lets U.S. companies continue doing business with China's Huawei Technologies Co. as U.S. regulators continue crafting rules on telecommunications firms that pose national security risks. Semiconductor stocks moved higher.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday temporarily put on hold a lower court ruling that would require President Donald Trump's accounting firm to hand over some of his financial records to a Democratic-led House of Representatives committee.
The order issued by Chief Justice John Roberts does not indicate whether the court ultimately plans to hear Trump's appeal, filed on Friday, of the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It merely puts the litigation on hold while the nine justices decide how to proceed. The hold remains in effect until the court acts.
The case represents an important showdown pitting the powers of the presidency against the authority of Congress, with Trump fighting doggedly to keep details of this finances private even as he faces an impeachment inquiry in the House.
Trump turned to the justices after the D.C. Circuit decided last week that it would not revisit its October decision backing the House Oversight Committee's authority to subpoena the records from Mazars LLP, Trump's longtime accounting firm.
Earlier on Monday, the committee said it would not oppose a 10-day delay in enforcing the subpoena, but would not favor a longer delay sought by the Republican president.
Trump's lawyers had asked the justices for at least a temporary hold on the enforcement of the subpoena. They also want the matter to be put on hold for a longer period while the litigation is resolved.
If the Supreme Court declines to hear Trump's appeal, the documents would have to be handed over to lawmakers. Five votes among the justices are needed to grant a stay request. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority.
In a separate case, Trump last Thursday asked the Supreme Court to review a New York-based federal appeals court's ruling that local prosecutors can enforce a subpoena also issued to Mazars demanding Trump's personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018.
The House committee subpoenaed Mazars this year, saying it needed the records to determine if Trump complied with laws requiring disclosure of his assets, and to assess whether those laws needed to be changed."
1341,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 01:17PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Chip Stocks Rise as Huawei Granted Another Reprieve on Trade Ban,"Investing.com – Chip stocks climbed Monday as semiconductor companies like Micron Technology that count Huawei as an important customer were given a lifeline after the U.S. extended a license that lifts restrictions on U.S. companies from selling or transferring technology to Huawei.
The temporary general license, granted in Sept and due to expire on Tuesday, was extended for 90 days. The previous extension was granted to give U.S. companies more time to move from away using Huawei products amid national security concerns that the Chinese tech giant's relationship with the Chinese Communist Party runs too deep. 
""The Temporary General License extension will allow carriers to continue to service customers in some of the most remote areas of the United States who would otherwise be left in the dark,"" US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement on Monday. 
Huawei-exposed semi suppliers, including Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), rose about 0.73%, and 0.78%, respectively, as fears eased that domestic companies may have to halt sales to Huawei – a move that would not only stifle orders but exacerbate the chip inventory overhang that has plagued the sector.
More broadly, the extension gave investors some hope that the U.S. and China trade talks may be turning positive following reports over the weekend that Beijing, a key market for U.S. chip companies, was getting cold feet about consummating even a Phase One deal.
CNBC’s Eunice Yoon reported that Beijing was growing pessimistic about a trade deal as President Donald Trump was showing little willingness to roll back tariffs.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose about 0.30%, taking its gains for the year to about 51%. The gains came after an 8% loss in 2018.
Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is up more than 51% for the year. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has gained more than 24%. "

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 01:06PM ET</span>",Large gender bias class action vs Sterling Jewelers revived: U.S. appeals court,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday restored a nationwide class action arbitration allowing at least 70,000 female Sterling Jewelers employees to pursue claims that the retailer paid them less and promoted them less often than men for a decade.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in finding that an arbitrator lacked power to include women in the class who had not said they wanted to join it, rather than only the 254 who authorized it.
Circuit Judge Peter Hall said Sterling, a unit of Signet Jewelers Ltd (N:SIG), and the women were bound to arbitrator Kathleen Roberts' view on who belonged in the class, under an agreement the women signed as a condition of employment.
""The absent class members, no less than the parties, ... bargained for the arbitrator's construction of their agreement with respect to class arbitrability,"" Hall wrote.
Monday's 3-0 decision overturned a January 2018 ruling by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan.
The case had been brought in 2008 under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the federal Equal Pay Act.
A large class action could subject Signet to greater liability than if more women were forced to arbitrate individually.
Signet spokesman David Bouffard said Sterling, which has offices in Akron, Ohio, would continue defending itself, and was confident that the women's claims were ""wholly without merit.""
Joseph Sellers, a lawyer for the women, said in an interview he was pleased with the decision.
""It's a good thing for workers because it permits them to participate in classes certified in arbitration, in the same way (as) classes certified by the courts, to ensure that their interests and rights can be protected,"" he said.
The appeals court instructed Rakoff to decide whether Roberts exceeded her authority by certifying an ""opt-out"" class of plaintiffs, an issue that was not part of the appeal.
Sterling in May 2017 settled a similar case by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by agreeing to improve its employment practices and training, under a consent decree expiring in August 2020.
The case is Jock et al v Sterling Jewelers Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-153."

Vincenzo Capezzuto, head of Moreno Srl was placed under house arrest on charges of illegal employment and abduction, his lawyer, Rosario Pagliuca said.
Industry and investigative sources said the workshop in Melito, a suburb north of Naples with a large immigrant population, made shoes and bags for groups including Armani, Kering's (PA:PRTP) Saint Laurent and LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Fendi, whose products can sell for thousands of euros.
None of the companies confirmed any connection with Moreno and Saint Laurent denied any relationship.
Worldwide the luxury goods industry is estimated to be worth some 276 billion euros ($305.86 billion) in 2019, according to consultants Bain & Co and Fondazione Altagamma, the Italian luxury goods manufacturers' industry foundation.
However the case highlighted the murky world of sweatshop labor and fly-by-night subcontractors that lies behind many areas of the industry, which draws heavily on the cachet of the ""Made in Italy"" brand.
As police searched Morena's premises, some 50 workers, including a pregnant woman and two teenagers were hiding in a storeroom among rolls of leather and piles of shoes and bags before being found and brought out.
Pagliuca defended his client, saying small suppliers were integral to the industry and were often underpaid by the big fashion houses.
""The manufacturing district around Melito is seen as China, where production is decentralized from European industry due to low costs and poor workers' rights,"" he told Reuters.
He also denied workers had been abducted, saying they had agreed to hide to stop the company being shut down. He said they would all be put on regular contracts.
Most large fashion groups have teams of inspectors to ensure contractors respect labor and health and safety rules.
""But the production chain at times is too long. It happens that the original suppliers subcontract to other companies, without the brands knowing,"" a person working in the luxury industry told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Saint Laurent, controlled by French luxury group  Kering , said it had no relationship with Moreno. ""We are currently investigating the matter,"" it said.
In a statement, Armani said Moreno was not one of its direct suppliers or an authorized subcontractors. Fendi declined comment."

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 11:46AM ET</span>","Gulfport Energy to cut jobs, halt share buybacks","By David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. gas exploration and production company  Gulfport Energy  Corp (O:GPOR) on Monday confirmed that it would cut jobs, change its board and end its share buybacks, in a bid to reverse a slide in its stock price.
Reuters had reported the news earlier in the day, citing sources.
Gulfport shares, which fell 7.8% to $2.85 in morning trading, have lost about 67% of their market value in the last 12 months, as weak natural gas prices have eroded its profitability and forced it to slash capital investment.
Gulfport, whose production is focused primarily in the Utica Shale in Ohio and SCOOP acreage in Oklahoma, also made a new commitment to use excess cash to pay down debt, which totaled $2.1 billion as of the end of September.
The company said it would shed about 13% of its workforce. It also said that Chairman David Houston will not seek reelection to the company's board when his term ends in 2020, with two other directors - Craig Groeschel and Scott Streller - stepping down from Gulfport's board by the end of this year.
Gulfport has been under pressure from hedge fund Firefly Value Partners, its second-largest shareholder, to improve its stock performance. Firefly said in March it would not mount a challenge to Gulfport's board after the company agreed to a share buyback program.
Firefly had asked Gulfport to buy back $500 million worth of stock, but the company responded with a smaller $400 million program. It ended up buying only $30 million worth of stock in the first nine months of this year, according to company filings.
However, Gulfport spent $80 million to buy back $105 million of its debt in the third quarter, Chief Executive David Wood said on a Nov. 1 analysts call, noting the discount at which the bonds traded made repurchasing them an attractive option. The company also managed to report positive free cash flow in the third quarter.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 11:34AM ET</span>",Coty takes $600 million bet on reality star Kylie Jenner's beauty brands,"By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) said on Monday it would pay $600 million for a majority stake in Kylie Jenner's make-up and skincare businesses, as it looks to tap into the reality TV star's huge social media reach, sending its shares up as much as 5%.
One of the cosmetics world's older names, Coty is seeking to revitalize sales on the back of its broad global distribution and is banking on Jenner's more than 270 million social media followers to attract a younger audience.
Jenner, 22, the youngest sibling of the wildly popular Kardashian-Jenner clan, a household name a decade after their reality TV show ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" became a smash hit, started her make up line with lipstick and lip liner kits in 2015.
The kits sold out within minutes of launching, an early sign of her power as a social media influencer, and Coty said Kylie Cosmetics had an estimated $177 million in net revenues over the past 12 months.
Forbes, making her the youngest self-made billionaire on its 2018 list, said Jenner's line of cosmetics brought in sales of an estimated $360 million in 2018.
Coty will hold 51% of Jenner's business, valuing her company at about $1.2 billion.
""Kylie is a big brand in beauty today. She's very influential ... (but) Coty remains financially leveraged,"" D.A. Davidson retail analyst Linda Bolton Weiser said. 
Celebrities, including Jenner, are leveraging their huge social media following to launch their cosmetics and lifestyle brands and compete with established players in the market.
Social media-powered beauty brands such as Glossier, Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Huda Beauty have all notched up about $1 billion in valuation, according to media reports.
""I look forward to continuing the creativity and ingenuity for each collection that consumers have come to expect and engaging with my fans across social media,"" Jenner said in a statement. 
Coty has been doubling down on its skin care and fragrance products, rolling out new luxury fragrances and lipsticks, while spending more on marketing to combat falling sales.
The company, which is majority owned by German conglomerate JAB Holdings, has struggled to integrate about 40 beauty brands, including Covergirl and Max Factor, that it bought from Procter & Gamble (N:PG) in 2016, forcing it to take billions of dollars in writedowns and outline a four-year restructuring plan.
The partnership will add to Coty's net revenue growth of its core fragrance, cosmetics and skin care business by more than 1% per year over the next three years, the company said. 

The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, Coty said.

(Reuters) - Former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli will remain in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected his effort to overturn his conviction and seven-year sentence for securities fraud and conspiracy.
The justices refused to hear Shkreli's appeal of his August 2017 conviction and $7.36 million forfeiture for cheating investors in two hedge funds he founded, and trying to prop up the stock price of biotechnology company Retrophin Inc, which he once ran.
Shkreli, 36, argued that the jury instructions about the harm to his investors undermined his defense that he had acted in good faith. Shkreli also said the forfeiture was excessive because some investors received profits.
""It was a long shot,"" Shkreli's lawyer Mark Baker said in an interview. ""We're disappointed, but will move on.""
Shkreli is serving his sentence at a low-security prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. He is eligible for release in September 2023, when he will be 40.
Shkreli, sometimes called ""Pharma Bro,"" achieved notoriety by raising the price of the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by more than 5,000% in 2015 when he was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, now called Phoenixus AG.

He is also known for his frequent use of social media, including when during his trial he offered $5,000 for a strand of former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's hair. Bail was revoked after Shkreli made that offer.

The Riyadh-based discount carrier ordered 80 A320neo family jets in 2017, with purchasing options for an additional 40 aircraft. In June, it signed a preliminary agreement to swap some of those for larger A321 versions.
""We are thinking to confirm part of the options but still we are in negotiations with Airbus,"" CEO Chief Executive Bander Abdulrahman al-Mohanna told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow.
The airline plans to make an announcement with Airbus on Tuesday to ""confirm a couple of things,"" he said, declining to comment further.
As part the June agreement, flynas also placed a provisional order for 10 longer-range A321XLR jets.
The airline, at this stage, will continue to use engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between  General Electric  (N:GE) and  Safran  (PA:SAF) of France, in any potential order, Mohanna said.
Delivery of new A320 aircraft has been delayed this year as Airbus wrestles with production issues. The planemaker last month cut its full-year delivery goal for commercial jets.
""I don't think any airline that has an order of A320 family (jets) is not frustrated,"" Mohanna said.
Flynas continues to consider an order of either A330neo or Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787-8 jets, Mohanna said, but has concerns about the A330neo engine and the price of the 787.
The airline, partly owned by Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal's investment vehicle, expects to carry around 7.4 million passengers this year, representing a 10% increase.
Mohanna declined to say whether the airline would be profitable but warned that airlines in Saudi Arabia's domestic market were offering more seats than there is demand.
""It is proven there is a huge overcapacity in the domestic market that needs to be addressed,"" he said.
Flynas is consulting with the Saudi aviation regulator and expects that it will soon stake steps to address domestic overcapacity, Mohanna said."

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 10:37AM ET</span>",Corbyn effect? British utility debt boosted by nationalization bet,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - British utilities are becoming increasingly popular with bond investors who believe their debt may benefit if a Labour government comes to power in December's general election and takes them into public ownership. 
Labour's finance spokesman John McDonnell last week detailed the party's plans to nationalize parts of BT (L:BT) to provide free broadband for all if it wins the election. 
Previously, Britain's main opposition party has spoken about plans to nationalize privately-owned, and in many cases publicly listed, energy, water and rail companies should they come to power.
Most opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Party with a clear lead ahead of the Dec. 12 poll, suggesting a left-wing government under Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely. 
However, the Labour Party surpassed expectations at the previous election in 2017 and a Corbyn victory would be viewed as an unfavorable outcome by many in the financial markets community.
But some corporate bond investors are more sanguine.
""We believe that it would be a quite favorable outcome for British utilities on the debt side as the operating companies of these utilities will become more closely aligned with the UK government,"" said one portfolio manager who works for a British fund manager.
As a result, he said the fund he works for has added British utilities to their bond portfolios.
Utilities and telecoms collectively make up more than a third of the 502 billion pounds ($651 billion) UK corporate bond market, according to Refinitiv data. Of this, the energy and power sector makes up about 22.8% while telecoms makes up another 15.7%. 
""Labour have stated they want to pursue a model similar to TfL (Transport for London), which has a very close relationship with the UK government and enjoys a very high credit rating as a result,"" the investor added. 
TfL, which runs London's underground and bus network, enjoys a credit rating of AA- from ratings agencies S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch, just a notch below the UK government. 
Recent bond issuance by British utilities ranging from  National Grid  (LON:NG) Electricity Transmission to Scottish Power UK -- through its operating company SP Transmission -- have all been met with strong demand. SP Transmission's 350 million pound, 12-year bond issued early this month, for example, received enough demand to cover the deal nearly five times over. 
A source close to that transaction said: ""I think the market gave us a really easy time, there were no questions over nationalization... I was actually astonished."" 
Investors say the rationale is clear. 
""Labour publications suggest that bondholders at the regulated ringfenced level could be 'honored in full' and refinanced over a period of time so that the costs of debt are reduced,"" said Sharon Vieten, a credit analyst at fund manager Columbia Threadneedle, in a July note. 
She said the yield premium that investors demand to hold utility bonds over benchmark UK government debt, known as gilts, could fall.
""We estimate that at the 25-year maturity point, this tightening could reach a scale of 20-45 basis points (of yield) on UK gilts, compared to the current level of 140-160 basis points,"" Vieten wrote. 
There are also some signs of divergence within the structure of company debt that show investors are playing a nationalization trade. 
As Labour has said it will nationalize utilities at the operating company level, investors have started favoring operating company debt rather than holding company debt. 
Energy firm SSE's (L:SSE) February 2037 bond , issued through its Southern (NYSE:SO) Electricity Power Distribution plc operating company, is now far outperforming an August 2038 bond  issued through the holding company, by almost 30 basis points on yield. Yields move inversely to prices. 
For a graphic on SSE opco vs holdco debt, bond yields, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8771/8685/SSE%20graphic.png
One caveat is nationalization would require additional borrowing and could push gilt yields higher, hurting the credit rating of the UK government and, by extension, British utility debt. 
Ratings agency Fitch warned last week that the election pledges ahead of the vote heighten the United Kingdom's fiscal risks. 
But the portfolio manager said the nationalization plans wouldn't involve enough borrowing to put the 'Double A' UK rating at risk, and wouldn't deter him from investing in British utilities.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) will stop taking orders from prospective institutional investors for its $13.4 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong earlier than expected after attracting strong demand, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Order books will now close on Tuesday at 12 p.m. in New York (1700 GMT), half a day earlier than initially planned by the Chinese e-commerce giant and its investment banking advisers.
The decision was made by the company on Monday, the sources said. The final price that institutional investors will pay will still be set by Wednesday evening Hong Kong time, based on Tuesday's closing price in New York, they added. 
The sources, who could not be named because the information has not yet been made public, also told Reuters that the order books are covered ‘multiple times’. 
An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's decision to close the books early.
The listing is part of a year-end equity market rush which also includes the IPO of Saudi oil giant Aramco. 
The price range set by Aramco on Sunday values the company at up to $1.7 trillion, below the $2 trillion sought by Saudi Arabia's crown prince.
But the valuation still keeps it in the running to become the world's largest IPO, potentially topping Alibaba's record $25 billion New York stock market debut in 2014 if there is enough demand to use an over-allotment option. 
Alibaba's stock is due to start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on November 26, according to a prospectus lodged with New York regulators, with a listing ceremony scheduled for that day. 
The stockmarket debut in Hong Kong comes as the Chinese-controlled city battles worsening violence on the streets in anti-government protests which have been ongoing for nearly six months.

More than 4000 people have been arrested during that time and China warned on Monday that the world should not under-estimate its will to protect Hong Kong from 'criminals conducting violence against civilians'.

A fire weather watch has been issued by the National Weather Service for parts of northern California from late Tuesday night to Thursday morning. PG&E said in a statement overnight it may cut power to customers in the North Bay, North Valley and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada due to the forecast.
Southern (NYSE:SO) California, meanwhile, dodged a blackout threat for about 32,000 customers over the weekend as winds there faded.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Best Mart 360's chairman said on Monday he would keep every one of the popular Hong Kong snack food chain's stores open, despite them being repeatedly damaged during anti-government protests.
Lin Tsz Fung, whose Best Mart 360 was listed on the Hong Kong exchange in January, said he was optimistic of being able to limit the impact after talks with insurers about damage to some 72 of the firm's 102 shops.
""We have 700 staff and we're a listed company; it is unfair to stakeholders if we don't open our shops. We hope to minimize our losses,"" Lin told Reuters in his office.
Five months of protests have plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis in decades and tipped the Asian financial hub into recession. Meanwhile, Best Mart 360's share price has fallen by around 50% since May.

1366,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 08:46AM ET</span>",Aramco Failure to Win Foreign Investors Makes IPO a Local Event,"(Bloomberg) -- Two years ago, when the initial public offering of Saudi oil giant Aramco held the imagination of foreign investors, President Donald Trump felt compelled to publicly lobby for the share sale to happen in America.“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump tweeted in November 2017.Today Saudi Aramco isn’t just shunning New York -- and other international exchanges -- as a listing venue, but has decided it won’t even market the IPO to American, Canadian, European or Japanese investors. Instead, Aramco plans to rely heavily on ultra-wealthy Saudis, many of whom have been pressed to invest, to get the deal done. Saudi banks are loosening lending regulations to allow locals to buy more shares.
The IPO once was promoted as the strongest sign of economic change in Saudi Arabia: the deal that was going to attract tens of billions of foreign capital into the kingdom. Instead, a slimmed down share sale is starting to look more like a levy on the country’s economy as Saudi investors, large and small, take the place of foreign money managers.It may well still be the world’s largest IPO, perhaps raising about $25 billion and valuing the company at $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion, well above the biggest names of Silicon Valley. But that’s short of the $100 billion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said he was hoping to raise when he first mooted the IPO in 2016. At that point, he targeted a valuation of at least $2 trillion.“The valuation range is higher than most institutional investors would consider attractive,” said Neil Beveridge, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “Aramco’s price range would imply a premium valuation to western oil majors on almost every valuation metric.”The new valuation implies Aramco, which has promised a dividend of at least $75 billion next year, will reward investors with a dividend yield of between 4.4% and 4.7%, below what other oil majors pay.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). pays a dividend yield of just under 5%, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc pays 6.4%.
So poor is the international appetite for the deal, even at the lower valuation, Saudi Aramco decided at the last minute against marketing the IPO in the U.S., Canada and Japan -- three markets traditionally seen as a must-go destination for any big Wall Street deal. Instead of the planned approach to American investors, using what lawyers and bankers know as the 144A rule of the U.S. Securities Act, Aramco decided on Sunday the tepid interest meant it wasn’t worth the trouble.
The array of Wall Street banks, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, with mandates to sell the stock to international investors, were taken aback by the sudden decision, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private conversations.
Skipping the U.S. means saying goodbye to powerful American pension funds with billions of dollars managed from cities like Boston and Los Angeles.
On Monday, Aramco’s banks told investors in London and other European cities that roadshow events planned for this week had been canceled.
In a sign of Aramco’s shifting ambitions, the company has yet to publish an English version of the updated prospectus, more than 24 hours after the Arabic version posted the target price range.The difference between local and foreign investors is that Prince Mohammed, the country’s day-to-day ruler, has leverage at home. Overseas, he has almost none.
Many of the rich Saudi families that will now become key investors in Aramco learned the ruthlessness of Prince Mohammed during the crackdown that saw many arrested in the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh in 2017. Prince Mohammed also controls the local banking industry, which will lend billions of dollars to Saudi retail investors to buy shares.Despite the tepid interest overseas, the 34-year-old Prince Mohammed is all but sure to get the job done -- even if the result falls short of his original ambitions. As well as a lower valuation between $1.6 and $1.7 trillion, it won’t be the 5% of company’s capital he envisioend. Instead just 1.5% will be offered.
The combination of a lower valuation and a smaller stake means that there will almost certainly be enough Saudi money to buy the shares – and perhaps guarantee reasonable post-IPO trading -- but the sale will be a long way from the seismic global financial event Prince Mohammed touted in back in 2016."

The billion dollar new order, announced at the Dubai Air Show, is Boeing's second 737 MAX order after a deadly crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet in March led to the worldwide ban of the MAX fleet. British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) signed a letter of intent for 200 737 MAX planes in June.
Leisure airline SunExpress, a joint venture of Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), said in a statement that it signed the additional order on Monday and that the purchase was valued at $1.2 billion according to list prices.
The airline expressed confidence in the jet's capabilities and its return to service, even as Turkish Airlines has been critical of Boeing during the 737 MAX crisis.
""We believe this was and is the right decision for SunExpress in order to survive and be successful... The economics and the ecological advantages of this aircraft are valid and confirmed,"" Chief Executive Officer Jens Bischof said.

HP stock has gained about 10% and those of Xerox around 7% since Nov. 5, when the first news reports surfaced on Xerox's $33.5 billion cash-and-stock offer to buy bigger rival HP.
The printer industry has been in decline for years as growth in purely electronic communication cuts the need for printed letters and documentation. Both HP and Xerox earn a chunk of their revenue from selling printers and related accessories.
HP said in a statement on Sunday that it recognized the potential benefits of consolidation and added that with access to diligence information on Xerox it could quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction.
Xerox has a market value of $8.4 billion and HP is valued at nearly $30 billion.
""We continue to believe consolidation within the printing industry makes sense given a mature and secularly challenged end demand backdrop,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a client note.
Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a stake in Xerox, told the Wall Street Journal last week that he was not set on a particular structure for a deal with HP, as long as a combination is achieved.
Icahn, who also owns shares in HP, is yet to issue a statement on the latest developments. 
In its letter to HP's board, Xerox outlined about $2 billion in savings it said could be achieved within two years of the deal. 
""HP and Xerox's portfolios are largely complimentary given different focus areas, and see opportunity for significant cost takeout if the two companies were to combine,"" Credit Suisse said.

The battery in the new ID.3 can be used to add structural rigidity to the body and the modular layout of the battery allows for advantages in packaging and economies of scale. 
""If you focus on an electric platform, all in all it accounts for a 40% reduction against the predecessor electric Golf,"" Diess said. ""Most of it from cells and the battery system. Around 5-10% comes from dedicating an entire plant to electric vehicles."" 

This cost reduction is one of the reasons that Volkswagen is confident it can shift from making combustion-engined to electric cars without eroding the company's profit margin, VW said.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>",Banks and funds lower red flags on supercharged stocks,"By Tom Westbrook and Tom Arnold
SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - A raft of major banks and fund managers have upgraded their view on global equities, with emerging-market stocks their top pick to benefit from signs of easing in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
Fund manager J.P. Morgan Asset Management raised its outlook on global stocks, pointing to hopes for a breakthrough in the U.S.-China trade discussions, a reduced risk of a U.S. recession and a moderately positive earnings outlook.
The call, from the manager of $1.8 trillion in assets, comes as U.S. stock markets sit at a record high but a recent bond rally shows signs of unwinding.
""We have held a cautious view on the outlook for equity markets for much of this year ... however, the environment has shifted in recent weeks"" Patrik Schowitz, global multi-asset strategist at the fund manager, said in an emailed note.
""That change likely reflects several factors, which we think has some more room to run,"" he said.
Schowitz cited renewed optimism that Beijing and Washington will reach an agreement to end their trade dispute, recession risk in the U.S. dropping from an even chance to 20% to 30% and the possibility of earnings growth as the main factors. He did not specify how the upgrade would affect asset allocation nor offer target levels for equity indices.
Emerging-market equities were the most favored pick, alongside U.S. large-cap equities, Schowitz said.
Meanwhile, UBS said it was closing its underweight to emerging-market stocks and moved its overall position on equities to neutral.
""There have been material signs a U.S.-China deal is more likely, while monetary policy and economic fundamentals are also now more supportive,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""While equity prices have risen and downside risks remain, upside potential has also increased.""
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also joined in, upgrading emerging-market equities to equal weight from underweight on a better global growth outlook outside the U.S., singling out South Korea which it upped to overweight.
Morgan Stanley saw the biggest potential in markets with a clearer path to earnings growth, such as developing-market stocks and Japan, or a scope for multiple re-rating on falling political risks, such as Europe.
""Neither of these factors are at play in the U.S., where we remain UW (underweight) given peak earnings risk, higher relative valuation and unique political risk to sentiment,"" it added.
Rabobank also spotted signs of change, saying November's divergence between the MSCI emerging-markets stocks index and the S&P 500 Index against the MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index, which during September and October rose in tandem, was unlikely to last.
""Either EM stocks will start to outperform U.S. equities and the ratio rises sharply or the MSCI EM FX Index falls,"" it said.
World shares were close to a record high on Monday after Beijing surprised markets by trimming a key interest rate for the first time since 2015, stirring speculation that further stimulus was on the way for the world's second-largest economy."

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",Tata Steel plans to cut jobs across European operations,"LONDON (Reuters) -  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) plans to cut jobs across its European operations as it wrestles with excess supply and high costs, the company said on Monday.
Following a weekend interview in the Financial Times with the group's European chief executive, Henrik Adam, Tata confirmed it was planning to announce job cuts across the European business, which employs around 20,000 people. 
No numbers have been made public. Indian-owned Tata Steel, which launched a transformation program in June to strengthen its European business, has operations including steelmaking in the Netherlands and Wales and downstream operations across Europe.
There will be no plant closures but the aim is to shield the company against the ""huge number of challenges"" it faces, the company said.
""We are working hard on our plans to be operationally cash positive,"" Adam said, adding that the company was aiming for ""a fundamental change"". A company spokesman confirmed Adam's comments originally made to the Financial Times.
Steel making in Europe has come under strain from international competition and high energy costs, putting large numbers of well-paid jobs under threat.
European steelmakers blame China for the extent of a surplus in the market, but the world's biggest steelmaker says it has made its own deep cuts to capacity.
Britain last week announced that Chinese steelmaker Jingye has signed a provisional deal to buy British Steel, which went into compulsory liquidation in May.
The agreement is politically resonant ahead of British elections as job opportunities have become a major issue. If confirmed, the rescue could save thousands of jobs.
ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), the world's biggest steelmaker, has idled a series of plants across Europe.
In an emailed statement on Monday, Tata Steel said challenging market conditions had been made ""worse by the use of Europe as a dumping ground for the world's excess capacity"".
The company's European transformation program launched in June aimed to develop ""a simpler and leaner organization, capable of sustainably financing high levels of investment, Tata said.
Changes will include streamlining supply chains and using technology to improve efficiency, as well as seeking to cut employment costs.
Tata's quest to boost profitability follows a European anti-trust decision to block a joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG).

DUBAI (Reuters) - Replacing all Pratt & Whitney engines on IndiGo's fleet of almost 100 Airbus planes by Jan. 31, as ordered by India's aviation watchdog, will be challenging but the airline aims to complete the work, its chief executive officer said on Monday.
India's aviation regulator on Nov. 1 ordered IndiGo (NS:INGL) to replace all Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines on its fleet of twin-engined Airbus A320neo family aircraft with new P&W power units, following recent inflight engine shutdowns that caused ""serious concern"".
""It's a challenge. But we have every intention of meeting it. Pratt is helping us and we are trying to make that work as fast as we can,"" Ronojoy Dutta, IndiGo CEO, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Dubai airshow.
Low cost carrier IndiGo is Airbus' (PA:AIR) biggest client for A320neo planes, and while the United Technologies' (N:UTX) P&W engines are fuel efficient there have been issues since they entered service in 2016, forcing the airline to ground its planes several times.
In June, IndiGo, India's biggest airline, dropped P&W in favor of French-U.S. engine venture CFM by agreeing a record $20 billion deal for more than 600 engines to power Airbus jets already on order.
In October IndiGo placed an order for another 300 A320neo-family jets but it has yet to decide the engine provider - P&W or CFM, which is jointly owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE) of the United States.
""We will be talking to both Pratt and CFM, whoever has the best offer we will give it to them,"" Dutta said.
IndiGo is focused on growing its international routes and the plane order includes a long-range version of the single-aisle A320neo family, A321XLR which will provide the airline with ""a lot of growth"", Dutta said.
He said ordering widebodies was a distant dream for IndiGo and a part of its five-year plan but no decision had been finalised.
Dutta also said that a dispute between the airline's two promoters and largest shareholders, Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal, was having no impact on the company.
""Both promoters are very much unified in their strategy for expansion. Let's grow fast, let's expand international, they agree with that completely,"" Dutta said."

The bank took action after finding the account was being used inconsistently with its original paperwork, the Hong Kong Economic Journal said. The firm informed the client last month that it will close the account after a 30-day notice period that ends this week, according to the report, which didn’t identify who opened it.
“As part of our responsibility to know our customers and safeguard the financial industry, we regularly review our customers’ accounts,” Vinh Tran, a spokeswoman for the bank in Hong Kong, said in an email statement that didn’t elaborate on the account at issue. “If we spot activity differing from the stated purpose of the account, or missing information, we will proactively review all activity, which can also result in account closure.”
Hong Kong’s polarizing protests have created headaches for companies including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI). that have come under heavy political pressure to cut any perceived ties with the city’s pro-democracy movement -- only to later face public backlash. In pointing to well-established banking regulations, HSBC may show it had no discretion in the account’s closing and that it isn’t because of politics.
Another organization, 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which helps protesters pay medical expenses and legal fees, said Monday on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that its HSBC account is running normally.
Few global companies have tied their fortunes as closely to Hong Kong as London-based HSBC, which keeps pressure on the bank to maintain its standing with residents there. The firm drew more than 35% of its adjusted revenue from the city during this year’s first nine months. When reporting results in October, it said business there was proving resilient despite the turmoil.
Banks are required to “effectively assess risk” regarding account activity, ensuring the consistency of their stated purpose and source of funding, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in a separate statement on Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares were close to a record high on Monday, after Beijing surprised markets by trimming a key interest rate for the first time since 2015.
In the latest show of support for its economy, China's central bank cut rates on seven-day reverse repurchase agreements by five basis points to 2.50%.
The news helped Asia's main markets close higher (CSI300) (N225) (HSI) and Europe followed suit, though 0.1% to 0.3% moves showed the initial reaction was cautious. 
It did nudge MSCI's 49-country world share index <..MIWD00000PUS> 0.12% higher to leave it less than 1% off the record high it set back in early 2018.
""It is a slow start to a slow week, but risk is marginally on,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes. 
He added it was now hard to avoid concluding that China was slowly easing monetary policy, having held off in recent months, perhaps wary of drawing fresh criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump during trade talks. 
""Maybe that's what 5 basis points is all about. It's not rocking the boat, but it's a shift."" 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was extending its six-week winning streak. The index is only 8 points short of its own record high of 415.18 points hit in mid-April. 
Japan's Nikkei (N225) gained 0.5% and was just short of its recent 13-month top. E-Mini futures pointed to S&P 500 (ESc1) adding to Friday's record highs. (N)
Beijing's latest policy bolstered to hopes it might also be more serious about making progress in trade talks with the United States.
On Saturday, Chinese state media said the two sides had ""constructive talks"" on trade in a high-level phone call that included Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
""More than in previous rounds, we see momentum toward reaching at least a limited trade deal, and certainly a mini-deal would remove some of the negative sentiment overhang for the real economy and markets,"" said Patrik Schowitz, global multi-asset strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
""We have upgraded our outlook on equities as an asset class,"" he added. ""Emerging-market equities are now our most favoured region alongside U.S. large-cap equities.""
LOOKING TO THE FED
The dollar was little changed against other major currencies on Monday and within recent trading ranges. Volatility in the market has been the lowest in decades recently and shows no sign of shifting.
The dollar rose against the safe-haven yen to 108.94  The euro traded at $1.1063 (EUR=) having found support at $1.0987 last week. Investors are waiting for the first major speech by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, due on Friday, for clues on future policy. Sterling gained to $1.2952  as more polls showed the Tories ahead in the campaign for Britain's Dec. 12 election. The dollar and bonds are likely to be sensitive to minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting, set to be released on Wednesday. ""The minutes are likely to reiterate that the U.S. economy is 'solid' and that current monetary policy settings are 'appropriate', which would support the dollar,"" said Joseph Capurso, a currency analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. However, he noted a report on October U.S. retail sales released on Friday suggested previously strong consumption might be slowing. ""Any further weakness in consumption could warrant a material reassessment of the outlook by the FOMC.  Under our baseline, the FOMC would most likely start cutting interest rates again in 2020,"" said Capurso. Spot gold fell to $1,459 per ounce . 
Oil prices also fell, after Brent touched a seven-week high on Friday. [O/R] Brent crude (LCOc1) futures dropped 18 cents to $63.12 a barrel. U.S. crude (CLc1) slipped by 4 cents to $57.69.

1383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 04:17AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Sees U.S. Underperforming in 2020 Across Markets,"(Bloomberg) --  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) predicted that American equities and corporate bonds will underperform peers next year, while the dollar weakens as growth outside the U.S. picks up.
“We see the biggest potential upside in markets with a clearer path to achievable earnings growth (Japan and EM) or scope for some multiple re-rating on falling political risks (Europe),” strategists including Andrew Sheets, Michael Wilson and Matthew Hornbach wrote in a yearly outlook dated Nov. 17, with regard to stocks.
The Wall Street bank sees a modest decline in the S&P 500 Index by the end of next year, to 3,000 from 3,120 at last week’s close. American shares have been global leaders this year, though closely followed by European ones as both markets benefited from central banks starting another monetary easing cycle.
That was a cycle Morgan Stanley miscalculated a year ago, when the bank’s strategists were “neutral” on equities relative to a benchmark allocation. The MSCI AC World Index is currently sitting on a 22% total return for 2019 so far.
“We underestimated the aggressiveness of the central bank response, the decline in DM and EM inflation that would make this possible, and the willingness of markets to pay much higher multiples even as global earnings growth turned negative,” the team wrote. DM refers to developed markets and EM is emerging markets. “We are skeptical that central banks can pull off the same trick twice,” they wrote.
Challenges for the U.S. next year range from the risk that corporate earnings have peaked, high relative valuations on shares and “unique” political risk in the run-up to the presidential election.
“Stretched U.S. asset valuations will likely decline as U.S. growth slows to trend, further weighing on the dollar as net portfolio inflows fall,” Morgan Stanley currency strategists led by Hans Redeker wrote.
The bank still saw potential for a rebound in the dollar against currencies tied to the growth cycle in the second half of 2020, as the presidential election may make the risk environment “more challenging.” Havens like the yen and Swiss franc could also do well, the bank said.
In fixed income, Morgan Stanley is neutral on Treasuries and Japanese government bonds, and underweight German bunds and U.K. gilts. As for corporate debt, again underperformance against the rest of the world is the name of the game. “A better growth impulse outside the U.S. and relative valuations result in marginal positive returns for Asia and European credit.”

1384,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>","Apple iPhone 11 Scores Early China Success, Official Data Shows","(Bloomberg) -- Chinese consumers are rediscovering their appetite for iPhones.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shipped 10 million iPhones in China during September and October, based on Bloomberg’s calculations from government data on overall and Android device shipments. That’s the first indication of the company’s performance following the autumn release of its latest gadgets, and it shows iPhone shipments up 6% from a year earlier, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, which is run by the country’s technology ministry.
That affirms expectations that Apple’s iPhone 11 is selling more strongly than its predecessor, particularly in a market that’s second only to the U.S. in its importance to Apple’s bottom line. The company had recently been stuck in a rut in China, ceding ground to local rivals like Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp., which offer more enticing pricing, better specifications and increasingly premium design. Apple also lost market share to Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. and Huawei globally prior to the iPhone 11’s release. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said new pricing, a monthly payment program and trade-in offers helped the iPhone’s performance in China.
“Chinese customers seem to be receiving the iPhone 11 series better than last year’s models because of the lowered retail price,” said Nicole Peng, a Canalys analyst. “We see weaker shipments for old models but the latest products are going strong.”

Overall Chinese smartphone shipments dropped 5% to 69.3 million units during the two months, according to reports published by the academy, which is run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and tracks the number of smartphones that get permits to be sold in China.
Apple took major strides to increase battery life in its iPhone 11 and 11 Pro devices while lowering the starting price by $50. After years of stagnation in cameras, the company overhauled the iPhone’s image quality this year, catching up to category leaders Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Huawei. This approach drew an overwhelmingly positive critical reception.
In China, however, Apple still faces an uphill climb against local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi. Beyond new device sales, Apple’s other major challenge there will be to make available more of its lucrative subscription services. As the company transitions to a business model more reliant on recurring fees -- such as via iTunes Music, Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade -- their unavailability in China becomes increasingly a hurdle to growth.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Kuwait's  Jazeera Airways  (KW:JAZK) is unhappy with delivery delays of Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft and has no plans to place an order at this week's Dubai Airshow, its chief executive said.
Airbus and Boeing (N:BA) are vying for an order of up to 25 narrowbody jets from the Middle East budget carrier which now expects to place an order by the middle of next year.
""We have no plans to make an order announcement at the air show,"" Rohit Ramachandran told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow.
The Airbus A320 operator says production issues have delayed the delivery of new aircraft this year, forcing it to push back some route launches this year.
""We are not happy with the delays that are occurring in the production line and I think Airbus is very aware of our position,"" Ramachandran said.
""I don't see a major improvement. I think they continue to have unplanned delays in production,"" he said.
Airbus last month cut its full-year delivery goal for commercial jets, as the planemaker wrestles with production issues.
Jazeera, whose fleet will expand to 13 jets this year, has been considering placing an order for over a year. It has consistently pushed back potential deadlines on when it could sign a deal and its CEO said it was in no rush.
""We want to make our shareholders rich, not Boeing and Airbus shareholders rich,"" said Ramachandran.
An order could be worth around $3 billion at list prices, depending on which aircraft are ordered, but it is common for airlines to receive discounts.
Any order could include longer range narrowbody jets like the Airbus A321XLR, Ramachandran said.
Airbus and Boeing said they are mostly sold out of the latest versions of their workhorse single-aisle jets until 2024 after selling thousands in recent years. 
""If we really put money on the table, we are confident we will be able to get aircraft in a timely manner,"" said Ramachandran, who wants to start receiving new aircraft in 2022.
Jazeera, one of the Middle East's few listed airlines, expects to carry just under 3 million passengers this year.

1393,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 01:03AM ET</span>",How Saudi Aramco’s Mammoth Share Sale Stacks Up in Five Charts,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia put a valuation on oil giant Aramco of between $1.6 trillion and $1.71 trillion, well below the $2 trillion target sought by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since he first touted the deal in 2016.
The kingdom will list only 1.5% of the company on the Tadawul and the offering will mainly target local investors. If shares price at 32 Saudi riyals ($8.53) -- the high end of the range -- it will just beat  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to the title of the world’s biggest IPO.
At the lower end of 30 riyals, Aramco will still be more than three times bigger than the entire Saudi stock market. A poll of 24 money managers by Bloomberg News shows more than 40% put the company’s fair range at $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion.
The new valuation implies Aramco, which has promised a dividend of at least $75 billion next year, will reward investors with a yield of between 4.4% and 4.7%. That compares with just under 5% for  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and 6.4% for Shell (LON:RDSa).
Read more details disclosed on Nov. 17.
At this rate, it would dwarf last year’s payouts from the 80 listed firms on the Saudi bourse that paid dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors who buy into the IPO have been guaranteed that the dividend won’t fall until after 2024.
No matter what the final valuation, the share sale will create a public company of unmatched profitability. Aramco earned a net income of $111 billion in 2018 on revenue of $315 billion. It pumps about 10% of the world’s oil from giant fields under the kingdom’s deserts.
The company is so big, investors and analysts were concerned it could drain liquidity from the Saudi market. In recent months, many analysts have said that local investors -- key for a successful deal -- were offloading some of their portfolio to buy Aramco shares.
Read more about what Gulf investors are saying about the IPO.
The Tadawul All Share Index has under performed emerging markets as the Saudi government accelerated preparations for the IPO. The index, which finished little changed on Sunday, has retreated 1.1% since Aug. 29, compared with an 8.1% increase for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.

1394,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 01:02AM ET</span>",South African Airways Faces Regulator Inquiry Over Sale Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- South African Airways officials will be summoned to a meeting with regulators next month to disclose details about talks with potential equity partners and give assurances that any deal won’t violate foreign-ownership laws.
Under the Air Services Licensing Act of 1990, airlines must be at least three-quarters owned by South Africans to operate a domestic service. That would prevent international operators from buying more than a 25% stake from the government, unless the rules are changed.
“We are going to be calling SAA to next month’s meeting to share with us what their plans are,” said Mike Mabasa, chairman of the Air Services Licensing Council, which regulates domestic aviation within South Africa. “If they are already in conversations with strategic equity partners we need to know what that entails.”
Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said last month the government is talking with potential investors in SAA, which is technically insolvent and reliant on bailouts and other forms of state support to survive. The carrier last week triggered a plan to cut 944 jobs to reduce costs -- leading to an ongoing strike that started on Friday.
Two labor groups on Sunday said they are consulting with workers about intensifying the strike across the aviation industry after failing to reach a deal over wage increases and job cuts at the weekend. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the South African Cabin Crew Association argue that ending the outsourcing of services would help reduce costs.
“It is clear to us that the management of SAA is not prepared to do what is necessary to save the airline,” they said in a joint statement.
Investor Interest
Ethiopian Airlines Group Chief Executive Officer Tewolde Gebre Mariam has said the continent’s biggest airline would consider taking a stake in SAA, a partner in the Star Alliance. Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. founder Richard Branson has also indicated an interest.
“If some tough decisions need to be made, we’ll make them,” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Thursday. He’s previously said the company will need to remove unnecessary costs to attract a viable buyer.
Routes to some international destinations including London and New York are due to resume Sunday night.
SAA’s ongoing battle with unions may prove decisive to the carrier’s survival, with an estimated 50-million rand ($3.4 million) of losses incurred with every day of strike action, and little in the way of leeway in terms of cash reserves. Labor groups are demanding a reversal of the plan to reduce the workforce by about a fifth on top of an 8% pay rise and other employment benefits.
“SAA pretends as if its service is indispensable, which is not the case,” because it has just a 20% market share, and other carriers can step in in the event of its demise, said Gerhard Papenfus, chief executive officer of the National Employers’ Association of South Africa. “This notion of indispensability, however, emboldens the trade unions to make unrealistic demands.”
Tlali Tlali, SAA’s spokesman, didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone seeking comment.

1396,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2019 12:35AM ET</span>",Ford bets on an electric Mustang to charge its turnaround,"By Joseph White
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Mustang Mach E electric sport utility vehicle  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) unveiled in Los Angeles on Sunday is more than another car for the storied automaker. 
The Mach E has become within Ford a high-profile test for a restructuring that has been marred by profit warnings, costly quality problems and the troubled launch this year of another important vehicle, the Ford Explorer sport utility.
For Chief Executive Jim Hackett, the Mach E's aggressive design and futuristic interior represent a long-awaited, visible sign of the overhaul of the company's product creation process he has tried to explain to skeptical Wall Street analysts for the past two years.
By accelerating the ""clock speed"" of vehicle development, cutting overlapping product architectures to just five from 13 and extending the company's most successful brands to new products, Ford could slash $20 billion out of a five-year, 2018-2023 product plan, Hackett told Reuters. 
""This is the first thing we generated out of this new thinking,"" Hackett said in an interview ahead of the Mach E unveiling. ""We have a lot more coming.""
For Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr., the Mustang Mach E puts together two previously conflicting goals: His desire for Ford to be a leader in clean cars and make the automaker carbon-neutral by 2030, and his personal love of the Mustang and its growling V-8 engine.
""We are really pushing our chips in on the table with this vehicle,"" Ford said in an interview ahead of the Mach E's unveiling. The automaker has said it will spend $11.5 billion developing electric and hybrid models by 2022.
Automakers have struggled to make money on electric vehicles. Bill Ford told Reuters on Sunday after unveiling the Mach E ""will be profitable right from the start.""
Ford's confidence in the Mach E, and its determination to challenge Tesla, was reflected in the location the company chose to reveal it: An airplane hangar just a short walk from the main offices of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's SpaceX operations in Hawthorne, Calif. Musk often uses SpaceX facilities to unveil Tesla's new models, and has scheduled the debut of his electric pickup truck for somewhere in Los Angeles on Thursday.
Musk replied to Ford’s event with a tweet late Sunday:
“Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too.""
The Mach E started with humble ambitions. 
The SUV originally was to be what Ted Cannis, Ford's global director for electrification, called a ""compliance"" play - an electric variant of a front-wheel drive internal combustion vehicle, aimed at generating emissions credits to comply with clean air regulations at low cost. There was no link to Mustang's muscle car image.
Boring electric cars were the norm for Ford and other legacy automakers. Then Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) in 2013 launched its Model S - an electric car that looked like a sporty European luxury sedan with a giant screen for a dashboard and entertainment and functional features that could be upgraded with over-the-air software updates. 
Tesla's market value is now higher than Ford's.
Ford's own customer research showed dull electric cars were a mistake, Cannis and other executives said. 
'MUSTANG EXPERIENCE'
Those doubts came to a head in mid-2017 when Hackett, then newly appointed, reviewed the design for the electric SUV with Executive Vice President Jim Farley, who has owned seven of the cars starting with a 1965 model he restored when he was 14 years old. 
""It's not good enough,"" Hackett recalled saying. Farley agreed, and Hackett said, ""We tear it up.""
The team designing the vehicle started over, using a new architecture engineered from the start to be a battery electric vehicle, instead of the original plan to use a modified version of an internal combustion engine vehicle, Ford executives said.
The Mustang muscle car's distinctive ""shark face"" front end and body proportions were adapted to a new skin, and under the floor Ford designed a new battery pack that can deliver up to 300 miles (483 km) of range in an ""extended range"" version. 
The re-do had to be accomplished much faster than normal to stay on target for a fall 2020 launch.
""We were super behind time,"" said exterior designer Chris Walter during a briefing on the vehicle ahead of the Los Angeles debut. 
A concept for new dashboard software and a display using a 15.5-inch (39 cm) diagonal screen was pulled together in just 90 days by a 15-person group that called itself Team Menlo - a reference to Thomas Edison's Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory. A paper prototype of the new screen used an empty Keurig coffee pod to represent a large control knob. 
The overhaul cost money, but Ford product development chief Hau Thai-tang told Reuters the dedicated electric vehicle architecture should allow for 25% to 30% improvements in manufacturing efficiency to help offset the cost. 
The final call on using the Mustang name came from the top, and was not given easily.
""I was dead set against it, initially,"" Bill Ford said. Ford said he started to warm to the idea as he saw the styling and the performance data for the vehicle.
Ford said he did not grant his approval until earlier this year after driving a prototype.
""It felt like a Mustang experience to me,"" he said.
TURNING POINTS
This is not the first time a challenge to reinvent the Mustang has emboldened Ford employees to break with convention during a rough patch in the company's history.
The original Mustang launched in 1964 was derived from a mainstream Falcon compact car, and quickly became a hit, far out-selling the company's projections. 
In the early 1990s, with the economy in a slump, a small group of Ford employees rebelled against a plan to transform the rear-wheel drive Mustang into a front-wheel drive car developed by Ford's then-partner, Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261). That project became a laboratory for cutting the costs of product engineering by putting representatives of different functions on the same team.

The Mach E is another turning point, Hackett said. ""The science project platform for EVs is now gone.""

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2019 11:52PM ET</span>",U.S. expected to grant Huawei 90-day license extension Monday: sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is set to issue a 90-day extension of a license on Monday allowing U.S. companies to continue doing business with China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], two sources familiar with the deliberations said.
Reuters reported Friday that an initial extension of around two weeks was expected and a longer extension was in the works, but had not yet been finalized due to regulatory hurdles. Over the weekend, the Trump administration's plans changed and it now plans to renew the temporary extension for the same 90-day period as it did in August, the sources said. 
After adding Huawei to an economic blacklist in May citing national security concerns, the U.S. Commerce Department has allowed it to purchase some American-made goods in a move aimed at minimizing disruption for its customers, many of which operate networks in rural America.
The extension will be announced Monday, when the earlier reprieve is set to expire, the sources said. The sources declined to be identified as the extension has not been publicly announced.
A spokesman for Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecom network equipment, said Friday the company does not comment on rumors and speculation. The Commerce Department declined to comment.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network on Friday that some rural carriers need the temporary licenses and are dependent on Huawei for 3G and 4G networks.
""There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities - we don’t want to knock them out. So, one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate,"" Ross said.
The development comes amid discussions between the United States and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war that has lasted for over a year.
In blacklisting Huawei, the U.S. government said it had a ""reasonable basis to conclude that Huawei is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests."" Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations.
Last week, Attorney General William Barr said Huawei and ZTE Corp (HK:0763) ""cannot be trusted,"" as he backed a proposal to bar U.S. rural wireless carriers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment or services from them.
In May, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The Commerce Department was directed to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October but has yet to publish one.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung's plan to outsource a fifth of its smartphone production to China next year may help it compete with low-cost rivals such as Huawei and Xiaomi but it's a strategy fraught with risks, people with familiar with the move said.
Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), which shut its last in-house Chinese smartphone factory in October, is quietly moving production of some Galaxy A models to contractors such as Wingtech, which are little known outside China.
Samsung has been coy about the volumes involved but sources said the South Korean tech giant plans to ship some 60 million phones made in China by so-called original design manufacturers (ODMs) next year out of a total of about 300 million devices.
Wingtech and other ODMs make phones for multiple brands - including Huawei [HWT.UL], Xiaomi and Oppo - giving them the economies of scale to keep costs down, and the nimble contractors can develop and produce new budget phones quickly.
Critics of Samsung's strategy say it risks losing control of quality and undermining its manufacturing expertise by outsourcing, and may even help rivals by giving contractors the extra volume they need to lowers costs further for all.
Samsung can ill afford another quality crisis. It scrapped its flagship Galaxy Note 7 in 2016 after reports the expensive phones were catching fire and delayed the launch of its folding phone this year after screen defects were identified.
But with margins razor thin for budget smartphones, people familiar with Samsung's strategy say it has little choice but to follow rivals and use Chinese ODMs to shave costs.
""This is an inevitable strategy rather than a good strategy,"" a source with knowledge of Samsung's Chinese operations said.
Samsung said in a statement to Reuters that it has been making limited lines of smartphones outside its own plants to broaden its existing portfolio and ""ensure efficient management in the market"". It declined to say how many Samsung phones are made by ODMs and said future volumes had yet to be determined.
Wingtech did not respond to a request for comment.
CHEAPER COMPONENTS
Research firm Counterpoint says ODMs can procure all the components needed for $100-$250 smartphones for 10% to 15% less than major brands with their own factories in China.
One supply chain source said Wingtech can get some parts for up to 30% less than Samsung Electronics pays in Vietnam, where it has three factories churning out smartphones, TVs and home appliances.
Wingtech started making tablets and phones for Samsung in 2017, accounting for 3% of its smartphones. That's expected to hit 8%, or 24 million units, this year, according to IHS Markit.
Samsung's outsourcing plans involve its lower and mid-range Galaxy A series, with Wingtech having a hand in both design and production, sources said. The A6S, one of the models to be outsourced, costs from 1,299 yuan ($185) in China.
The Wingtech phones will mainly go to Southeast Asia and South America, one source said. Samsung is gaining share in both at the expense of Huawei, which is suffering from U.S. sanctions that bar it from putting all Google's services on new phones.
While Samsung is anxious to remain global smartphone market leader, some analysts worry it might not be worth the risk given that profits in the budget phone business are scarce for all.
""Low-end phones are headache for Samsung,"" said CW Chung, head of research at Nomura in Korea.
Chung said they were now commodity products and it was ""nonsense"" to make them in-house. But he and other experts said if Samsung gave ODMs more volume, that could cut contractors' costs further and boost their experience and knowledge.
""If ODM firms become more competitive, rivals will be more competitive,"" Tom Kang, an analyst at Counterpoint said, adding that once a company loses its expertise in making low-end phones by outsourcing, it is difficult to regain the know-how.
'GAME OF SURVIVAL'
Chung said Samsung's strategic shift signaled the declining manufacturing prowess of the company, once a low-cost Asian manufacturer and now the world's top producer of high-end electrical consumer goods.
U.S. rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) outsources production to Taiwan's Foxconn Technology, which has factories in China, but Apple still designs its phones in California.
Samsung said in an emailed response to Reuters that it will be involved in the oversight of the design and development of smartphones produced by ODMs.
One person familiar with Samsung and Chinese ODMs said contractors save money by cutting some steps out of the manufacturing process, potentially raising quality issues. He declined to go into details.
With that in mind, Samsung has been pairing South Korean component suppliers with Chinese contractors to keep closer tabs on quality control, the person said.
""We understand the logic of increasing the production volume with Chinese contractors is a strategic business decision but that doesn't mean all of us are happy about it,"" an executive at a Korean component supplier said.
Samsung told Reuters it has applied the same quality checks and standards it does with all its devices, adding that it was committed to delivering high-quality products.
Historically, Samsung has designed and produced almost all its phones in-house in vast factories in Vietnam and, more recently, India while winding down production in South Korea and China where labor costs more.
But Roh Tae-moon, the youngest executive to become a president at Samsung Electronics, is championing the new ODM strategy in his role as number two at the mobile division, two people familiar with the matter said.
""It is crucial to cut costs to maintain competitiveness with Huawei and other Chinese handset makers,"" said a Samsung insider who declined to be named.
Other Korean firms have also embraced outsourcing. LG Electronics, whose smartphones have been losing money for several years, has said it plans to expand its ODM output from budget models to mid-priced phones.
""Smartphones have come down to a battle over costs. It's a game of survival now,"" said Kim Yong-serk, a former Samsung mobile executive who is a professor at South Korea's Sungkyunkwan University."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) fought to save billions of dollars of jet deals on Sunday as host airline Emirates kept the Dubai Airshow in suspense over dozens of tentative orders designed to fine-tune the world's largest international airline network.
The world's top jetmakers are trying to win final approval for more than $30 billion in orders from Emirates that have been on ice for up to two years as Emirates protests about industrial delays.
Interlocking deals involving a total of 110 Boeing 787 and Airbus A330neo and A350 are up for grabs, but it remains unclear whether there was room for all them in Emirates' revised fleet, delegates said.
Emirates wants to reduce an order for 150 Boeing 777X after deliveries were pushed back by a year and may use at least part of the 787 order as leverage.
It also has a total of 70 A330neo and A350 orders pending as part of a deal triggered by Airbus' recent decision to axe the slow-selling A380, for which Emirates was the biggest supporter.
The plans involve reshaping the fleet to adapt to demand for shorter regional flights, but delegates said they could not rule out a repeat of 2017 when an air show deal was postponed.
""It feels like two years ago. It is hard to predict,"" a senior industry source said.
Negotiations to unjam the orders dragged into Sunday evening after a muted start to the Nov 17-21 show saw just two planes ordered, for Biman Bangladesh Airlines, delegates said.
All of the parties declined to comment.
In an interview with German publication aero.de on the eve of the show, Emirates boss Tim Clark signaled he would not place orders and complained about widespread delivery delays.
DUBAI SUPPORT
Boeing meanwhile continued to adopt a contrite tone over the grounding of its 737 MAX in the wake of two crashes.
In a signal of support for the embattled planemaker, Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum visited Boeing's stand while inaugurating the show.
Airbus is poised to clinch a deal for as many as 120 A320neo from Air Arabia, while Air Senegal will take A220s, delegates said. Bloomberg said the Senegal deal involved 8 jets.
Possible regional targets for Boeing's MAX include Turkey's SunExpress, which currently flies earlier 737s. The airline is co-owned by Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO).
Signing for larger jets, Biman Bangladesh Airlines backed Boeing.
""We are trusting and doing business with Boeing and that is indicated by signing these two new 787-9,"" said Biman Chairman Muhammad Enamul Bari.
Ethiopian Airlines, one of two airlines involved in the MAX crashes that led to the grounding, declined to be drawn on whether it would continue to take delivery of the jet but signed a deal to retrofit its 787 fleet with in-flight Internet.
The show started amid a fragile local economy hit by relatively low oil prices and a stand-off between U.S.-backed Gulf Arab states and Iran, coupled with fuel protests in Iran.
Defense exhibits featured missiles and anti-drone systems as well a new Saab surveillance plane for the UAE.
""Tensions in the region are running high,"" said commentator Vago Muradian, editor-in-chief of Defense & Aerospace Report.
""Iran is looming very, very large after the resumption of its nuclear activities, the Saudi Aramco attack and earlier this summer the shootdown of the (U.S.) RQ-4 reconnaissance drone,"" he said.
""All of these elements are coming together to raise tensions and then you have the internal unrest in Iran which I think exacerbates the situation, because you don't know how the leadership is going to react in a moment like that."""

Renault ousted chief executive Thierry Bollore in October as the carmaker and its Japanese partner Nissan (T:7201) have tried to rekindle their relationship after the arrest of the alliance's former head Carlos Ghosn.
""If we select a person by the end of the year, all the better. If not, it's not a bad thing,"" Jean-Dominique Senard told Seuddeutsche Zeitung in an interview published on Sunday.
He praised Renault's finance director, Clotilde Delbos, who took over as interim CEO.
Bollore had been close to Ghosn and had strained relations with Nissan's previous boss.
Appointing new faces at the helm of Renault could help draw a line under almost a year of turmoil and revive cooperation between two carmakers once seen as destined to a full merger.
Senard did not rule out reducing Renault's stake in Nissan, which he said the Japanese firm had long demanded. The French company holds 43% of Nissan's shares.
""Things are not written for all eternity,"" Senard said. ""However, a reduction in shares must make sense."" 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday that the search was ongoing for a new CEO and that he favoured selecting a professional from the automobile sector.

RIYADH (Reuters) - From taxi drivers to clerics, Saudis clamoring to own part of state oil giant Aramco went online and to local banks on Sunday at the start of a long-delayed share sale for what could be the world's biggest initial public offering.
Ahmed Sanad, 37, who signed up at a Saudi British Bank (SABB) branch in central Riyadh called the IPO, which has dominated conversations on social media, in cafes and at family gatherings, ""the talk of the town"" and ""a global event"".
""I don’t think anyone will miss the opportunity. There are no better options at the current time,"" he told Reuters as banks extended working hours to meet high expected demand during a sale process that runs until Nov. 28. 
Roadside billboards and shopping mall adverts hailing ""Saudi Aramco, soon on Tadawul"", have for weeks been trailing the listing of the world's most profitable company through a listing on Riyadh's Tadawul bourse. 
Retail investors will be able to buy up to 0.5%, about $8.5 billion worth of shares, in the Aramco IPO, valuing the company at $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion.
Aramco's high-profile advertising campaign contrasts with another bumper share sale this month, the secondary listing of Chinese retailer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which is pursuing Hong Kong's first paperless listing.
In the Aramco IPO, retail investors are entitled to one bonus share for every 10 they buy if they hold on to their stock for 180 days. Saudi media have reported that up to 5 million people are expected to participate in the domestic flotation.
Abdullah al-Faqeeh, a 29-year-old dentist, began saving to buy Aramco shares once de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced the plans nearly four years ago.
""I will get bonus shares, and with the profits I will buy more shares. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" he said.
LENDING BOOM
Saudi banks are marketing loans, with some offering four times the usual limits, two financial sources told Reuters, adding that they are able to do so as they will hold the stock on behalf of clients so have it as security.
Abdulmohsen al-Fares, chief executive of Alinma Bank which operates according to Islamic law, told Reuters that clients could receive immediate approval for lending facilities.
""We are very optimistic there will be a lot of participation... We are expecting it will be overcovered.""
Senior Muslim clerics, including royal court adviser Sheikh Abdullah al-Mutlaq, said investing in Aramco is permissible. 
""It (Aramco) is a pillar of the Saudi economy,"" Mutlaq, a member of the kingdom's top clerical body, said in response to a caller's question on a weekly radio show on Friday.
""I think even the scholars, we will participate in it.""
RIYADH OIL RUSH
Aramco said on Sunday it plans to sell 1.5% of its shares or about 3 billion shares, at an indicative price range of 30 to 32 riyals, valuing the IPO at as much as 96 billion riyals ($25.6 billion) at the top end of the range. It could beat Alibaba's record $25 billion IPO in 2014.
The chairman of another Riyadh-listed firm said he and others in the business community were looking to invest: ""It's the greatest quality by any standard. Best-in-class.""
The government has pushed rich Saudis to invest, with many viewing it as an opportunity to show their patriotism after a September attack on Aramco facilities that struck at the heart of the kingdom's energy industry.
Washington and Riyadh blamed regional rival Iran for the attacks, which temporarily cut more than 5% of global oil supply. Tehran has denied any involvement.
""Participating in the Aramco IPO is a national duty for whoever can afford it,"" Saudi columnist Anwar Aboalela tweeted.
Thousands of Saudis are seeking to invest on behalf of their dependents, to increase the number of shares they can buy, two bankers told Reuters.
Saud al-Tukhaify, who signed up for himself, his wife and three children, called it an opportunity to ""become partners"" with Crown Prince Mohammed, who pushed to take Aramco public to help fund reforms aimed at weaning the economy off oil.
On Twitter, trending hashtags about the IPO included photos and praise for the 34-year-old prince.
Although some think he is wrong to relinquish even partial control of Aramco, the lure of holding shares is hard to resist.

""Aramco will be a winning horse,"" said Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver Abu Mohsen. ""I will subscribe only because of the expected gains but I remain against the sale, especially to foreigners.""

Asked at the Dubai Airshow whether he supported changes to software and training being finalised by Boeing, Tewolde Gebremariam said, ""It is still work in progress... We will have to see it completed and the result of the further tests that are still to come.""
Reports into the March 10 crash in Ethiopia and a Lion Air accident in Indonesia, which killed a combined total of 346 people, have suggested an automated system erroneously pointed the planes' noses down repeatedly after take-off.
Boeing says it has revised the software system to prevent repeated dives and is waiting for the approval of U.S. and global regulators before putting the plane back in service, expected early next year.
Asked whether Ethiopian Airlines would take any further deliveries of the aircraft, of which it has more than 20 on order, Tewolde told reporters, ""We have not yet decided."" 
He was speaking at the Dubai Airshow after signing an agreement with Boeing to retrofit internet connectivity on a feet of 787 Dreamliners that the airline already has in service.
He said the airline had no reservations about signing a new deal to enhance the 787 with Boeing, which was ""more than 100 years old and a high-quality engineering company.""
But asked about overall relations with the U.S. planemaker, he said, ""It is work in progress. Let's wait patiently and see the final return to service.""
He also said Ethiopian Airlines might add further orders for the Airbus A350, a rival to the 787. 
""We have an order of 24, so depending on the market need, we will increase.""
Tewolde played down past suggestions by the airline that it could take a stake in debt-strapped South African Airways.
""We are discussing commercial cooperation to work together and code-share, and training and maintenance cooperation,"" he said.

The airline, which competes with large Middle East carriers to connect long-haul passengers, has a strategy of building a patchwork of African routes and to fly customers toward expanding Asian markets.

(Reuters) - Japan's Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) has said it is recalling 394,025 cars in the United States over a braking system defect, causing concerns that a brake fluid leak could potentially lead to a fire.
The leak into internal circuit boards will trigger a warning to drivers, which if ignored may lead to a fire in ""rare instances,"" Nissan said in a filing dated Nov. 8 with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under recall number 18V-601.
""... if the warning is ignored and the vehicle continues to be operated in this condition, the brake fluid leak may potentially create an electrical short in the actuator circuit, which in rare instances, may lead to a fire,"" the Japanese automaker said.
The recall, which was reported on Friday by U.S. media, includes Maxima sedans from 2016 through 2018, Infiniti QX60 luxury crossovers from 2017 to 2019, Murano SUVs from 2015 to 2018 and Pathfinder SUVs from 2017 to 2019, the filing showed.
The document does not mention whether the brake system defect actually caused any fires or injuries.

The development comes less than two months after NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into 553,000 Nissan Rogue sport utility vehicles after reports of their automatic emergency braking systems engaging without warning or an obstruction.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) moved on Saturday to ease tensions with regulators over the return to service of its 737 MAX, saying it was up to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and its global counterparts to approve changes to the jet in the wake of two accidents.
The FAA told its staff this week to take whatever time was needed to review the grounded plane after Boeing said it expected the FAA to certify the 737 MAX in mid-December.
""We put some targets out that still line up to December ... type certification,"" Stan Deal, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told reporters.
""The FAA has said they are not going to put a time frame on it and we are going to track behind them on this,"" he told a news conference ahead of the Dubai Airshow.
Boeing's mid-December estimate sent the planemaker's stock price soaring on Monday, though it also said it would not win approval for changes to pilot training until January.
U.S. officials privately said this week that Boeing's timetable was aggressive -- if not unrealistic -- and was not cleared in advance by regulators.
On Friday, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson indicated the agency would decide in its own time whether to unground the plane that was involved in two fatal crashes in five months, killing 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
""This effort is not guided by a calendar or schedule,"" Dickson wrote in a memo seen by Reuters.
Dickson is due to attend the Dubai Airshow this week.
Speaking on the eve of the show, the head of Boeing divisions spanning jetliners, defense and services expressed sympathy for the relatives of victims of the two crashes that led to the plane's worldwide grounding in March.
Deal said Boeing is in discussions with host airline Emirates over the impact of delays to its much larger 777X, for which the Dubai carrier is by far the largest customer.
Boeing is also talking to Emirates about the future of a tentative order for 40 787 Dreamliners, which is among a number of orders left in the balance since the last Dubai show in 2017.
Emirates has taken a tough stance on new orders ahead of the Nov. 17-21 show but industry sources say it could agree to confirm at least some of the 787s in exchange for a deal with Boeing that would allow it to cancel or defer some delayed 777X.

It is also expected to confirm orders for some Airbus jets.

1. FOMO Fever Keeps Traders Coming Back More
The fear of missing out, or FOMO should hold little place in rationally functioning markets. But as time has proven markets are neither rational nor efficient. Greed and fear have long been the two overriding emotions prompting traders to take action.
With markets riding a wave of all-time highs, FOMO fever has gripped fund managers once gain. In a desperate dash to join the rally, they have cut their cash holdings to the lowest level in years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s latest fund manager survey.
The survey of 230 managers found cash levels fell 0.8% to 4.2%, the biggest monthly decline since November 2016 and the lowest cash balance since June 2013. And their allocation to equities has gone the other way, rising 20% month-on-month to net 21% overweight, the highest level in one year.
While the U.S.-China trade war is still thought to represent the biggest risk, recent signs of progress has kept FOMO alive and well, with managers betting a partial trade deal will be consummated soon, the survey showed.
FOMO or not, some on Wall Street have warned against chasing the rally at a time when stocks appear to be running too hot.
“We think you are just plain old overbought in the equity market right now,” said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “When I talk to investors and I talk to people who are more bullish, I hear the FOMO in their voices.”
With a bumpy road for risk assets expected in coming year, Goldman Sachs has also echoed caution.
“High uncertainty, investor fears of a recession, and low starting cash allocations will likely limit a significant increase in equity allocations” in 2020, Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients last month.
2. Should Boeing Whipsaw the Dow?
As indexes go, the Dow is a little crazy because it's price weighted. So the higher the stock price, the more influence the stock has on the average.
This is important because Boeing (NYSE:BA) has been perhaps the most important influence on the Dow all year. Friday, as an example, Boeing was up 1.24%, 10th best among the 30 Dow stocks. (Tops was   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) at 2.2%.)
But because Boeing is the single-priciest Dow stock at about $372, Boeing's gain of $4.55 a share translates into a 32-point gain for the index, or about 20% of the total change.
This is why news about the problems with the 737 MAX airliner, grounded in March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 passengers and crew, affects the Dow so greatly.
The index looks to finish up 1.4% on the week, or about 258 points. Boeing is contributing about 144 points, or 55% of the total gain.
Boeing shares have fallen 16.7% from a $446.01 peak on March 1 but are still up 15% for the year. The shares did go negative on the year once, on Aug. 14, when the shares were down 0.64%.
The company said this week it expects the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its fixes to the plane's flight-control systems next month, with flights resuming in late January.
The news cheered Wall Street.
Boeing still faces three huge challenges.
• Three of the biggest 737 customers – American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) – aren't scheduling flights using the planes until March at the earliest.
• Passengers may be reluctant to book flights that use the plane for a while. 
• Boeing faces years of litigation from airlines, whose businesses have been disrupted by the groundings, and, more importantly, families of passengers killed in the accidents.
3. Buy Side Continues
Stocks ended with a flourish Friday, but will the buyers continue? JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) thinks so.
“We keep our bullish equity market view, expecting further gains, and reiterate our September call for the rotation in style and sector leadership,” JPM said.
“We continue to believe that style and sector rotation will be seen as a positive for the overall market direction,” the analysts said. “The recent market behavior appears to confirm this. Since the September low in Value/Growth, markets are up 5% on average, with broad-based participation, and are fully absorbing 50bp upmove in U.S. and German bond yields.”
“The key for a sustained rotation is that it gets fundamental supports, namely the bounce in bond yields and in PMIs,” JPM added. “We expect both of these to come through. Euro PMIs follow M1 and China export orders, and these are improving. Global manufacturing PMI is stable for 3 months now.”"
1413,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2019 03:21AM ET</span>","MSCI, S&P Dow Jones, FTSE Russell could fast-track Aramco into indices","By Clara Denina and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - MSCI, the world's biggest index provider, will follow in the footsteps of S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell, which told clients this week that they could fast-track Saudi Aramco's inclusion into their indexes as soon as December.
Typically, providers of indexes which are tracked or used as a benchmark by investment funds would add newly listed companies during their rebalancing reviews, conducted quarterly or semi-annually, depending on the index.
State-owned Saudi Aramco, the world's most profitable company, is set to launch a share sale process on Nov. 17, aiming to raise $20 billion-$40 billion in a domestic initial public offering (IPO) in early December.
The oil giant is due to announce the pricing of its IPO on Nov. 17, but it is unclear whether more details around timing will be disclosed.
While a large part of the offer is set to be sold to retail investors, when the company is added to the global indexes and what proportion of them it will account for will influence demand for the shares from overseas money managers, particularly now that Saudi Arabia has been classified as an 'emerging market'.
MSCI, whose indexes are used by funds with trillions of dollars in assets globally, said that if Saudi Aramco starts trading on or before Dec. 12, it would add it to the MSCI Equity Indexes from Dec. 17.
""However, if the IPO listing date is after December 12, 2019, MSCI would postpone the implementation until after January 5, 2020,"" it said in a note to clients on Friday night.
It added that it would do so to avoid lower liquidity during the Christmas period, when trading thins.
The FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones started adding Saudi stocks to their emerging markets indexes in March, while MSCI added the Tadawul, or Saudi Stock Exchange - the region's largest market - into its Emerging Markets Index last August, with a weight of 2.8%.
In a briefing to clients, S&P Dow Jones said it would consider Saudi Aramco big enough for fast-track inclusion into its Global Benchmark Indices, based on the minimum float-adjusted market capitalization of at least $2 billion.
Companies would normally be required to ensure that at least 10% of their stock was made available to trade by investors, but while Aramco would not meet this level, S&P said it could make an exception.
""Based on the initial announcements by Saudi Aramco, only a very limited percentage of the company's total shares will form part of the IPO, expected to be well below the limit described above,"" it said in a note to clients on Friday.
""The Index Committee has reviewed this case and ruled that, given the expected size and liquidity of this IPO, an exception to the foreign availability rule will be made for Saudi Aramco if it meets all other index criteria for fast-track IPO addition to SPDJI's Global Benchmark Indices,"" it added. 
FTSE Russell, part of the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) , could also potentially include Saudi Aramco in an end-December rebalancing of its FTSE Global Equity Index series, with the decision due at least five days after its listing, it said in a notice seen by Reuters and dated Nov. 11.
It plans to update the market on whether Saudi Aramco will have a fast-track inclusion after Dec. 4, it added."
1414,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2019 12:27AM ET</span>",U.S. to extend license for its companies to continue business with Huawei: sources,"By David Shepardson and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is set to issue a two-week extension of a license allowing U.S. companies to continue doing business with China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, two sources familiar with the deliberations said.
The extension of around two weeks is far shorter than the prior 90-day extension and a longer extension is in the works but has not yet been finalized due to regulatory hurdles, said one source who was briefed on the matter.
After adding Huawei to an economic blacklist in May citing national security concerns, the U.S. Commerce Department has allowed it to purchase some American-made goods in a move aimed at minimizing disruption for its customers, many of which operate networks in rural America.
The extension will be announced on Monday, when the earlier reprieve is set to expire, the sources said, declining to be identified as the extension has not been publicly announced.
A spokesman for Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecom network equipment, said the company does not comment on rumors and speculation. The Commerce Department declined to comment.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network on Friday that some rural carriers need the temporary licenses and are dependent on Huawei for 3G and 4G networks.
""There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities - we don’t want to knock them out. So, one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate,"" Ross said.
The development comes amid discussions between the United States and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war that has lasted for over a year.
In blacklisting Huawei, the U.S. government said it had a ""reasonable basis to conclude that Huawei is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests"". Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations.
Attorney General William Barr said on Thursday Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) ""cannot be trusted,"" as he backed a proposal to bar U.S. rural wireless carriers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment or services from them.
In May, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The Commerce Department was due to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October but has yet to publish one.

The Commerce Department is also considering whether to grant individual licenses for U.S. firms to sell components to Huawei after receiving more than 200 requests.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 09:45PM ET</span>",U.S. charges another ex-JPMorgan executive with alleged market manipulation,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Department of Justice has charged another former JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) executive with alleged racketeering and manipulating precious metals prices between 2008 and 2016, the latest in a string of similar prosecutions.
The indictment against Jeffrey Ruffo, who is also charged with other federal crimes including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, is the result of an ""ongoing investigation"", federal prosecutors said in a statement. 
Ruffo is the sixth person to be charged with alleged fraud in connection to JPMorgan's precious metals desk.
The case relates to spoofing, which involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution, allowing spoofers to influence prices. In recent years there has a been a surge in spoofing related prosecutions in the United States by the Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Ruffo could not immediately be reached for comment.
A JPMorgan spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. The U.S. bank has said in recent regulatory filings that it is cooperating with various investigations relating to its metals trading practices.
According to the indictment, Ruffo worked at JPMorgan from 2008 to 2017 as a salesperson serving hedge funds investing in precious metals and he encouraged JPMorgan traders to place deceptive orders to create price advantages for his clients.
The indictment also alleged that Ruffo and his former colleagues defrauded JPMorgan's clients who had invested in ""barrier options"" by pushing option prices to levels that benefited the bank.
An option is a financial instrument that gives buyers the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed price and at a fixed time. Its value is tied to the value of the asset.
While previous spoofing prosecutions have led to guilty pleas, a former metals trader at the Swiss bank, UBS Group, was acquitted by a jury in a similar case last year. The acquittal highlighted the difficulties in making a case that cancelling orders is a criminal act, given that many market orders go unfilled. 
Some lawyers also argue it is aggressive to charge bank executives with a racketeering conspiracy, which is usually associated with organized crime.

The charges were filed on Thursday and made public on Friday.

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 09:45PM ET</span>",Ford's UAW members vote to ratify new four-year contract,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Friday that rank-and-file members at Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have voted in favor of a new four-year labor contract with the No. 2 U.S. automaker.
The UAW will now focus on Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), the sole remaining Detroit automaker without a new labor contract. Talks with FCA are expected to begin on Monday, a UAW spokesman said.
The union said 56.3% of Ford's hourly workers voted to approve the deal, which allowed the company to avoid a strike like the one that cost its larger rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) about $3 billion (£2.3 billion).
UAW leaders said earlier this month that Ford under the deal agreed to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. plants, and to create or retain more than 8,500 UAW jobs. 
The deal also includes pay raises and lump-sum payments over the life of the contract, a pathway to full-time employment for temporary employees and unchanged healthcare coverage.
Workers at GM approved a deal in late October that ended a contentious 40-day U.S. strike, the longest automotive labor stoppage since 1970.
Detailed terms of the Ford deal - released just a week after GM workers approved their new contract - echoed those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a template for those that follow. 
UAW leaders managed contract negotiations with Ford and GM, including the lengthy strike, while struggling with an ongoing federal corruption probe.
To date, 10 people have pleaded guilty in connection with the criminal investigation into illegal payoffs. Just last week former UAW vice president and former GM board member Joseph Ashton was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud. 
Earlier this month the UAW said that its president, Gary Jones, who had been linked to the ongoing corruption probe, was taking a leave of absence.

Rory Gamble, the union's acting head, said last week he will examine every department of the union in response to the spreading federal corruption probe to prevent future misuse of members' dues.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 09:37PM ET</span>",Microsoft to probe work of Israeli facial recognition startup it funded,"By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) has hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate whether the use of facial recognition technology developed by an Israeli startup it funded complies with its ethics principles, the company said on Friday.
AnyVision, based outside Tel Aviv, has come under scrutiny following reports by Haaretz's TheMarker business newspaper and NBC News that its technology is used to surveil Palestinians who live in the occupied West Bank.
AnyVision, which denied to NBC such use of its services, did not respond to a request for comment.
The probe reflects growing unease about facial recognition surveillance in the United States and elsewhere that civil liberties groups say could lead to unfair arrests and limit freedom of expression.
Microsoft announced facial recognition ethics principles last year, saying the company would ""advocate for safeguards for people's democratic freedoms in law enforcement surveillance scenarios and will not deploy facial recognition technology in scenarios that we believe will put these freedoms at risk.""
Microsoft said in a statement that Holder would lead a team from law firm Covington & Burling to conduct the probe. Holder, the top U.S. legal official under former President Barack Obama, was hired by  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) in 2017 to review claims of sexual harassment.
He did not immediately return a request for comment.
M12, the venture fund of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, participated in a $74 million series A investment round that AnyVision announced in June.
NBC had reported that AnyVision's technology was used within the West Bank and at Israeli border crossings. The company told NBC its software was not used for West Bank surveillance and was deployed at border crossings in a manner similar to U.S. Customs' use of biometric identification at airports.
Israel faces criticism and a boycott for its occupation and policies toward Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
AnyVision in an August blog post also said that it would announce an ethics advisory board and that it had a responsibility to prevent its technology's abuse. At the same time, it touted how facial recognition speeds up border crossings while helping law enforcement spot criminals.
Microsoft itself markets a facial recognition tool and backed a U.S. Senate bill, announced on Thursday, that would require a court order before federal law enforcement could use the technology for targeted, ongoing surveillance.
Neema Singh Guliani, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the bill ""falls woefully short of protecting people's privacy rights."""
1418,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 07:02PM ET</span>",U.S. FAA regulator head tells team to 'take whatever time needed' on 737 MAX,"By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has told his team to ""take whatever time is needed"" in their review of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX, according to a Nov. 14 memo and video message reviewed by Reuters.
The comments came days after Boeing said it expected the FAA to certify the 737 MAX, issue an airworthiness directive and unground the plane in mid-December. That timetable sent the planemaker's stock price soaring on Monday, even as it acknowledged that it would not win approval for changes to pilot training until January.
U.S. officials have privately said this week that Boeing's timetable was aggressive - if not unrealistic - and was not cleared in advance by regulators.
On Friday, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a clear message that the agency would make the decision on its own timetable on whether to unground the plane that was involved in two fatal crashes in five months, killing 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
""This effort is not guided by a calendar or schedule,"" Dickson wrote in the memo sent to Ali Bahrami, a top FAA safety official. 
Dickson offered his unequivocal support for a ""data-driven methodical analysis, review and validation of the modified flight control systems and pilot training required to safely return the MAX to commercial service.""
Boeing still must complete an audit of its software documentation before it can schedule a key certification test flight and faces other hurdles.
In a video message posted on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N71s4_Q3Fe4&feature=youtu.be on Friday, Dickson said: ""I am not going to sign off on this aircraft until I fly it myself and I am satisfied that I would put my own family on it without a second thought.""
""I know there is a lot of pressure to return this aircraft to service quickly. But I want you to know, that I want you to take the time you need and focus solely on safety. I’ve got your back,"" Dickson said. ""The FAA fully controls the approval process.""
Boeing said on Friday it was working closely with the FAA and other regulatory authorities. 
""With the rigorous scrutiny being applied, we are confident the MAX will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly,"" the company added, noting the ""FAA and other regulatory authorities will determine the timing of certification and return to commercial service.""
The three U.S. airlines that operate the 737 MAX - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and United Airlines Holdings Inc - are scheduling flights without the aircraft until early March 2020, nearly a year since the grounding. 
Separately, Representative Peter DeFazio, who heads the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said on Friday he had sent a series of follow-up questions to Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg about the decisions that were made before, during, and after the rollout of the 737 MAX.

Muilenburg testified before the committee on Oct. 30, and was repeatedly hammered by lawmakers over his compensation and key mistakes in the development of the MAX.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 06:57PM ET</span>",Twitter tightens bans on political ads and causes ahead of 2020 U.S. election,"By Sheila Dang and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) on Friday said its political advertising ban will include references to political candidates or legislation, and it will not allow ads that advocate for a certain outcome on social and political causes.
The popular social media site, which first announced its political ads ban last month, had not previously provided details on the new policy. On Friday, it said it will define political content as anything that references ""a candidate, political party, elected or appointed government official, election, referendum, ballot measure, legislation, regulation, directive, or judicial outcome.""
Twitter said it will use a combination of automated technology and human teams to enforce the new ad policies.
The move comes as campaigns for the November 2020 presidential election heat up amid growing pressure on social media companies to stop accepting ads that spread false information and could sway elections.
""We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,"" Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in announcing the ban.
Rival  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), saying it did not want to stifle political speech, has refused calls from some politicians and others to follow Twitter's lead, and said it would not vet political ads for misleading claims on its site.
The ban is expected to take effect on Nov. 22. 
Brad Parscale, campaign manager for U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election bid, in a statement called the move, ""yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known.""
Bill Russo, deputy communications director for former Vice President Joe Biden's presidential campaign, said in a statement that he appreciates Twitter will not allow ""disproven smears"" to appear in ads, but said social media companies had more work to do to ensure their sites are not rife with disinformation.
""We look forward to seeing how the policy works in practice and intend to hold Twitter to its word,"" he said. 
Twitter will allow companies and advocacy groups to run ads that promote awareness and discussion about social causes, such as environmental protection. But they will not be allowed to push for a political or legislative change, especially if they are advocating for something that benefits their business, Del Harvey, vice president of trust and safety, said in a conference call on Friday.
Under the new policy for example, Sierra Club could still promote their causes, but they would not be able to single out politicians they support or target those they would like to see defeated in elections, or lobby for political outcomes.
Similarly, a group could run a gun violence awareness ad but could not call for a ban on assault weapons used in mass shootings as a ban implies legislation, Twitter said.
Ads intended to promote awareness about a cause would be allowed to target users at the state level or higher, but not by zip-code. And those advertisers will not be able to target people based on their political leanings, Twitter said.
Roy Temple, a partner at digital media consultancy GPS Impact who has worked with political campaigns, called the move ""a gigantic cop-out"" by Twitter's CEO that does not involve the loss of much revenue, and he questioned the difficulty of implementing the complicated policy.
""I wouldn't want to be the Twitter employee who has to make these calls and defend them,” Temple said. ""Universal healthcare is a cause, but is there a bill related to that? Are you talking about the bill or the cause? How is that determined?""
Harvey said on Friday the new policies were not expected to change Twitter's fourth-quarter revenue forecast. Political ad spend for the 2018 U.S. midterm elections on Twitter was less than $3 million, the company reported.
Critics have said the ban would punish lesser-known candidates taking on well-funded incumbents in local elections.
If Facebook and Google - much larger players in digital advertising - were to adopt similar policies it would be ""catastrophic"" to down-ballot candidates who lack name recognition, said Eric Wilson, a political strategist based in Washington D.C.
""If Facebook considers eliminating things like microtargeting, that's when we would panic,"" Wilson said. He said the platform has been the best vehicle for raising grassroots support, and a similar ban could hurt candidates that do not accept large donations from corporations and political action committees (PACs).
Twitter said it sought to make its new rules as clear as possible. But other major tech companies, including Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, have had widely publicized struggles to moderate the vast amount of content uploaded to their sites.
News publishers that meet certain criteria will continue to be able to run ads on Twitter that reference political content, but they cannot advocate for or against a political topic.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 06:54PM ET</span>",Oklahoma judge reduces Johnson & Johnson opioid payout to $465 million,"By Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - An Oklahoma judge on Friday said Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) must pay that state $465 million for fueling the opioid epidemic through the deceptive marketing of painkillers, down from his original award of $572 million.
The decision by Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman in Norman, Oklahoma, came in the first case to go to trial out of 2,700 nationally by states, counties and cities seeking to hold drug companies responsible for the deadly epidemic.
Balkman reduced the amount he had awarded in August by $107 million after agreeing with New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J that he had made a math error.
J&J said it will appeal, and that the award and finding of liability were ""neither supported by the facts nor the law.""
A spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said that office is reviewing the decision and will formally respond within the next few days.
Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Following a non-jury trial, Balkman ruled in August that Oklahoma had proven that J&J engaged in misleading marketing about the benefits of painkillers, and that their addictive risks caused a public nuisance in the form of the opioid crisis.
Hunter had sought to have J&J pay $17 billion to help fund addiction treatment and other services to repair damage from the opioid epidemic over the next 30 years.
Balkman, however, awarded only enough money for one year of programs, saying Oklahoma failed to support its claims regarding the need to abate the epidemic in future years.
Following the August ruling, Oklahoma asked Balkman for permission to return to his courtroom annually to prove those costs, but Balkman on Friday maintained his prior ruling.
J&J, meanwhile, argued that it deserved a $355 million credit, reflecting pre-trial settlements by the drugmakers Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd.
Balkman concluded on Friday that state law did not allow such credits.
Last month, J&J and four other companies proposed a $48 billion settlement framework to resolve all of the opioid cases they face, with J&J paying $4 billion. Lawyers for the local governments have opposed the proposal.

If approved, the settlement would let J&J resolve some of the thousands of product liability lawsuits it faces. The company also faces litigation over whether its baby powder causes cancer, a claim it denies.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 06:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. regulator rethinking changes to whistleblower program after backlash - sources,"By Katanga Johnson and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator is rethinking a proposal that could weaken a landmark whistleblower program after a pushback from whistleblower lawyers and advocates, people with knowledge of the deliberations told Reuters.
Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed reworking the program which allows the SEC to reward tipsters whose original information leads to a penalty exceeding $1 million with between 10% and 30% of the fine. 
Created after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the program is widely considered a major success, resulting in more than $2 billion in penalties against firms such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and $387 million in rewards. Weakening the program would hamper the agency's ability to detect and prosecute white collar crime, say lawyers.
The SEC has proposed several changes to the program in a bid to make it more efficient and to speed up issuing rewards. Among them, the SEC has proposed giving staff more latitude when assessing awards and the discretion to reduce certain payouts that would exceed $30 million. 
The SEC has also proposed requiring that whistleblowers formally file their reward claim within 30 days of first initiating contact with the agency. Currently, staff may consider formal claims long after contact is made and an investigation is underway.
The proposal has drawn fierce opposition from whistleblower advocates who warn that the changes will reduce the incentives for tipsters to flag the most egregious corporate frauds by increasing the legal costs of filing tips, limiting rewards and creating uncertainty.
Whistleblowers face major risks and need confidence they will be suitably compensated, the advocates have said.
Some of the planned changes have also met with resistance on Capitol Hill, including from Republican Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. He has pressed the SEC to reconsider changes that would water down the program or weaken whistleblower protections, said one of the sources. The SEC's two Democratic commissioners also publicly opposed the proposal when it was first unveiled. 
The pushback prompted SEC chair Jay Clayton to take the unusual step of postponing a scheduled Oct. 23 vote to adopt the rule changes, according to public documents and the sources. 
Instead, Clayton and SEC staff held meetings with whistleblower lawyers and advocates that day to hear their concerns, according to his calendars and three people who participated in the meetings.
A spokeswoman for Clayton said at the time that he had delayed the vote to hear more feedback and that the SEC's goal was to ""enhance"" the program, but did not elaborate on potential changes to the proposal. Two people with knowledge of the matter said the SEC is now rethinking the changes to potentially address some of the concerns raised by advocates.
In a statement issued on Friday, Clayton said concerns regarding uncertainty over the SEC's commitment to the program and rewarding of whistleblowers are ""not lost on me"" and that his aim was to increase the transparency of the program. 
""I expect the Commission to consider final rules in the near future,"" he said, adding he hoped the changes would ultimately encourage more, not fewer, tips.
Sean McKessy, who set up the SEC whistleblower office and is now a partner at Phillips & Cohen LLP, was among those who met with Clayton, according to the calendars. 
He and Clayton discussed modifying the proposal to give SEC staff more flexibility to issue an award even if the claim was not filed within the 30 day window, according to McKessy and a letter he submitted to the SEC two days later. They also discussed reconsidering the discretionary caps.  
""Imposing more agency discretion on its awards only suggests to whistleblowers that the SEC plans to make restrictive an already complicated and risky process,"" McKessy told Reuters. 
Corporate lobbyists have been pushing the SEC to revise the program. They say excessive awards have spawned a cottage industry of tipsters and their attorneys who get a cut of the reward, overwhelming the SEC with unhelpful and sometimes bogus information. 
The majority of awards have been less than $2 million but some have been as high as $50 million. The SEC has said the proposed changes would ensure rewards are ""reasonably necessary"" and has pointed out that additional discretion would also allow staff to adjust bounties upwards in cases of smaller penalties. 

Grassley declined to comment on his interaction with the SEC, but in a statement said it was ""good news"" the agency was rethinking the changes.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 06:04PM ET</span>",Chile's stock market jumps on plans to dump dictatorship-era constitution,"By Dave Sherwood
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's stock exchange posted its biggest daily gain in 11 years after lawmakers agreed on Friday to hold a referendum on replacing the country's dictatorship-era constitution, bowing to protesters furious over inequality and social injustice.
The deal, struck in the early hours of the morning, also boosted the Chilean peso following its slide earlier this week to a historic low that prompted concerns of a recession.
Protests have raged for a month in the South American nation, once the region's most stable economy. Riots, arson and looting have paralyzed Santiago, a city of 6 million, crippling its bus and metro system. The unrest has wrought billions in damages to both private business and public infrastructure. More than 20 people have died in the chaos.
Chile's existing constitution, which dates back to General Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 military dictatorship, early on became a lightning rod for anger. Many Chileans say it is rigged in favor the rich.
Voters in April 2020 will be asked whether they approve the idea of a new constitution and whether current lawmakers should serve on the commission that would redraft the document.
The two-page ""Agreement for Peace and a New Constitution,"" signed after intense negotiations, calls for a ""commitment to re-establish peace and public order in Chile.""
SIGNS OF PEACE
Hours after the deal was announced, a group of neighbors draped a white cloth with the message ""Peace"" over a statue of a Chilean general in Plaza Italia, the city's central square.
The plaza has been the focal point of often violent clashes between security forces and protesters. It was quiet for much of Friday, though small groups had gathered there by early evening.
Political observers hailed the agreement as an important step - but perhaps not enough to end the protests all together.
""The agreement is unlikely to represent a magic bullet,"" according to Nicholas Watson, a political risk analyst with global advisory firm Teneo.
Watson said in an investor's note that the Chilean government would also need to move to quell growing concerns over human rights abuses amid the protests.
Center-right President Sebastian Pinera has already called for a raft of social and economic reforms, from boosting the minimum wage to topping off the pensions of the lowest earners.
Many blame the country's 1980 Constitution for simmering social and economic inequalities, saying the much-revised document still fails to guarantee proper healthcare, education and the participation of citizens in government.
Opponents of an overhaul say the charter has been a pillar of stability for Chile, among the region's strongest and most investor-friendly economies.
The details will be worked out by a constitutional convention whose composition will be determined in the April referendum. A second vote, in October 2020, will let voters select those who will serve on the convention.
A final vote on the draft itself will be obligatory for all voting age Chileans, according to the agreement."
1423,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 06:04PM ET</span>","Bristol-Myers Squibb wins antitrust approval to buy Celgene, but must divest psoriasis drug","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) and  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) have won U.S. antitrust approval for their merger on condition that they sell Celgene's psoriasis drug Otezla, the Federal Trade Commission said in a statement on Friday.
Bristol-Myers Squibb said the decision meant it had all the needed regulatory approvals and would close the acquisition on Wednesday.
Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) has agreed to buy Celgene's Otezla business, the company said in a statement. The Otezla sale was valued at $13.4 billion.
Bristol-Myers Squibb announced in January it would buy Celgene Corp in a cash-and-stock deal for about $74 billion, combining two of the world's largest cancer drug businesses in the biggest pharmaceutical deal ever.
The proposed divestiture is the largest that the FTC or the U.S. Department of Justice have ever required in a merger enforcement matter, the FTC said in its statement.
""The Commission has ordered BMS to divest Otezla to preserve BMS's incentive to continue developing its own oral product for treating moderate-to-severe psoriasis,"" FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said in a statement.
The five members of the FTC split along party lines on whether to approve the proposed merger, with the three Republicans in favor and two Democrats opposed.
Rebecca Slaughter, who voted to oppose the deal, argued that the FTC's approach of demanding divestitures only if the two companies sell treatments for the same ailment was ""too narrow.""
""The commission should more broadly consider whether any pharmaceutical merger is likely to exacerbate anticompetitive conduct by the merged firm or to hinder innovation,"" she said in a dissenting statement."

The Dow Jones industrials, up 0.8%, closed at a record 28,005, as it finished with its fourth-weekly gain in a row. The S&P 500, up 0.77%, finished higher for a sixth-straight week. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.73% and finished higher for a seventh-straight week.
All three indexes, plus the Nasdaq 100 Index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, saw new intraday highs as well.
For the year, the S&P 500 is up 24.5%, with the Dow up 20% and the Nasdaq up 28.7%. The market has spent much of 2019 recovering from the slump that hit stocks in the fourth quarter of 2018. The major averages are well on track to see their biggest one-year gains since 2013. 
There was a downside to the market rally. The relative strength indexes for the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq all topped 70, a level that is a warning the market could be overbought and vulnerable to a pullback.
A host of stocks hit all-time intraday highs during the day, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), paint-maker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS).
The catalysts on the day were assurances from White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow late Thursday that negotiations on a U.S.-Chinese trade deal were progressing. President Donald Trump, however, has not yet assented to the terms.
China is balking about agreeing to a dollar amount of purchases of U.S. farm products. It also wants tariffs set for the December rescinded.
Meanwhile, the government said retail sales for October were up 0.3%, a solid, if not great showing after a decline in September. The report helped many investors put away their fears of a recession.
A downside on the economy was that industrial production fell 0.8%, its third monthly decline in a row. Most economists see that as a function of the trade fight.
Health, industrial and technology stocks powered the market, especially the Dow.
Oil prices moved higher, as did interest rates.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.834%, from Thursday's 1.815%. The yield is 8.66% higher for the month but off 5.7% for the week.
West Texas Intermediate crude moved up 95 cents to $57.72 a barrel, a six-week high. Brent crude, the global benchmark, gained $1.02 to $63.30. 
Gold fell $4.90 an ounce to $1,468.50 an ounce in New York, as investors looked to put money in stocks and related assets. Gold rose 0.4% on the week but is down 3.1% so far in November.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 04:32PM ET</span>","California, other U.S. states sue to block EPA from revoking state emissions authority","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California and 22 other U.S. states filed suit on Friday to challenge the Trump administration's decision to revoke California's authority to set stiff vehicle tailpipe emissions rules and require a rising number of zero emission vehicles (ZEV).
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seeks to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency's decision in September to revoke portions of a waiver it granted in 2013.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the legal challenges, told Reuters in an interview this week the state would aggressively fight to protect its own legal authority.
""We are going to fight for everything we've gotten, everything we've attained and everything we still need to do,"" Becerra said. ""The Trump administration continues to fight on the side of for-profit polluters, instead of tackling air pollution and protecting public health.""
The move follows a separate lawsuit filed in September by 23 states led by California against the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) seeking to undo a parallel determination that federal law bars California from setting tailpipe emission standards and ZEV rules.
The California ZEV mandate, adopted in 1990 and revised on numerous occasions, requires the sale of a rising number of electric or other zero-emission vehicles. Last year, California forecast that about 8% of the state’s new vehicle sales in 2025 will be zero-emission and plug-in electric hybrids.
The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit Friday but said the agency had not revoked California’s separate authority to enforce its Low Emission Vehicle program and other standards to address harmful smog-forming vehicle emissions.
Over the past 50 years, the EPA has granted more than 100 waivers for California emissions standards. California's vehicle emissions rules are followed by about a dozen other U.S. states.
Last month, major automakers - including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corp, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV - backed the Trump administration's effort to bar California from setting tailpipe standards.
Those automakers intervened on Trump's behalf in the lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Washington by states and environmental groups over NHTSA's determination.
California and other states are separately filing a protective petition on Friday with the appeals court over the NHTSA determination. The Trump administration has asked that the district court suits be dismissed and the challenges moved to the appeals court.
The lawsuit marks the latest salvo in a high-stakes battle between the Trump administration and state officials over the future of U.S. vehicles.
The U.S. Justice Department in August launched an antitrust investigation into four major automakers that struck a deal with California to follow revised state vehicle emissions standards. Reuters reported the administration issued civil subpoenas to Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
In August 2018, the administration proposed freezing vehicle efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, which would result in average fuel efficiency of 37 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 46.7 mpg under Obama-era rules.
The Trump administration's final requirements are expected to be released in the coming months and modestly boost fuel efficiency versus the initial proposal, with several automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%, much less stringent than the Obama rules.
The lawsuit was filed by the 23 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia and the cities of New York and Los Angeles.

In addition to California, the other states are: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes closed at record levels on Friday, fueled by fresh optimism over a potential calming of U.S.-China trade tensions and by big gains in shares of healthcare companies.
The benchmark S&P 500 tallied its sixth straight week of gains, its longest such weekly streak in about two years, while the Dow breached 28,000 for the first time.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Thursday that the United States and China are getting close to a trade agreement, citing what he called very constructive talks with Beijing. 
“Today is definitely about optimism surrounding the trade tensions,” said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.
The stock market has climbed recently to record highs, driven by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, third-quarter earnings topping low expectations and signs that economic growth may be bottoming, while uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations remains a wild card. 
""It’s definitely been a big source of volatility over a fairly long period of time for the markets and stocks in general,"" Pride said. ""To see some sort of resolution of it would probably be a lift to investors and to equity holders because it takes away a big piece of uncertainty in many investors’, and even corporate executives’, minds.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 222.93 points, or 0.8%, to 28,004.89, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 23.83 points, or 0.77%, to 3,120.46 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 61.81 points, or 0.73%, to 8,540.83.
Ten of 11 S&P 500 sectors ended positive. Healthcare (SPXHC) led the way, gaining 2.2% for its biggest one-day percentage rise since January, with UnitedHealth Group (N:UNH) shares surging 5.3% and  Pfizer  (N:PFE) rising 2.0%.
The gains came as President Donald Trump made an announcement on healthcare price transparency. Regulatory and election risks have contributed to the healthcare sector's underperformance in 2019, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina, noting that perhaps Friday's gains were ""a catch-up trade.""
Shares of Applied Materials (O:AMAT) soared 9.0% after the chip gear maker forecast first-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX) gained 0.9% and hit a record high. Enthusiasm for the group was tempered by a 2.7% decline in Nvidia (O:NVDA) shares following the chipmaker's report.
Data on Friday showed U.S. retail sales rebounded in October, but consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items and clothing, which could temper expectations for a strong holiday shopping season.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.84-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 52 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 121 new highs and 108 new lows.

About 6.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.9 billion-share daily average over the last 20 sessions.

KBC Group NV’s chief executive apologized for his criticism of an Irish mortgage overcharging investigation, after his comments drew a public rebuke from the country’s Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar.
Lawmakers from across the political spectrum rounded on Johan Thijs after he urged the Irish central bank to “turn the page” on the “annoying” inquiry into how thousands of customers across numerous retail banks were overcharged, with some eventually losing their homes. His comments hit a nerve in a country that is still wary of the financial sector more than a decade after the financial crisis crippled the economy there.
“I want to acknowledge the insensitivity of what I said and the manner in which it was delivered,” Thijs said in a statement on Friday in Dublin. “It was unintentional and I am truly sorry for the offense caused. “
“We see a pattern of behavior in the banking sector in Ireland and listening to those remarks, I’m unconvinced the the culture and attitude has changed, “ Varadkar told reporters in Dublin on Friday, before the apology.
“It needs to change, because if it doesn’t we’re going to have another charging scandal or banking scandal in another five or 10 years time,” he said.
The tracker scandal illustrated unacceptable practices by the banking industry, a finance ministry spokesman said in response to questions, adding it will take considerable time to restore trust in the industry.
``While my words yesterday do not reflect that, I want to assure people that KBC and myself will do everything in its power to regain public trust, “ Thijs said."

The Japanese company has raised roughly $2 billion for the second Vision Fund so it can start backing startups, according to two people familiar with the matter. This stage of the fund-raising process is known as a first close, and SoftBank will continue gathering commitments. A Vision Fund spokesman declined to comment.
SoftBank said in July that its second Vision Fund would be even larger than the first, which broke records in 2017 by raising almost $100 billion. This time around, SoftBank has said it is taking more control, committing $38 billion of its own capital and replacing Saudi Arabia, which was the largest investor in the first fund.
So far, it is unclear whether there are any outside investors in the second fund. The original Vision Fund was announced in October 2016, but took another seven months for its first major closing with $93 billion in commitments.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co., which contributed $45 billion and $15 billion, respectively, to the first fund, are reconsidering how much to put into the new fund, Bloomberg News previously reported.
Talks with Saudi Arabia are still ongoing, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. Mubadala recently told Bloomberg News it had yet to decide on whether it would invest.
SoftBank has said the second fund is also expected to collect money from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Foxconn Technology Group and the sovereign wealth fund of Kazakhstan.
WeWork and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., two of the largest investments made by SoftBank and the first Vision Fund, have performed poorly this year. That’s prompted some soul-searching at the Japanese company.
“There was a problem with my own judgment, that’s something I have to reflect on,” SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son said.

1431,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 04:18PM ET</span>",Watch for Sparks as Jet Engines Hit Their Limits,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Earlier this week, my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Chris Bryant examined the ongoing troubles for advanced jet engines used on today’s commercial airliners. These engines now seem to be reaching their technical limits, and as Bryant says, we may be asking too much of the technology.
That’s not great news for the companies making those turbines, or for those flying the aircraft. It’s also not the best news for the climate, given the trajectory of emissions from air travel and air freight. Carbon dioxide emissions from commercial aviation made up 2.4% of global emissions in 2018 and, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, have grown 32% in just five years.
The geography of those emissions is highly concentrated. Three markets — the U.S., the European Union and China — account for more than half of all emissions; the top 10 emitters contribute more than 70% of the global total.
There’s something hopeful, actually, in that geographical distribution. High concentration means that tackling emissions in just three markets can have an outsized impact, and standards set in those large markets are easy for others to follow.
There’s another aspect to the distribution of aviation emissions that’s worth examining: emissions by type of aircraft. Bryant writes of problems with engines on both widebody and narrowbody aircraft: the Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON:RR) Trent 1000 engines used on the widebody Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 787, and United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX). subsidiary Pratt & Whitney’s geared turbofan used on the narrowbody Airbus SE A320neo. While widebody aircraft make up one-third of global emissions, narrowbody and regional passenger plans are almost half.
If the turbines used to propel the largest and longest-range of aircraft are approaching technical limits but almost half of emissions are from shorter-range and smaller aircraft, then there’s space to innovate, for emissions’ sake, at the short and small end. And that space looks electric and hybrid.
Next month, Vancouver-based Harbour Air will fly its first electric seaplane, a De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver prototype retrofitted with a propulsion system from Seattle-based electric aviation company MagniX. It’s a first look at what electric commercial flight could be, and as it draws upon a sophisticated, global and continually improving network of battery makers while the cost of batteries continues to decrease, it has room to grow. “Because of airborne mobility development, this technology is unstoppable, and it’s getting more practical as every day goes by,” says Greg McDougall, Harbour Air’s CEO. “The brainpower and money involved is snowballing, and there’s no doubt we can roll out what we’re doing to other small airlines.” It’s an infectious enthusiasm, but it just might take to the air elsewhere, too.

The SEC's inquiry is preliminary and may not lead to any allegations of wrongdoing, Bloomberg reported, adding that it could not determine whether specific WeWork business decisions or transactions prompted the review.
WeWork shelved its IPO in September after investors grew wary of its mounting losses, a business model with high leasing liabilities and corporate governance that forced former chief executive and co-founder Adam Neumann to resign.
Neumann and other WeWork officials are also being sued by minority shareholders who accuse the company's board of directors of breaching its fiduciary duties.
Masayoshi Son, chairman of SoftBank Group which took control of WeWork last month, is also one of the defendants in the case.
The SEC's enforcement division is reviewing WeWork's business and its disclosures to investors after media reports showed conflicts of interest and the company's fundraising, according to the report. 
WeWork has retained top Wall Street lawyer Andrew Ceresney, who previously headed the SEC enforcement unit, Bloomberg reported. 
WeWork and the SEC declined to comment.
The SEC took issue with WeWork's use of non-regular financial reporting rules, including a profitability measure it dubbed ""contribution margin,"" the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The SEC told WeWork the term could be misleading.
WeWork should have clearly indicated its losses would continue to mount in the near term in its IPO filing, analysts have said. WeWork also failed to provide a cash flow statement that would show it would run out of money if it did not receive anticipated financing from the shelved IPO.
Neumann has been accused of self-dealing, or acting in his own interests instead of the company's. Neumann earned $5.9 million for selling the rights for the name We Company, WeWork's parent, which he returned in September after a public outcry.
Material information also was omitted in the IPO filing, including that Neumann had been on the board's compensation committee when he was CEO, the Journal reported in October.

The We Company on Wednesday said net losses in the third quarter more than doubled to $1.25 billion.

PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's interim chief executive Clotilde Delbos has applied to take the job on a permanent basis, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the French carmaker edges toward a shortlist likely to also feature several external candidates.
Financial chief Delbos was propelled to the job on a temporary basis after CEO Thierry Bollore's ousting in mid-October, as  Renault  and its Japanese partner Nissan clear the decks of managers closely associated with the Carlos Ghosn era.
Ghosn, who chaired the alliance between the two companies, was arrested in Japan a year ago on financial misconduct charges he denies, and Renault (PA:RENA) and Nissan (T:7201) have been striving to repair their strained ties since.
Delbos, who joined Renault in 2012, had put herself forward for the CEO job but was not certain to feature on the shortlist of frontrunners, despite being one of the few likely internal candidates, one of the sources said.
That selection, which would comprise around three names, is expected to be turned over to the group's nominations committee in the coming days, the source added.
Delbos declined to comment when asked by Reuters earlier this week whether she had applied. Renault also declined to comment on Friday.
The French carmaker, chaired by Jean-Dominique Senard, a former executive at tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) parachuted in following the Ghosn scandal, is expected to choose a new CEO by year-end so that the group can try and fully refocus on its operations.
Like many peers, both Nissan and Renault are struggling with falling sales in a faltering global auto market.
Several heavyweight external candidates have been cited as good fits for Renault, and the French government, which has a 15% stake in the carmaker, has already made clear it was not opposed to a non-French national getting the job.
Didier Leroy, a senior Toyota executive who was already seen as a potential replacement for Ghosn when the latter was close to departing last year, has once again been cited in the recruitment process, two other sources close to the situation said.
""I do not pay attention to these rumours and remain 100%focused on my job at Toyota, where I enjoy a very trustful relationship with Akio Toyoda,"" Leroy said, referring to Toyota's president in a statement sent to Reuters through the Japanese carmaker.
One of the sources said that Patrick Koller, the Franco-German CEO of car parts maker Faurecia, and Luca de Meo, the Italian boss of Volkswagen-owned SEAT, also ticked many of the boxes for recruiters, namely as both spoke French.
Faurecia declined to comment.
""Luca de Meo is fully committed to SEAT, as he himself has stated on several occasions since he was appointed company President in 2015,"" SEAT said in a statement."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Restaurants are doing away with dining rooms as consumers increasingly order food deliveries through apps such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's Uber Eats and GrubHub Inc.
The newest Chopt Creative Salad Co location, which opened Tuesday in New York, is unlike any of the chain's other 61 sites. It has no cash registers or tables for customers.
Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A Inc has similar sites in Nashville and Louisville, where customers order and prepay online with the option for delivery or pickup.
Chick-fil-A is also trying something different, opening three pilot ""delivery kitchens"" this year - in Chicago, Los Angeles and near San Francisco. The latter is run by delivery platform DoorDash Inc.
At those sites, the chicken chain shares kitchens with other restaurants to prepare food for delivery only.
Off-premise digital orders are a major growth area for fast-food and fast-casual chains. More are turning to these so-called dark, virtual or ghost kitchens, which can also save labor and real estate costs.
Wendy's Co said during its Oct. 11 investor day it aimed to open two ""dark kitchens"" by year's end in high-delivery markets. Its franchisee in the Dominican Republic opened one there last month.
A Wendy's spokeswoman said she could not yet disclose locations for its next dark kitchens.
Some delivery-only locations by startups, independents and celebrity chefs in New York and San Francisco have flopped in recent years.
But in January, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick's CloudKitchens got a $400 million investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, according to a source familiar with the matter. The Wall Street Journal first reported the investment last week.
CloudKitchens, founded in 2016 and based in Los Angeles, builds shared kitchens for delivery-only restaurants to rent. It did not respond to a request for comment.
At the new Chopt location in New York, shelves hold salads ready for pick up, while delivery workers shuttle other orders through the front door. Greeters inside help customers place orders. 
In the kitchen, a central prep table stocked with ingredients is flanked by a row of employees on each side who assemble orders. 
Privately held Chopt offered pick-up and delivery orders soon after it opened 18 years ago, but today, those orders make up nearly half of its business at larger locations, said Chief Marketing Officer Julie Atkinson.
""We are sensing a really huge customer need for speed, for convenience,"" she said. ""We're hopeful that this concept really raises the bar on customer convenience.""
Connecticut-based private equity firm L Catterton and consumer company The Hain Celestial Group Inc invested an undisclosed amount of money in Chopt in 2015.
GrowthPoint Restaurants, a fund raised by Chopt CEO Nick Marsh, is Chopt's original outside investor. 
An initial public offering is ""an absolute possibility"" though not the only course to finance growth, Marsh said.

On Nov. 5,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) opened its first Starbucks Pickup location in the United States for online orders. The midtown Manhattan location is similar to some new Starbucks stores in China, where digital ordering and delivery is more common.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 02:07PM ET</span>","Alphabet features self-driving garbage cans, apartment noise monitors in Toronto smart city project","By Moira Warburton
TORONTO (Reuters) - Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Sidewalk Labs has provided more details on the technology it intends to use to develop a futuristic smart city in Toronto, which includes self-driving garbage cans and infra-red sensors to track foot traffic in stores, a document released by the company on Friday said.
Sidewalk, owned by the parent company of Google, released a 483-page document in response to criticism from an arm of the government-mandated body developing the project that called the initial proposal ""frustratingly abstract.""
Waterfront Toronto, the agency in charge of developing the waterfront area of Canada's biggest city, gave a tentative approval to the project two weeks ago after Sidewalk agreed to walk back many of its original proposals, including putting all data collected into an Urban Data Trust, which critics said would not be subject to adequate oversight.
The 12-acre project, close to Toronto's central business district, would feature adaptive street design and responsive sounds to help blind people find their way around, the document showed.
Sidewalk would implement a pay-as-you-throw system of garbage deposition, with volume sensors installed on each bin to indicate when it should empty itself, and optical sensors that would allow each self-driving bin to navigate through the public realm.
It said the majority of the services it is proposing have already been partially or fully implemented in an existing project in various cities around the world.
Sidewalk said the objective of this list is to ""not only describe the 'what' and the 'why,' but also the 'how' and 'who' for each service.
""It also can help provide a clear, single source for what data collection activities are proposed — and importantly, what activities are not.""
Sidewalk has said it will not sell data collected to third parties, or use it for advertising purposes. It will also not share personal information - one of four categories of data it defines - with third parties, including other Alphabet-owned companies, without explicit consent.
It will not use facial recognition, and 60% of services will not generate personal information.
Sidewalk's plan to monitor residents include tracking noise level in apartments to ensure tenants are adhering to an acceptable nuisance threshold, the document showed.
Waterfront Toronto cautioned that it is still reading through Sidewalk's document but said it was pleased to receive further details.
""Having worked with Sidewalk Labs to reach a realignment on important digital issues, we are eager to see how these discussions have been reflected,"" Kristina Verner, Waterfront's vice president of innovation, sustainability and prosperity, said in an emailed statement.
The project will now go through a formal evaluation and further public consultation before a final vote on Mar 31, 2020, by Waterfront Toronto's board of directors."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The strength of the U.S. consumer has been often cited as a pillar of the economy and one of the reasons the S&P 500 has recently scaled new heights, but consumer discretionary stocks have skipped the party for several months.
The S&P consumer discretionary sector (SPLRCD) hit a record high on July 15. But while the S&P 500 has continued to climb to new highs, discretionary stocks have gone in the opposite direction, falling nearly 4%. (N)
Graphic: Consumer discretionary lags broader market, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8768/8682/Pasted%20Image.jpg
Subsequent attempts by the sector have fallen short, with the index making lower highs, indicating a downtrend.
Graphic: Consumer discretionary in a downtrend, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8766/8680/Pasted%20Image.jpg
The disappointing performance for the sector comes as U.S. companies continue to point to strong domestic spending.
On Friday, data showed retail sales rebounded in October, although purchases of big-ticket household items and clothing were curtailed. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said its U.S. consumer confidence indicator bounced further in the survey period through Nov. 12, but remained below July's levels.
According to Refinitiv data, 65% of the companies in the sector that have reported earnings have topped expectations, below the 74.6% beat rate for the S&P 500 as a whole through Nov. 15. The third-quarter year-over-year earnings growth rate for the sector has tumbled to 0.9% from the 9.9% anticipated at the start of the year.
""Earnings across the board have been pretty lackluster - it may be reflective of the consumer taking a little bit of a pause. Consumer spending has been solid but it hasn’t been robust,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston.
Research firm CFRA forecasts retail sales for the holiday season months of November and December to rise 4.3% to $1.05 trillion. However, CFRA retail analyst Camilla Yanushevsky believes the growth is more a result of an easier comparison with last year, when figures were distorted by the government shutdown. U.S. consumers are not as strong at this time as they were a year ago, she says.
""This is a very confusing time for investors looking at this sector,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. ""Whither the sales?""
A big overhang on these stocks has been the trade war, said Yanushevsky, and the perceived progress in negotiations between the United States and China has been a big factor.
Another round of tariffs on about $156 billion in Chinese imports is scheduled to take effect on Dec. 15, raising prices on many consumer products, such as cell phones. Negotiators for the two countries are attempting to reach a deal to cancel current tariffs in phases.
""Right now there is not much optimism; it is kind of a wait- and-see before reacting approach,"" said Yanushevsky. ""If there is some sort of optimism like a Phase 1 deal is signed and then there is a clear path to Phase 2 and Phase 3, that could reignite that optimism that we saw in the beginning of the year with the securities.""
Underperformance in Amazon (O:AMZN), by far the biggest weight in the sector at over 20%, has contributed to the lackluster returns for the sector. Investors have rotated into beaten-down stocks that have become cheap, such as financials (SPSY) and energy (SPNY) names, which have gained more than 3% this month.
""If you back the lens up and say 'How has consumer discretionary done for the whole year and when did it top out?', it topped out right when we started to cycle into the things that hadn't been working,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
With Amazon having already reported results, investors will get a look at results from a host of companies in the sector next week, including its second-largest weight,  Home Depot  (N:HD).
Other consumer discretionary names due to post results in coming days include  Target  (N:TGT), Nordstrom (N:JWN), Kohl's (N:KSS) and Lowe's Companies (N:LOW).
""The fact we are having rotations is healthy because that just means we are not glued to what has been working in 2019,"" said Hogan. ""As consumer discretionary goes through that mini-rotation, it probably comes out of it and next week is probably that catalyst to at least see what has been overdone on the downside here."""

RBC upgraded its price target on shares of AMD to $50 from $44, touting improved prospects for the chipmaker, and forecasting its shares to rally above $40 by year end. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 1%.
""We are raising our price target on AMD to reflect improving Data Center demand and increased conviction in share gains through 2020. While 2021 is admittedly unclear, we think 2020 has become more attractive,"" RBC said.
RBC also said the threat to AMD's competitive edge is limited, estimating that the chipmaker will not see a change of competition in a meaningful way until around the end of the third or fourth quarter next year.
The more somber outlook on data centers comes in the wake of bullish commentary form Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Following its quarterly results yesterday, Nvidia said it expected a rise in conversational artificial intelligence to drive-data center growth. That echoed bullish sentiment from Intel, with the company’s chief financial officer, George Davis, telling Reuters in an interview last month that “data center came back much more strongly than even we anticipated this quarter.”
The increasing complexities of machine learning used to develop AI products will likely drive demand for hyperscale computing, boosting demand for data-center products from both Nvidia and Intel. 
“Like Intel, Nvidia saw big demand from its hyperscale customers, undoubtedly driven by machine learning training and inference needs,” Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said."

(Reuters) -  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) launched ""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order"" on Friday, garnering strong reviews for its flagship action-adventure series that is crucial to its holiday sales, after the videogame publisher shelved ""NBA Live"" game.
The latest title, which scored 83% on Metacritic earlier in the day, follows the story of one of the last surviving Jedi as he attempts to rebuild the order.
In fiscal 2020, EA expects to sell 6 million to 8 million units of the latest title.
Fextralife, a Twitch streamer with channels views of over 400 million, said the title is a step in the right direction.
""There is a bit too much Uncharted in the game, and I was hoping for more of an action ARPG, akin to Dark Souls,"", the gaming group said.
The game's official gameplay trailer garnered over 4 million views on YouTube.
The previous titles - ""Star Wars: Battlefront I"" launched in 2015 and ""Star Wars: Battlefront II"" in 2017 - have sold over 33 million copies combined, EA had said in October.
Jeff Cohen, analyst with Stephens, expects sales of the latest title to hit 8 million units, given the upcoming movie release.
The ninth film in the series, ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" will hit the theaters by the end of December. ""The Mandalorian"", a web series set in the Star Wars universe, was also launched earlier this week on Disney+.
EA, which had previously canceled four ""NBA Live"" console titles in its popular basketball series, missed market expectation for 2020 adjusted revenue forecast in October.
""Pushing out NBA 20 also will clearly impact sales,"" Elazar Advisor analyst, Chaim Seigel, said.
""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order"" is the biggest single-player focused game coming out at the end of the year.
""It has elements of Tomb Raider like environmental puzzles, a God of War style emotional story design and even Batman inspired fluid combat,"" Samuel Franklin, founder of gaming recommendation website Games Finder said.
According to Cowen analysts, the sales for latest Star Wars title could grow to 11 million units on consoles, estimating that every incremental million unit will add about 7 cents to earnings per share."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc said on Friday it is extending cancellations of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX flights until March 4, joining U.S. peers who are also scheduling without the aircraft until early March as the jet awaits approval to fly again.
The March date will mark nearly a year since regulators around the world issued a safety ban on Boeing Co's fastest-selling aircraft, the 737 MAX, following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Boeing said on Monday that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration could approve in December fixes to software that played a role in both crashes and approve fixes to new pilot training in January, though the agency has insisted it has no set time frame.
Major airlines have said they will need at least a month after approval to complete training and install revised software before flights can resume.
Since the grounding, airlines have canceled flights or put other aircraft on routes that would have been flown with the 737 MAX in a hit to profits.
""We are continuing to work through the schedule to try and swap and upgauge aircraft to mitigate the disruption caused by the grounding of the MAX,"" United said in a statement.
Airlines have been automatically booking affected passengers on alternate flights or offering other options.
United had previously canceled 737 MAX flights through early January. The new timeline, which could still change depending on the timing of FAA approval, will lead to more than 8,500 flights being canceled between November and the first few days of March.

The other two U.S. airlines that operate the MAX, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, last week announced extended cancellations through March 4 and March 5 respectively.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 11:11AM ET</span>",On board Qantas' ultra-long haul test flight,"By Jill Gralow
SYDNEY (Reuters) - When I signed up to join a trial run of the world's longest commercial flight, I expected an exercise in endurance but not steak for breakfast and a physical work-out regime.
In preparation for its first 19-hour non-stop commercial flight planned for 2022-3, Qantas Airways is carrying out three dummy runs from London and New York to Sydney to test the effects of ultra-long haul flying on passengers, staff and pilots alike.
Although I travel frequently for my job as a TV journalist, this ""research flight"" was a whole new experience.
On board were six test passengers under constant electronic monitoring by the Australian carrier. I and a handful of other journalists largely shared their experience, minus the wires.
It began with a London sunrise and an early-morning dinner, followed by lights-out as we immediately adopted Sydney time - part of the regime drawn up by a specialist team to coax our body clocks into making the 11-hour leap.
That meant a sleep-inducing carb-fest of steak sandwich and soup instead of the expected breakfast. I turned down the wine.
Meal composition and schedules, well-timed exercise and lighting can all ""help people adjust better and reduce jetlag"", University of Sydney physiologist Corinne Caillaud told me during the roughly 17,000-kilometre (10,500-mile) flight.
So after the eight-hour blackout and a breakfast spiked with chilli - to boost the metabolism - Caillaud led regular bouts of stretches and squats, performed in the aisles with varying degrees of enthusiasm by her guinea-pig passengers.
Besides raising alertness, the airborne work-out is also key to reducing the risk of deep-vein thrombosis on such a long flight.
The meals, sleep schedules and encouragement to exercise are likely to figure to some extent in the cabin service eventually offered to Qantas’ commercial customers on these routes.
To fly direct to Sydney with a full passenger load, Qantas will need a longer-range plane than the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787-9 Dreamliner we flew in, which was more than three-quarters empty.
The airline is betting that customers will pay more to avoid stop-offs. The new aircraft it's poised to order from Boeing or Airbus will have cabin features tailored to ultra-long haul, and unprecedented space in coach class.
The interiors will offer a ""very designed product for long-haul travel"", as Qantas CEO Alan Joyce explained to me during the flight.
""Our intention is to have a bigger seat pitch in economy than we've ever done before, and have dedicated stretching areas in economy.""
So how did I sleep?

And although I can't be sure, the carefully scheduled meals and blackouts may have left me feeling slightly less destroyed than I otherwise might after soldiering through two sunrises, with a final flight time of 19 hours and 19 minutes.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Alibaba's (N:BABA) order books for its $13.4 billion Hong Kong share sale have already been covered ""multiple times,"" sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, as the ecommerce group kicked off its campaign for the secondary listing in the city gripped by protests.
The Chinese e-commerce giant plans to list its shares in Hong Kong from November 26, where it is hoping to raise up to $13.4 billion, and it is marketing the deal to investors around the world.
The sources said potential investors had been told that the ""quality of demand is high"" and that there ""continues to be very strong feedback"" about the deal.
An  Alibaba  spokeswoman declined to comment.
Pricing of the shares for institutional shareholders will be set on November 20, a prospectus lodged with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange shows. Retail investors will not pay more than $HK188 per share.
In a first for the Asian financial hub, Alibaba said the listing would be fully automated and paperless to reflect its environmental standards, confirming an earlier Reuters story. 
Investment bankers familiar with the listing however said the move avoided a potential publicity nightmare of investors queuing at banks to place stock orders while protests raged around them. 
Four thousand people have been arrested in Hong Kong since June and the territory’s economy has sunk into recession for the first time in a decade as the anti-government demonstrations disrupt business and deter tourists.
Earlier on Friday, Alibaba Group Chairman Daniel Zhang made no mention of the unrest in Hong Kong in a letter included in the company's supplementary prospectus.
""Over the last few years, there have been many encouraging reforms in Hong Kong’s capital market. During this time of ongoing change, we continue to believe that the future of Hong Kong remains bright,"" Zhang wrote.
The share sale is set to be Hong Kong's largest in more than nine years, and comes as Beijing seeks support from the semi-autonomous territory's tycoons and entrepreneurs to maintain a sense of business-as-usual in the face of more than five months of unrest.
Alibaba had originally considered a Hong Kong initial public offering in 2013, but ultimately chose New York after failing to gain approval from Hong Kong regulators for its unusual governance structure.
The institutional price will be finalised on Nov. 20 following a book build which is underway for global investors. 
In the retail component 12.5 million shares will be offered, which is 2.5% of the total deal, but that could be increased to up to 50 million, or 10% of the total transaction.

Alibaba also has the option to exercise a so-called over-allotment option to add an extra 75 million shares to the deal.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 10:43AM ET</span>",Global debt to top record $255 trillion by year's end,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Global debt is on course to end 2019 at a record high of more than $255 trillion, the Institute of International Finance estimated on Friday -- nearly $32,500 for each of the 7.7 billion people on planet.
The amount, which is also more than three times the world's annual economic output, has been driven by a $7.5 trillion surge in the first half of the year that shows no signs of slowing.
Around 60% of that jump came from the United States and China. Government debt alone is set to top $70 trillion this year, as will overall debt (government, corporate and financial sector) of emerging-market countries.
""With few signs of slowdown in the pace of debt accumulation, we estimate that global debt will surpass $255 trillion this year,"" the IIF said in a report.
Across sectors, government debt saw the biggest rise in the first half of the year, increasing by 1.5 percentage points, followed by non-financial companies, with a 1 percentage point rise.
Moreover, with state-owned companies now accounting for over half of non-financial corporate debt in emerging markets, sovereign-related borrowing has been the single most important driver of global debt over the past decade.
Separate analysis from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) on Friday calculated that since the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, governments have borrowed $30 trillion, companies have taken on $25 trillion, households $9 trillion and banks $2 trillion.
The IIF's data, which are based on Bank for International Settlements and International Monetary Fund figures as well as its own, also said the amount of debt outside the financial sector now topped 240% of world gross domestic product at $190 trillion. 
Global bond markets have increased from $87 trillion in 2009 to over $115 trillion. Government bonds now make up 47% of the market compared with 40% in 2009. Bank bonds have dropped to below 40% from over 50% in 2009.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 10:06AM ET</span>","J.C. Penney's loss smaller than expected, shares soar 13%","By Nivedita Balu and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) on Friday reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on lower ad spending and higher margins, results Chief Executive Jill Soltau said showed efforts to revive sales and profits at the department store are taking hold.
Shares of the Plano, Texas-based company were trading up nearly 13% at $1.24 before the bell on Friday.
The 117-year-old retailer, one of the worst-hit by the surge in online shopping in the past decade, has been desperate to attract modern shoppers. In August, it partnered with resale clothing company thredUP, adding second-hand women's clothing and handbags to its merchandising mix.
It is also testing a new store to attract customers with everything from a yoga studio, a videogame lounge and lifestyle workshops.
Such efforts are a part of Soltau's turnaround strategy, aimed at reassuring investors it can lure back shoppers into stores amid fierce competition from online giants like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and discount retailers like TJX Cos Inc's (N:TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains.
""We are beginning to see results – both in our numbers and how we operate as a business,"" Soltau said in a statement on Friday.
Soltau, hired late last year from craft and fabrics seller Jo-Ann Stores, is attempting to restore Penney's roots as a retailer of mid-priced apparel for middle-class families. 
Soltau also pushed to stop sales of appliances and limit its furniture offerings, while reducing inventory at stores to boost margins and closing underperforming outlets.
Retail traffic data from analytics firm Placer.ai showed traffic turned positive in August, rising 13.3% above the baseline for the period, above the 7.3% rise in 2018. 
J.C. Penney's rivals, including Macy's (N:M) and  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN), are also looking to bring in shoppers to new stores with cafes, donut shops, fine-dining restaurants and full bars with Instagrammable views.
Excluding one-time items, J.C. Penney reported a loss of 30 cents per share, narrower than the average analyst estimate of a loss of 55 cents.
The company said its net loss narrowed to $93 million, or 29 cents per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 2, from $151 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier.
J.C. Penney's total revenue fell 8.5% to $2.5 billion in the third quarter.
The company also said it now expects its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the year to exceed $475 million, compared with its prior outlook of $440 million to $475 million.
It maintained its full-year forecast for comparable store sales.

Sales at stores open for more than a year fell 9.3% compared with expectations of a 7.74% slide, according to data from IBES Refinitiv.

1452,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 08:41AM ET</span>",Lloyds Wins Suit Over HBOS Takeover During Credit Crunch,"(Bloomberg) -- Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LON:LLOY) won a landmark London lawsuit Friday over its decision to take over the ailing HBOS Plc a decade ago -- a turbulent chapter that “deeply troubled” senior executives and ultimately contributed to Lloyds having to seek a government bailout itself.
The U.K. government didn’t pressure Lloyds into making the offer, Judge Alastair Norris said in his ruling. While there were “imperfections” in Lloyds’s circular giving details of the takeover, it wasn’t enough to mislead, he said.
“The majority who approved the acquisition did not do so under some misapprehension of the position,” Norris said in the 208-page ruling. “They knew the course recommended unanimously by the board. They knew the risks identified by the board. They knew that the board assessed the chance of advantage as outweighing the risk inherent in the transaction.”
The lawsuit rekindled interest in the U.K. response to the global financial crisis and heard testimony from Lloyds' executives as well as the head of the financial regulator. Around 6,000 investors sued the lender for as much as 600 million pounds ($773 million), accusing managers of deliberately misleading shareholders into accepting the deal.
Lloyds was forced to take a 20.5 billion-pound bailout after the purchase, while other lenders accepted rescue packages or sought outside funding to strengthen their balance sheets as loans soured.
For the Lloyds board, the takeover was “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to expand with a deal that under ordinary circumstances would’ve been blocked by regulators. Ex-CEO Eric Daniels, who left Lloyds in 2011, said that the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the bank it would ease the competition issues to ensure a deal.
Alongside Daniels, former Chairman Victor Blank was also questioned during the trial. The executive said he was “deeply troubled” upon learning of HBOS’s funding issues days after striking a deal. He said that he only became aware of the bank’s inability to access crucial central bank funding after Lloyds had already announced its plans to buy HBOS.
Hector Sants, the former head of the U.K. financial regulator, also gave evidence.
The claimants, which include around 300 pension and investment funds, accused Lloyds of “secretly” making a 10 billion-pound loan facility available to HBOS and that the bank received billions in “covert” financial support from the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Lloyds rejected any accusation of wrongdoing in its representation of the deal to shareholders and said the due diligence it did prior was “adequate” and indeed “more extensive than normal.”
“Throughout this process, the group has sought to act in the interests of our shareholders,” a spokeswoman said in an emailed statement."

LONDON (Reuters) - Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal turned world stock markets and other risk assets higher on Friday, though an escalating wave of global protests from Hong Kong to Chile left some deep scars.
Europe's main bourses and Wall Street futures followed Asia higher (EU) (N) after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday that the United States and China were nearing a deal and talking every day.
""We're getting close,"" he told an event at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. ""The mood music is pretty good, and that has not always been so in these things.""
It kept alive hopes that MSCI's 49-country world index and Europe's STOXX 600 could both avoid their first weekly falls since the start of October, but it was touch and go and others had little chance.
Emerging market stocks were down 1.7% for the week, after a violent escalation of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong had left the Hang Seng down 4.7%, its worst weekly performance in four months. 
Chinese blue-chip shares ended the day down 0.75% and 2.4% for the week, which was their biggest fall since August. Fierce anti-government protests in Chile means its currency could have its worst week since 2011 with a 7% plunge.
""The politics of anger is an important element that one needs to take account off,"" UBP's EM macro and FX strategist Koon Chow said. ""Populations are feeling left behind even during the upswing. You have to wonder what happens when people start losing their jobs.""
Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital in Sydney, likened regional markets' bullish reaction to positive trade news to being in a relationship with an alcoholic, driven by entrenched hopes for recovery.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said there would be a call between U.S. and Chinese officials later in the day as both sides continue to hammer out a phase one trade pact, but added U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports could still start Dec. 15.
""Markets want to believe that there will be some sort of resolution to this issue, some sort of lasting truce at least, even though the experience of the last 18 months doesn't give a lot of cause for comfort,"" AMP's Oliver said.
However, weaker Chinese and U.S. economies as well as the U.S. presidential election next year put pressure on both sides to come to an agreement, he added.
RECESSION SUPPRESSION 
In currencies, the safe-haven yen weakened, with the dollar rising 0.3% to buy 108.73 yen. The euro was barely changed at $1.1023 and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was off just 0.02% at 98.129.
Higher U.S. Treasury yields also illustrated the risk-on tone in the Asian session, with the 10-year yield rising to 1.845% from a U.S. close of 1.815% on Thursday.
The policy-sensitive two-year yield rose to 1.6101% from 1.593% on Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of the U.S. economy facing a dramatic bust is remote.
A Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed that while concerns have eased over a U.S. recession, few see an economic rebound, and most believe a trade truce is unlikely in the coming year.
BULLS VS CHINA 
Government borrowing costs in Germany and France also inched up on Friday, but were set for sizeable weekly declines, in contrast to southern European countries that have come under heavy selling pressure again this week.
Germany's 10-year Bund yield was at -0.33%, off more than one-week lows hit on Thursday. But it is down 8 bps on the week, set for the biggest weekly fall since mid-August. Dutch 10-year bond yields are down 7 bps this week, and French yields are 5 bps lower,.
Data on Thursday had showed Germany's economy grew just 0.1% in the third quarter, with consumer spending helping the country to avoid a mild contraction and a technical recession of two quarters of economic shrinkage.
""In general, there has been risk aversion in recent days and a shift to core bond markets from the periphery,"" said Daniel Lenz, a rates strategist at DZ Bank.
Global sentiment has been buffeted in recent weeks by conflicting assessments of progress in talks between the United States and China aimed at ending their 16-month-long trade war. 
China's commerce ministry said the two countries are holding ""in-depth"" discussions on the first-phase trade pact, and that cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reaching a deal.
China has also ended a nearly five-year ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat, which the U.S. Trade Representative said would lead to more than $1 billion in annual shipments to China.
Those developments followed comments from officials from both countries last week that they had a deal to roll back tariffs, only to have U.S. President Donald Trump deny that any such deal had been agreed to.
The new record for the S&P, which gained just 0.08% to 3,096.63, came despite a grim outlook from network gear maker Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) that underlined the impact of trade uncertainty.
In commodity markets, U.S. crude prices seesawed after sliding Thursday on rising U.S. crude inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude stumbled from $57.02 to $56.67 a barrel.
Global benchmark Brent crude slipped 0.5% to just below $62 per barrel on the way to a modest weekly fall.

Gold retreated from gains that had been prompted by trade uncertainty. Spot gold was last trading at $1,463.90 per ounce, down 0.48%.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies face stiffening competition in 2020, the International Energy Agency said on Friday, adding urgency to the oil producer group's policy meeting next month.
""The OPEC+ countries face a major challenge in 2020 as demand for their crude is expected to fall sharply,"" the Paris-based agency said in a monthly report.
The IEA estimated non-OPEC supply growth would surge to 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) next year compared to 1.8 million bpd in 2019, citing production from the United States, Brazil, Norway and Guyana.
""The hefty supply cushion that is likely to build up during the first half of next year will offer cold comfort to OPEC+ ministers gathering in Vienna at the start of next month,"" it added.
While U.S. supply rose by 145,000 bpd in October, the IEA said, a slowdown in activity that started earlier this year looks set to continue as companies prioritize capital discipline.
Demand for crude oil from OPEC in 2020 will be 28.9 million bpd, the IEA forecast, 1 million bpd below the exporter club's current production.
The recovery by OPEC's de facto leader Saudi Arabia from attacks on the country's oil infrastructure contributed 1.4 million bpd to the global oil supply increase in October of 1.5 million bpd.
""With plans underway for the Aramco IPO and the persistent need for revenues to fund the government budget, Riyadh has every incentive to keep oil prices supported,"" the IEA said.
Saudi state oil company Aramco, the world’s most profitable firm, starts a share sale on Nov. 17 in an initial public offering (IPO) that may raise between $20 billion and $40 billion.
It was the IEA's last monthly report before the Dec. 5-6 talks among OPEC states and partners led by Russia on whether to maintain supply curbs aimed at buoying prices and balancing the market.

The agency kept its assessments for growth in global oil demand in 2019 and 2020 at 1 million bpd and 1.2 million bpd respectively, but said its outlook might slightly underestimate the impact of tariffs from the U.S.-China trade war.
The IEA said that if some or all tariffs were lifted in coming months, ""world economic growth and oil demand growth would both rise significantly"", though the rebound may not be immediate.
Sluggish refinery activity in the first three quarters has caused crude oil demand to fall in 2019 for the first time since 2009, the IEA said, but refining is set to rebound sharply in the fourth quarter and in 2020.

BT Group (LON:BT) fell as much as 4% and smaller rival Talk Talk (LON:TALK) fell 4.8% after the Labour Party grabbed headlines by promising to nationalize Openreach, the last-mile infrastructure unit of the old incumbent, and giving every home and business free full-fiber broadband by 2030.
At face value, that would destroy a great deal of value for BT shareholders and even more for independents like Talk Talk, whose business model would be killed stone dead if the government ever were to pay for everyone’s broadband bill.
There are, however, so many obstacles to this ever happening that it’s difficult to know where to start counting.
First, and most obviously, there is virtually no chance of the Labour Party winning the election: it’s lagged the Conservatives by up to 15% in opinion polls published since the vote was slated for Dec. 12. University of Strathclyde polling expert Professor John Curtice said on Thursday that the chances of a Labour majority are “frankly as close to zero as one can safely say.”
The only way for Labour to implement even part of its agenda would be to form a coalition with at least two other parties: the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, both of which have different ideas about nationalization and very different priorities as regards public spending.
Second, the only way such a coalition would be formed and sustained would be via a commitment to hold a second referendum on Brexit and campaign for Remain. That means staying bound by the EU’s laws on state aid. While there’s no prohibition on nationalizing assets, especially pure infrastructure ones such as Openreach, Labour’s plans would run into big trouble at the European Court of Justice if it started offering commercial services in competition to the likes of Talk Talk. The legal actions could easily stretch beyond the term of the next parliament.
Third, nationalizing Openreach would also require the government to assume its pension liabilities, meaning that the total bill would go well beyond the 20 billion pounds ($26 billion) outlined by Labour’s finance spokesman John McDonnell to the BBC.
Fourth, Labour’s dramatic late conversion to renationalizing telecoms makes clear that it is not as much of a priority as renationalizing rail services and water utilities. Given that both of those projects are likely to absorb enormous amounts of political energy and capital – and given the improbability of any immediate, dramatic performance by those services under state control, it’s hard to see the public or parliament having the appetite for further nationalization by the time Labour has addressed its core priorities.
Fifth, Labour hasn’t defined what it means by “free broadband”. Note the above commitment to renationalizing water, which is more of a basic human necessity. No-one has suggested that people won’t have to pay water bills in future, so it’s a stretch to see Labour agreeing to pay for everyone to stream Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and play FIFA at the same time.
The real importance of McDonnell’s suggestion is that it fixes on a widespread feeling of unhappiness toward privatized utilities and says it can be fixed by taxing companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) more. It thus taps into two populist lines of thought that can both be big vote winners.
As such, it may increase Labour’s chances of stopping a Conservative majority. It doesn’t, however, present any meaningful threat to today’s listed companies."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Automakers around the world are awaiting a decision from U.S. President Donald Trump on whether he will impose up to 25% tariffs on U.S. car and auto part imports after a 180-day review period elapsed this week.
Trump was briefed ahead of the expiry of the self-imposed deadline, which he set in May, to decide whether to again extend a review or impose tariffs that automakers have warned could cost jobs and dramatically boost vehicle prices.
""I'll make a decision fairly soon. I was fully briefed and I'll make a decision fairly soon,"" Trump said on Wednesday.
Officials from major automakers told Reuters they believe Trump will not impose new levies on vehicles from the European Union, Japan or elsewhere amid a trade war with China.
The Trump administration first launched its probe of foreign autos in May 2018 and six months ago Trump agreed with an administration study that some imported cars and trucks are ""weakening our internal economy"" and threaten to harm national security, but stopped short of naming specific vehicles or parts.
Trump could make an announcement on Friday, but nothing is final until he signs off, administration officials say.
Trump has been especially critical of foreign-made vehicles and jawboned both U.S. and foreign automakers to build more cars in the United States. ""Cars are the big one,"" he said last year.
A delay on tariffs could push the issue back to the middle of the 2020 presidential campaign and experts say it could be harder for Trump to impose a hefty tariff on a major consumer product close to an election.
Tariffs may not be necessary, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said earlier this month. EU officials also expect Trump to announce a six-month delay. 
On May 17, Trump had postponed a decision on tariffs by up to 180 days as he ordered U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to pursue negotiations.
The White House declined to comment Thursday.
Ahead of the deadline, foreign automakers have been eager to highlight their U.S. investments to try to dissuade Trump from using tariffs that they argue could cost U.S. jobs. 
On Wednesday, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, a Republican ally of Trump's, attended a groundbreaking at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chattanooga assembly plant, marking the beginning of an $800 million expansion to build electric vehicles and add 1,000 jobs.
South Korean automaker  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) has also announced it will start making its Santa Cruz pickup trucks at its Alabama factory in 2021, with an investment of $410 million, as it seeks a foothold in the segment led by U.S. rivals.
Japanese automakers and suppliers have announced billions of dollars in investments, most notably a $1.6 billion joint venture plant in Alabama by Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and  Mazda Motor Corp.  (T:7261).

Germany's merchandise trade surplus with the United States - $69 billion in 2018 - remains a sore point with the Trump administration as does Japan's $67.6 billion U.S. trade surplus last year - with two-thirds of that in the auto sector.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 04:34AM ET</span>",Jet grounding and delays overshadow Dubai Airshow,"By Alexander Cornwell and Tim Hepher
DUBAI (Reuters) - An eight-month crisis over the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jets and widespread industrial delays are setting an unpredictable backdrop to next week's Dubai Airshow, with some airlines reviewing fleet plans even as others look for bargains.
The biennial civil and military expo is a major showcase for wares from jumbo jets to military drones but faces growing questions over demand and the capability of overstretched suppliers, delegates arriving for the Nov. 17-21 event said.
Top of their agenda will be the worldwide grounding of the 737 MAX in the wake of two deadly crashes.
Investors who have pushed up Boeing (N:BA) shares believe the planemaker is turning a corner after the eight month grounding, with the company predicting commercial flights in January. But it also faces a logjam of undelivered jets that could take 1-2 years to unwind.
State-owned flydubai expects its fleet will now shrink by a third this year, highlighting the cost of the grounding for the biggest MAX customer outside the United States. ""Flydubai has very big ambitions ... given the scale of those ambitions, there's little they can do but wait and watch, like everyone else,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.
Boeing lost one potential MAX customer earlier this year as Saudi budget airline flyadeal ditched a provisional order.
Experts say airline frustrations with plane and engine makers could also disrupt plans by the world's largest jetmakers pushing for order endorsements. The Middle East's largest aerospace event will give Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing a chance to sit with some of their top customers who have threatened to walk from billions in deals. The planemakers are struggling to deliver aircraft on time, forcing airlines to delay expansion plans, while engines on some jets are consistently causing issues for carriers. ""This seems to be a systemic issue across the board,"" said Novus Aviation Capital Managing Director Mounir Kuzbari. ""As a result, we see stress on the relationship between airlines and the plane and engine makers."" Dubai's Emirates, by far the region's biggest airline, has issued a stern warning to plane and engine makers. It will no longer take delivery of aircraft that do not meet performance expectations, raising doubts over $35 billion in pending orders. Airbus, Boeing and engine makers will be looking to allay concerns as they finalize jet sales with Emirates, which is also looking at reducing an order for the delayed Boeing 777X.
Airbus is seen close to a final order for A330neo and A350 jets while Boeing aims to salvage a provisional order for 787s.
GULF PRESSURE
Air Arabia (DU:AIRA) could, however, steal the show with a planned order of up to 120 Airbus jets, industry sources say.
Kuwait's  Jazeera Airways  (KW:JAZK) is in negotiations with Airbus and Boeing for around two dozen airplanes.
Past editions of Dubai's premier trade event have featured blockbuster deals, often led by Emirates as Gulf carriers redrew the aviation map around their 'super-connector' hubs.
But the Gulf hub model is increasingly under pressure as the once-rapid growth of the region's biggest airlines slows. ""The market continues to be weak for all airlines in the region; we should see a further 2-3% reduction in passenger numbers for the full year,"" said Diogenis Papiomytis, Frost & Sullivan's Global Program Director for Commercial Aviation. Middle East military leaders touring the displays will try to gauge whether they are on the cusp of another regional splurge on weapons after an escalation in Gulf tensions. A series of attacks over the summer has highlighted potential security gaps among some of the world's top defense spenders who now increasingly buy from China and Russia."
1463,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 03:59AM ET</span>",U.K. Labour Plans to Nationalize BT’s Broadband Unit,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. Labour Party pledged to deliver free full-fiber broadband for everyone within 10 years by nationalizing BT Group's (LON:BT) Openreach unit at a cost of 20 billion pounds ($26 billion).
If elected to power Dec. 12, a Labour government “will undertake a massive upgrade in the U.K.’s internet infrastructure, delivering fast, secure, reliable internet connections for everyone and putting an end to patchy and slow coverage,” the party said in an emailed statement late Thursday. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will announce details of the policy in a speech in Lancaster, northern England on Friday.
“What was once a luxury is now an essential utility,” Corbyn will say. “It’s time to make the very fastest full-fiber broadband free to everybody, in every home in every corner of our country.”
It’s the biggest new pledge yet of the election campaign from Labour, which already has plans to nationalize the postal service, the railways and water and energy utilities. While the radical proposals may prove popular with voters, Corbyn is far from certain to be in a position to implement them. The Labour Party has an average of 29% support in recent polls, typically 11 points behind the Conservatives, which have 40%.
Labour puts the cost of the nationalization at about 20 billion pounds, which it would finance partly by taxing multinational corporations such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). and Alphabet;s (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Google. BT’s Chief Executive Officer Philip Jansen said the proposal -- including the full-fiber pledge -- would cost almost five times that amount.
BT shares fell as much as 3.7% in London and were down 2.2% as of 8:30 a.m., giving the company a market value of about 18.9 billion pounds.
“These are very very ambitious ideas,” Jansen said Friday in an interview on BBC Radio 4. “The Conservative Party have their own ambitious ideas for full fiber for everybody by 2025.”
“How we do it is not straightforward, it needs funding,” Jansen said, putting the cost of such a roll-out over eight years at “not short of 100 billion pounds.”
BT has been pledging to speed up its own full-fiber build and Jansen said the company’s shares have fallen on the recognition that “we’re going to be investing very very heavily.” Shareholders “are nursing massive losses on their investment” in BT if they’d bought it a few years ago, he said.
Investors could get burned in a nationalization, according to analysts. Openreach’s business would likely be undervalued in an expropriation, New Street analyst James Ratzer said in an email, adding that nationalization “rarely works well for shareholders.” The Labour announcement caused TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc to pause talks to sell a fiber project as the industry seeks clarity.
BT shareholders would receive U.K. government bonds as compensation, John McDonnell, who speaks for the Labour Party on financial matters, told the BBC.
It’s not the first time radical ideas have been proposed for BT’s Openreach unit, a national network of copper wire and fiber-optic cable that communication providers including BT, Comcast Corp's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Sky and   Vodafone   Group PLC (LON:VOD) tap into to provide home internet to customers.
BT was forced to legally separate the division from the rest of the company in recent years over concerns about competition, and that it wasn’t investing fast enough to roll out fiber, and some investors have suggested the company should fully spin it out into an independent, listed business to unlock value.
Nicky Morgan, the Conservative cabinet minister with responsibility for digital services, in a statement dismissed Corbyn’s plan as a “fantasy” that “would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions” of pounds.
The Conservative Party’s own proposal for full-fiber broadband across the U.K. by 2025 -- eight years ahead of a previous government goal -- has raised eyebrows across the telecom industry, as some executives and analysts expressed skepticism about whether it’s doable, whether there’s consumer demand for the ultrafast internet service and how companies would make money.
TechUK, the industry’s main trade body called Labour’s plan “a disaster” for the telecom sector. “Renationalization would immediately halt the investment being driven not just by BT but the growing number of new and innovative companies that compete with BT,” said Chief Executive Officer Julian David.
The announcement will provide more fodder for the arguments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives that a Labour government risks plunging the country into an economic crisis. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid over the weekend released analysis estimating Labour would raise spending by 1.2 trillion pounds over five years. McDonnell at the time called it “fake news.”
McDonnell told the BBC that Parliament would set the value of Openreach when it’s taken into public ownership and that shareholders would be compensated with government bonds. He said the expenditure was needed because only 10% to 12% of the country has coverage now, compared with near complete coverage in Japan and South Korea.
Under Labour’s plan, the roll-out would begin in areas with the worst broadband access, including rural communities followed by towns and then by areas that are currently well-served by fast broadband.
According to elections expert John Curtice, Corbyn’s chances of forming a majority government are “as close to zero” as it’s possible to get. The election is still hard to predict, and it is possible that Labour could yet win power, either on its own or with the support of smaller parties."

The Supreme Court allowed Arcelor to make the payment for Essar Steel India Ltd. and set aside a bankruptcy appellate tribunal’s order that had given secured and unsecured creditors equal right over the sale proceeds. The lenders’ panel of a bankrupt company has discretion in the distribution of funds in insolvencies, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman said Friday.
The acquisition of Essar Steel India Ltd. will make Arcelor the fourth-biggest producer in a nation where the government is investing trillions of rupees in infrastructure. The verdict is likely to be the final approval in a more than yearlong battle by Arcelor to take over Essar. While companies can seek a review of decision by the same bench of judges, the success of review petitions is rare.
The world’s largest steelmaker, ArcelorMittal SA (AS:MT) and its partner Nippon Steel Corp. had offered to pay 420 billion rupees ($5.8 billion) in cash to creditors and pump another 80 billion rupees in the mill last year. While that offer was approved by a bankruptcy tribunal in March under the insolvency process, the payment was kept on hold by the Supreme Court after a dispute arose between lenders on the distribution of funds.
The ruling will set a precedent for other insolvencies that are awaiting resolution over the distribution of funds between different class of creditors.
India’s rupee, and creditors to Essar extended gains after the ruling. The rupee rose 0.3% at 11:06 a.m., while State Bank Of India (NS:SBI) added 4.2% and   Canara Bank   Ltd (NS:CNBK) surged as much as 7%.
The Supreme Court on Friday also said the timeline for insolvencies can be extended in exceptional cases."

Copenhagen-based Maersk now sees global growth this year of 1-2% compared with a previous estimate of 1-3%, it said on Friday. The company said growth in its own business may be “slightly lower” than the industry average.
The more pessimistic outlook “reflects the broad-based weakening of the economic environment in all the main economies,” Chief Executive Officer Soren Skou said in the statement. “Negative effects from escalating trade restrictions also weighed on trade growth.”
Amid protracted tensions between the U.S. and China, Maersk said it’s bracing for a “continued slowing in global manufacturing and global export orders.” The company is projecting industry growth of 1-3% for 2020, but said that the “continued weakening of global sentiment, above all in the manufacturing sector, reduces the likelihood of a growth pick-up” next year.
Maersk raised its full-year profit forecast on Oct. 21. The company said back then that its container-line business had performed better than expected despite weak global trade growth fanned by tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and China. On Friday, the company said it still sees full-year operating profit, or Ebitda, of about $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion.
“Aside from the cyclical slowing of the global economy, the main risks to global container demand relates to the U.S.-China trade negotiations. Other risks to the outlook relate to the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary stimuli in major economies, such as the U.S. and China,” Maersk said. “Finally, the outcome of the Brexit negotiations poses a risk to UK and European container trade.”"

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",Deere workers grapple with fallout from Trump's trade war,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
EAST MOLINE, Illinois (Reuters) - Devin Spencer has been on edge ever since Deere & Co. laid off dozens of his colleagues at its Harvester Works plant in western Illinois due to dwindling demand for farm combines.
He considers himself lucky to have escaped the indefinite layoffs, but has been relegated to a lower-level job with a pay cut. The 29-year-old welder blames America's trade war with China, which has dented U.S. agricultural exports and, in turn, slowed sales of equipment, for his situation.
Spencer, who is married with a young son, fears the worst if sales continue to sag and Deere cuts more workers. He is not alone. Hundreds of workers at Harvester Works are facing an uncertain future as a result of the 16-month-old tariff war. 
""Orders have sunk so low that I am lucky to have a job,"" he said. ""What happens if we don't get orders? I am out of the door.""
Deere, the world's largest tractor maker, said last month it had indefinitely laid off 50 employees at Harvester Works, part of 163 layoffs across Iowa and Illinois, adding that each factory balanced the size of its workforce with demand for its products. 
Harvester Works' union head David Thompson told Reuters that weeks later the company extended temporary layoffs for another 100 workers at Harvester Works until early January. The workers were due to return to work in November, he said.
Another 300 employees have been downgraded to lower-level roles, Thompson added. 
Deere has not publicly disclosed the extension of the temporary layoffs or the relegation of workers. The company declined to comment for this story, citing a quiet period before quarterly earnings on Nov. 27.
All the layoffs and job shuffles, which Thompson says have affected about 41% of the plant's roughly 1,100 workforce, show how the trade war is hitting the operations of some manufacturers like Deere, regarded as a bellwether for U.S. agriculture and manufacturing.
Last week, Deere told 12 workers at a facility that makes planting equipment just 15 minutes' drive from Harvester Works that they would be laid off indefinitely from early January, the plant's labor union head Heather Keag told Reuters.
President Donald Trump's trade war, coupled with poor weather in the U.S. farm belt, has dented the company's earnings and forced it to cut production, as well as trim full-year profit and sales forecasts.
Retail sales of Deere's combines in North America have been falling since May, according to the company which reports figures on a three-month rolling basis. Its rivals are also battling lower sales. 
'LOT OF ANXIETY, FEAR'
Trump blames China for hollowing out U.S. manufacturing, and says his tariffs are needed to force a change in the way Beijing does business. 
He says his measures will ultimately benefit U.S. companies and workers by not only opening up the Chinese market, but also bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. 
Thompson, who did not vote for Trump, a Republican, agreed some measures were required, but said workers at his facility were bearing the brunt of the fallout.
""There is a lot of anxiety, a lot of fear,"" he said.
The mood was different in early 2018. A nascent recovery in demand had led to healthy growth in orders for Deere's planters and combines. Harvester Works began hiring new workers, said Thompson. 
But as the trade war began taking a toll on the farm economy, Spencer said farmers started cancelling their orders. 
""We could all see the writing on the wall,"" he said. 
Deere is not alone. Rival  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), the world's largest heavy equipment maker, has decided to let go of 120 workers in Texas, for example, while United States Steel Corp has had layoffs in Michigan.
U.S. Federal Reserve reports show American factories are running way below their long-run average production levels and companies are delaying capital spending due to uncertainty over trade policy. U.S. manufacturing activity fell to a more than decade-low in September. 
Trump, however, said on Tuesday that industries had not been hurt by his administration's trade actions. 
Harvester Works is in Illinois, a heavily Democratic state. But some industrial swing states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that Trump narrowly won in 2016 are now shedding thousands of factory jobs.
These states are up for grabs in 2020. 
SWEEPING THE FLOOR
Deere's shares have gained about 2% since Trump announced a ""phase one"" trade agreement with Beijing on hopes that more agricultural sales to China would encourage farmers to resume purchases. The deal, however, is still being put to paper.
Thompson worries the agreement will not be enough to help lift demand for his factory's combines. 
Meanwhile Spencer, the welder, is now sweeping the floor of the plant.
Apart from the psychological impact of doing a less skilled job, the change has reduced his earnings by more than a third. Spencer says he can no longer afford a vacation.
When Trump first declared a war on the global trade order last year, he said: ""Trade wars are good and easy to win."" 
However, employees at Harvester Works have yet to see any positives, according to Josh Saunders, who has been moved from a higher-paying welding role to an assembly job.
The 37-year-old, who has a wife and two stepsons, is worried losing a job with one of the better employers in the area could force him to sell his house and move away.

""I don't know where this winning is coming from because we are having layoffs, and orders aren't there,"" he said.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 01:12AM ET</span>",Hong Kong's cash pool tightens as Alibaba primes for $13 billion listing,"By Noah Sin and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group's $13.4 billion Hong Kong listing is shrinking cash levels in the protest-wracked financial hub, with short-term borrowing costs shooting back towards a decade-high marked in July.
Large IPOs and share sales typically hoover up cash in Hong Kong's relatively small banking system, albeit temporarily. But market players say Alibaba's listing is having a much bigger impact, due to its blockbuster size and as five months of pro-democracy protests have resulted in recession and sown fears of capital outflows.
""Timing wise, it's not good for the liquidity to get sucked out of the system as there's a bit of capital outflow happening due to the protests,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior banker at a European bank, who asked not to be identified.
The one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) has rocketed 100 basis points this week to hit 2.75% on Thursday, not too far off a decade-high of 2.99% marked in July when protestors occupied the city's legislature. On Friday, the rate edged back to 2.71%
Those levels are much higher than other previous big share sales. One-month HIBOR was under 1.1% when South African media group Naspers sold $9.8 billion in Tencent Holdings shares in March 2018 and under 2% in the run-up to China Tower Corp's listing in August later that year.
The climb is also unusual as Hong Kong's interbank rates normally track their U.S. peers due to Hong Kong's dollar peg and those U.S. peers have been falling due to Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The one-month U.S. dollar Libor rate is 1.765%.
""In contrast with the situation in July, August, the Fed has already cut twice but local rates are driving higher still. Capital outflow concerns seem pretty severe,"" said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank.
Hong Kong may have lost as much as $4 billion in deposits to rival financial hub Singapore between June and August, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has estimated. In late October, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said there was no obvious capital outflow from its banking system.
Cheung added interbank rates could stay elevated if capital outflow concerns persisted after the Alibaba listing is wrapped up.
Hangzhou-headquartered, New York-listed Alibaba began collecting orders for its Hong Kong listing late on Wednesday and will price the deal - expected to be at a slight discount to its U.S. shares - next Wednesday.
Mackie Lau, head of investment management for treasury markets at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) in Hong Kong, said cash could be locked up for a week prior to the date on which investors are allotted their shares.
Market participants said, however, they expect one-month HIBOR to be capped near 3% and that there were a range of options for authorities and banks if cash becomes too tight.
Banks have access to the HKMA's discount window and other facilities to meet sudden shortfalls and the central bank could cut banks' capital buffer again. The HKMA cut the buffer last month by 0.5% - its first cut since the ratio was introduced in 2015.
""The money hasn't disappeared, it's still in the system. It's just changed hands from one bank to another. Rates spike because people have to scramble, not because there is no money,"" added Lau.
Cash supplies in Hong Kong have been declining steadily for years as money went into higher-yielding U.S. assets and as the HKMA defended a currency that has been at the weak end of its band for much of 2018 and 2019.
The aggregate balance, a gauge of banks' cash balances with the HKMA, is down 87% from its 2015 high of HK$426 billion."
1473,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 01:06AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why is Alibaba listing in Hong Kong?,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA) is set to price its first share sale in Hong Kong next week, raising up to $13.4 billion in what will be the largest deal in the city since 2010 and the world's biggest ever cross-border secondary listing.
WHY IS ALIBABA LISTING IN HONG KONG?
Analysts say establishing a base outside the United States gives the U.S.-listed company options, especially in the light of the U.S.-China trade dispute.
It is an ""escape valve listing"", said Travis Lundy, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors who publishes on SmartKarma.
""Investors can take delivery or buy and sell shares (in Hong Kong) should U.S.-China relations worsen. This should be considered a non-negligible benefit for any U.S.-listed Chinese company,"" he added.
Alibaba, which is due to start trading on Nov. 26 in Hong Kong, could also benefit from Chinese demand.
While it will not be eligible for trading until June in the Stock Connect that links Shanghai and Shenzhen with Hong Kong, analysts and investors expect demand from mainland mom-and-pop investors to lift its valuation.
Alibaba's Hong Kong deal is technically small versus its $476 billion market capitalization and it will dilute existing shareholder by just 2.8%, the company calculates. [nL4N27T2DL]
WHY NOT LIST IN SHANGHAI OR SHENZHEN?
Alibaba is essentially too big for its home market.
China hosts the world's No.2 pool of equity capital, but local share sales are usually much smaller than in Hong Kong.
While Alibaba holds the record for the world's biggest initial public offering, with its $25 billion New York listing in 2014 - pipping Hong Kong which hosted Agricultural Bank of China's $22 billion deal in 2010, China's biggest IPO in the past decade was the $7.3 billion float in 2009 of China State Construction Engineering Corp (SS:601668), Refinitiv data shows.
Beijing is working to help fast-growing start-ups list at home as well as lure back those that got away, including Alibaba. This year it launched the STAR Market to host innovative earlier-stage companies under a less controlled, more Nasdaq-style listing system - a first for China. [nL4N2553XV]
WHY IS IT A BIG DEAL FOR HONG KONG?
Alibaba postponed its listing plans over the summer as political protests that began in June worsened.
The company's decision to push ahead now will be seen as a vote of confidence in Hong Kong's financial future even as protests grow increasingly violent. [nL4N25H123][nL4N27U6PU]
The listing is also the culmination of six-plus years of argument, consultations and rule changes that all stemmed from Alibaba's decision in 2013 to list in New York, not Hong Kong.
That was driven by the city's refusal to ease its one-share-one-vote stance to accept Alibaba's unusual governance, where a self-selecting group of company insiders control the majority of board seats.
Many market participants felt being able to trade Alibaba alongside arch-rival Tencent (HK:0700) would have encouraged other tech companies to follow suit - rebalancing Hong Kong's reputation for hosting stodgy Chinese state-owned enterprises and local tycoon-controlled conglomerates.
Last year, bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HK:0388) pushed through rules that allowed firms to list with different classes of shares, opening a path for tech giants listed elsewhere such as Alibaba to sell shares in the city.
Alibaba is the first to do so, although others are expected to consider following the same path."

The company’s Chief Executive Officer Mike Veverka said in a phone interview with Bloomberg that Jumbo aims to triple its ticket sales by 2022. 
 
Younger people “are not really interested to buy a lottery ticket at a normal newsagent,” Veverka said. “Even some of the older demographics that are used to going into a store to buy their lottery ticket prefer to buy it online.”
 
Veverke noticed around 2005 that selling lottery tickets over the internet could be profitable, as “there wasn’t really anybody doing it.”
 
“It was something that didn’t have to be delivered physically, it was repetitive and something that the Internet really added a lot of value on,” he added.

China’s Shanghai Composite was little changed at 2,910.01. The Shenzhen Component slipped 0.1%. 
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington is “getting close” to a trade deal with Beijing. Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng confirmed that the two sides are having “deep discussions about a phase one deal,” but said rolling back some of the existing tariffs is key to reaching an agreement.
“The trade war was begun with adding tariffs, and should be ended by cancelling these additional tariffs. This is an important condition for both sides to reach an agreement,” Feng said Thursday at a weekly press conference.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.3%. Political unrest remained in focus. Overnight, the U.S. Senate brought the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act under an expedited process that would allow for quick passage for the bill. 
The bill could pass as early as next week, according to a Senate aide.
“The world witnesses the people of Hong Kong standing up every day to defend their long-cherished freedoms against an increasingly aggressive Beijing and Hong Kong government,” U.S. Senator Marco Rubio said in a statement. “Now more than ever, the United States must send a clear message to Beijing that the free world stands with Hong Kongers in their struggle.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China are getting close to a trade agreement, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday, citing what he called very constructive talks with Beijing about ending a 16-month trade war.
Kudlow said negotiators for the world's two largest economies were in close touch via telephone but he gave no further details on the timing of a possible deal.
""We're getting close,"" he told an event at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. ""The mood music is pretty good, and that has not always been so in these things.""
The United States and China have been locked in successive waves of tit-for-tat tariffs that have roiled financial markets and threaten to drag growth in the global economy to its lowest rate since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. 
Markets are anxiously awaiting an agreement to end uncertainty that has slowed business investment around the globe. An agreement had appeared likely in May, but those prospects were dashed after U.S. negotiators said China backed away from the text of a draft agreement.
Kudlow's comments could ease market concerns that flared again this week amid reports that the trade talks had hit a snag over how and when to reduce tariffs, and what level of agricultural purchases could be expected from China.
Markets also soured after U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he could impose substantial new tariffs on China if no deal was reached.
Kudlow told the audience he had just come from a meeting of the top Trump administration trade officials and was more optimistic.
""It's not done yet, but there has been very good progress and the talks have been very constructive,"" he told the event.
He also opened the door to the possibility that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would not need to meet in person to clinch a deal.
Trump had hoped to sign the ""phase one"" agreement with China on the sidelines of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile this month, but that possibility disappeared after Chile withdrew from hosting the event.
Kudlow said the White House had hoped to stick to that general timetable. He joked that his preference was for the deal to be signed in his office on the second floor of the White House.

""I don't like to travel,"" he quipped.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian equities rose on Friday after the S&P 500 index notched a new record closing high, but investor sentiment remained fragile following weak data from China and Germany, which reinforced concerns about the global economy.
Early in the Asian trading day, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.34%. Japan's Nikkei added 0.58% and Australian shares gained 0.53%.
The safe-haven yen weakened, with the dollar rising 0.11% to buy 108.50 yen. The euro was unchanged at $1.1021 and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals was flat at 98.163.
Providing a fillip to investor confidence in Asia were comments from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that Washington was getting close to a trade agreement with China.
Higher U.S. Treasury yields also indicated a slight risk-on tone in the Asian session, with the 10-year yield rising to 1.8307% from a US close of 1.815% on Thursday.
The policy-sensitive two-year yield rose to 1.6036% from 1.593% on Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of the U.S. economy facing a dramatic bust is remote.
A Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed that while concerns have eased over a U.S. recession, few see an economic rebound, and most believe a trade truce is unlikely in the coming year.
Global sentiment has been buffeted in recent weeks by conflicting assessments of progress in talks between the United States and China aimed at ending their 16-month-long trade war.
On Thursday, China's commerce ministry said that the two countries are holding ""in-depth"" discussions on a first phase trade agreement, and that cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reaching a deal.
China has also ended a nearly five-year ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat, which the U.S. Trade Representative said would lead to more than $1 billion in annual shipments to China.
Those developments followed comments from officials from both countries last week that they had a deal to roll back tariffs, only to have U.S. President Donald Trump deny that any such deal had been agreed to.
The new record for the S&P, which gained just 0.08% to 3,096.63, came despite a grim outlook from network gear maker Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) that underlined the impact of trade uncertainty.
The company forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below expectations as increasingly global economic uncertainties kept clients away from spending more on its routers and switches, sending its shares down 7.3%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.01% 27,781.96 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.04% to 8,479.02.
European shares also fell after data showed the German economy grew just 0.1% in the third quarter, with consumer spending helping the country to avoid a mild contraction.
""In further diminishing the likelihood of significant fiscal stimulus from the Berlin government, it was not good news at all,"" analysts at National Australia Bank said in a morning note.
The German data followed numbers from China indicating a faster-than-expected slowdown in factory output growth in October due to weak domestic and global demand.
In commodity markets, U.S. crude prices rebounded after sliding Thursday on rising U.S. crude inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was 0.37% higher at $56.98 a barrel.
Gold retreated from gains prompted by trade uncertainty. Spot gold was last trading at $1,466.98 per ounce, down 0.27%."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Thursday said it is contesting the Pentagon's award of an up to $10 billion cloud computing deal to  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process. 
The company filed notice last Friday that it will formally protest the decision on the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, known as JEDI. In a company-wide meeting on Thursday, Amazon Web Services' CEO Andy Jassy said it would be challenging for a U.S. agency to award a contract objectively when the president is disparaging one of the contestants, according to an Amazon spokesman.
President Donald Trump has long criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos.
The company confirmed Jassy's comments and said, ""Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias- and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified.""
The Federal Times earlier reported the news.
A challenge to the Defense Department's award announced last month was widely expected by legal experts, analysts and consultants, especially after Trump publicly derided Amazon's bid for the high-stakes contract.
Trump had said in August that Amazon's bid for the JEDI contract was under review by his administration after complaints from other companies. 
Amazon was considered a favorite for the contract, part of a broader digital modernization process of the Pentagon, before Microsoft emerged as the surprise winner.

“We have to be very, very careful,” Ma said on Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We have to solve problems, we should not create more problems.”
While a full-scale trade war might not last that long, relations could end up rocky for the next two decades, he said. Ma emphasized the importance of the two countries working together and sharing technology.
The trade dispute, which has been going on for more than a year and a half, has already ensnared more than 70% of bilateral trade in goods. If the two countries can’t resolve at least some of their differences in the coming weeks, the White House on Dec. 15 will add 15% punitive tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese imports. China-based Alibaba, one of Asia’s biggest companies, is expected to ride out the storm better than some, thanks to booming online consumption in the world’s No. 2 economy. But Alibaba saw its stock dip earlier this fall on reports that the Trump administration was weighing a limit on U.S. government pension funds buying Chinese stocks.
The internet giant listed shares in New York in 2014, in the biggest ever initial public offering. It’s now readying a share sale in Hong Kong that could raise almost $12 billion. Ma sees the listing as a way to curry favor with Beijing while hedging against trade war risks."

(Reuters) - WeWork's junk bond price dropped and its risk premium shot to a record high on Thursday following a report that its main backer still hasn't delivered on a plan to buy $3 billion of stock from existing shareholders.
The Real Deal, citing anonymous sources, said Japan's SoftBank Corp has yet to commence the tender offer that was part of a $9.5 billion rescue package for the money-losing shared-office operator.
An investor who requested anonymity confirmed to Reuters that there have been delays, but he had no more details. 
""(The delays) will likely be resolved,"" the investor said in a text, asking not to be named because the discussions between investors and SoftBank were confidential. ""Lots of anxiety."" 
The We Company, owner of WeWork, told bondholders on Wednesday net losses in the third quarter more than doubled to $1.25 billion as it added a record number of desks to its global network but was unable to control rising costs.
SoftBank agreed in October to the rescue package that would result in it owning almost 78% of WeWork if the tender were fully subscribed, according to a presentation to bondholders reviewed by Reuters.
The tender was supposed to have begun five business days after an initial payment of $1.5 billion to WeWork was in place, The Real Deal said, citing a letter from SoftBank to WeWork investors. The payment was made on Oct. 30, but sources told the publication that no tender offer has been extended.
WeWork's 7.875% note due in May 2025 fell 2.25 cents on the dollar to a bid of 74 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
The bond now yields a record 15.02% and its spread, a measure of the premium investors demand for the added risk of holding WeWork's bond rather than safer securities like U.S. Treasury debt, widened to a record 13.40 percentage points.
Losses have widened at WeWork as costs have outpaced the company's breakneck expansion, which new management aims to curb after a disastrous effort to go public was shelved in September.

A pipeline of existing leasing commitments suggests WeWork's rapid growth will likely continue into 2020.

1. Data Deluge With Retail Sales, Industrial Output, Empire Manufacturing
Spending, Spending, Spending. The domestic consumer's liberal approach to consumption has kept the U.S. economy ahead of its rivals. With the holidays nearing, many will look to the latest retail sales numbers for a check on the health of shoppers.
The Commerce Department will release the numbers at 8:30 AM ET (13:50 GMT).
On average, economists expect that retail sales rose 0.2% last month and that core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, climbed 0.4%. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – is expected to have risen 0.3%.
New York manufacturing activity meanwhile is forecast to inch higher to a reading of 5 in November from 4 last month.
U.S. industrial output due at 9:15 AM ET (14:15 GMT), meanwhile, is expected to decline 0.4% as productivity has come under pressure from the ongoing U.S.-China trade battles.
2. Rig Counts on Tap
Baker Hughes releases its weekly installment of drilling activity on Friday, a day after the U.S. Energy Department said crude production rose to a record high of 12.8 million barrels a day for the week ended Nov. 2.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US fell by 7 to 684. That's also down nearly 23% from a year ago.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 0.6% lower at $56.77 a barrel in the wake of data showing U.S. crude supplies continued to climb, rising 2.2 million barrels last week, above forecasts for a 1.65-million-barrel build.
Sentiment on crude futures has turned more positive in recent sessions after OPEC cut its forecast for overall U.S. oil output owing to a slowdown in shale oil production.
3. China Stocks on Watch as JD.Com Reports
Just a week after rival   Alibaba   (NYSE:BABA) topped quarterly earnings estimates, JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) will report third-quarter earnings before markets open.
Its online retail business is expected to lead growth despite a slowdown in China’s e-commerce industry and wider tech sector.
In an attempt to ease the risks of a slowing market, the Chinese e-commerce giant has attempted to diversify beyond online shopping. It has not only branched out into businesses like convenience stores and supermarkets but areas, beyond the mainland.

1485,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 14, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Stocks: Another Act of 'Waiting for China' Leaves S&P Flat,"Investing.com - Investors spent Thursday hoping for a catalyst to push stocks higher – and didn't get one.
While the S&P 500 did reach a new closing high at just under 3,097, it came with no drama. The other major indexes struggled as well.
The S&P 500 rose 2.6 points, or 0.08%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was very nearly flat for the second time in three days. It was off 1.6 points or 0.01%. On Tuesday, the index finished unchanged on the day, its first unchanged day since April 24, 2014.
 The Nasdaq Composite and the Nasdaq 100 indexes fell 0.04% and 0.02%, respectively.
The catalyst investors, traders and their computers want is a trade deal with China. It didn't happen Thursday. And no one in the Trump Administration or the government of Xi Jinping in China was signaling any clarity on when an agreement will come.
The critical issues right now appear to be how much China will spend on U.S. farm products and when and how tariffs imposed earlier this year and possibly boosted next month will be rescinded.
Instead, investors had to deal with disappointing guidance from Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and a downgrade on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose stock hit an all-time intraday high of $264.68 before pulling back. Cisco, down 7.3%, was the weakest performer in the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) moved 1.36% higher, good for nearly 34 Dow points on an upgrade from Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard. Stallard raised his price target on the stock to $400. But there was a caveat: The 737 Max has to start flying again.
After the close, shares of RH (NYSE:RH), the corporate name of home-furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware, jumped 6.7% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) disclosed it has bought 1.2 million shares in the company. Berkshire Hathaway also bought nearly 7.5 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Occidental shares rose 1.6% after hours.
Boeing shares are off 3.4% this quarter, but are still up nearly 14% on the year.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) hit an all-time high after fiscal third-quarter results were stronger than expected, but the shares fell back 0.3% on apparent profit-taking.
Seven of 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by real estate and materials stocks, reflecting lower interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.819% from Wednesday's 1.869%.
Gold  jumped $10.10 to $1,473.40 an ounce in New York, attracting investor capital looking for safe havens.
Energy was the weakest sector, reflecting lower oil prices.
West Texas Intermediate crude fell 35 cents to $56.77 a barrel. Brent  crude, the global benchmark, was off 9 cents to $62.28. Prices dropped after the Energy Information Administration reported a larger-than-expected gain in domestic oil stocks.
Software company DXC Technology (NYSE:DXC), data-storage maker NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), fertilizer maker Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and personal computer maker HP (NYSE:HPQ) were among the top S&P 500 stocks. 
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), food giant Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), utility giant CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) were among the biggest S&P 500 laggards.

1486,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 14, 2019 04:53PM ET</span>",U.S. Farm Finances Worsen Despite Trump Trade War Aid,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
Farm finances deteriorated across a swath of agricultural states during the summer and early fall despite the Trump administration’s second round of trade aid payments and slightly higher prices, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reported Thursday.
The report underscores the mounting economic pressure on a key Donald Trump constituency as he confronts a re-election campaign and impeachment struggle while undertaking negotiations with Beijing on a partial trade deal that could provide relief from retaliatory tariffs hitting American farmers. The trade talks have bogged down as Trump seeks assurances that Beijing will deliver on commitments on agricultural purchases.
Farm income fell in the third quarter from a year ago in each of the seven rural states covered by the Kansas City Fed, according to its survey of agricultural credit conditions. The report cited the trade war, volatile crop prices and disruptions at a major beef processing facility.
Bankers contacted by the Fed said the drop in farm income was sharper than they expected going into the summer. Respondents expect income to decline further and credit conditions to worsen in the coming months despite trade aid payments. The USDA started issuing payments from its 2019 trade aid program in August.
“Extreme weather conditions and commodity prices continue to adversely effect the financial condition of our producers,” said one banker quoted in the report, identified only as located in Central Nebraska. “These conditions are potentially setting up a difficult renewal season this fall” for loans.
Farmers have responded by cutting back on spending and equipment purchases to preserve cash. Even so, their working capital deteriorated “at a modest pace,” according to the Fed.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which covers five Midwestern states, also reported Thursday that farm credit conditions “slid yet again” in the third quarter. Bankers participating in the Chicago Fed regional survey also said they expected crop net cash earnings to drop in the fall and winter from levels a year earlier.
Farmland values in the Chicago region declined 1% from a year earlier, the bank reported. The Kansas City Fed reported “stable” farmland values in its region.
Other indicators also show rising financial stress. U.S. farm bankruptcies in the 12 months through September rose 24% from the same year-ago period to the highest since 2011, according to a report by the American Farm Bureau Federation. That report also highlighted farmers’ and ranchers’ growing dependence on government financial help.
Almost 40% of projected farm profit this year will come from trade aid, disaster assistance, federal subsidies and insurance payments, according to the report, which is based on Department of Agriculture forecasts. That’s $33 billion of a projected $88 billion in net income.

1487,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 14, 2019 04:51PM ET</span>","T. Rowe, Fidelity Score Green Light for ETFs That Hide Holdings","(Bloomberg) -- Regulators are on track to approve four new flavors of exchange-traded funds that keep their holdings secret, notching a win for active managers.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it plans to approve active non-transparent ETFs from T. Rowe Price, Natixis, Fidelity and Blue Tractor, according to filings on Thursday. The funds will reveal their holdings at least once a quarter, rather than disclosing their portfolios every day like conventional ETFs.
The regulator is warming to the concealed holdings approach, after more than 10 years of considering the concept. Active managers say that inserting their strategies into a transparent ETF format would give away their best investment ideas and expose them to front-running. Still, they have been looking for a way to participate in the boom that ETFs enjoyed over the past decade.
Fund managers see the active non-transparent model as an entry point into the $4.2 trillion U.S. ETF market. But it remains unclear whether retail investors will adopt the model over traditional ETFs that keep their holdings public.
“It’s a big regulatory win, but now comes the hard part: trying to attract assets in an utterly brutal marketplace where nearly every cent goes into products charging 0.2% or less,” said Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Read: Stock Pickers Love ETFs That Hide Assets, But Investors May Not
All four firms plan to follow a so-called proxy-basket approach, meaning they will disclose some information about their holdings every day to help market makers price their funds, just not their full portfolio.
Precidian Investments already has approval for an alternative structure that requires funds to publish an indicative value of the holdings every second. This model also uses an agency broker to confidentially buy and sell securities to help money flow into or out of the fund.
New York Life’s IndexIQ, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and American Century Investments are among the firms that have licensed Precidian’s model."

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2019 04:25PM ET</span>",U.S. charges two former Herbalife executives in China over bribery scheme: source,"By Jonathan Stempel and Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors criminally charged two former executives of  Herbalife  Nutrition Ltd's (N:HLF) Chinese unit with running a decade-long scheme to bribe Chinese government officials to win business and evade regulatory scrutiny, a person familiar with the matter said.
Herbalife was not criminally charged, and the multi-level marketing company was not identified by name in Thursday's indictment against Yanliang Li, also known as Jerry Li, and Hongwei Yang, also known as Mary Yang. The person familiar said Herbalife was their employer.
Li, the former head of Herbalife's Chinese unit, and Yang, who led its external affairs department and reported to Li, were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by orchestrating the bribes and circumventing Herbalife's accounting controls.
Prosecutors also charged Li with perjury for lying under oath when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission questioned him about the alleged bribes, and for destroying evidence.
Both defendants are 51-year-old Chinese citizens and remain at large. The SEC filed related civil charges against Li.
Lawyers for the defendants could not immediately be identified. Herbalife did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The charges were announced six weeks after Herbalife agreed to pay $20 million to settle SEC civil charges that it misled investors from 2012 to 2018 about how its Chinese business operated, without admitting wrongdoing. 
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said Li and Yang approved ""extensive and systematic payments of bribes"" to Chinese government officials from roughly 2007 to 2017.
Authorities said the bribes included cash, entertainment, meals and travel, and Yang's department reimbursed employees more than $25 million for entertaining and gift-giving.
The bribes were intended to help Los Angeles-based Herbalife obtain direct selling licenses, reduce government scrutiny of its Chinese operations, and suppress negative coverage by state-controlled media, authorities said.
By 2016, China accounted for 19%, or $869 million, of Herbalife's $4.49 billion of net sales, up from 7% in 2006, regulatory filings show.
The $20 million SEC accord resolved charges that Herbalife told investors it paid distributors in China differently from distributors elsewhere, because the multi-level marketing it normally uses is illegal in that country, when in fact the compensation methods were similar.
William Ackman, the hedge fund manager, made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife starting in 2012, and accused the company of being a pyramid scheme, which it denied. He later unwound his position as Herbalife's stock price kept rising.
Herbalife shares were down 30 cents, or 0.7%, at $43.50.

The criminal case is U.S. v. Li et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-cr-00760. The SEC case is SEC v. Li in the same court, No. 19-10562.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) ""cannot be trusted,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said, labeling the Chinese firms a security threat as he backed a proposal to bar U.S. rural wireless carriers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment or services from them.
The Federal Communications Commission will vote on Nov. 22 and is proposing requiring the carriers to remove and replace equipment from the companies. Barr said in a letter to the FCC released on Thursday that ""their own track record, as well as the practices of the Chinese government, demonstrate that Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted."" 
He added that ""we should not signal that Huawei and ZTE are anything other than a threat to our collective security, for that is exactly what they, through their actions, have shown themselves to be."" 
Huawei and ZTE did not immediately comment.
Barr noted that federal prosecutors charged Huawei with violations of the U.S. embargo on Iran, bank fraud, obstruction of justice and trade secret theft. ZTE pleaded guilty in 2017 to illegally sending approximately $32 million in U.S. goods to Iran.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the commission ""cannot ignore the risk that the Chinese government will seek to exploit network vulnerabilities in order to engage in espionage, insert malware and viruses, and otherwise compromise our critical communications networks.""
The move is the latest U.S. action aimed at barring U.S. companies from purchasing Huawei and ZTE equipment. Huawei said last week that ""in 30 years of business, Huawei has never had a major security-related incident in the 170 countries where we operate.""
The U.S. government added Huawei to its economic blacklist in May, saying the Chinese company was involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security.
The United States has pressed nations not to grant Huawei access to 5G networks and alleged Huawei’s equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese company has repeatedly denied. Several European countries in recent months have not agreed to bar Huawei, despite U.S. pressure.
In May, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The order directed the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October. The Commerce Department has yet to publish a plan.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - The European Cockpit Association (ECA) pilot group has urged regulators to take action over what it described as a ""safety hazard"" caused by Ryanair's (I:RYA) approach to flight crews' sick leave, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Europe's largest budget carrier has spent the last two years negotiating improved pay and conditions with its pilots and cabin crew after a revolt by some staff forced it to recognize trade unions for the first time.
The ECA, which represents pilots' associations in 33 European countries, said Ryanair adopts a practice of systematically questioning absences due to certified sickness, leading to investigative and disciplinary meetings where staff are threatened with potential dismissal.
Asked about the ECA's concerns, a Ryanair spokeswoman said the airline operates ""a standard sick pay scheme, and like all employers, manages absenteeisms"".
The airline, which has never had a fatal crash and has one of the youngest fleets in Europe, regularly cites safety as its top priority.
The ECA said it raised the issue with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) a year ago but that Ryanair's ""problematic approach"" to flight crew's sickness has not substantially changed.
""In fact, we are concerned that the safety hazard created by this approach remains fully in place, must be considered endemic, and quite evidently is not adequately addressed by the competent national authority: the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA),"" the letter dated Nov. 5 said.
A spokeswoman for the ECA confirmed it had sent such a letter to the regulator, the second in a year, and that it was concerned that the safety hazard related to Ryanair's policy remains unaddressed.
In the letter, the ECA said it was aware that the EASA raised the matter with the IAA following the initial complaint but that the Irish regulator told one of the ECA's member groups that it was satisfied there was not a systematic issue of crews flying while unfit due to fear of sanction at Ryanair.
The IAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Citing letters sent to staff, the ECA said Ryanair or broker agencies overseeing agency workers used by the airline have gone as far as threatening to halt pilots' career progression, due to their sickness rate.
The pilot group called on the European regulator to ensure the IAA adequately fulfils its safety oversight role by summoning Ryanair to stop the practice of intimidating letters and investigative proceedings and also carry out an independent confidential survey among Ryanair crew."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lloyd Blankfein, a former Goldman Sachs (N:GS) chief executive, criticized Elizabeth Warren for engaging in the ""vilification"" of billionaires on Thursday and said that ""maybe tribalism is just in her DNA,"" after he appeared in the presidential candidate's latest ad on taxing the super rich.
Warren, a Democratic U.S. senator from Massachusetts, aired a television ad on Thursday about her proposed 2% tax on wealth beyond $50 million. In it, Blankfein is shown with a caption saying he ""earned $70 million during the financial crisis.""
The ad also shows a clip of Leon Cooperman, the chairman and chief executive of investment advisory firm Omega Advisors, saying the ""vilification of billionaires"" is ""bull,"" along with the fact he was charged with insider trading. Venture capitalist and Republican donor Peter Thiel also appears in the ad, saying he is ""most scared by Elizabeth Warren.""
""Surprised to be featured in Sen Warren's campaign ad, given the many severe critics she has out there. Not my candidate, but we align on many issues,"" Blankfein, now a senior chairman at Goldman, wrote in response on Twitter.
""Vilification of people as a member of a group may be good for her campaign, not the country. Maybe tribalism is just in her DNA.""
Blankfein, who supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016, could not immediately be reached to comment on Warren's ad or his tweet.
President Donald Trump has criticized Warren for saying she was of Native American heritage, dubbing her ""Pochahontas"" ahead of her presidential bid and calling for her to take a DNA test. Warren did, and it showed Native American ancestry dating back multiple generations. She has since apologized to Native American leaders for the ancestry claims.
Blankfein is the latest billionaire to publicly clash with the progressive candidate, who has built her campaign on combating Washington corruption and ensuring the wealthy pay their fair share.
She has proposed a host of policies such as universal childcare, free public college tuition that she would finance with her wealth tax, along with an expansion of it to partially pay for Medicare for All healthcare.
Cooperman has appeared on television news programs to vociferously criticize Warren's policies, calling her rhetoric about billionaires ""disgraceful.""
On Thursday, Cooperman responded to Warren's ad on CNBC, defending his philanthropy, saying he had settled the insider-trading charges without admitting guilt and accusing Warren of ""firing off snarky tweets that stir your base at the expense of accuracy.""
Warren's campaign now sells a ""Billionaire Tears Mug"" inspired by one of Cooperman's television appearances. ""Savor a warm, slightly salty beverage of your choice in this union-made mug as you contemplate all the good a wealth tax could do,"" reads the campaign's website.
""Every time Elizabeth Warren pisses off a billionaire, we get a whole new crop of volunteer leaders. It's campaign magic,"" Warren staffer Suzy Smith wrote on Twitter after Cooperman's prior criticism.
Blankfein, 64, led Goldman, a U.S. investment bank, from 2006 to the autumn of 2018, and is largely credited with helping keep the company afloat during the financial crisis with an early decision to rein in exposure to risky mortgage-backed securities.
However, the bank was highly criticized for its role in the crisis and for paying out billions of dollars in bonuses to top staffers during the years surrounding the crisis.
Born in the South Bronx and raised in a predominantly Jewish housing project in Brooklyn's East New York neighborhood, Blankfein's rags-to-riches story is well known in the world of finance.
Warren's campaign did not immediately respond to Blankfein's tweet."

PARIS/LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European investment firm Eurazeo (PA:EURA) is exploring a partial or full sale of its near 30% stake in Europcar Mobility Group (PA:EUCAR) as it seeks to cash out from the troubled French car rental company, sources told Reuters.
Europcar's shares have sunk 65% over the past 12 months as the firm grappled with weak leisure demand from British tourists, declining rental volumes in the business-to-business segment and a softening economic environment in Europe.
Eurazeo has tapped JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to handle the sale, which was triggered by a series of approaches made by financial investors in recent weeks, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and Eurazeo may decide to keep at least part of its stake, they said.
Eurazeo said in a statement it was reviewing strategic options for the company following the Reuters report.
Europcar and JPMorgan both declined to comment.
The business, advised by  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Rothschild, is saddled with 851 million euros of net debt as of September.
In October it revised its full year guidance saying it expected 2019 core earnings of 275 to 285 million euros, after net profit dropped 32% in the first nine months of the year while adjusted core earnings were down 13.5% in the same period.
Several private equity firms have been monitoring the company's poor performance and approached Eurazeo in October, the sources said, betting on the turnaround potential of the 70-year old company.
Eurazeo is wary of selling at a discount and would retain at least part of its stake if it couldn't negotiate an attractive price, one of the sources said.
Some of the bidders may also consider bidding for the whole company as this would allow them to delist the business and turn it around away from the public markets, some of the sources said, cautioning that no deal was certain.
Any buyer crossing the 30% threshold will need to submit a mandatory offer for the whole company, according to French capital markets rules.
BREXIT IMPACT
A former unit of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Europcar was bought by Eurazeo in 2006 and subsequently listed on France's Euronext in 2015.
The business, based on the outskirts of Paris, has grown significantly under Eurazeo's ownership expanding in 140 countries around the world and employing more than 8,900 people.
Yet its core European business has started to slow down, partly due to Britain's decision to leave the EU that has deterred British tourists from traveling abroad.
Europcar boss Caroline Parot has looked at growth overseas, trying to crack the U.S. market with the purchase of Fox-Rent-A-Car while also investing heavily in upgrading the company's digital platform."

1499,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 14, 2019 01:12PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Apple Drifts Lower on Rare Sell Rating,"Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell on Thursday after one Wall Street analyst suggested the stock may be running too hot, slapping a sell rating on the tech giant on expectations that sales of its latest slate of iPhones will come up short. 
Maxim Group downgraded its rating on Apple to sell from hold, with a price target of $190. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell about 0.5% to around $263. 
Citing analysis of a propriety survey, Maxim said it expects iPhone revenue to come in 14% below consensus in fiscal second quarter of 2020 and 6% below for the full year, with overall iPhone revenue down 5% for the year. 
Against the backdrop of falling iPhone sales, some have suggested that the company's higher-margin services business would plug the gap. 
But Maxim disagrees, forecasting that Apple’s operating profits will fall 2% year over year as ongoing growth in services and wearables will only partially offset iPhone declines.
In its most recent quarter, however, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has shown there is life beyond the iPhone. 
Wearables and services helped drive revenue up 1.8% in the September quarter, offsetting a 9.2% decline in iPhone sales. 
Still, many on Wall Street are betting the tech giant will revive iPhone sales with the launch of a 5G-enabled smartphone touted for late next year. 
Bloomberg reported recently that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) expects iPhone sales to return to growth next year after the launch of 5G-enabled phones. The iPhone maker plans to ship 200 million phones in 2020, the report said."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Model 3 and S sedans both regained ""recommended"" status in Consumer Reports magazine's annual reliability survey, allowing the electric carmaker's overall standing to rise slightly.
Tesla's ranking improved four spots to No. 23 out of 30 brands in the U.S. market as it worked to resolve production problems with the Model 3, said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. Both the Model 3 and S raised their reliability ratings to ""average.""
""People really like their cars,"" he said of Tesla owners. ""Hopefully, if that frantic rate of change can slow down a bit, they can maintain reliability.""
Tesla has touted the popularity of the Model S, listed in the top ranks of a different Consumer Reports survey, on owner satisfaction, every year since 2013 when the carmaker was first included.
Fisher cautioned he expected Tesla's reliability to remain fluid given its inconsistent track record.
Tesla's Model X SUV still ranks among the least reliable models, according to the annual survey released on Thursday.(CR.org/reliability)
The poll predicts which new cars will give owners fewer or more problems, based on data collected for more than 400,000 vehicles. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.
Reliability rankings tend to suffer when automakers offer new or redesigned models, which dragged down Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) namesake and Audi brands. The VW brand slid nine spots to No. 27, while Audi fell seven spots to No. 14.
Brands with no major changes to their lineups, such as  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles' (MI:FCHA) Dodge and Chrysler, made significant gains. Dodge was the highest ranked U.S. brand at No. 8, making the biggest gain of 13 spots. Chrysler rose seven spots to No. 19, while Jeep finished at No. 26.
Ford Motor Co's (N:F) Lincoln and Ford brands were No. 15 and 16, while General Motors Co's (N:GM) Buick, GMC, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands ranked No. 18, 22, 25 and last at 30, respectively.
The reliability of full-sized pickups, the most popular vehicles in the U.S. market, was weak. Ford's F-150 and FCA's Ram trucks were rated ""well below average,"" while GM's pickups - the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra - both had ""below average"" reliability.
Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) Lexus luxury brand finished atop the survey, followed by Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) and the Toyota brand."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former head of subprime trading at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) will pay a $500,000 civil fine to resolve charges he misled investors about the quality of loans backing $1.42 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) issued before the 2008 financial crisis.
The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday announced the settlement with Paul Mangione, who was also a former Deutsche Bank managing director, who did not admit wrongdoing. Settlement papers were filed with the federal court in Brooklyn, New York.
Mangione was accused of understating the risks of loans backing two securities offerings, ACE 2007-HE4 and ACE 2007-HE5, in April 2007 and June 2007, including borrowers' ability to repay and whether the loans were underwritten properly.
More than half the loans were made by Deutsche Bank's DB Home Lending unit, then known as Chapel Funding.
Mangione had been charged in September 2017 with mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.
The charges were announced eight months after Deutsche Bank reached a $7.2 billion settlement, including a $3.1 billion civil fine, with the U.S. government, and admitted to misleading investors about RMBS it sold.
Other banks have reached similar settlements. U.S. authorities have long faced criticism that they have not held enough individuals accountable for RMBS failures.
Mangione joined Deutsche Bank in 2000 after six years at  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN). His lawyer, Patrick Smith, said Mangione settled so he could devote his time and energy elsewhere.
""Mr. Mangione did nothing wrong during his time at Deutsche Bank,"" Smith said in a statement. ""He acted in good faith in performing his customary job functions as a whole loan trader at Deutsche Bank. Mr. Mangione was not responsible for Deutsche Bank's RMBS practices and disclosures to investors, which were at the core of the government's claims against him."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) raised its annual outlook on Thursday as a robust economy boosted purchases at its stores and website and the retailer picked up market share in food and other groceries, earning praise from U.S. President Donald Trump. 
The world's largest retailer posted better-than-expected earnings, comparable sales and e-commerce growth in its largest market during the third quarter. It has now posted a more than five-year streak of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retail chain.
Walmart's shares were up 1% in mid-morning trade, and helped lift other retailers, including  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Macy's Inc (N:M).
Trump used Walmart's performance to say U.S. tariffs, imposed by his administration on imports from China, have had little impact on consumers.
""Walmart announces great numbers. No impact from Tariffs (which are contributing $Billions to our Treasury)...,"" Trump said in a tweet.
Consumer spending going in to the crucial holiday season remains healthy, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Retailers earn a sizeable chunk of their annual revenue during November and December.
""The consumer remains in pretty good shape, employment situation is good, fuel prices are low … wage growth is pretty good,"" he said. 
Walmart has also managed to minimize the impact from U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, Biggs said. ""I think we've muted the impact (of tariffs) pretty well up to this point.""
The retailer gets 56% of its revenue from food and grocery sales, which allows it to manage the pressure from tariffs better than many rivals, analysts said.
Earlier this week, Trump dangled the prospect of completing an initial trade deal with China ""soon,"" but offered no new details on negotiations.
In October, Walmart said its chief executive for U.S. operations, Greg Foran, who was credited for turning around the business, will leave the company and be replaced by the head of its Sam's Club warehouse chain unit, John Furner.
The U.S. business has ""a lot of momentum,"" Furner, who took charge on Nov. 1, told reporters. His priority is to maintain that pace until the end of the holiday season, he added.
The company is focused on spreading out sales during this year's compressed holiday season, instead of focusing on a few big days, executives said.
Online sales rose 41%, higher than the previous quarter's increase of 37 pct and greater than the company's expectation of 35%. 
""Our strength is being driven by food, which is good, but we need even more progress on Walmart.com with general merchandise,"" CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. 
Food typically has lower margins and does not drive online profitability, which has continued to suffer for the retailer.
Operating income fell 5.4 percent to $4.7 billion as a result of ongoing investments in e-commerce including faster delivery.
Losses at the U.S. e-commerce business could rise to about $1.7 billion this year from $1.4 billion in 2018, according to estimates from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore said improving operating profitability is a key area of focus for the company.
Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3.2%, excluding fuel, in the quarter ended Oct.31. Analysts estimated growth of 2.9%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.16 per share, beating expectations of $1.09 per share.
Walmart forecast earnings per share, including the impact from its acquisition of Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart, to increase ""slightly"" from a year ago. 
Total revenue rose 2.5 percent to $128 billion.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2019 10:38AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo former interim CEO Parker steps down as general counsel,"By Bharath ManjeshR and Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said on Thursday general counsel Allen Parker, who briefly served as interim chief executive of the scandal-hit U.S bank, will step down next year.
The departure, effective March 2020, comes at a time when Charles Scharf is beginning to put his own mark on the bank’s leadership team. Last week, the fourth-largest U.S. bank hired former  JP Morgan Chase  (N:JPM) executive and previous White House official, William Daley, to head public affairs.
The appointment of Daley, a former Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) executive, was an early sign that Scharf might bring in more of his long-time lieutenants.
Parker, who has focused on cleaning up existing issues and preventing them from spreading during his time at Wells, had earlier signaled that he had no plans to leave, and reiterated his desire to stay on when Scharf became CEO in late October.
""As interim CEO, Allen often spoke of the need for everyone at Wells Fargo to conduct our business with the highest levels of integrity,"" Scharf told bank employees in a memo.
Parker joined Wells as general counsel in March 2017, served as interim CEO and president from March 2019 to October 2019, and then returned to the general counsel role. 
In September, the Wall Street bank named Scharf as its next leader, after a wide-ranging sales practices scandal claimed two CEOs. 
Parker was thrust into the top position when former CEO Tim Sloan retired, saying pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank.
At one point, some analysts and people within the bank believed Parker should take on the role permanently. However, regulators were keen on Wells Fargo appointing an outsider to clean up its operations with a fresh perspective.
Parker joined the bank as general counsel from law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he was partner in charge of managing the firms operations.
Through his work at the firm defending high-profile clients like former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, he also developed relationships in Washington that were helpful while navigating Wells Fargo's regulatory problems.
After becoming interim CEO, Parker made one of his priorities settling regulatory probes from agencies including the U.S. Department of Justice. 

Wells Fargo said it would start a search for Parker's replacement immediately.

Amazon said last month it would eliminate its grocery delivery charge for Prime members in the United States and make shopping easier by combining AmazonFresh and Whole Foods Market ordering on a single site, as it battles rival grocery sellers.
On Thursday, Amazon said it would cut the monthly membership fee for fresh deliveries in Germany to 7.99 euros ($8.80) from 9.99 euros and also reduce the additional delivery fee for orders worth less than 40 euros to 3.99 euros from a previous 5.99 euros.
It is also allowing Prime members to pay 5.99 euros per delivery without having to sign up for separate Fresh membership and is offering a 20 euro discount for new customers who spend above 60 euros and discounts for the first five orders.
Amazon last month forecast revenue and profit below Wall Street's expectations, amid surging costs related to its drive to speed up shipping times around the world.
 Deutsche Post  DHL (DE:DPWGn) said in August it would no longer deliver fresh food in Germany for Amazon as the market for food ecommerce had been disappointing.

(NYSE:UBER) just days after disposing of a fifth of his stake, bringing the total offloaded to $711 million this month.
The 43-year-old entrepreneur sold $164 million of his holdings in the ride-hailing company this week, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. Last week he disposed of stock worth about $547 million.
The sale underlines Kalanick’s focus on other investments, including CloudKitchens, which he funded with $300 million. A $400 million injection from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund valued the food startup at $5 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.
His remaining 4.2% stake in Uber is valued at $1.9 billion, or less than two-thirds of his $3.4 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. When he was Uber’s chief executive officer, Kalanick said he retained all his shares in the company. That changed after his ousting in 2017. He sold stock in private transactions and had a 6% stake at the time of its May initial public offering.
Kalanick has moved quickly to offload Uber shares since the IPO. This month’s trades came after a 180-day lockup period restricting insider and early investor sales expired last week.
Uber shares fell 3.9% on Nov. 6 when its lockup expired. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc. has done even worse, falling 22% since its lockup ended. Shares in Avantor Inc., Fastly Inc. and Luckin Coffee Inc. all rose Wednesday when their restrictions were lifted."

Burberry said it will open a so-called ""social retail"" store in Shenzhen in China's technology hub powered by Tencent technology in the first half of next year that will blend retail and social media to create digital and physical spaces aimed at attracting customers.
Few other details were given.
But with its popular Wechat Pay online payment platform and Weibo's vast social media clout in one of the world's largest luxury goods market, Tencent offers Burberry a one-stop shop for marketing and selling its products online and in stores. Tencent's Wechat is China's dominant chat app.
""Social media is becoming such an important part of the luxury customer journey, particularly in the inspiration phase, and retail needs to keep pace with this,"" Burberry Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti said in a statement.
""China was the obvious place to start as it is one of the leading hubs for innovation and technology and Chinese consumers are some of the highest users of social media.""
Shenzhen is the neighboring city to Hong Kong on China's mainland where sales are suffering as months of protests have forced retailers to close stores.
The move also comes as more well-off Chinese consumers are buying at home, deterred from overseas shopping trips due to the weaker yuan.
Burberry, known for its traditional tartan pattern, posted double-digit declines in Hong Kong sales in its latest earnings released on Thursday although the popularity of collections by designer Riccardo Tisci boosted overall sales.
Chinese retail giants like  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and JD.com (O:JD) have also upped the ante in their battle for relevance in the lucrative luxury goods market with the launch of luxury sites in mid-2017 that boast labels such as  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn)."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Alibaba's Hong Kong listing will not only land it $13.4 billion, it will also garner goodwill from Beijing to help the Chinese e-commerce giant weather the fallout of a damaging trade war.
The share sale, set to be Hong Kong's largest in more than nine years, comes as Beijing seeks support from businesses and entrepreneurs in the face of anti-government protests there.
""Beijing has long wanted China's tech champions to list closer to home,"" Mark Natkin, managing director at Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting, said of Alibaba's plans.
""Especially now, after months of protests in Hong Kong, leaders will greatly appreciate the sense of solidarity and stability the listing brings,"" Natkin added.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) had originally considered a Hong Kong IPO in 2013, but ultimately chose New York after failing to gain approval from Hong Kong regulators for its unusual governance structure.
Alibaba's plan to dual list in Hong Kong from Nov. 26 is set to be the biggest cross-border secondary offering.
It comes as China's e-commerce industry is slowing, with Alibaba's annual Singles' Day shopping blitz recording its weakest sales growth since its 2009 debut, and Hong Kong's business district paralyzed by demonstrations.
""The listing reflects politics more than business strategy,"" said Brock Silvers, managing director at Hong Kong-based Adamas Asset Management, adding the trade war was an ""added incentive"".
Alibaba has found itself in Washington's crosshairs after a U.S. government panel last year blocked on national security grounds its plan to acquire MoneyGram International Inc.
In June, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill that would force U.S.-listed Chinese companies to allow third-party regulators unrestricted access to auditing reports, something Beijing has long resisted, citing national security.
And in September, there were reports that U.S. President Donald Trump was considering forced de-listing of U.S.-listed Chinese companies on similar grounds.
""Trump has threatened to restrict China's access to U.S. capital markets, and Alibaba's Hong Kong listing could help blunt that leverage,"" said Silvers.
Alibaba declined to comment.
'RICH ALIBABA ECONOMY'
Staying closer to home could help the $475 billion retailer boost its valuation.
""Investors in the Hong Kong stock market are less influenced by the political atmosphere and have a more objective view of the richness of the Alibaba economy,"" a former Alibaba senior executive, who declined to be named, said.
While its 17.1% operating profit margin and over 50% revenue growth rate are the envy of many Western retailers in mature economies, Alibaba trades at a deep discount to them.
It trades at just 25 times forecast earnings, compared to 85 times for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), even though the U.S. firm's margin is just 4.5% and revenue growth around 30%, Refinitiv data shows.
Alibaba's plan to expand beyond its core e-commerce to cloud, entertainment and artificial intelligence will help reduce some of the gap with the $869 billion giant.
Alibaba said in a filing it would use the Hong Kong proceeds to invest in food delivery services, video streaming platforms, cloud computing and machine learning.
The overwhelming majority of Alibaba's revenue comes from advertisements and related services it offers on its e-commerce sites, but growth from this revenue stream has steadily slowed.
It sits on a $33 billion cash pile and the share sale will boost its coffers above Amazon's $43 billion, sharply enhancing its financial firepower for expansion into new sectors.
This extra ammunition can be used against Beijing-based Meituan Dianping in the food delivery sector, as well as Tencent Holdings Inc and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) in artificial intelligence and the cloud.
""While the added access to capital should prove to be extremely useful, it isn't a necessity,"" Silvers said."

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has dropped U.K. security firm G4S Plc (LON:GFS) from its portfolio, citing abuses of migrant-worker rights in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
The central bank in Oslo, which manages the $1.1 trillion fund, said it took the step “due to unacceptable risk that the company contributes to or is responsible for serious or systematic human rights violations,” according to a statement on Thursday.
Shares in G4S dropped as much as 3.7% in London trading. The fund held a 2.33% stake in G4S at the end of 2018, valued at the time at about $91 million. The fund’s policy is to sell shares in a company before an exclusion announcement is made.
G4S couldn’t immediately comment, but said it was preparing a statement.
The decision to exclude G4S follows a recommendation from Norway’s Council of Ethics, which said it had assessed the company’s operations in the two Gulf countries, where it employs about 18,000 migrant workers from countries including India, Pakistan and Nepal.
The investigation showed that workers paid recruitment fees to be able to work for G4S, that a substantial part of their salaries went to pay debt related to those fees, and that many were paid less than agreed. In the Emirates, workers saw their passports confiscated, the Council said. The probe also revealed that workers were exposed to long days, no overtime compensation and instances of harassment.
The Council said in its report that G4S had itself acknowledged the risk of human rights abuses and was setting a cap on recruitment fees. But it hasn’t indicated it would end the practice altogether, or taken any measures to prevent misleading information about wages or working conditions, the report said.
Norway’s wealth fund, the world’s biggest of its kind, is managed according to a set of ethical principles. It’s barred from investing in tobacco and certain kinds of weapons, as well as in companies responsible for serious environmental damage or human rights abuses. The investor currently has 156 companies on its exclusion list.

1522,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 14, 2019 05:19AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Daimler to Slash Jobs, Cap Investment in Painful EV Shift","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The past has long caught with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). But it still isn’t doing enough to secure its future.
That’s the main takeaway from another sobering update from the maker of luxury cars and heavy trucks at a capital markets day in London on Thursday. The company is cutting up to 1.4 billion euros in personnel costs, including a 10% reduction in management headcount, as it tries to adapt to a world requiring cleaner and more automated vehicles.
Daimler’s shares, which had eked out only a 5% gain over the last 12 months, gave up 3.0% by 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT) to a three-week low.
In a statement, new chief executive Ola Kallenius said the company needs “comprehensive measures” to meet new targets on CO2 emissions from its fleet that will depress earnings for the next two years.
That means letting go thousands of workers who make the group’s current fleet of high-performance combustion engines, as well as a sharp increase in investment in new technologies. Running old and new technologies side by side, in itself, will make the company more complex and – at least in the short term – less profitable. Daimler only expects a reduction in complexity after 2025.
“The expanded range of plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles is leading to cost increases that will have a negative impact on Mercedes-Benz Cars’ return on sales,” Kallenius said.
It also wants to cut personnel costs by 100 million euros a year at its vans division and 300 million euros a year at its trucks unit, the latter overwhelmingly in Europe, where profitability is lower than in its market-leading U.S. operations.
While investors have been expecting – indeed, demanding – action on pruning the group’s conventional engines workforces, they appeared more unsettled by the other part of Kallenius’ announcement on Thursday.
“Investment in property, plant and equipment and in research and development will be capped at the 2019 level and be reduced in the medium term,” Kallenius said, immediately raising questions about how he intends to catch up lost ground vis-à-vis the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and, indeed, Volkwagen, which has been in full-on electrification mode for the past couple of years.
 “Daimler and other traditional OEMs are significantly lagging in comparison to, for example, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the area of digitalization and electrification,” Georg Konjovic, co-founder of the EV Angels consultancy, via Twitter. “In such a phase, I think an R&D cap is wrong. They are playing catch-up, not leader.”
Daimler’s warning also sent shock waves through much of the rest of the sector, with bearings maker Schaeffler particularly hard hit, falling over 4% at one point before trimming losses to be down only 3.4%.
The German DAX was down 0.1%, supported by slightly better-than-expected GDP figures for the third quarter which showed Europe’s largest economy avoided a technical recession, even if it is to all intents and purposes only flatlining.
The broader Euro Stoxx 600 benchmark was flat at 405.82, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.4%. "

DUBAI/ABU DHABI (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  (L:HSBA) has laid off about 40 bankers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Emirates NBD is cutting around 100 jobs, as banks in the Arab world's second-biggest economy reduce costs, sources familiar with the move told Reuters.
The job cuts come at a time of weak economic growth, especially in the region's business hub - Dubai - which is suffering from a property downturn.
HSBC's redundancies came after the London-based bank reported a sharp fall in earnings and warned of a costly restructuring, as interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn seeks to tackle its problems head-on in his bid for the full-time role.
HSBC has about 3,000 staff in the UAE, part of its nearly 10,000 workforce in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey region.
The cuts at Dubai's largest lender Emirates NBD (DU:ENBD) came in areas such as consumer sales and liabilities, one of the sources said, while a second source played down the significance, citing the bank's 12,000 workforce.
HSBC and Emirates NBD declined to comment.
""The cuts are part of cost cutting and rationalizing to drive efficiencies in a challenging market,"" the second source familiar with the matter said about Emirates NBD.
Other banks have been reducing staff this year.
UAE central bank data shows local banks have laid off 446 people at the end of September from the same period a year ago, while foreign banks have added staff in the same period.
Staff at local banks account for over 80% of the 35,518 banking employees in the country.
The merger between Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (AD:ADCB), Union National Bank and Al Hilal Bank resulted in hundreds of people being made redundant.
 Commercial Bank International  (AD:CBI) in September said it would offer voluntary retirement to employees, which sources close to the bank said resulted in over 100 job cuts. CBI, which is partly owned by Qatar National Bank (QA:QNBK), has not commented on the figure.
Standard Chartered's (L:STAN) local unit cut more than 100 jobs in its retail business in the UAE in September, Reuters had reported citing sources.
Rating agency Fitch warned in September a weakening property market in the UAE is likely to put more pressure on the asset quality of the banking sector."

(Reuters) - European shares dipped on Thursday, as a warning from German carmaker  Daimler  and lackluster economic data from Asia and Europe countered a handful of positive corporate updates.
By 0929 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) slipped 0.1%, with German shares (GDAXI) dropping 0.2%.
Data showed Germany's economy narrowly avoided slipping into recession in the third quarter but growth remained close to zero and that in central and eastern European economies that rely heavily on its demand are crumbling.
Daimler (DE:DAIGn) dropped about 3% after the carmaker said tougher emissions rules would hit earnings in 2020 and 2021, forcing it to seek more than 1 billion euros on staffing costs at Mercedes-Benz by the end of 2022.
""Clearly, either side of zero is not great. It doesn't indicate a strong German economy,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.
""The thoughts now are to what extent will you see the German authorities stimulate their economy.""
Daimler's warning spurred a 1% fall in the European auto index (SXAP), leading declines among the major sectors.
Other numbers on Thursday showed China's factory output growth slowed significantly more than expected in October and Japan's economy ground to a near standstill.
The gloom took European shares further from a four-year peak hit last week driven by optimism about the chances of a 'phase one' trade deal between the United States and China and some better-than-expected earnings.
Shares in Germany's biggest electricity producer (DE:RWEG) also fell 2.5% and science and technology company Merck KGaA (DE:MRCG) dropped 1.5% despite raising their 2019 forecasts.
The STOXX 600's biggest gainer was genetic testing company  Qiagen  (DE:QIA), up 13.1% after Bloomberg reported scientific instruments maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (N:TMO) had approached company about a potential deal.
Defensive sectors including real estate (SX86P), utilities (SX6P) and healthcare (SXDP), considered safer during times of economic uncertainty, also inched higher.
London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) was down 0.4% as a drop in private equity company  3i  (LON:III) and a handful of stocks trading ex-dividend overshadowed an earnings-driven surge in luxury brand  Burberry .
Burberry's shares (L:BRBY) rose about 6% after it said the popularity of collections by designer Riccardo Tisci boosted sales in its second quarter.
Official data showed British consumers, whose spending has helped the economy weather three years of Brexit turmoil, cut back on their shopping in October, adding to signs of weak overall economic growth."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Alibaba's planned $13.4 billion share sale will be Hong Kong's first paperless stock market listing, a source with knowledge of the matter said, breaking with a long-held tradition of investors placing stock orders in bank branches.
Companies carrying out initial public offerings in Hong Kong have traditionally placed prospectuses in banks, which would often stay open late or over the weekend, and investors would fill out paper forms to place their stock orders. 
The decision by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) to fully automate the retail subscription component of its deal comes as Hong Kong is gripped by violent civil unrest which has shut shops in the financial district and on Thursday led the government to close schools.
Alibaba does not plan to print a paper copy of its 661-page prospectus, which it lodged with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Wednesday, said the source, who was not authorised to speak to the media and so declined to be named.
Investment bankers familiar with the Alibaba listing said the logistics of having investors queuing in or outside banks while protests unfolded nearby would have been difficult.
Alibaba is not expected to carry out a advertising campaign for the listing, but will tell potential retail shareholders, particularly the elderly, that the automation process will not lock them out of participating. 
An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment.
The Hangzhou-based ecommerce giant will invite retail investors to subscribe for shares on Friday, with an initial allotment for them of 12.5 million shares, or 2.5% of the new stock to be issued, a term sheet seen by Reuters shows.
HANG SENG SINKS
Alibaba's prospectus showed the company plans to issue 500 million new shares and could raise up to $13.4 billion after the so-called over-allotment option is exercised.
The listing comes as Hang Seng index fell to a five-week low on Thursday, driven down by worsening sentiment in Hong Kong.
Alibaba had planned a paperless deal when it considered a listing in Hong Kong over the summer. The listing was put on hold after the anti-government protests started to unfold and the city has since been gripped by worsening violence.
The decision to go paperless was in line with Alibaba considering itself a leading e-commerce and digital platform, the source said.

An Alibaba report on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) last year said it was ""mindful of the environmental effect of paper and plastic packaging as well as the carbon footprint of transport systems in logistics"".

G4S had no immediate comment but said it was formulating a response.
The wealth fund, the world's largest, has an ethical profile and excludes companies from its investments for what it deems to be ethical breaches.
The exclusion from the fund was based on an assessment of G4S's operations in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the fund's ethics watchdog, the Council on Ethics, said in a separate statement.
Many of G4S's employees in the two Gulf countries are migrant workers who paid recruitment fees to join the company, the council said.
""When the workers arrive in the Gulf, they must spend a significant part of their salary to pay off this debt, and therefore have little chance of leaving. Many also received far lower wages than agreed, and in the Emirates, the workers got their passport confiscated,"" it wrote.
""The Council’s investigations also revealed long working days, a lack of overtime payment and examples of harassment,"" it added.
G4S employs around 18,000 workers in the two countries, the ethics council said, quoting a letter it received from the company this year.
The share price of G4S fell on the news, declining from 204.8 pence just ahead of the 0900 GMT announcement to 200.8 shortly after. At 0924 GMT it was trading at 203.3 pence.
At the end of 2018, the fund held a 2.33% stake in the company worth some $90 million, according to fund data.
When a company is excluded, the fund progressively sells its stake ahead of the announcement so that when a decision is made public, it no longer has any share in an excluded company."

“We are acting very carefully and analyzing a range of issues as authorities show interest” in Japanese investments in overseas CLOs, Hiroichi Shishimi, a senior executive, said at a briefing.
With about $1.7 trillion of household savings, Japan Post Bank has been buying CLOs and other foreign assets in search of returns that domestic government bonds no longer provide. The Bank of Japan signaled concern last month that CLO prices “could fall substantially” if economic and market conditions worsen, while adding that the risk of defaults in top-rated tranches is “basically small.”
Shishimi said the bank examines factors including the reputation of CLO managers and the quality of individual loans included in the vehicles. It conducts strict stress tests to make sure that the amount of CLOs owned at any given time is manageable and won’t undermine its financial strength, he said.
The structure of CLOs, particularly top-rated slices, has improved sharply since the global financial crisis, according to Shishimi. Japan Post Bank has been purchasing AAA rated segments partly because they provide higher yields than regular corporate bonds, he said.

Another way Japan Post has accumulated exposure to U.S. leveraged loans is through investment funds that buy the debt. The company plans to pare its allocation to such funds and increase its CLO investments because the latter offer a cushion against losses in a downturn, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month.
Norinchukin Bank, the Japanese agricultural lender that holds more CLOs than any other local bank, pared its holdings last quarter after becoming more selective about purchasing the credit products, people with knowledge of the matter said this week.

The company began to build 777 fuselages in 2015 in an upright orientation, with robots drilling holes and installing fasteners, an initiative known as fuselage automated upright build (FAUB).
The world's biggest planemaker said it had stopped using the system which, according to industry sources, caused problems with reliability and rework issues.
Boeing had faced delays last year when the FAUB machine was tried out on existing versions of the 777. (https://reut.rs/2KjsQtl)
Instead, the company will switch to ""flex tracks"" - an automated method to drill the holes along the circumference of the airplane that are then fastened manually.
The system was developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes and has been tested in commercial and defense programs, company spokesman Paul Bergman said in an emailed statement.
Implementation of flex tracks for the 777 fuselage began in the second quarter and Boeing expects the transition to be complete by the year-end, Bergman said.
There are no planned changes in total staffing and the company continues to implement robotic systems on areas such as wing manufacturing for the 777X.
The setback highlights continuing pressure on the company's management at a time it is trying to obtain approval to return its grounded 737 MAX jetliner to service before the end of this year.
The change in production strategy for the 777 was reported earlier by Bloomberg."

A Canadian with 30 years experience in mining, including 16 at BHP and the past three at the helm of BHP's Australian business, Henry was named on Thursday as the successor to Andrew MacKenzie.
While less well known to the investment community than some of BHP's other senior executives, Henry, 53, has a reputation as a thoughtful, ethical, diligent leader, more a safe pair of hands than an aggressive company builder.
""He's smart and dedicated and will apply himself with great diligence to the role. Mike leads by example,"" said a former colleague who worked with Henry for several years.
""He's a really straight up and down guy. He doesn't play games and for a guy in that position, he has his ego totally in check,"" said the source, who asked not to be named.
As head of BHP's Australian operations, Henry has been responsible for the global miner's vast iron ore, coal, copper and nickel assets in the country, leading nearly 40,000 people.
""He seems like a pretty good appointment. Obviously he has a number of years of experience within BHP running a very large part of the organization from a profitability point of view.. So the level of experience is definitely there,"" said Ausbil Chief Investment Officer Paul Xiradis.
BHP highlighted Henry's role in developing a BHP-wide operating system that has delivered big cost savings, as well championing diversity - doubling the number of female employees and boosting indigenous employment.
At a news conference on Thursday, Henry stressed the importance of safety, a key issue for BHP after it took a reputational hit from a Brazilian dam collapse in 2015, and said he would look to unlock more value from the company's assets.
""We do live in an uncertain world,"" he said.
""That's why...(we) need to be driving performance within the core business because that discipline, that performance will be what will allow us to navigate an uncertain world in the right way that will continue to grow value.""
Henry, who has experience in Europe, North America and Asia and lives with his wife in Melbourne, will still need to win over some Australian fund managers, who would have preferred an outside appointment.
Some investors also cited a less than smooth performance of BHP's Australian operations after a runaway iron ore train last year had to be forcibly derailed, and underpeformance at the Olympic Dam copper mine in South Australia.
For Henry, who will take over on Jan. 1, 2020, it's ""day -45""
""I need to get my feet under the desk, I want to spend time out engaging with our global operations, hearing from our people."""

  Burberry   Group (LON:BRBY) said its underlying earnings per share rose 12% and raised its dividend fractionally after a first half in which comparable store sales rose 3% in currency adjusted terms to 1.28 billion pounds.
The luxury group known for its scarves and trenchcoats said it still expects “broadly stable” revenue for the full year “despite incremental pressure on gross margin from the disruptions in Hong Kong and (product) mix.”
Hong Kong sales fell by more than 10%, offset by a “mid-teens’ percentage rise in mainland China.
The company said it has also entered into an exclusive partnership with social media and gaming group Tencent to develop “social retail” - “a concept that blends social media and retail, creating digital and physical spaces for engaged communities to interact, share and shop.” It will debut the concept with a store in Shenzhen, China, in the first half of next year.

Mining giant BHP (LON:BHPB) said it had appointed company veteran Mike Henry to succeed Andrew Mackenzie as chief executive officer from January 1.

Henry has been on the company’s leadership team for the last eight years and is currently president of operations for the group’s Australian mines.
Henry, 53, has a reputation as a thoughtful, ethical, diligent leader, more a safe pair of hands than an aggressive company builder, according to Reuters


Train and bus operator First Group reported revenue up by 4.1% in the six months through September, thanks largely to a strong performance by GWR and increased immigration in the U.S. which helped its Greyhound business. The latter was amplified by a strong dollar.
The group still swung to a statutory operating loss of 118 million pounds due to an impairment charge against Greyhound, part of its preparations to sell the unit.
Statutory EPS were -14.3 pence. Like-for-like passenger revenue was up 4.9%.
First Group upheld its outlook for the year, which has improved as a result of its successful bid for the West Coast Partnership. That franchise will connect Scotland, the North-West of England, North Wales, the Midlands and London from December.

  National Grid   (LON:NG) said underlying operating profit rose 1% and earnings per share rose 2% in the first half of its fiscal year after what it called “strong organic growth at the top end of the 5% to 7% range.”
Profit was concentrated in its regulated U.S. business, where underlying operating profit rose 16% to 452 million pounds at constant exchange rates. Its U.K. electricity transmission business, which suffered a dramatic outage in August, also saw profit rise 5%.
The group also said it was tightening its internal targets for CO2 emissions and is now aiming for “net zero” by 2050, rather than the net 80% reduction previously targeted.  National Grid  (LON:NG) bought Geronimo, a Minneapolis-based wind and solar generator, in July, something that contributed to a 28% rise in capital spending in the half.

Icahn, who owns a 10.6% stake in Xerox, now owns a 4.24% stake in HP, the Journal said https://www.wsj.com/articles/carl-icahn-makes-case-for-xerox-hp-union-11573702903?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1.
An HP spokesperson told Reuters the company is aware of Icahn's investment and is committed to doing what is in the best interests of all HP shareholders. HP did not disclose how much stake Icahn owns in the PC maker.
Xerox made a roughly $33 billion cash-and-stock offer for HP, a company more than three times Xerox's size, Reuters reported last week. HP confirmed the bid, but has not disclosed the offer price.
""I think a combination is a no-brainer,"" Icahn was quoted as saying by the Journal.
""I believe very strongly in the synergies,"" he said, adding that ""there will probably be a choice between cash and stock and I would much rather have the stock, assuming there's a good management team.""
Xerox believes it can achieve at least $2 billion in annual cost synergies by creating an office technology supplies giant, one source told Reuters last week.
The billionaire told the Journal that his team began looking at HP in late February and he bought the company's shares from late April to mid-August, though he did not have a deal with Xerox in mind when he started accumulating the shares.
Icahn said he believes a combined company is in the best interests of both sets of shareholders given the potential for cost savings and to market a more balanced portfolio of printer offerings, the WSJ reported.
This is not the first deal that Icahn has tried to orchestrate by having a small company buy a bigger one. 
In June, U.S. casino operator Eldorado Resorts Inc agreed to acquire larger peer Caesars Entertainment Corp for $17.3 billion, including debt. Icahn had earlier gained seats on the board of Caesars.

Icahn and Xerox did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment late on Wednesday.

1536,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 11:30PM ET</span>","Australian Bonds Heading to Record-Low 0.5% Yield, UBS Says","(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s bonds have fallen far enough in recent weeks to price in positive U.S.-China trade news and may now be poised to rally as global and domestic economic growth slows, UBS Group AG says.
Benchmark 10-year yields may drop to a record 0.5% next year as the U.S. and China fail to resolve their trade dispute and existing tariffs stay in place, according to Giulia Specchia, Australia and New Zealand rates strategist at UBS in Sydney. While there are signs global manufacturing is stabilizing, there’s no indication purchasing managers indexes are bouncing back, she said.
“Where 10s in Australia are now, they are already pricing in the good news and the pickup in PMIs, so the upside from here is really limited unless you have PMIs booming again,” Specchia said in an interview. “This is a good opportunity to go long again. The fundamentals in the global economy haven’t really changed in the last four weeks.”
Bonds have fallen around the world over the past month amid signs the U.S. and China are moving closer to a trade deal and the threat of a no-deal Brexit has waned. Australia’s 10-year yields climbed to a three-month high of 1.34% last week from the current record-low of 0.85% set in August.
Aussie bond yields dropped on Thursday after a government report showed the economy unexpectedly lost jobs in October and the jobless rate increased to 5.3%. Benchmark 10-year yields slid as much as nine basis points to 1.18%, while traders boosted odds that the central bank will cut interest rates.
UBS’s house view is that the Reserve Bank of Australia will lower its cash rate target in December and once more in the first half of 2020 to 0.25% as a global growth slowdown convinces the Federal Reserve to reduce its benchmark to 1%, Specchia said.
Further RBA rate cuts will probably convince markets to start pricing in the prospect of quantitative easing, though the central bank is likely to deploy other tools first, such as open-market operations to inject liquidity and to try and get banks to pass through the full amount of lower interest rates to consumers, Specchia said, citing UBS’s house view.
“That’s why we don’t think they will really need to do QE because you just need to tell the markets that you could do that and you are willing to do that if needed, and then I think that would have quite a big impact on bonds,” she said.
In the event the RBA does start QE, the impact would be modest as a percentage of gross domestic product, UBS said in its market outlook for 2020 to 2021.
The free float of Australian government bonds -- those not held for foreign-exchange reserve managers and central banks or others unlikely to sell -- is about 40%, or A$250 billion ($171 billion), UBS said. That limited amount means the RBA may only need to buy a small quantity to obtain “a large, persistent, decline of bond yields,” it said.

A criticism of Apple Card's algorithm started last week, after entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson railed against the evaluation process in a series of Twitter posts, saying it gave him 20 times the credit limit his wife received.
Goldman, which oversees the banking decisions on the iPhone maker's credit card, has responded by asking aggrieved customers to request a second look at credit-limit decisions, according to the report https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-14/elizabeth-warren-slams-goldman-over-apple-card-bias-allegations?utm_content=business&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business.

Goldman said it welcomed a discussion of this topic with policymakers and regulators. 
""Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has not and will never make decisions based on factors such as gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other legally prohibited factors when determining credit worthiness,"" the bank told Reuters.
It's the company's responsibility to come forward with the information about how that algorithm was designed and the exact impact of it, the Democratic presidential candidate said, adding that ""if they can't do it, then they need to pull it down"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co pilot union Wednesday sharply criticized Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and questioned whether the manufacturer was trying to speed up the timeline for the 737 MAX's return to service.
Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX has been grounded since March, after two deadly crashes in five months killed 346 people, and it has come under harsh criticism from U.S. lawmakers.
Jon Weaks, who heads the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), said in a note to pilots Wednesday, reviewed by Reuters, that ""Boeing is increasingly publicizing that they may have to shut down their production line due to running out of room to store completed MAX aircraft. There is some concern that this is simply another tactic to push the (return to service) timeline up.""
He added doing so would ""force operators to resume making payments on MAX aircraft, and transfer some costs, logistics, and responsibilities of storing and restoring the MAX to revenue service to respective operators.""
Boeing did not immediately comment late Wednesday.
Southwest Airlines spokeswoman Brandy King said the airline is ""confident in the work being done to return the MAX to service and continue to await additional guidance from Boeing and the FAA regarding timing and next steps.""
On Monday, Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe told Reuters that ""we expect the Max to be certified, airworthiness directive issued, ungrounded in mid-December."" He added that the company expects ""pilot training requirements to be approved in January.""
Boeing noted that the ""FAA and other regulatory authorities will ultimately determine return to service.""
Two federal officials told Reuters this week that Boeing's timetable is aggressive and far from certain, citing hurdles yet to be cleared.
Boeing still must complete an audit of its software documentation before it can schedule a key certification test flight.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Steve Dickson on Tuesday said the agency was not ""delegating"" anything to Boeing in its review and offered no ungrounding timetable, saying it ""will be based solely on our assessment of the sufficiency of Boeing's proposed software updates and pilot training.""
On Friday, Southwest and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) extended Boeing 737 MAX cancellations until early March, just shy of the one-year anniversary of an Ethiopian Airlines crash that led to a worldwide grounding.
Last month, SWAPA sued Boeing, saying it had ""deliberately misled"" the airline and pilots. The grounding wiped out more than 30,000 Southwest Airlines flights, causing over $100 million in lost wages for pilots, the union said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank's Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan, one of Japan's top internet firms, confirmed it is in talks to merge with Line Corp (T:3938), a $27 billion union that would bring the messaging app operator under the SoftBank umbrella as it expands e-commerce and payments services. 
Yahoo Japan, which last month changed its name to Z Holdings (T:4689), said on Thursday discussions were underway with Line but nothing had been decided. SoftBank Corp (T:9434), which owns almost half of Z Holdings, also acknowledged the talks.
Shares in Z Holdings, which had a stock market value of about $17 billion at Wednesday's close, jumped 16%. 
Shares in Line, which is valued at about $10 billion, were untraded with a glut of buy orders.
Sources told Reuters the previous day a deal was likely by month-end and could see SoftBank Corp and Line's parent Naver Corp (KS:035420) form a 50/50 venture that would control Z Holdings, which would in turn operate Line and Yahoo.
Line said in a statement it was true it is considering ways to improve its corporate value but nothing had been decided.
A deal would bring together the operators of two of Japan's biggest QR code payment apps, as the country belatedly shifts to cashless payments. SoftBank's PayPay recently hit 19 million users through aggressive marketing, while Line Pay can tap the 82 million Japanese users of the Line app.
Those services are money-losing, with Line - which last year sold a majority stake in its mobile unit to SoftBank - reporting three consecutive quarters of operating losses as it tries to jump-start growth.
While the two companies combined revenues would exceed rival  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755), whose shares fell 6% on the news, their combined transaction value would still be dwarfed by Rakuten, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Masaru Sugiyama wrote in a note. 
SoftBank is making a major push into online retailing, launching PayPay Mall, as it tries to grow revenues outside its core telecoms business. 
Separately on Thursday, Z Holdings said it has successfully acquired 50.1% of fashion e-tailer Zozo Inc (T:3092) in a $3.7 billion deal announced in September, as it bulks up against rivals such as Amazon.com (O:AMZN). 
The deal leaves Zozo founder and former CEO Yusaku Maezawa as the second largest shareholder with an 18% stake. 
Dealmaking by SoftBank Corp, controlled by tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), comes despite the weak performance of the technology bets of its parent, which recorded an $8.9 billion operating loss in the second quarter. 

The group's first quarterly loss in 14 years followed a collapse in the value of its investment in office-sharing firm WeWork as investors have turned skeptical about the path to profitability at cash-burning startups.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers pressed top U.S. antitrust enforcers on their probes of tech giants Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Wednesday, with the chair of a House subcommittee expressing frustration over the companies' continued acquisitions.
In a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said his investigative staff was focused on understanding how personalized advertising transactions work. Facebook and Google, in particular, depend on advertising for their revenue.
""By understanding these competitive dynamics, we can understand how the market leaders have monopoly power, how they exercise that monopoly power and whether the source of that power is for merit-based competition or the source of that power is exclusionary,"" Delrahim said.
The Justice Department and the committee are looking into all four companies while the Federal Trade Commission is probing Facebook and Amazon. Groups of dozens of state attorneys general are also investigating Google and Facebook.
Delrahim said the department was working with the states on their probes. ""We continue to coordinate with the state AGs on both of the matters that have been made public,"" said Delrahim.
Representative David Cicilline, chair of the subcommittee, noted that Google had continued with acquisitions despite the slew of antitrust investigations, pointing in particular to planned purchases of Looker and Fitbit. The acquisition of Looker, a privately held big-data analytics company, was approved last week.
""The hubris of the executive team to pursue an acquisition of this size,"" he said, referring to its $2.1 billion bid for Fitbit, ""while under federal and state antitrust investigations is astonishing.""
Google's interest in Fitbit Inc, a U.S. wearable device maker, comes as it eyes a slice of the crowded market for fitness trackers and smartwatches.
Watchdog groups like Public Citizen and the Center for Digital Democracy, among others, urged the FTC Wednesday to block the deal.
""Google knows more about us than any other company, and it should not be allowed to add yet another way to track our every move,"" they said in a letter.
Republicans on the committee, by and large, urged caution in probing America's biggest, most successful companies, with Representative Doug Collins warning against punishing success.

""Companies that offer new innovations, better solutions and more consumer benefits at lower prices often become big — to the benefit of society. Proposals to break up big companies because of their size alone risk throwing the baby out with the bath water,"" he said.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers question why Centrus awarded federal uranium contract,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. Representatives asked officials at the Energy Department on Wednesday how Centrus Energy Corp, a company whose chief recently served as deputy at the department, won a federal contract to demonstrate a production method for a new nuclear power plant fuel. 
The Department of Energy (DOE) issued a notice of intent in January to award a no-bid $115 million contract to Centrus to demonstrate by June 2022 production of a new fuel called high-assay low-enriched uranium, known as HALEU, which one day could be used in advanced nuclear reactors. 
""We are deeply concerned about the Department of Energy’s award to Centrus Energy Corporation to demonstrate a method of producing"" HALEU, the lawmakers said in a letter to Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The letter, seen by Reuters, was also sent to Dan Brouillette, Trump's nominee to replace Perry, who is stepping down next month.
The lawmakers said they support the DOE's research activities to speed advanced nuclear reactor development but ""we have questions about how this contract was funded, why other companies were not allowed to compete for the award, and whether the need for HALEU in the near-term is well-supported.""
The letter was spearheaded by Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat and chairwoman of the House Science Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, and Ralph Norman, the panel's top Republican. 
The contract has been controversial in part because the Centrus president and chief executive officer is Dan Poneman, the deputy of the DOE from 2009 to 2014, under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. 
The letter said the department had not ""presented adequate justification"" for requiring demonstration of the fuel for advanced reactors, which are many years away from being commercial. At least two existing programs could potentially provide serviceable amounts of the fuel for testing, it said. 
Centrus spokeswoman Lindsey Geisler said the firm is the only American company pursuing production capability of the fuel and that its competitors are foreign state-owned companies that benefit from a range of government support. 
Centrus ""will deliver the best, most economical, domestic source of HALEU - a critical step to re-establishing American leadership in the global nuclear industry,"" she said.
The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Nonproliferation experts say HALEU may be a target of militants looking to enrich it further to produce crude nuclear weapons. HALEU is enriched to up to 20% uranium 235, far more than the than fuel used in today's reactors which enriched to about 5% uranium 235. 

The lawmakers want the Energy Department to provide information by Dec. 3 on a series of questions including whether the project is intended to satisfy Defense Department requirements in addition to nuclear power goals.

The Alamaba factory expansion was announced as President Donald Trump is expected this week to push back a self-imposed deadline on whether to put tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars and parts.
Hyundai has invested more than $1.1 billion in the Montgomery region in the last 18 months, with the latest move expected to add 200 new jobs and 1,000 people employed by regional suppliers and logistics companies.
The factory, which began production in 2005, was Hyundai's first assembly and manufacturing plant in the United States and now has 2,900 full-time and 500 part-time employees. 
Hyundai, whose late response to the SUV market took a heavy toll on its sales in the United States, China and other markets, has expanded its SUV offerings in recent years. 
The Santa Cruz pickup truck, introduced as a concept vehicle four years ago, will be its first for the U.S. market, joining three models - the Sonata, Elantra sedans and the Santa Fe SUV, now made in its sole U.S. factory. 

Last year, the United States and South Korea agreed to revise a trade pact sharply criticized by Trump, striking a deal to extend U.S. tariffs on Korean-made pickup trucks by 20 years, until 2041.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 07:07PM ET</span>",Uber launches new safety features in UK as it fights for new license,"LONDON (Reuters) - Uber (NYSE:UBER) launched a set of new safety features in Britain on Thursday as it battles to retain its taxi operating license in the face of concerns about passenger safety.
The measures include a discrimination button enabling drivers and riders to report abuse, enhanced safety training for drivers and a direct connection to the emergency services.
In September, Uber received only a two-month operating license in London, its most important European market, failing to secure a maximum five-year term in a battle with the regulator Transport for London (TfL) which has previously stripped the app of its right to take rides.
The two-month license came with ""new conditions to ensure passenger safety"" and TfL said at the time it wanted more details from the company.
In 2017, TfL rejected the Silicon Valley company's license renewal request due to failings it said it found in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks. Uber was then granted a probationary 15-month license in 2018.
Drivers of London's traditional black taxis have lobbied hard against a license renewal, citing safety issues, working standards and the undercutting of their business model.
Uber says its roughly 45,000 drivers in the city enjoy the flexibility of their work and that it has already taken several steps to improve safety for its passengers."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The We Company, owner of WeWork, said on Wednesday net losses in the third quarter more than doubled to $1.25 billion as the money-losing shared-office operator added a record number of desks to its global network but was unable to control rising costs.
WeWork opened 97 new sites in the quarter ended Sept. 30, its biggest quarterly expansion ever, taking its total number of offices to 625 from 528 at the end of June, a presentation of its earnings that was provided to bondholders showed.
The company also expanded the number of cities in which it operates by 16, increasing its worldwide footprint to a total of 127 and the number of countries in which it has sites by four to 33, the presentation, which Reuters reviewed, showed.
The number of desks it offers customers rose to a record 115,000 in the quarter to reach 719,000, including its India affiliate. A year earlier it had 354,000 desks.
The company had $2 billion in cash at the end of the third quarter, with $600 million of that from three Asian affiliates. 
WeWork also had $3.4 billion in commitments from SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), which gained control of the company in October, and another $1.5 billion in existing warrants from SoftBank that were exercised last month, the presentation showed.
Gross profit from the sale of workplace memberships and service revenue rose in the third quarter to $808 million from $454 million in the year-ago quarter. 
But losses widened from $497 million a year earlier as costs grew faster than WeWork's breakneck expansion, which new management aims to curb in the wake of a disastrous effort to go public. Yet a pipeline of leasing commitments means rapid growth will likely continue in the fourth quarter and into 2020.
The development of new locations jumped to $288 million from $69 million a year earlier; general and administrative costs rose to $157 million from $81 million; while sales and marketing reached $194 million versus $108 million.
A presentation to bondholders that WeWork released last week showed a 90-day plan in which the company revealed it will divest seven ""non-core"" units, prioritize ""profitable"" growth and ""right-size"" operations.
The Oct. 11 presentation said administrative jobs would be cut, along with jobs in WeWork's venture capital arm and in so-called growth-related functions, a possible reference to design and construction units. The size of job cuts was not mentioned.
WeWork's crash has confounded industry experts who praise the company for making flexible workspace a product large corporations desire but whose financial structure baffles.
""WeWork was the highest payer for space, and was also the cheapest provider of space,"" said Ryan Simonetti, chief executive and co-founder of Convene, an events and flex space operator backed by Brookfield Asset Management, among others.
""We have lost deals to customers in the last 12 to 18 months where they were paying less than WeWork was paying for the real estate itself,"" Simonetti told reporters on Tuesday at a news conference to discuss the industry. ""That doesn’t make sense."" 
As WeWork restructures, the company will have fewer locations as it gets rid of non-performing sites, Simonetti said. 
WeWork shelved its plans to go public on Sept. 30 after investors grew wary of its losses, business model and corporate governance that had forced former CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann to resign a week earlier.
The company, valued at $47 billion when it registered to go public in August, saw its valuation plummet as it bled cash, leading SoftBank to bail out WeWork with a pledge of $6.5 billion in October.

1547,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 06:36PM ET</span>",China launches new crackdown on chemical safety,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's cabinet will begin a nationwide safety crackdown on its massive chemical industry after an official investigation into a deadly plant blast that killed 78 people and injured dozens more in March.
The explosion, at the Tianjiayi chemical factory in Yancheng in eastern coastal Jiangsu province, has already resulted in the closure of dozens of small plants and China expects to relocate more than 80% of hazardous chemical production by the end of 2020.
A meeting of the State Council chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday said an inquiry into the blast revealed local authorities had failed to implement safety rules or crack down on violations.
A summary of the meeting on China's official government website (http://www.gov.cn) showed Beijing will launch a new round of inspections into hazardous chemical producers throughout the country, and that local governments must eliminate all hazards around production, storage, transportation and waste disposal.
It will also work on new legislation to help enforce safety rules and punish offenders, and curb ""blind and disorderly"" development in the industry.
The March blast sent shockwaves throughout the chemical industry, with industry officials saying costs have risen and supply chains have been disrupted as a result of stricter inspections and plant closures.
As well as tighter zoning regulations that prevent chemical plants from being built near residential areas, China is now implementing new rules on the transportation and disposal of hazardous materials."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Tesla (O:TSLA) will build its first European factory and design center near Berlin, giving the U.S. electric car pioneer the coveted ""Made in Germany"" label just as local rivals Audi, BMW and Mercedes prepare to launch competing cars.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk announced the move at a prestigious German car awards ceremony late on Tuesday and said the new plant would make batteries, powertrains and cars - starting with the Model Y sports utility vehicle.
""Everyone knows German engineering is outstanding for sure. You know that is part of the reason why we are locating Gigafactory Europe in Germany,"" Musk said at the ceremony in Berlin.
The plan is a big boost for Germany as a center for manufacturing after BMW (DE:BMWG) and Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) in recent years chose to build new factories in Hungary, and after its auto industry was hit hard by Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests. 
Germany's powerful manufacturing industry has been slowing, with data on Thursday set to show whether Europe's biggest economy has slipped into recession for the first time since 2013.
Tesla is struggling to ramp up production and has yet to prove it can be consistently profitable as rivals including Audi-owner Volkswagen retool plants to mass produce electric cars. 
Musk said the factory would be near Berlin's new Brandenburg international airport, diversifying the Silicon Valley firm's production beyond the United States at a time when global trade tariffs make exports more difficult. Besides Europe, Tesla is opening a factory in Shanghai.
Tesla's proposed factory will be within commuting distance of Poland, where labor costs are cheaper, a rival manufacturer - who also looked at the site - told Reuters.
""Tesla's decision to build an ultra-modern factory for electric cars in Germany is further proof of the appeal of Germany as an automotive hub,"" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Wednesday.
""We think we now have the chance, in the coming years, to become an important international center in this future-oriented sector,"" he said.
The German government has earmarked financial support for making electric car battery cells locally as a way to secure manufacturing jobs as tougher emissions rules threaten demand for older technologies, like diesel engines.
Dietmar Woidke, the premier of the Brandenburg state that surrounds Berlin, said any official support given to Tesla would be in accordance with European Union rules. 
Altmaier said there had been no discussion so far about any subsidies for Tesla's plans, adding the company would be treated like all other carmakers.
'SETS AN EXAMPLE'
In a high-profile example of the impact of Brexit, Musk said he picked Germany for his new factory over Britain because of uncertainty over the nation's exit from the European Union.
""Brexit made it too risky to put a gigafactory in the UK,"" he said in an interview with industry website Auto Express.
Germany's biggest labor union, the influential IG Metall, was quick to welcome Tesla's plan. ""This strengthens Berlin as an industrial location and creates jobs. We hope this sets an example,"" said Birgit Dietze, IG Metall's regional head.
Even Germany's auto industry association, VDA, welcomed the arrival of a U.S. competitor. 
""Elon Musk's announcement shows how important Germany is as a location for producing electric vehicles in Europe,"" VDA said. ""We don't shy away from competition, quite the opposite.""
German carmakers and suppliers are preparing to build more than 150 electrified vehicles by 2023, VDA said.
While Germany's renowned car industry is mainly based in the south of the country, the capital has become a hub for start-ups and has attracted many creative and technology firms since the fall of the Berlin Wall three decades ago.
""Tesla is coming to Brandenburg with a big investment,"" said state premier Woidke, without giving details ""We lobbied for this for a long time in intensive talks and with good arguments.""
Berlin's minister in charge of economic affairs, Ramona Pop, told public broadcaster RBB there had been talks about creating 6,000 to 7,000 jobs in production alone, with hundreds or even thousands more in areas such as design, software and research.
Musk's appearance at the awards ceremony is another example of Tesla's efforts to give its cars the German stamp of quality.

It already has an engineering firm in Pruem that specializes in automated manufacturing systems for battery factories and has tested its cars on the Nordschleife, the notorious northern loop of the Nuerburgring racing track.

1549,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 06:07PM ET</span>","ProPetro confirms U.S. SEC probe, accounting weaknesses","By Liz Hampton and Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - Oilfield services firm ProPetro Holding Corp (N:PUMP) on Wednesday said a board investigation had uncovered material weaknesses in its financial controls and an undisclosed related-party transaction with its former chief accountant. 
The Midland, Texas-based company also confirmed Reuters' report last month that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation in its financial disclosures and reporting. 
ProPetro provided the first snapshot of its business since disclosing the departure of its chief accounting officer and the demotion of two top officials amid an internal investigation into its financial accounting and disclosures. 
Its board identified weaknesses in internal controls, two of which were material and at least one of which existed since Dec. 31. It plans to amend its 2018 annual report and first-quarter 2019 financial filing to reflect the change, it said in a statement.
The undisclosed related-party transaction involved a business owned in part by former chief accounting officer Ian Denholm that had sold or leased a facility to ProPetro. Denholm resigned in October. 
He did not immediately respond to a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) request seeking comment and attempts to reach him by phone were unsuccessful. 
ProPetro also said it would not file its second- and third-quarter reports to the SEC before Dec. 31 due to the continuing investigation. Its internal review, however, has not to date identified anything requiring restatements of its balance sheet, statement of operations, shareholders' equity or statements of cash flow, it said. 
A company spokesman declined a request to interview an executive on Wednesday. ProPetro will hold a conference call on Thursday morning to discuss its results. 
The company reported net income fell to $34.4 million, or 33 cents per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, from $46.3 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier.
ProPetro has disclosed real-estate and rental transactions with executives and board members. In addition, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Dale Redman and former finance chief and co-founder Jeffrey Smith reimbursed the company a combined $364,000 for expenses improperly billed to ProPetro. 
Shares of ProPetro, which went public in early 2017, were up about 5.5% at $7.74 in after-hours trading after closing down 4.6% on Wednesday. 

Its stock has fallen sharply this year amid slowing oilfield activity and concerns about its internal review and SEC investigation.

BANGALORE/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) is stepping up its oil and gas-producing property sales, adding land in Utah's Uinta Basin acquired as part of its $38 billion deal for Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), according to a marketing document seen by Reuters.
Occidental aims to reduce the $40 billion of debt from the Anadarko purchase and has raised about $10 billion so far through sales of properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and oil production elsewhere in Africa. It has targeted $15 billion in proceeds by mid-2020.
Its latest offer covers about 190,000 net acres in Uinta Basin's Greater Natural Buttes gas field that could bring between $190 million to $240 million based on prior gas deals in the Rockies, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Occidental declined to comment on the potential sale.
The property has forecast net production of 215 million cubic feet equivalent per day and projected 12-month cash flow of $48 million, according to the document. EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and  QEP Resources  (NYSE:QEP) operate on property nearby.
Anadarko had not completed a new well on the acreage since 2016, according to the marketing document. It reduced activity in the field to focus on more lucrative areas.
CIBC Griffis & Small is the financial and technical adviser.
Occidental last month began soliciting bids for oil and gas properties in Wyoming and Colorado that it hopes will fetch up to $700 million. It separately offered its own Midland, Texas, campus for sale and will move employees there to Anadarko's offices, Reuters reported on Monday.
Plans to sell Occidental's stake in its Western Midstream Partners (N:WES) pipeline unit recently were shelved after failing to attract an attractive offer. It also needs the cash the unit generates, analysts have said.
Shares of Occidental closed at $38.12 Wednesday and are down more than 40% since its interest in Anadarko became public."
1551,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 05:48PM ET</span>",A Jump in Bond Yields Gives the Bank of Japan Some Relief,"(Bloomberg) -- The surge in Japanese government bond yields is helping to correct some distortions in the market and provides a measure of relief to Bank of Japan policy makers.
The 10-year yield is eyeing a break out of negative territory for the first time since March, approaching the key zero percent level around which the BOJ has built its yield curve control policy. The benchmark yield rose to as high as minus 0.03% Tuesday, after falling to near a record low of minus 0.295% early in September. It traded at minus 0.05% Wednesday
The move has eased pressure on the central bank to taper bond purchases to prevent a downward spiral in yields. After a flurry of cuts in August and September, the BOJ has kept purchases in the key 5-10 year zone unchanged in its regular operations, including on Monday.
“It won’t boost purchases, and because the yield is near zero, it won’t taper buying,” said Takenobu Nakashima, senior rates strategist at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Yields around current levels will not prompt the BOJ to do much at its operations.”
Meanwhile, the two-year versus five-year yield curve has come out of inversion for the first time since April. The move has made the five-year note look less expensive, raising hopes of solid demand in an auction of the maturity on Thursday, according to Kasutoshi Inadome, senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities in Tokyo.
Further out Japan’s curve, longer-dated yields are also rising. Thirty-year yields have risen about 9 basis points this month with twenty-year equivalents up over 8 basis points, helping push the yield curve relative to benchmark JGBs out of the flattening trend it has been in for much of the year.
“The yield curve may not flatten aggressively as before because there are some signs of the global economy stabilizing,” said Naoya Oshikubo, a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co. “An excessive curve steepening may see some unwinding but it won’t enter a serious flattening trend unless it becomes evident that the U.S. economy has slipped into recession.”"
1552,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 05:47PM ET</span>",Bond Traders Clear the Tourists From the Room,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The bond market isn’t ready to concede that the economy is on a sustained upturn that will allow it to skirt a severe slowdown or even a recession. U.S. Treasuries followed most of the rest of the global government debt market higher Wednesday, providing a welcome respite from a sell-off that’s looking more like an adjustment of overextended positions than a referendum on faster growth.
Sure, some of the gains in the bond market may be related to doubts about the U.S. and China actually agreeing to the first phase of a trade deal after some downbeat comments by President Donald Trump on Tuesday and subsequent reports of a “snag” on Wednesday. But what hasn’t been discussed as much is evidence that the recent slump in bonds had much to do with the reversal of positions by general investors who bought government debt in August, September and early October as recession speculation peaked. That was borne out in the latest monthly survey of global fund managers by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) released on Tuesday. It showed being long Treasuries is no longer the world’s “most crowded trade,” with 21% of respondents saying so, down from a massive 41% in October. The new “most crowded trade” is long U.S. technology and growth stocks at 39%. And with yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries having risen from 1.43% in early September to 1.87% on Wednesday, there’s reason to believe that bonds are more fairly valued. In fact, the latest yield is higher than the 1.71% that economists expect it to be at the end of the year and the 1.78% they estimate at the end of the first quarter 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Although the data show that the economy both in the U.S and globally may not be getting any worse, that’s far different from showing it’s getting much better and causing central banks to turn hawkish again. “We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday in Washington. “However, noteworthy risks to this outlook remain.”
STOCKS HIT A TRADE SNAGThanks in part to Powell’s dovish comments, everything was going swimmingly in the stock market until the Wall Street Journal reported that trade talks between the U.S. and China had hit a snag, briefly causing equities to erase their gains. Citing people familiar with the matter, the paper said China is leery of putting a numerical commitment on agriculture purchases in the text of a potential agreement. The development seems to explain why Trump only a day earlier sounded unusually cautious about a trade agreement, saying only that it “could happen soon” and adding that if it didn’t, then he would just increase tariffs on Chinese goods. This is no small matter for the stock market, which has rallied to new highs largely on the notion that a “phase one” deal would be reached, eliminating a significant drag on the global economy. “A couple of weeks ago, it looked like that phase one deal looked all but certain. I think the market started to price in a really positive outcome on the trade side,” Jeff Mills, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust, told Bloomberg News. “Although I do think that progress is moving in a positive direction, I think it would be foolish for us to assume that we’re going to move completely in a positive direction in trade without any type of intermittent setbacks.” Although equities recovered in late trading, buying stocks in the hopes of a trade deal is proving to be a perilous strategy.
DEFICITS (SOMETIMES) DON’T MATTERThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose for the seventh time in eight days on Wednesday to its highest in a month even though the U.S. government said its budget deficit widened in October, the first month of the fiscal year, as government spending increased and receipts declined. The shortfall grew about $34 billion, or almost 34%, from the same month last year, to $134.5 billion. This comes after the budget deficit for fiscal 2019 clocked in at just shy of $1 trillion at $984.4 billion. One benefit to having the world’s primary reserve currency is that such deficits don’t exactly matter as much as they would in a place such as Greece. Still, an out-of-control deficit and borrowing could reduce demand for the greenback and U.S. debt at the margins. The upshot is it looks as if the U.S. may not borrow as much as previously estimated to finance the deficit, thanks to recent moves by the Fed to buy Treasury bills to ensure reserves remain abundant. As a result, the strategists at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) wrote in a report this week that net debt issuance to the public by the U.S. Treasury will be just $720 billion, down from a projected $1.27 trillion in fiscal 2019. That should provide some support to the dollar and, by extension, the U.S. government.
ITALY GETS BYPASSEDOne place where the bond rally failed to make an appearance was Italy. Demand slumped to the lowest in 14 months at an auction Wednesday of seven-year notes, even with yields near the highest in three months. That suggests investors prefer countries with slimmer returns but lower credit risk and comes after a recent rise in yields in markets such as Germany and France, weakening Italy’s relative appeal, according to Bloomberg News’s James Hirai. Investors have been cooling toward Italy after political uncertainty and a recent revival in the fortunes of euro-skeptic politician Matteo Salvini. “Peripheral spreads become more vulnerable the higher core yields go as investors switch demand to safer core, semi-core bonds,” Peter Chatwell, head of European rates strategy at Mizuho International, told Bloomberg News. “Higher yields, without a broad based and structural rise in nominal growth, will pose a sustainability risk to Italy’s debt.” With $2.26 trillion of government debt, Italy has more bonds outstanding than all but the U.S., China and Japan, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Italy also has one of the highest debt-to-gross domestic product ratios at 131.5%, compared with 82.3% in the U.S. So when Italy has a poor debt auction, it’s worth paying attention.
HOT COCOAChocolate lovers may soon have to dig a little deeper in their pockets to afford their favorite indulgence. Cocoa prices have staged an impressive rally in recent months, approaching an almost 18-month high in New York on Wednesday. The gains come amid speculation that near-term supplies are getting tighter, according to Bloomberg News’s Agnieszka de Sousa. The clearest sign that traders expect tighter supplies can be seen in the prices of so-called nearby contracts, which have moved into a premium compared with later deliveries in a market structure known as backwardation and a sign of tightening supplies. “Traders are blaming the upsurge on concerns about a shortage in the short-term availability of cocoa beans,” Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG), said in a note. Still, it’s not clear why short-term supplies should be so tight as shipments in top grower Ivory Coast are still in full swing and higher than a year earlier, he said. There are also some concerns that a new $400-a-ton premium for supplies from West Africa, the world’s top producing region, may affect the way cocoa is traded on the exchanges. The new pricing system could mean that fewer supplies end up getting delivered to warehouses monitored by ICE (NYSE:ICE) Futures U.S., driving a rally in the market, according to NickJen Capital Management.
TEA LEAVESThere is a good chance that talk of a global recession could heat up again as soon as Thursday. That’s when Germany — Europe’s largest economy — reports on GDP for the third quarter. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for a contraction of 0.1%, which would mark a technical recession because the economy shrank by the same amount in the second quarter. But as Bloomberg Economics points out, whether the German economy records the shallowest of recessions or escapes one by the narrowest of margins isn’t important; what’s important is how long the dip will persist.

The petitions from BCE Inc., Rogers Communications Inc. and industry peers follows a decision by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in August to reduce wholesale broadband prices that telcos charge to third-party service providers in a bid to boost competition, with the cuts applying retroactively to 2016.
“Restoring the pre-existing rates and maintaining the status quo will allow resellers to continue to grow and at the same time preserve incentives for network investment at a critical juncture in the investment cycle,” BCE said Wednesday in the petition to Trudeau’s cabinet.
Montreal-based BCE argues the decision has brought wholesale broadband rates to below the cost of service, undermining incentives to invest and offer new products at a time when the nation is already struggling to retain business spending. BCE even cited the decision by Encana Corp. -- one of the country’s marquee energy companies -- to move its headquarters to the U.S.
“It is not the first time that we raise investment concerns with government. But, the dramatic impact of these latest rate reductions raises our concern to a new level, especially when the investment situation is already difficult in Canada,” BCE said.
Brad Shaw, chief executive officer at Calgary-based Shaw Communications Inc., said in a statement the CRTC’s decision will “seriously affect” the company’s ability to expand into rural and remote communities and meet the demand of millions of families, “particularly as we enter the 5G era.”

1556,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com -- Here's a preview of the three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Wholesale Inflation; Powell Returns
A day after data showed the pace of consumer prices accelerated last month, the Labor Department will issue the producer price index (PPI) report at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect the PPI rose 0.3% in October, compared with a 0.3% decline in the prior month.
The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen to 0.2%, from a 0.3% decline a month earlier, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would bring year-over-year PPI growth to 0.9%, down from 1.4%, and core PPI growth up 1.5%, down from 2%.
The PPI is considered a leading indicator, measuring the input prices for goods sold at a retail level.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, meanwhile, will testify on the economy before the House Committee on the Budget at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT). But the Fed chief's appearance is not expected to stray too much away from his comments on Wednesday when he reiterated that the U.S. central bank's current stance on monetary policy was appropriate as the U.S. economy remains in good shape.
2. U.S. Crude Oil Inventories Set for Another Build
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report is due Thursday, with analysts keen to see whether domestic crude stockpiles will stage another build for the third-straight week.
The EIA is expected to report a build in stockpiles of 1.65 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 8.
Crude oil futures rose 0.6% to settle at $57.17 a barrel, though some weakness was seen in late in the session on reports that U.S.-China trade talks had hit a snag.
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data, which, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, showed weekly crude stockpiles fell by 0.5 million barrels last week.
3. Nvidia, Walmart Earnings in Focus
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) reports fiscal third-quarter earnings Thursday before the opening bell, with many optimistic that the low-cost chain's efforts to improve its digital offerings will bolster growth.
Walmart management guided U.S. same-store sales growth toward the upper end of 2.5% to 3% range and forecast U.S. e-commerce sales to expand about 35%
The retailer is expected to report earnings of $1.09 per share on revenue of $128.57 billion. A year ago, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said it earned $1.08 a share on revenue of $125.42 billion. Shares are up 29.9% this year after falling 5.67% in 2018.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), meanwhile, will report earnings after the market closes.
Sentiment on the graphics chipmaker has turned more positive recently on signs spending on data center, a segment making up more than a quarter of total revenue, has returned.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported in late October that data center came back much more strongly than anticipated.
Nvidia's gaming sector will likely get a boost from strong sales for the Nintendo videogame console, which includes Nvidia-made GPU chips. Nintendo's Switch has been the top-selling video game console in U.S. for 10 months now, according to the NPD Group, a market research company.
With most of the ""goodness"" already baked into shares of Nvidia, the potential for a significant run higher on the back of solid quarterly results is limited, according to Deutsche analyst Ross Seymore.
As well as earnings, guidance will also be closely watched as many are optimistic that the launch of new products next year will drive growth.
Nvidia is expected to report earnings of $1.58 a share on revenue of $2.92 billion. A year ago, the company earned $1.97 on $3.18 billion in sales. Shares are up 56% this year after falling 30.85% in 2018."

DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) on Wednesday announced a series of ethics reforms in answer to a spreading U.S. federal corruption probe that has resulted in charges or convictions for a number of former leaders of the union.
The UAW said those reforms will include the appointment of an independent ethics ombudsman who will not be an employee of the union; increased financial oversight by the union's accounting department; and creation of an ethics hotline.
""I'm committed to putting in place the right mechanisms to safeguard our union, regaining the trust of our members, and ensuring the misconduct that has recently come to light will never happen again,"" acting UAW president Rory Gamble said in a statement.
To date, 10 people have pleaded guilty in connection with the criminal investigation into illegal payoffs. Just last week former UAW vice president and former GM board member Joseph Ashton was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud. 
Earlier this month the UAW said that its president Gary Jones, who had been linked to the ongoing corruption probe, was taking a paid leave of absence.
Last week acting UAW president Gamble said he would scrutinize every department in the union in response to the probe and that the UAW would have to prove it could run itself in order to avoid a possible U.S. government takeover of the labor organization.
In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appoint a trustee because of the union's connection to organized crime.

The government oversaw the union from March 1989 until 2015, when it agreed to a five-year transition period that will end in February 2020.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET) was sued for gender discrimination on Wednesday by a female former senior vice president who said she was underpaid, called a ""bitch"" and told she had to ""choose between being pretty and being smart"" while working at the insurance company.
Mona Moazzaz, who served as chief administrative officer in MetLife's global technology and operations department, said in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan that she was retaliated against and ultimately fired in May after authoring a document calling attention a lack of diversity at the company and other issues.
""We believe the allegations are without merit and plan to defend this matter vigorously,"" MetLife spokesman Randy Clerihue said in an email.
""It is completely unacceptable for companies to pay women hundreds of thousands of dollars less than men who do the same or less work,"" said Michael Willemin of the law firm Wigdor, who represents Moazzaz, in a statement.
Moazzaz, who joined MetLife in 2012, said in her lawsuit that she was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars less than multiple men with similar or lesser responsibilities and unfairly passed over for promotion.
She said that a human resources executive referred to her as a ""bitch"" and repeatedly called her ""the little one"" rather than using her name.
Moazzaz said a male ""leadership coach"" the company assigned to her told her she needed to ""choose between being pretty and being smart because men can't put you in both boxes"" if she wanted to be promoted.
In 2018, Moazzaz said, she authored a ""candidate strategy"" for a MetLife executive, Martin Lippert, who was seeking to become its next CEO. Among other things, the document said MetLife had fallen short in hiring minorities and promoting women.
Lippert lost out to current MetLife CEO Michel Khalaf. Moazzaz said she was fired eight days after Khalaf took over.

Khalaf and other MetLife executives are also named as defendants in the lawsuit, which is brought under federal and New York law and seeks unspecified monetary damages.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 04:23PM ET</span>","Google Pay to offer checking accounts through Citi, Stanford Federal","By Paresh Dave and Munsif Vengattil
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google said on Wednesday it will offer personal checking accounts next year through its Google Pay app, initially in partnership with  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and a small credit union at Stanford University.
The project, codenamed Cache, comes as rivals  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) are expanding their own efforts in consumer finance, a broad area that ranges from digital payment apps to bank accounts, brokerage accounts and loans, and which offer Silicon Valley new sources of revenue and new opportunities to strengthen ties with users.
U.S. regulators and lawmakers have expressed concern about how those companies' massive influence and poor records on data privacy will play out as they try to gain ground in finance. The scrutiny most recently prompted Facebook's partners to pull back from plans to support the launch of a digital currency.
Google said it has held initial talks with regulators, though it declined to specify which ones, about compliance issues related to the new checking accounts.
Asked about Google's plans, U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat on the Senate panel that oversees banking, expressed reservations.
""There ought to be very strict scrutiny,"" Warner told CNBC about tech giants such as Facebook or Google entering new fields before rules governing them were in place.
Google spokesman Craig Ewer said the company's lead partners were Citi and Stanford Federal Credit Union and that more details would be known within months.
""We’re exploring how we can partner with banks and credit unions in the U.S. to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay, helping their customers benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools, while keeping their money in an FDIC or NCUA-insured account,"" Ewer said in a statement, referring by acronym to two U.S. agencies that insure deposits.
Stanford Federal and Citi confirmed their roles.
""This agreement has the potential to expand the reach and breadth of our customer base,"" Citi spokeswoman Liz Fogarty said. ""Privacy and transparency are, and will continue to be, critical priorities.""
Joan Opp, president and chief executive of Stanford Federal, described the deal as ""critical to remaining relevant and meeting consumer expectations.""
Traditional banks have long partnered with companies outside the industry to lure deposits or expand their loan books.
The most recent prominent example is  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) teaming up with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on a credit card this year, but other regulated banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Citigroup Inc (N:C),  American Express  Corp (N:AXP) and Green Dot Bank, have teamed with companies, including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Walmart Inc (N:WMT), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) to offer co-branded products.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Google's plan and quoted Caesar Sengupta, general manager and vice president of payments at Google, as describing an approach of partnering deeply with banks. 
""It may be the slightly longer path, but it's more sustainable,"" Sengupta said.
Leaning on the regulatory and financial know-how of banks could allow Google to proceed without engaging much with bank regulators.
For instance, deposits are stored in an account managed by a regulated bank and protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and if the lender does not share consumers’ financial data with Google, there may not be a regulatory problem or license requirements. 
Google's biggest success in financial services has been in India, where it has over 67 million monthly users for Google Pay, which is used to digitally pay for groceries, Uber (NYSE:UBER) rides and other transactions. 
Though still behind Indian rivals, the Google Pay app's popularity in India has overshadowed its usage in the United States and other countries, where it can be used for cashless payments in stores and money transfers.
Sengupta had overseen the Indian service, formerly known as Tez, as head of Google's emerging markets product team. Chief Executive Sundar Pichai last year sought to build on the Indian app, developed by a team of about 150 employees in Asia, and merged it into Google's broader payments organization. 
The move has given Sengupta oversight of several thousand workers worldwide, including those who maintain tools to help Google charge its advertisers and app store users.
Former Google Pay employees said the company faces a massive challenge gaining users for payment tools in locations such as the United States that have robust financial products already. High interest rates on deposits or major loyalty perks could become important incentives for Google to draw consumers, the former employees said.
On Tuesday, Facebook launched a unified payment service through which users across its platforms can make payments without exiting the app, named Facebook Pay.

The effort is separate from Facebook's plan to launch its Libra cryptocurrency, which has met with skepticism from U.S., European and Australian regulators concerned about the risk of money laundering and the security of transactions and user data.

1563,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 02:41PM ET</span>",StockBeat: FBI Launches Probe Into Energy Transfer's Pennsylvania Pipeline Permits,"Investing.com -  Energy Transfer  units fell sharply Wednesday after the FBI launched a probe into how its Mariner East project won permits to construct a natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania.
Units for  Energy Transfer  LP (NYSE:ET), a master limited partnership, were down 5.3% this afternoon. 
Permits for the construction for the two Energy Transfer pipelines - the 350-mile-long (563-kilometer) Mariner East 2 and 2x - were granted in 2017 despite environmental advocacy groups warning that the construction of the pipelines may cause irreparable damage to Pennsylvania's environment and residents.
The pipelines are part of a trio of transmission facilities. The first, built in the 1930s, carried products like gasoline and heating oil to western Pennsyvania.
The Associated Press said the FBI is reportedly looking into whether Governor Tom Wolf and his administration forced environmental protection staff to approve construction permits and whether Wolf or his administration received anything in return, according to three people who have direct knowledge of the agents’ line of questioning.
That has placed Energy Transfer, which has invested about $3 billion into the expansion project, under even more scrutiny following ongoing regulatory actions against the company in recent months. 
In March this year, the Delaware County District Attorney and the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s office began to investigate Energy Transfer's Sunoco Mariner East 2 natural gas liquids pipeline on suspicions of criminal misconduct during construction.
Both pipelines were projected to open in 2017, but Mariner East 2 began operating only last December. Mariner East 2X could be complete in 2020.
An Energy Transfer spokeswoman said the company had not been contacted by the FBI about the Mariner East pipeline.

It removed more than 11.6 million pieces of content depicting child nudity and sexual exploitation of children on Facebook and 754,000 pieces on Instagram during the third quarter. Law enforcement is concerned that Facebook's plans to provide greater privacy to users by encrypting the company’s messaging services will hamper efforts to fight child abuse.  Last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the changes would turn the platform into a ""dream come true for predators and child pornographers.""  Facebook also added data on actions it took around content involving self-harm for the first time in the report. It said it had removed about 2.5 million posts in the third quarter that depicted or encouraged suicide or self-injury. 
The company also removed about 4.4 million pieces involving drug sales during the quarter, it said in a blog post. (https://

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>","Federal pension fund to include China investments, bucking political pressure","By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A pension fund for federal workers on Wednesday said it will begin tracking a benchmark that includes China-listed companies, despite strong opposition from a bipartisan group of Senators. 
The decision by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), an independent government agency that oversees the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement fund, comes amid heightened trade tensions with China and efforts to limit the flow of U.S. capital to Chinese companies due to security concerns.
It also bucks months of political pressure from a group of U.S. senators led by Republican Marco Rubio and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, who this month introduced legislation dubbed the TSP Act to block TSP from making the benchmark switch. The House of Representatives has introduced a similar bill.
In a statement, Rubio described the decision as ""unconscionable"" and ""foolish,"" adding: ""The Board's refusal to act in the best interests of the United States will not go without consequence. I urge my colleagues to quickly pass our bipartisan and bicameral TSP Act.""
The FRTIB said in a letter to the senators that its decision to use the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index as the benchmark for its international stock fund came after recommendations from a consulting firm. 
That firm said investing in emerging market stocks, which have outperformed developed markets in recent years, was in line with nearly all other major public and private pension plans.
""It is imperative that the Board provide TSP participants with the same opportunities to save for their retirement as are afforded to every other American,"" the FRTIB wrote. 
The FRTIB is a fiduciary of the TSP, which is like a 401(k). As of July, it held $599.5 billion in assets. 
MSCI CEO Henry Fernandez said last month that limiting capital flows to China would have a ""devastating impact on global markets."" But some investment experts said the Senators were right to question whether U.S. federal funds should invest in companies that may be acting against U.S. interests. 
Steven Schoenfeld, chief investment officer of BlueStar Indexes, said investors should ""look under the hood"" of their index funds to assess both investment and policy risk.
""Particularly in emerging markets, fiduciaries should carefully assess the risks posed by certain 'bad actor' companies in their portfolios,"" he added.

If the U.S. Treasury were to ban investing in a country or companies, they would be dropped from the index, it wrote.

But concerns about the China-U.S. trade dispute was keeping gains in check.

Disney's (NYSE:DIS) gain of more than 4.6% was worth more than two-thirds of the Dow's 0.3% gain on the day after reporting 10 million users of its new Disney+ streaming service. Also boosting the blue-chip index were Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG),   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).

The S&P 500 was up 0.14%, with the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes up a small 0.07% each.

Powell told Congress' Joint Economic Committee that he remains comfortable with the Fed's key federal funds rate at 1.5% to 1.75%. The rate nicely supports an economy with low unemployment and low inflation, he said. He did warn that sky-high deficits were unsustainable. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool sees almost no chance of a rate change at the Fed's December meeting, with rates likely to remain stable until at least through spring.


The China-U.S. trade fight was looming over the market after The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese insistence that existing tariffs on Chinese imports be removed is proving a big challenge in getting the two sides to commit to a phase one agreement. The tariff issue has been dogging the negotiations for months.

MILAN (Reuters) -  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) is set to roll out the Roma, a record fifth new model this year for the 'Prancing Horse', as it expands its stable to help sustain its profit and share price growth.
The new grand tourer (GT) will make its debut on Thursday in Italy's capital in an event inspired by Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"".
GTs are more comfortable on long journeys than high-performance sports cars and models from the 1960s, some seating four, are among the most popular at auctions and among Ferrari enthusiasts. Ferrari has said previously that about 40% of its total sales could come from GT models by 2022, up from 32% now.
The Roma will be a 2+ coupé, meaning it has two small rear-seats, Ferrari said on Wednesday, without disclosing its price. 
""With its distinctive flair and style, the car is a contemporary representation of the carefree, pleasurable way of life that characterised Rome in the 1950s and 1960s,"" the Italian luxury carmaker added. 
It will feature a 620-horsepower, 3.85 liter eight cylinder mid-front mounted engine. 
This year's other new releases include another GT, the 812 GTS, presented in September, which the company described as a return for a model type that has played a ""pivotal role in the marque's history"", as well as the F90 Stradale, Ferrari's first hybrid car in series-production.
Chief Executive Louis Camilleri said last week the hybrid SF90 Stradale was attracting ""huge interest"" despite initial skepticism by clients used to roaring combustion engines. 
Ferrari has also promised several special edition hybrid cars and a utility vehicle, the Purosangue, which is expected by late 2022 as it seeks to almost double core earnings and boost margins to above 38%, without sacrificing exclusivity.
It is set to slow the roll-out of new vehicles in the coming years, as it planned to launch 15 models between 2019 and 2022, while achieving a significant increase in average retail price.
Chairman John Elkann has said that Ferrari, which shipped fewer than 10,000 cars last year, would not try to chase German rival  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p) which makes more than 250,000 sports cars and SUVs annually.

To capitalize further on its name, Ferrari plans new apparel and accessory collections, entertainment offers, and luxury products and services for clients.

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 01:56PM ET</span>",Woodford analysis suggests investors may lose a third of their money,"By Sinead Cruise, Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors in British money manager Neil Woodford's flagship fund could lose more than 1 billion pounds, four times more than had it reopened in December, according to estimates made by his firm before the shock closure of the fund. 
The 3 billion pound ($3.84 billion) LF Woodford Equity Income Fund, backed by more than 300,000 investors, many of them small savers, failed because its exposure to hard-to-sell stocks meant it could not meet a flood of redemption requests after a phase of disappointing performance and asset revaluations.
The move to wind down the fund in October following a four-and-a-half month suspension sent shockwaves through the City and marked a stunning reversal of fortune for Woodford, one of the UK's most high profile investors.
An impact assessment analysis seen by Reuters and dated Oct. 11, four days before administrator Link Fund Solutions suddenly announced it was closing the fund, shows savers facing losses of up to 36% on their investments, according to projections made by Woodford Investment Management.
The losses, which would be realized after a 12-month period of selling the fund's assets, would be four times greater than the estimated 'worst case' scenario foreseen if the fund had reopened in December, the original deadline Woodford was given to meet redemption requests, the documents show.
Although investors won't know exactly how much they will receive until all the assets have been sold, the vast difference is likely to spark further scrutiny of Link's handling of the fund's suspension and its decision to close it. 
The assessment included three other projected returns based on the fund reopening in December, the worst of which was a 9% loss reflecting a write-down of the fund's entire unlisted technology portfolio to zero.
Two other scenarios, based on selling stakes in Industrial Heat and Mafic -- among the fund's biggest unlisted holdings --at 50% and 75% discounts, resulted in total estimated losses of 7.2% and 7.9% respectively, the document showed.
A source familiar with the matter said Link declined an opportunity to review Woodford's analysis before taking the decision to shutter the fund.
A spokesman for Link declined to comment on whether executives had refused to look at the analysis. 
The administrator has also declined to supply details on alternative analyses used in its decision-making process, saying that to do so would not be in investors' interests.
A second source familiar with the matter said it was plausible that investors could end up losing a third of their money.
OUSTED 
Link, the legal and regulatory owner of the fund, told investors on Sept. 23 that it was monitoring the repositioning of the fund, with a view to a reopening in December. 
But on Oct. 14, Link said it had decided to wind up the fund entirely, ousting Woodford and appointing BlackRock (N:BLK) to sell off the remaining liquid stocks and PJT Partners to dispose of harder-to-sell assets.
In an emailed statement to Reuters, the spokesman for Link said the firm decided to close the fund because it was no longer confident it would be able to reopen until the listed and unlisted assets had all been sold.
""The demand for redemptions at the point of reopening might consume a very large proportion of the liquid assets, risking a renewed suspension and the unequal treatment of investors,"" the spokesman said.
Link declined to comment on the size of the redemptions queue or on whether redemptions were greater than the cash accumulated from disposals made between the fund's June 3 suspension and Oct. 14.
In a letter dated Oct. 15, Link told investors they would start getting their money back in stages from Jan. 2020. It has not provided estimates on how much savers could receive or how long it might take for all assets to be sold.
The surprise decision to close the fund prompted Woodford to close Woodford Investment Management a day later, impacting investors in two other funds bearing his name.
The Oct. 11 analysis shows the fund had increased its proportion of highly liquid listed assets to 43% from 12%, while the least liquid assets had dropped to 23% from 34%. Link declined to comment on these figures.
In addition, formal bids on a substantial portfolio of illiquid biotech assets were due to be filed to PJT a few days after Link announced the closure of the fund, the first source said, raising questions about the timing of the decision.
A consortium led by life science investor WG Partners has since entered exclusive talks to buy the portfolio for close to 500 million pounds, two sources familiar with the matter said, with one source suggesting WG's bid reflected a discount of around 20%.

Th S&P 500 erased earlier losses to push gains to a second day, lead by defensive utility and real estate shares. The benchmark remained below yesterday’s mid-session record reached as part of a more than 7% rally since the start of October, fueled by hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal, waning recession fears and rate cuts.
Inflation data Wednesday did little to alter the view that the Federal Reserve is done easing and in no rush to hike as prices continue to rise at a tepid pace. Chairman Jerome Powell reinforced that thinking in his address to Congress, saying the Fed’s current policy is appropriate as long as the economy stays on track.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell the most in more than a week, while the dollar rose for the seventh time in eight sessions to the highest in a month. The yen advanced along with gold. West Texas crude rose to $57 a barrel.
“A couple of weeks ago, it looked like that phase one deal looked all but certain. I think the market started to price in a really positive outcome on the trade side,” said Jeff Mills, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust. “Although I do think that progress is moving in a positive direction, I think it would be foolish for us to assume that we’re going to move completely in a positive direction in trade without any type of intermittent setbacks.”
The prospect of a deal between the world’s two biggest economies has become key to sustaining a rally that drove American stocks to records, as it appears the Fed will be on the sidelines for a long time. The U.S. and China have yet to announce a new location or time to seal the agreement after an international gathering in Chile was canceled, and it’s unclear whether Trump’s renewed threats will move things forward.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday expressed sympathy toward allowing comedian and producer Byron Allen to pursue his racial bias lawsuit accusing cable television operator Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) of discriminating against black-owned channels.
Over the course of an hour of oral arguments, however, the justices struggled over whether a lower court that cleared the way for the $20 billion lawsuit against Comcast to proceed had reviewed the case under the proper legal standard.
Their ruling, due by the end of June, could impact the ability of plaintiffs to enforce claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, a post-Civil War law that forbids racial discrimination in business contracts.
At issue in the litigation is the refusal by Comcast to carry channels operated by Entertainment Studios Networks, owned by Byron Allen, who is black.
The case centers on whether a lawsuit like Allen's can proceed to trial without showing that racial discrimination was the predominant cause of the denial.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year said lawsuits may go ahead if plaintiffs can show that discriminatory intent was one factor among others in the denial of a contract.
During Wednesday's arguments, several justices raised doubts that the standard to sustain a lawsuit should be as stringent as Comcast suggests.
Chief Justice John Roberts wondered why, if ""clear racial animus"" occurred at one step of a failed contract negotiation, it would not be reasonable to allege in a lawsuit that the discrimination carried through to the end.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that such discrimination lawsuits are rarely thrown out at an early stage of litigation.
Both liberal and conservative justices, however, raised questions indicating that the appeals court decision siding with Allen may have to be set aside and reconsidered in light of their eventual ruling.
Entertainment Studios Networks sued in Los Angeles federal court, accusing certain cable companies including Comcast and  Charter Communications  Inc (O:CHTR) of violating the civil rights law.
Comcast and Charter said their business decisions were based on capacity constraints, not race, and that Allen's channels, including JusticeCentral.TV, Cars.TV, and Comedy.TV, did not show sufficient promise or customer demand to merit distribution.
Other distributors, including  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ), AT&T Inc (N:T) and DirecTV, carry some of Allen's programming, court papers said.
Allen pinned the rejections primarily on racial discrimination, accusing cable executives of giving insincere or invalid excuses and granting contracts to carry white-owned networks during the same period.
The Trump administration backed Comcast in the case."

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 10:48AM ET</span>",Biotech-for-hire PeptiDream charts new path and becomes short target,"By Rocky Swift
TOKYO (Reuters) - The promise of PeptiDream Inc's drug-discovery technology and its lucrative research-for-hire contracts have made it a darling of the Tokyo stock market. Now, those gains have made it a target for short-seller Muddy Waters. 
The company, which has seen its market value jump fivefold to $6 billion over the past four years, is now pivoting its strategy to in-house research, using its technology that allows it to create libraries of peptide chemicals that can bind drugs to cells. 
Muddy Waters Capital LLC says that the biotech company's new, and traditional, businesses are flawed and is betting its shares will fall back to earth as a result. 
Since its listing in 2013, PeptiDream has grown from a lab start-up into a company with the highest profit margins in the Japanese pharmaceutical industry - without ever having brought a drug to market. Its technology has attracted a bevy of partners including Novartis AG, Merck & Co and Shionogi & Co. 
""We're on the cusp of over the next 1-5 years of introducing a multitude of drugs into the clinic through our big pharma and strategic partnerships,"" PeptiDream President Patrick Reid told Reuters in an interview. 
""We'd rather get 5% of 100 drugs than get 100% of five drugs,"" he said. He estimates that around half of all drugs being worked on by PeptiDream partners are cancer drugs. 
PeptiDream's rocketing market value has been helped by its traditional fees for collaborating in R&D and licensing deals to use its libraries. Its operating profit margin is 50%, the highest of all 37 members in the Tokyo market's pharma index, where the average is 14%. 
MUDDY WATERS DEALS DISPUTE
However the shares of the Kawasaki-based company fell 4 percent on the Nov. 7 release of Muddy Water's report, which doubted the viability of many of its existing partnerships and said investors were ""deluded as to its potential for commercializing drugs"".
""There's real technology there, but it's the usefulness of the technology that we question,"" Muddy Waters founder Carson Block said in an interview with Reuters. ""It's cool, but so far it's been unable to yield anything that's meaningful.""
PeptiDream was now ""massively overvalued"", Block said, adding that ""many of these partnerships that are the basis of this valuation seem inactive"". 
PeptiDream's Reid declined to comment on the Muddy Waters report, referring to a company statement that ""completely rejects"" the short-seller's assertions.
The company says it has 19 discovery and development partners, predominantly big to mid pharma firms. Among its 101 programs in progress, compared with 60 in 2017, two are cancer-related compounds being developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) now in phase 1 clinical studies.
Twelve of PeptiDream's partners told Reuters their partnerships were active and ongoing, including pharma giants Bristol-Myers, Merck, Novartis,  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) and  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN).
Japan's Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp declined to comment on the status of its relationship. The other six companies did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Block declined to name a price target for PeptiDream or the size of its short strategy, which pays off when a stock falls.
PeptiDream's shares are trading about 5% lower than before the release of Block's report. PeptiDream is the second short play in Japan for Muddy Waters, which became famous for its bearish calls on Chinese companies. Muddy Waters announced a short bet on Nidec Corp in December 2016. Shares in the maker of precision motors have since risen more than 60%.
""It's a bunt single, and that's better than a strikeout,"" Block said of PeptiDream's share fall, referring by bunt single to a baseball play that sees a batter eke out a small gain.
""Japan's potentially interesting. We might look to come back and hit some more bunt singles and see if we can build up a brand.""
PROTEIN HULA HOOPS
PeptiDream's research partners do the heavy lifting in bringing drugs through clinical trials to market - allowing the company to avoid much of the large development costs and risks. 
Even so, as the company increasingly looks to keep some ownership of its research, it will still receive future milestone payments and royalties. 
On top of its research partnerships, it also has seven license agreements for its library or drug-discovery platform.
PeptiDream concentrates on ""constrained peptides"", particularly macrocyclic peptides - hula hoops of natural and non-natural amino acids that can carry various cargoes to specific types of cells - such as cancer or inflamed tissue.
Founded in 2006, the company sprang out of the research of University of Tokyo professor Hiroaki Suga. Suga looked to Reid, then an associate professor at the university, to help forge the connections to big pharma.
As discoveries related to antibody and small-molecule treatments dwindle, peptide-based compounds are likely to become increasingly important as a class of drugs, said Bernstein analyst Shen He, who has an ""outperform"" on the stock. 
""PeptiDream is one of the best technology platforms out there to solve this,"" He said. ""But it's not an overnight journey.""

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 10:34AM ET</span>",London forex trader accuses Citigroup of unfair dismissal,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A former top  Citigroup  (N:C) trader, who was fired in 2014 but acquitted of foreign exchange-rigging charges after a trial in New York, told a London employment tribunal he was unfairly dismissed despite being in the ""eye of the storm"" at the time.
Rohan Ramchandani, who headed European spot forex trading, has already filed a $112 million-plus case against Citigroup in New York, alleging the bank framed him by making false and malicious statements to U.S. prosecutors after sacking him.
Citigroup, which has paid more than $2 billion in fines and civil settlements to date over forex allegations, says it will vigorously contest Ramchandani's claims.
""Individual accountability continues to be important to Citi, and for that reason we are disputing Ramchandani's request for compensation, reinstatement and re-engagement at the employment tribunal,"" it said in a statement.
The former Citigroup veteran, who says he first heard of his dismissal when his manager phoned him on holiday in India, told the east London tribunal on Wednesday he had had no opportunity to explain potentially confusing or misleading electronic chats.
Ramchandani conceded that his name was bandied about in news reports in 2013 as British and U.S. authorities honed in on allegations of price-fixing in the $6.6 trillion-per-day currency markets.
But he told the tribunal: ""I do not accept it was fair for me to put me on leave when the bank said there were issues about my chats (electronic communications).""
Ramchandani alleges he was fired without a disciplinary process and was given no right of appeal. The former trader, whose annual pay stood at around 1.0 million pounds, is seeking a pay-out of around 80,000 pounds ($102,000) and either his old job back or a comparable role.
But if the court agrees he should be reinstated or re-engaged in a different role, he is eligible for compensation equal to the pay and benefits he would have accrued if he had not been dismissed.
The former London-based trader was one of three who were members of electronic chatrooms in which dealers were alleged to have shared sensitive client order information.
A global investigation into alleged forex manipulation, that kicked off in 2013, resulted in some of the world's biggest banks paying fines of more than $11 billion. Dozens of traders were fired.
Citibank, which says Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) watchdog prohibited it from sharing information with Ramchandani about chats it had identified as concerning, has conceded that his dismissal was ""procedurally unfair"".
But it alleges that senior managers ""were clear that his conduct had precipitated an irreparable breakdown in trust and confidence""."

(Reuters) - Wall Street edged lower on Wednesday as President Donald Trump's threat to ""substantially"" raise tariffs if China did not make a trade deal with the United States as well as escalating tensions in Hong Kong kept investors away from riskier assets.
Trump on Tuesday dangled the prospect of completing an initial deal with China ""soon,"" but offered no new details on negotiations and largely repeated well-worn rhetoric about China's ""cheating"" on trade.
Technology stocks had lifted the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (IXIC) to all-time highs in the run up to Trump's speech on Tuesday, but the indexes pulled back slightly after his address at the Economic Club of New York.
""Now is more the realization that 'phase one' is really not a done deal,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""It felt for a couple weeks that the deal was almost done and then you have these comments that sort of puts us in the same place we were.""
Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. The financial sector (SPSY) fell 0.65%, tracking a drop in benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields and weighing the most.
The trade-sensitive industrial sector (SPLRCI) was also among the biggest drags, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.87%.
Heightened tensions in Hong Kong also dulled sentiment after police warned violence related to anti-government protests had reached a deadly level and that the Asian financial hub had been pushed to the ""brink of a total breakdown"".
Wall Street's main indexes have touched new highs this month on the back of a strong corporate earnings season and hopes of a trade deal to end the damaging 16-month tariff war.
U.S. central bankers see a ""sustained expansion"" ahead for the country's economy, with the full impact of recent interest rate cuts still to be felt, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in his prepared remarks for testimony that is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. ET (1600 GMT).
On the economic front, data showed U.S. consumer prices rebounded more than expected in October and underlying inflation picked up.
At 10:03 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 16.71 points, or 0.06%, at 27,674.78, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 4.11 points, or 0.13%, at 3,087.73 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 16.84 points, or 0.20%, at 8,469.26.

 Tech Data Corp  (O:TECD) gained 4% after announcing private equity Apollo Global Management (N:APO) would buy the U.S. company in a deal valued at $5.4 billion.

1587,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 10:07AM ET</span>",Powell Says Policy Appropriate Amid Noteworthy Risks to Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the current stance of monetary policy is likely to be sufficient provided the economy stays on track, but warned that “noteworthy risks” remain to the record U.S. expansion.
“We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook,” Powell said Wednesday in remarks prepared for delivery to the congressional Joint Economic Committee in Washington. “However, noteworthy risks to this outlook remain.”
Powell, whose comments largely echoed his message on Oct. 30 after the Fed’s third rate cut this year, said slowing global growth and trade developments pose “ongoing risks.” He added that persistently low inflation could lead to an “unwelcome” slide in the public’s longer-run expectations of inflation.
Powell, who is scheduled to begin his appearance at 11 AM ET (16:00 GMT), said the Federal Open Market Committee cut the policy rate, which is now in a range of 1.5% to 1.75%, to support growth and move inflation back to the 2% target. He added that the committee was prepared to respond to a “material reassessment” of its outlook. The speech suggests the Fed chairman is still attentive to downside risks though policy makers would need to see an accumulation of data before changing rates again.
Powell and the Fed have been relentlessly criticized by President Donald Trump, who has blamed the central bank’s policies, rather than the U.S.-China trade war, for a slowdown in the U.S. economy as he ramps up his 2020 re-election campaign.
“We’re paying actually high interest. We should be paying by far the lowest interest,” Trump said Tuesday in New York, complaining that by shunning the negative interest rates deployed by other central banks, the Fed “puts us at a competitive disadvantage.”
U.S. economic data has continued to show strength among households and financial conditions have eased with stocks touching record highs on Wall Street this month. Consumer sentiment improved for a third month in November, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index, while employers added 128,000 new jobs in October. Powell said the Fed expected some easing in the pace of job gains after last year’s strong pace.
Manufacturing and business investment continue to lag. A gauge of U.S. manufacturing signaled the sector contracted for a third straight month with the weakest production level since the last recession.
“Looking ahead, my colleagues and I see a sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2% objective as most likely,” Powell said."

Asia's biggest fashion retailer by sales, and the world's second-biggest after Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), last year said it would invest 100 billion yen ($916.59 million) to increase automation at its facilities.
Japanese robotics controller maker Mujin Inc and French robotics startup Exotec Solutions SAS will help introduce more automation at global warehouses, including in picking and shipping processes, Fast Retailing said in a statement.
Known for its affordable line of casual clothing such as lightweight down jackets, Fast Retailing's Uniqlo has grown through decades of weak consumption in Japan.
It is currently enjoying strong growth in China, with the brand logging over 1 billion yuan ($142.98 million) worth of sales during the 24-hour Singles' Day shopping festival of e-commerce powerhouse  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).
However, the unit has struggled with inefficiencies, occasionally blaming unseasonable weather for poor sales and excess inventory - an issue Fast Retailing hopes to address with shorter lead times and improved logistics.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 09:12AM ET</span>",Alibaba launches $13.4 billion Hong Kong listing to fund expansion,"By Scott Murdoch and Jennifer Hughes
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group launched the share sale for its Hong Kong listing on Wednesday, braving unrest in the global financial hub to try to raise up to $13.4 billion to fund its expansion plans. 
The books for institutional investors looking to buy the shares opened during the New York trading session on Wednesday.
A 661-page draft prospectus for what looks set to be the world's biggest cross-border secondary listing shows Alibaba plans to use the money to invest in online delivery and local services platform Ele.me, as well as online travel group Fliggy.
It will also spend more on developing Youku, which Alibaba says is one of the leading online video platforms in China.
The share sale, set to be Hong Kong's largest in more than nine years, is a boost for the city, which has sunk into its first recession in a decade as more than five months of street protests and worries about the U.S.-China trade war took their toll.
The progress of the protests is being monitored by Alibaba and its advisers, and is seen as a risk to the deal going ahead, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter. 
The institutional book-building for the listing will run for a week and the stock is expected to be priced on or around Nov. 20, two sources with direct knowledge of the process said. 
A maximum price for the retail component of the deal will be announced next week, one said.
The people could not be named because the information has not yet been made public. Alibaba stock is due to start trading the week of Nov. 25.
The company also intends to increase its investment in cloud computing and machine learning, the prospectus shows.
The Hangzhou-based company said Alibaba Cloud was currently the world's third largest Infrastructure as a Service business, by U.S. revenue in 2018, according to a study by Gartner.
The prospectus shows Alibaba has 960 million 'digital economy users' in China, including customers of its Ant Financial partnership.
The company said its revenue was 410.8 billion renminbi for the year to June 30, 2019, and the total assets on its balance sheet were worth 1.01 trillion renminbi. 
DISCOUNT
Alibaba had been planning to sell the shares earlier this year, but in August postponed the deal as the anti-government protests rocking Hong Kong since June became increasingly violent.
However, a source familiar with the transaction said Alibaba was confident it could overcome the negative sentiment in Hong Kong financial markets caused by the demonstrations.
The deal had been initially expected to raise up to $15 billion, but 500 million primary shares will now be sold in the listing. Including a typical ""greenshoe"", or overallotment option, to sell some extra shares, the sale could raise up to $13.4 billion.
A sale of that size would dilute existing shareholders from the company's New York listing by 2.8%, and investors would be able trade shares between the two exchanges.
The Hong Kong shares are expected to be offered at a discount of up to 5% of the U.S. equivalent.
At $13.4 billion, Alibaba’s share sale would rank as the world’s largest follow-on share sale targeting an entirely new stock exchange, according to data from Dealogic. 
Alibaba holds the world record for an initial public offering (IPO) with its $25 billion New York flotation in 2014, but could shortly lose the crown to Saudi Arabia’s Aramco. 

The oil producer is expected to raise between $20 billion and $40 billion in an IPO expected to price in the coming weeks. 
 
"
1593,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 09:01AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Is Latest Bank to Offer $1 Trillion Aramco Spread,"(Bloomberg) --  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is one of the most bearish -- and bullish -- on Saudi Aramco’s valuation.
In a presentation for investors, Morgan Stanley bankers ran through several valuation models that gave a spread of about $1 trillion between the most bearish and bullish scenarios.
For example, based on a dividend discount model the spread ran from $1.06 trillion up to $2 trillion. The base case was $1.52 trillion, according to the presentation seen by Bloomberg. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
Morgan Stanley isn’t alone in struggling to pinpoint exactly how much Aramco is worth. Valuation has been a sticking point since the IPO was first touted in 2016. Aramco faces a delicate balance as it seeks to push its IPO valuation as close as possible to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s $2 trillion -- a figure that’s been met with skepticism from many professional investors -- while making sure it’s attractive to potential Saudi buyers.
Range of some of the banks with the IPO mandate:
Another Morgan Stanley scenario shows a valuation of between $1 trillion and $2.2 trillion, according to the presentation. A third model shows a range of $1.07 trillion and $2.5 trillion.
Among 16 banks that offered a valuation, the range in estimates ran from $1.1 trillion at the bottom right up to $2.5 trillion, a number that even the crown prince might find optimistic. The midpoint was $1.75 trillion, according to people who’ve reviewed all the research.
This $1.4 trillion spread between the top and low end of valuations is more than the combined market capitalizations of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), the world’s three largest publicly listed energy companies.
Ultimately, investors will decide. The price range for the IPO will be announced on Nov. 17 and bookbuilding for the offering will start the same day.

(Reuters) - Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' Comstock Resources is in talks to buy Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) Corp's Haynesville shale assets in Louisiana, according to two people familiar with the matter.
A deal could be worth more than $1 billion, one of the people said, adding that the companies have settled on a structure for the deal and hope to reach an agreement by the end of the year. 
The people declined to be identified because the talks are confidential. They said there was no guarantee the talks would be concluded successfully and that the deal could still be subject to change.
Comstock and Chesapeake did not respond to emails, phone calls and messages requesting comment on the deal.
Debt-laden Chesapeake, once the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, warned last week it may not be able to continue as a going concern as it struggles with falling prices for natural gas.
Shares in the company have fallen for six straight sessions since and, after they fell another 17% on Tuesday, the company issued a statement saying it was pursuing ""strategic levers to reduce debt, including asset sales, capital markets transactions, and focus on cost discipline.""
Shares of the Oklahoma City-based company are now worth around 67 cents, compared to a peak of just below $70 in 2008. It has about $9.7 billion in total net debt and warned it may breach covenants if commodity prices do not rebound next year. 
A deal with Comstock would see Chesapeake depart from the shale region that it helped bring to prominence in 2008 with discoveries that led it to claim the area could hold 20 trillion cubic feet equivalent of potential reserves.
Chesapeake has been reducing its activity in the Haynesville region and last week said it was releasing its rigs and completion crews for the rest of the year. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30 it said production from the field was 694 million cubic feet of gas per day.
Jones' Comstock became the largest operator in Haynesville after buying privately held Covey Park in a $1.1 billion deal in June. 

Comstock shares have risen 52% so far this year, while Chesapeake shares have fallen 68%.

BARCELONA/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Takeaway.com (AS:TKWY) Chief Executive Jitse Groen said on Wednesday he did not intend to increase a 4.3 billion pound ($5.5 billion) offer for Britain's  Just Eat  (L:JE), despite a higher unsolicited bid from larger rival  Prosus  (AS:PRX).
A Takeaway-Just Eat tie-up, which is backed by Just Eat's boards, would create more value in the long run, Groen told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Barcelona.
Asked whether he would sweeten the bid, Groen said: ""no"".
""The combination is the new Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com, for investors that is the thing to think about,"" he said, referring to the online service that grew to dominate its sector by offering the largest selection of hotels and an easy-to-use ordering app.
Groen, who owns 25% of Takeaway himself, said the deal has ""a lot"" of support from Just Eat shareholders.
""Because they are the same shareholders, there's a lot of overlap. People know our track record,"" he said.
Prosus's cash offer of 710 pence values Just Eat at around $6.3 billion and is currently 12% higher than Takeaway's all-share offer of 634 pence. Just Eat shares were trading at 734.4 pence at 1204 GMT, a signal investors still believe a higher offer is on the cards.
Investor Cat Rock, which holds 5.69% of Takeaway shares and 2.6% of Just Eat, has said it backs the merger and opposes the Prosus bid as insufficient.
However, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Eminence Capital with 4.92% and 4.26% of Just Eat respectively have said they consider the Takeaway offer too low.
Prosus, which has argued it has more resources to invest after poor third quarter results from Just Eat, responded on Wednesday by saying that Takeaway underestimates ""the level of investment required in a sector that is changing rapidly"".
""Ours is the only offer that provides the certainty of cash to shareholders at an attractive and fair value,"" it said.
Takeaway also said on Wednesday it would introduce Takeaway's branded delivery service in Britain and combine the two companies' IT systems to save on costs.
Those changes would cost ""tens of millions"" of euros in the short term but would strengthen the combination's competitive position and lead to long-term growth, it added."
1597,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 07:24AM ET</span>",Tencent Profit Misses Lowest Estimate as Economy Sputters,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. (HK:0700) posted quarterly earnings that missed the lowest analyst’s estimate after a weakening economy hurt advertising revenue.
Net income fell 13% to 20.4 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in the September quarter, well below the 23.5 billion-yuan average of estimates. The Chinese social media and entertainment behemoth reported a 90% drop in one-time gains -- an item that tracks its vast portfolio of startups around the world -- after swallowing charges for investments in connected automobiles. Shares in Prosus NV, which groups largest shareholder Naspers Ltd.’s internet holdings, fell as much as 4%.
China’s economic slowdown is dousing revenue growth across Tencent’s platforms, dampening appetite for advertising among large brands as well as subscriptions to its video and music streaming services. Sales from media advertising, including on the Netflix-like Tencent Video service, plummeted 28% as marketers cut spending while major shows got delayed. Beijing’s decision to cap playing time for underage users is also prompting Tencent to spend more on producing AAA-rated mobile titles that appeal to a global audience, such as Call of Duty Mobile.
“The results were unbearable,” said David Dai, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Bernstein. “Games and media advertising were especially bad.”
Tencent’s sprawling gaming empire had helped offset some of the weakness in advertising growth, a consequence of a slowing Chinese economy as well as competition from the likes of ByteDance Inc. Revenue from the Value Added Services unit, which includes sales from online games and messaging service WeChat, climbed 15%. WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging service, had 1.15 billion monthly active users as of the end of September.
For this quarter, Tencent hit pay dirt with its smartphone adaptation of Call of Duty -- one of the world’s best-selling franchises. The game garnered more than 100 million downloads in the first week, putting it ahead of Nintendo Co (T:7974).’s Mario Kart Tour. That was four times more than Fortnite’s mobile version managed.
“Video ads and subscribers remain under pressure,” Jerry Liu, a Hong Kong-based analyst at UBS, said in a report. “Investors are pricing in lower structural growth in gaming, pressure in advertising growth due to macro and competition, and more regulatory headwinds in online content.”
Longer term, Tencent owns stakes in some of the biggest U.S. game studios and publishers, including the outfits that created household names Fortnite, League of Legends and World of Warcraft. The Chinese company is now counting on converting popular PC content for smartphones to re-kindle growth. The pipeline for such content stretches into 2022, the company says.
Revenue rose 21% to 97.2 billion yuan. Shares of Tencent were mostly unchanged in Hong Kong Wednesday before earnings were announced. The stock has increased 4.3% this year, compared with a 36% rise for New York-listed  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
Despite a tumultuous year, Tencent President Martin Lau said in February the company wouldn’t scale back on investment. The company has sunk money into more than 700 portfolio companies, including 122 that have become unicorns worth $1 billion or more. In China, its portfolio companies are worth roughly $107 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>","Unilever appoints Nils Andersen as chairman, replacing Dekkers","By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) named Danish businessman Nils Andersen as chairman on Wednesday, hoping his experience of consumer goods and logistics will help the group navigate a slowdown in its biggest markets and re-energize its foods business.
Andersen, a non-executive director on Unilever's board since 2015, comes in alongside Scotsman Alan Jope who took over as CEO earlier this year. He replaces Marijn Dekkers, who is standing down after more than three years as chairman.
Jope wants to carve out more market share for Unilever's foods, but faces a challenge in low-growth categories like tea, bouillon, mayo and condiments. Unilever has changed internal leadership of foods twice in the last two years, but sales still remain muted in the business known for Hellmann's mayonnaise and Magnum ice-cream.
He also faces signs of a slowdown in India and China, two of the company's biggest markets. The Sino-U.S. trade war and sluggish domestic consumption are weighing on China's economy and irregular monsoons have curbed rural spending in India.
Andersen, 61, joined Unilever after heading shipping giant AP Moller Maersk A/S (CO:MAERSKb) and brewer Carlsberg A/S (CO:CARLb). 
At Maersk, where he served as CEO between 2007 and 2016, he was credited with bringing customer centricity and exceeding international growth targets, but the stock price fell a third during his tenure and the board decided to steer the old conglomerate in a new direction.
At Carlsberg, where he ran the company since 2001, the share price doubled in the two years before he moved to Maersk.
His predecessor at Unilever, Marijn Dekkers, who is founder and chairman of investment and advisory firm Novalis LifeSciences, will remain on the board as a non-executive director. 
Dekkers became a target of investor ire last year for trying to consolidate the Lipton tea maker's dual headquarter structure in Rotterdam, dropping London. 
The plan, devised with Unilever's former Dutch CEO Paul Polman, was scrapped after shareholders opposed the move on fears it could remove one of UK's best known companies from the benchmark FTSE 100 index (FTSE).
Unilever's shares have risen 12% so far this year, outpacing the broader FTSE 100's 9% rise. The stock was up 0.6% at 4,622 pence in afternoon trading. 
Andersen currently is part of Unilever's audit committee and serves as chairman of Dutch paint company  Akzo Nobel  NV (AS:AKZO) and privately held Danish retailer Salling Group A/S. He is also a non-executive director at  BP  (L:BP).

He intends to step down from his roles at BP and Salling Group A/S in March 2020, the company said on Wednesday.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 07:06AM ET</span>",EDF wants new-model nuclear reactor to be competitive with gas,"PARIS (Reuters) - French state-owned utility EDF (PA:EDF) wants an optimized version of its flagship EPR nuclear reactor to be cost-competitive with gas-fired power stations, its CEO said on Wednesday.
Jean-Bernard Levy told a French Senate hearing that EDF is working closely with its reactor unit Framatome to learn lessons from long-delayed reactor projects in Finland and Flamanville, France to improve the design of the EPR reactor model.
He said for an optimized EPR, EDF is targeting a cost level of 65 to 70 euros ($77) per megawatt hour over the reactor's 60-year lifespan, based on 2016 prices.
""For those (countries) who choose nuclear energy, we want to offer a price level that is on par with gas, with the additional advantages of energy independence and low-carbon power production,"" Levy said.
Solar and wind energy have long been cheaper than nuclear, but these renewable energies are intermittent. Like coal and gas, nuclear is always available, barring outages, but produces no carbon emissions and does not require fossil fuel imports.
Lazard's annual comparison of the ""Levelized Cost of Energy"" of various power generation technologies estimates the cost of new nuclear at $118 to $192 per MWh, compared to $32-$42 for utility-scale solar and $28-$54 for onshore wind.
It puts the cost of gas-fired generation at $44-$68 for combined cycle gas plants and $150-$199 for gas peaking plants, those that are only used during peak consumption periods.
Levy also said that in the future, debt-laden EDF would not be able to finance new nuclear plants on its balance sheet, but it would need alternative financing methods similar to Britain's ""Contract for Difference"" (CfD) model.
EDF is building two EPR reactors in Hinkley Point, Britain, with a contract under which the government guarantees a minimum price level for the power sold by the plant.
In October 2013, the UK government signed a 35-year electricity price guarantee contract with EDF under which the utility will receive a top-up fee if power prices fall below 92.50 pounds ($118) per MWh."

DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is likely to win an order for at least 100 jets from Air Arabia (DU:AIRA) with an announcement possibly coming as soon as the Dubai Airshow next week, two sources told Reuters.
The Emirati budget carrier has been considering the order for up to 120 jets, which would more than double its current fleet of 55 narrowbody aircraft, for more than a year. 
Air Arabia, which has held talks with both Airbus and Boeing (N:BA) and said it would make a decision by January, was expected to select the European planemaker, the two sources said. 
Airbus declined comment. Air Arabia did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
The Dubai Airshow runs from Nov 17 to 21.
The main operation of the United Arab Emirates' only listed airline is from Sharjah airport, about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from Dubai International Airport, the hub of Emirates airline. 
Air Arabia also operates from the UAE's Ras Al Khaimah airport and has ventures in Egypt and Morocco.
Last month it announced it was setting up a budget airline in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi with state-owned Etihad Airways. It is unclear when the carrier, Air Arabia Abu Dhabi, will begin operations. 
Air Arabia's fleet is currently only Airbus A320 family jets, meaning an Airbus order could provide it with operational consistency.
The decision would come as Boeing's 737 MAX jet remains grounded following two fatal crashes. 

Boeing has said it now expects the jet to resume commercial flights in January, pushing back its own target of this quarter.

The air force said the A400M had participated in nearly 1,700 missions and formed the backbone of its air transport, being used for carrying personnel and material, air-to-air refueling, returning soldiers needing medical care and in humanitarian aid missions.
It said 31 of a total of 53 ordered aircraft had already been handed over. But it said there were technical issues, such as with nuts on propellers, and extra time was needed for inspections which would have a negative impact on the readiness of the A400M fleet.
The air force added that extra inspections were also needed for testing engine mounts, crack detection on various parts, combustion chambers and engine flaps but despite these checks, the A400M was still not able to perform all tasks.
""The overall technical defects and the realization that the two planes due to be delivered also do not possess the characteristics that were guaranteed in the contract, have resulted in the armed forces not taking these aircraft,"" the Luftwaffe, or air force, said in a statement.
The A400M was commissioned in 2003 to give Europe an independent airlift capacity to support military or humanitarian missions, rather than relying on the  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130 or the now out-of-production Boeing (N:BA) C-17.

A 3.5-billion-euro bailout from Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey rescued the A400M program from cancellation in 2010 after delays and cost overruns.

(Reuters) - European shares retreated from four-year highs on Wednesday, as a highly anticipated speech by U.S. President Donald Trump gave scant clues on the progress of a trade deal with China, and as anti-government protests in Hong Kong raged on, denting sentiment.
Banks with significant exposure to Hong Kong such as HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) lost 2% and 1.5%. Downbeat earnings from Dutch bank ABN Amro (AS:ABNd) also hurt the banking sector (SX7P), which fell 2.2%.
Parts of the Asian financial hub were paralyzed as the months-long unrest continued. Protesters hurled bricks onto roads lined with some of the world's most expensive real estate and luxury flagship stores.
On the trade front, Trump on Tuesday reiterated that United States is close to signing a 'phase one' trade deal with China, but would only accept a deal that is good for his country, offering no new details on negotiations at a speech made to the Economic Club of New York. 
That hit trade-sensitive exporting sectors with mining stocks (SXPP) slipping 1.6%, while the lack of details on possible U.S. tariffs on European carmakers weighed on auto stocks (SXAP), which fell 1.8%.
""Equity markets have priced in quite a lot of optimism that (a trade deal) is likely to happen. So, there is a little bit of disappointment that there wasn't a concrete proposal,"" said Ian Heslop, head of global equities at Merian Global Investors.
Germany's auto-heavy benchmark index (GDAXI) looked to post its biggest daily drop in a month. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.7% retreating from four-year highs hit on Tuesday.
A clear move into defensive stocks <.SDEFN> such as consumer stocks (SX3P) (SXQP), healthcare (SXDP) and utility shares (SX6P), underlined muted risk appetite. 
Spanish stocks (IBEX) led losses among regional peers, down 1.4%, extending a slide after Socialists and far-left Unidas Podemos formed a new coalition on Tuesday. The unexpectedly fast preliminary agreement was formed between two parties that recently refused to work together.
""I think its probably a concern that needs to seen to be played out in terms of what economic policy of the new government is likely to be,"" Merian's Heslop said.

Investing.com - Europe’s stock markets were in retreat again on Wednesday morning after President Donald Trump kept the world guessing about the future direction of U.S. trade policy with a speech that, on balance, did more to talk up the lingering risk of no trade deal with China.
By 4:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.7% at 404.18, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.6% and Germany’s DAX down 0.9%.
On another heavy day for earnings, Italian luxury group Salvatore Ferragamo (LON:0P52) stood out with a gain of 3.8% after posting figures that showed it had withstood a 45% drop in sales in Hong Kong in the quarter, thanks in large part to greater spending in mainland China.
Together with similar (if less dramatic) drops reported by   Kering   (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH), Ferragamo’s figures suggest that the biggest takeaway from the Hong Kong violence for Europe’s Asia-heavy luxury groups will be that Chinese shoppers can now easily replace trips to a shopping hub that was once unique in the region.
Elsewhere, Spanish banks continued to underperform amid fears for the future course of Spain’s economic policy under a prospective left-wing coalition. The center-left PSOE and far-left Unidos Podemos sealed a preliminary agreement on forming a new government on Tuesday, although they will still need votes from other parties to secure a stable majority in parliament.
Santander (MC:SAN) was down 3.2%, while BBVA (MC:BBVA) was down 2.4% and   Bankia   (MC:BKIA) – which depends more on the home market than either of its two bigger rivals – was down 4.4%. The IBEX 35 was down 1.4% and is now down 2.4% over the last week.
In the U.K., meanwhile, independent oil company   Tullow Oil   (LON:TLW) fell over 20% after announcing that the oil it had discovered in Guyana was a heavy, sour blend that would be hard to commercialize. Utility SSE (LON:SSE) rose 1.7% after first-half results that benefited from the reinstatement of payments by the U.K. capacity market which had previously been the subject of a challenge from the European Commission."

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday from four-year highs after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to ""substantially"" increase tariffs if China failed to agree a trade deal and also took a swipe at European Union trade policies. 
Concern is also growing that the intensifying unrest in Hong Kong could prompt a Chinese crackdown, pushing Hong Kong shares 2% lower and weighing on markets across Asia. 
MSCI's index of world shares slipped 0.2%, following a 1% fall in Asian shares outside Japan. Japan's Nikkei slipped almost 1%, moving further off last week's 13-month highs.
""The market was anticipating something more positive from Trump, but he didn't deliver,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, a portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management. 
""In recent weeks, we saw the balance of probabilities shift to the positive side, risks being taken off the table, but people have realized that risk is still there,"" Onuekwusi said. He's been reducing his equity allocations, he said.
Trump's speech threatened to raise tariffs on China, but he also said a trade deal was ""close"", without offering details on when or where it would be signed. He also criticized EU trade policies before a Nov. 14 deadline to decide whether to raise tariffs on European and Japanese carmakers.
That deadline will probably be extended, but investors remain jittery. A pan-European equity index opened half a percent lower, coming off Tuesday's four-year highs, when optimism before Trump's speech and better-than-expected economic indicators from Germany boosted stock.
An index of European auto companies slipped 1.3%. 
Brent crude oil futures were down 0.5%  Expectations for phase one of a trade deal this month have supported stocks and riskier assets recently. Investors were led to cut the share of cash in their portfolios to six-and-a-half-year lows, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's monthly survey of global managers.  The poll also showed growth optimism at 18-month highs. However, lack of progress on an agreement has started to increase doubts about whether a trade truce will happen at all. ""I'm absolutely concerned. The clock is ticking,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. ""Markets are now expecting substantial progress in the next week or so, and if not, then confidence could crumble."" Equity futures suggested U.S. stocks would open lower, with the S&P500 indicated down 0.2%. The S&P closed up on Tuesday, backing off record highs after Trump's speech. The S&P 500 has risen 2% this month and 23% so far in 2019 thanks to interest rate cuts, trade hopes and robust corporate earnings -- profits at three-quarters of S&P 500 companies have topped expectations this quarter, according to Refinitiv. European shares have gained 2.3% this month.  But a more prolonged standoff will revive fears for the world economy. Oxford Economics estimates the trade war has trimmed eight-tenths of a percentage point off U.S. growth. Having started 2019 with 3.1% growth, the economy eased to 1.9% in the third quarter, they noted Asian markets were also rattled, by Trump's speech and Hong Kong's turmoil.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 04:28AM ET</span>",J&J's Remicade losing ground in Quebec health plan despite court victory,"By Allison Martell and Allison Lampert
TORONTO/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson's Remicade, a blockbuster drug that treats autoimmune disorders, has steadily lost market share among patients enrolled in the Canadian province of Quebec's public drug program, even after a court ruling reinstated full coverage in January, a Reuters analysis of government data shows.
The plan's administrator stopped covering Remicade, J&J (NYSE:JNJ) unit Janssen's version of the drug infliximab, for some new patients in February 2017, in favor of cheap near-copies called biosimilars, mainly  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc's version of infliximab, called Inflectra. In January, a Quebec court ordered it to resume coverage.
Remicade's eroding market share underscores a gradual shift underway in Canada, where biosimilars have been slowly catching on with doctors and patients. The drug is under pressure elsewhere - in the third quarter, total global sales fell 17.6%.
Canadian governments have sought to boost the use of biosimilars as they try to bring down drug costs. 
In case of infliximab, biosimilars' market share rose to 11.4% in January 2019, from 0.7% in February 2017, according to Reuters analysis of data provided by the Quebec plan's administrator, the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ). 
For a graphic on Biosimilars gaining market share in Quebec plan:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/CANADA-PHARMACEUTICALS-BIOSIMILARS/0H001QXJ29D6/index.html
Resuming coverage of Remicade, as the court ordered, did not reverse Pfizer's gains. By August 2019, 13.4% of 2,164 patients were on the biosimilar: a single patient on Merck & Co Inc's biosimilar, Renflexis, with the rest on Pfizer's biosimilar.
That left some 86.6% of the market to J&J, down from nearly 100%. About 3.7 million people are enrolled in the plan.
Though Canada has about 2% of global drug sales, it had 16% of Remicade sales in 2017, about C$1 billion ($755.8 million), according to the country's Competition Bureau.
Janssen said Remicade's re-listing was part of its ""commitment to preserve patient and physician choice."" ""We strongly believe the use of biosimilars in Canada should be based on what physicians determine is in the best interest of their patients rather than being driven by efforts that restrict treatment choice in any way,"" the company said in a statement.
Janssen said it is proposing agreements with Canadian governments to ""provide the cost savings being sought.""
""TOO LATE"" 
Louis Bessette, a rheumatologist and professor at Université Laval in Quebec, said doctors in Quebec have gained more experience with biosimilars, and the court ruling did not change his prescribing choices. 
""We prescribe them more and more,"" he said of biosimilars. ""I think for Janssen it was too late, and there's no coming back."" 
But Bessette noted that overall, patients are generally unwilling to switch to biosimilars.
Those patients look to be the new frontier for Canadian governments: In May, the province of British Columbia said it would require thousands of patients on its public drug plan to switch to biosimilars. Health Canada says biosimilars are just as safe and effective, but some drugmakers and patient groups have pushed back. 
So far, Quebec has no switching policy. And Pfizer remains frustrated with slow biosimilar uptake in Canada. 
""This slow uptake undermines the potential value that biosimilars can offer and the savings they can bring to the health care system,"" Pfizer said in a statement. 
Pfizer said its internal data shows a recent decline in the number of new patients prescribed Inflectra, which the company attributes to the January court ruling. Comparing March to September 2019 to March 2017 to February 2019, they said, new enrollments dropped 30%. 
The RAMQ data obtained by Reuters shows that growth prescriptions for Inflectra and Remicade leveled off in early 2018. It is not clear what is behind this trend, which predates the court ruling. 
One possible explanation is competition from new drugs. Waqqas Afif, a gastroenterologist at McGill University Health Center in Montreal, said doctors are prescribing Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's Entyvio and Janssen's Stelara to some patients instead of infliximab.
Quebec's health ministry said in a statement it is working on a biosimilar policy but declined to go into detail on the options it is considering.

1609,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 04:14AM ET</span>","Apple Assembler Profit Beats, Signaling Strong iPhone 11 Demand","(Bloomberg) --   Hon Hai   Precision Industry Co. (TW:2317) reported quarterly profit above analysts’ estimates, indicating solid demand for Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 11 range.
The assembler of most of the world’s iPhones and iPads posted net income of NT$30.7 billion ($1 billion) for the September quarter, compared with an average estimate of NT$27.7 billion.
Apple last month forecast holiday revenue that surpassed Wall Street’s projections, suggesting healthy appetite for iPhone 11 models with lower entry prices and vastly improved cameras. It’s now said to expect iPhone shipments to return to growth in 2020 when it finally introduces its own 5G devices -- a boon to hardware suppliers such as Hon Hai and chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. coping with a decelerating smartphone market.
“The lower pricing of the iPhone 11 has been effective in driving demand past the Street’s expectations,” Sean Lin, an analyst at President Capital Management Corp., said in a Nov. 4 note.
Assembly partners like Hon Hai and TSMC typically begin gearing up for production weeks, if not months, ahead of a device’s commercial launch. The outlook for Apple and its suppliers remains overshadowed by an ongoing trade war. AirPods, Apple Watch, HomePod and other devices made in China have been hit with 15% tariffs, and U.S. President Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out the possibility of a levy on iPhones starting Dec. 15.
Hon Hai, which gets half its revenue from its Cupertino, California partner, previously reported NT$1.38 trillion in sales for the September quarter, barely changed from a year earlier according to Bloomberg’s calculations off monthly revenue numbers. Its shares closed down 1.4% ahead of the earnings on Wednesday, after gaining 27% this year."
1610,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 04:13AM ET</span>",Tesla Picks Germany for European Gigafactory,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
Elon Musk picked a glitzy event a few hours’ drive from the birthplace of the internal combustion engine to drop the news before some of the world’s biggest car bosses: Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) plans to set up shop in their backyard.
The billionaire chief executive officer announced Tuesday that Tesla will round out its global manufacturing network with a factory in Berlin. At a red carpet awards ceremony attended by the heads of BMW AG, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Audi AG, he said the company will also establish an engineering-and-design center near the city’s new airport.
“Some of the best cars in the world are obviously made in Germany,” Musk said while accepting a trophy for the Model 3, which beat out BMW and Audi sedans for midsize car of the year. He said the country is “not that far behind” in electric cars, while also acknowledging that the market for them is “unproven.”
The news wasn’t completely out of left field — Musk has said before that Tesla would announce the location for a factory in Europe before the end of this year, and that Germany was a frontrunner. But it nonetheless bolstered the CEO’s flair-for-the-dramatic reputation. Fresh off a surprise profit report that sent Tesla shares surging, he threw down the gauntlet in front of rival executives that no longer dismiss his company as a niche automaker.
“Elon Musk has an ability to make a splash,” said John Boyd, principal of an eponymous manufacturing site-selection firm based in Princeton, New Jersey. “Not only does Germany bring top-level manufacturing skill sets and positive supply chain dynamics to the table, but there is a cache value to Tesla establishing a brick-and-mortar presence in Germany — a nation synonymous with precision car manufacturing.”
Making a Statement
Musk has until now relied on a single auto assembly plant in Fremont, California, to build a $63 billion company. That facility is supported by the first of the company’s so-called gigafactories near Reno, Nevada, that makes batteries. Tesla is on the verge of starting sales of Model 3s produced at its latest production facility, near Shanghai.
While adding a European factory raises the stakes for established automakers already facing a serious threat from the electric upstart, it’s likely going to take time for the plant to get up and running. Musk estimated earlier this year that Tesla’s European gigafactory probably won’t be operational until 2021.
“The Berlin location serves two unique goals,” said Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “It’s strategic to lure German automotive talent to Tesla, and it’s a statement that Elon wants to one-up auto companies from that region.”
While the future of Germany’s electric-car market looks crowded, the politics of shifting away from the internal combustion engine also are going to be messy.  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, is running into labor-union resistance over where future electric cars will be produced ahead of a critical meeting with investors Thursday in London. Audi, the biggest profit contributor to VW Group, faces similar fights over safeguarding employment at its main German factories that specialize in sedans and station wagons.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government and local automakers have agreed to boost incentives for EVs, intensifying Germany’s effort to move away from the combustion engine to reduce exhaust emissions. Still, building vehicles in a country that has some of the highest labor and energy costs worldwide is bound to be a challenge. European customers also expect a network of dealers and repair shops to reliably handle maintenance and repair work, which Tesla has struggled with lately.
Demand Boost
Adding production in Germany and China will probably help Musk boost Tesla’s sales in those regions, according to Kevin Tynan, a Bloomberg Intelligence auto analyst. “The sustainability of the demand will be more the question,” he said. “And if local competition becomes real competition, it will be more difficult.”
The Berlin government announced last week that cash incentives will jump by 50% to as much as 6,000 euros ($6,680) per electric vehicle, with the auto industry covering half the cost. The changes will take effect this month and run through 2025.
For Musk, choosing greater Berlin for a factory was “surprising but not fallacious,” said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer director of Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen. Battery-cell manufacturing requires space, infrastructure and subsidies, and the city is a good fit for a premium brand like Tesla’s, he said.
Shortly after dropping the news, Musk sent out a pair of tweets to make sure it wouldn’t be missed by his 29.3 million Twitter followers. He said the factory will make batteries, powertrains and vehicles, beginning with the Model Y crossover unveiled earlier this year.
Tesla shares finished the trading day in New York up 1.4% to $349.93, their highest close since December 2018. The stock has surged 37% since the company reported a surprise quarterly profit on Oct. 23."

The decline at the Italian maker of leather pumps and silk scarves exceeded the impact estimated by some rival luxury companies. LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, previously said sales in the territory fell 25% during the quarter, while Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) reported a 35% drop.
Ferragamo offset the falling sales in Hong Kong with strong growth on the mainland, as China sales grew 15% excluding currency shifts in the first nine months of the year, the company said late Tuesday.
The stock rose as much as 3.5% in Milan trading on Wednesday. The management guided to a slight growth acceleration in the fourth quarter, according to Flavio Cereda, an analyst at Jefferies.
Cuts to value-added tax had already been encouraging Chinese shoppers to make more luxury purchases close to home rather than splashing out on shopping trips to Hong Kong and other tourist destinations.
The prolonged disruption is raising concerns about the territory’s future as a shopping destination. The city’s days as a luxury hub are numbered, according to Cereda, and brands are likely to rethink their presence there. Prada SpA is leading the exodus, planning to close its largest Hong Kong location in Causeway Bay after its lease expires next year.
Others are still saying they expect sales in the territory to bounce back. “It’s out of the question that we consider Hong Kong as something that may not be a strong business center in the years to come,” CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said on a call with analysts last month. “They are undergoing some difficulties for the time being, but we are fully confident that at some point they will recover.”

A Lion Air 737 MAX crashed shortly after take-off from Jakarta last year, killing all 189 people on board, and the model was grounded globally following a second deadly crash in Ethiopia in March this year. 
Indonesian investigators last month released a final report into the Lion Air crash that included recommendations to Boeing, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the airline on improving safety practices.
Boeing has been working to secure regulatory approval for proposed changes to an anti-stall system linked to both crashes before the model can resume flying.
""Indonesia is waiting for FAA and other big countries to recertify MAX,"" Sokhib Al Rokhman, head of the airworthiness and aircraft subdirectorate at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) told reporters in Jakarta on Wednesday.
""We are also increasing our cooperation with ASEAN countries once FAA publishes the recertification,"" he said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Boeing on Monday said it expected U.S. regulators to approve the 737 MAX's return to commercial service in the coming weeks but Europe's aviation regulator has indicated it will take longer.
Indonesia's decision on when to let 737 MAX jets fly in its airspace could have implications beyond local operators Lion Air and Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA).

Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) has said approvals by Indonesia and China might be needed before it returns regional arm Silkair's six 737 MAX jets to service, based on the routes they fly.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 02:46AM ET</span>",India's passive funds set to beat active funds for second year,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy
(Reuters) - India's passive index-tracking equity funds are set to beat their active stock-picking counterparts in returns for a second successive year as fund managers grapple with volatility and the challenges of outperforming benchmark indexes.
According to Refinitiv Lipper data, India's passive funds have delivered an average return of 9.6% so far this year, much higher than active funds' 5.7%. In 2018, passive funds posted 2.3% gains, while active funds had negative returns.
(GRAPHIC: India passive funds vs active funds - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8352/8281/india%20passive%20fund.jpg)
Active funds have historically outperformed passive funds in India when share price moves were more broad-based and market inefficiencies helped stock pickers as they hunted for shares whose prices were not truly reflective of their worth.
But India's stock market rally has been much narrower in the past two years, with investors preferring some well-established heavyweights over smaller ones owing to broader uncertainties around a slowing domestic economy and the U.S.-China trade war.
For instance, the Nifty index (NSEI) has risen 9.67% so far this year, but the Nifty Midcap index (NIMDCP50) has shed 6.2% and the small-cap index has slumped 11.4%.
Pratik Oswal, head of Passive Funds at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company, said 85% of the Indian stock market had become efficient.
""Finding mispricings has become harder than it was 5-10 years ago,"" he said.
""A sharp correction in mid and small caps, coupled with mega caps becoming larger, has led to underperformance of most active fund managers.""
Also, the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) rules on holdings of large-cap and mid-cap firms have affected the performance of active funds, analysts said.
At the end of 2017, SEBI said a large-cap equity fund must invest at least 80% of its portfolio in large-cap stocks and mid-cap funds must invest at least 65% in mid caps.
Prior to that, active fund managers had the flexibility to allocate larger amounts to other categories to boost their funds' performance.
Nonetheless, active funds remain more popular with Indian investors who still haven't taken to index investing, unlike in developed markets.
The passive funds' assets under management (AUM) is lower than that of active funds, according to Refinitiv Lipper data. Active funds' AUM stood at $94.4 billion at the end of third quarter, while passive funds' AUM were just $3.3 billion.
(GRAPHIC: India's passive funds' AUM - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8353/8282/india'%20s%20passive%20funds'%20AUM.jpg)
In the United States, passive funds' AUM stands at more than half of the active funds' AUM, the data showed.
""We don't have a lot of long-term money flowing into index, the way it does in America or other developed markets,"" said Dhirendra Kumar, founder and chief executive officer of Value Research.
""Indian investors have become curious and they are beginning to invest (in passive funds). But I don't think it is very big time."""

The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker for smartphones, which gets more than half of its revenue from Apple, posted a net loss of 25.4 billion yen ($233 million) in the July-September quarter, wider than the 7.8 billion loss a year earlier.
Japan Display, money-losing for the past five years due to slowing Apple iPhone sales and the delayed adoption of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, did not give a full-year earnings outlook.
But CEO Minoru Kikuoka, who took the helm in September, told an earnings briefing the company turned profitable in October.
Japan Display is seeking to raise at least 50 billion yen ($470 million), having had to scramble after Chinese investment firm Harvest suddenly pulled out of a bailout plan.

Alibaba was said to be already considering a listing in Hong Kong over the summer. The plan was suspended due to the pro-democracy protests that rocked the financial hub, reports suggested back then.

1621,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 11:15PM ET</span>","Singapore Aims to Carve Out Niche in AI Race Led by U.S., China","(Bloomberg) -- Singapore has unveiled an ambitious strategy to become a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2030, attempting to carve out a niche for itself in an increasingly politicized technology.
Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat outlined five key areas the island nation is targeting for AI applications including in transport and logistics planning, provision of municipal services, detection and management of chronic diseases, personalized education and border control. The country is planning to eventually fully automate immigration clearance for all travelers.
“Singapore is ready to deploy artificial intelligence at a national scale,” Heng, who also serves as finance minister, said in a speech at the annual Singapore Fintech Festival. “We aim to be a leader in developing and deploying AI solutions by 2030.”
Heng said the first step in health care is to deploy SELENA+, an AI system that is able to detect three major eye conditions, including diabetic eye disease, from retina photographs. “These solutions can be applied beyond Singapore, to the region and the world,” he said.
China and the U.S. are two AI superpowers that have dominated research but ongoing trade tensions between them is cooling the international collaboration that underpins technological innovation. Their AI dominance has also raised questions about how smaller countries like Singapore can influence and participate in emerging technologies.
Singapore’s approach is to target specific AI applications for development and deployment at scale in specific industries. It’s investing S$500 million ($368 million) on AI research through 2020 and has attracted U.S. and Chinese companies with policies that support AI research.
Tang Xiao’ou, co-founder of China’s SenseTime Group Ltd., said in a statement Singapore’s national AI strategy will help “establish our Singapore base as a living lab” for research.
“Silicon Valley and Beijing have been global leaders in AI research and developing AI-first startups,” said Andrew Ng, founder and chief executive officer of Landing AI. “Singapore has all the pieces needed to become a regional AI hub.”
Other key details of Singapore’s national AI strategy and Heng’s speech:
Singapore will create a new National AI Office to set the agenda for AI and bring together efforts across research, industry and government.Singapore will launch AI Marketplace, a new platform to support small and medium enterprises and startups.The Monetary Authority of Singapore will introduce “Veritas,” a framework for AI governance in the financial industry.The Infocomm Media Development Authority and the Singapore University of Technology and Design will start a new research-industry-government collaboration to leverage AI applications for smart estates."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major automakers think U.S. President Donald Trump will again this week push back a self-imposed deadline on whether to put up to 25% tariffs on national security grounds on imported cars and parts from the European Union and Japan amid an ongoing trade war with China, five auto officials told Reuters.
The anticipated delay -- expected to be announced later this week -- comes as foreign automakers are eager to highlight U.S. investments to try to dissuade Trump from using tariffs that they argue could cost U.S. jobs. 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said earlier this month tariffs may not be necessary. EU officials expect Trump to announce a six-month delay when he faces a self-imposed deadline this week. Trump in May delayed a decision on tariffs by up to 180 days as he ordered U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to pursue negotiations.
Lighthizer's office recently asked many foreign automakers to provide a tally of investments they have made in the United States, several auto industry officials told Reuters.
The White House and Lighthizer's office declined to comment.
On Wednesday, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, a Republican ally of Trump's, plans to attend a groundbreaking at Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Chattanooga assembly plant where they will mark the beginning of an $800 million expansion to build electric vehicles and add 1,000 jobs. The high-profile event will also include remarks from Germany's ambassador to the United States.
VW announced the plan to begin producing EVs by 2022 in Tennessee in January.
 Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) said in late 2017 it planned to invest $1 billion to expand its manufacturing footprint around Tuscaloosa, Alabama, creating more than 600 jobs. 
Tariffs on Japan seem even less likely than the EU, experts say.
Japanese automakers and suppliers have announced billions of dollars in investments, most notably a $1.6 billion joint venture plant in Alabama by Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp..
Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed a limited trade deal in September cutting tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products.
Although the agreement does not cover trade in autos, Abe said in September he had received reassurance from Trump that the United States would not impose auto tariffs on national security grounds. Lighthizer said the two countries would tackle cars in negotiations expected to start next April.
Stefan Mair, member of the executive board of the BDI German industry association, said a deal to permanently remove the threat of tariffs was needed. “The investments that are not being made are costing us the growth of tomorrow, even in sectors that are seemingly not affected,” he said.
Germany's merchandise trade surplus with the United States - $69 billion in 2018 - remains a sore point with the Trump administration as does Japan's $67.6 billion U.S. trade surplus last year -- with two-thirds of that in the auto sector.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 10:06PM ET</span>",Some U.S. airlines willing to take 737 MAX jets before pilot training approval: sources,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Some U.S. airlines are willing to pick up their 737 MAX jets from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co as soon as December if the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approves delivery of the grounded planes before new pilot training is agreed, three people with knowledge of the matter said. 
Hundreds of 737 MAX jets have rolled off Boeing's Seattle production line in the months since two fatal crashes on the aircraft led to a global safety ban, forcing the planemaker to park un-flown jets at facilities across Washington state until regulators approve software and training updates. 
Boeing on Monday said the FAA could issue an order approving the plane's return to service in December, even though approval for training changes would take more time.
The FAA has repeatedly said that it has set no time frame for the process. FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said on Tuesday that a decision for the MAX ""will be made solely on our assessment of the sufficiency of Boeing's proposed software updates and pilot training."" 
By starting to hand over 737 MAX jets, Boeing would get a head start on what airlines predict will be the biggest delivery logjam in civil aviation history, while also protecting output. The longer the 737 MAX grounding lasts, the longer it will take Boeing to work through deliveries and the higher the risk it will have to halt production of the money-spinning MAX.
The people with knowledge of the situation spoke on condition of anonymity due to continued uncertainty surrounding a definitive return-to-service date.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and United Airlines, which had MAX aircraft in their fleets at the time of the March grounding and more on order, have had to repeatedly extend daily flight cancellations as they await regulatory approval.
Alaska Air Group Inc was expecting to receive its first 737 MAX deliveries this year.
The conditions for 737 MAX delivery or contract terms were not disclosed, raising questions on whether any movements would be more of a pre-positioning rather than an actual delivery. Aircraft deliveries entail extensive paperwork, lawyers, and crucially, payment.
One benefit is that aircraft do not depreciate until they start flying, so while an aircraft may be sitting, it still retains the same value until it begins to fly, one person said. 
Some 737 MAX jets are in long-term storage with their engines sealed to prevent invasion from birds and wildlife, while others are receiving nearly daily checks that would enable a quicker return to flight. Either way, there is an expense.
Boeing has already set aside billions to compensate airlines for the cost of the grounding.
Still, Southwest, American and United have all said that they want their MAX orders as soon as possible. 

""Not being at the front of the line may impact each airline's delivery plans,"" said Greg Bowen, committee chairman for training and standards at the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.

MEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hackers demanded about $5 million in bitcoin from Mexico's Pemex, they told Reuters on Tuesday, saying the state oil firm missed a special discount by not paying immediately after a cyberattack that fouled up the company's systems.
The hack, which Pemex said it detected on Sunday, forced the company to shut down computers across Mexico, freezing systems such as payments, according to five employees and internal emails.
Hackers have increasingly targeted companies with malicious programs that can cripple systems overseeing everything from supply chains to manufacturing, removing them only after receiving substantial payments.
A ransom note that appeared on Pemex computers seen by Reuters pointed to a darknet website affiliated with ""DoppelPaymer,"" a type of ransomware.
The website demanded 565 bitcoins, or nearly $5 million at current prices, and threatened Pemex with a 48-hour deadline, listing an email address to contact.
When Reuters wrote to the email for details, the apparent hackers replied, saying that Pemex had missed a deadline for a ""special price,"" an apparent reference to the discounts sometimes offered to ransomware victims for early payment. But they said Pemex still had time to meet their bitcoin demand and would not comment further while the new deadline was pending.
Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the ransom demand.
The attack is the latest challenge for Pemex, which is battling to pay down heavy debts, reverse years of declining oil production and avoid downgrades to its credit ratings.
Pemex said its storage and distribution facilities were operating normally and that the attack had affected less than 5% of its computers.
""Let's avoid rumors and disinformation,"" it said in a statement.
A person who works in Pemex's production and exploration said that division was not affected.
There was some confusion about which form of ransomware was used in the attack. One Pemex official said in an internal email the company was targeted by ""Ryuk,"" a strain of ransomware that experts say typically targets companies with annual revenue between $500 million and $1 billion - far below Pemex's levels.
DoppelPaymer is a relatively new breed of ransomware that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said was behind recent attacks on Chile's Agriculture Ministry and the town of Edcouch in Texas.
On Tuesday, Pemex was reconnecting unaffected computers to its network using software patches and wiping infected computers clean, said one source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The company had to communicate with employees via mobile messaging service WhatsApp because employees could not open their emails, said another source, who was also not authorized to speak to reporters.
""In finances, all the computers are off, there could eventually be problems with payments,"" the person said.
Companies taken hostage digitally can suffer catastrophic damage, whether or not they pay ransom.
Norwegian aluminum producer Norsk Hydro was hit in March by ransomware that spread to 160 sites, eventually forcing parts of the industrial giant to operate via pen and paper.
The company refused to pay the ransom. But it said the attack generated up to $71 million in cleanup costs - of which only $3.6 million so far had been paid out by insurance."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. firearms makers will be able to more easily export guns, including assault rifles and ammunition, as early as mid-December under rules set to be finalized by the Trump administration, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.
The proposed changes could be enacted on or after Dec. 14, and would move oversight of commercial firearm exports to the Commerce Department from the State Department, the sources told Reuters.
Staff on several legislative committees were briefed on the rule changes on Tuesday ahead of a formal notification for lawmakers for Thursday, the people said, starting a 30-day clock before the rules can take effect.
While the State Department is primarily concerned with international threats to stability and maintains tight restrictions on weapons deals, the Commerce Department typically focuses on making it easier for U.S. companies to sell products overseas.
In a statement late Tuesday, U.S. Representative Ami Bera, a Democrat, said the change ""will remove critical oversight mechanisms that will increase the probability that U.S. firearms will be misused to create violence and instability around the world.”
The effort to streamline U.S. small arms export controls dates back to an Obama administration initiative begun in 2009 that was never translated into policy.
The move https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-guns-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-moves-closer-to-easing-gun-exports-idUSKBN1XH2IY by President Donald Trump's administration may generate business for gun makers such as American Outdoor Brands Corp (O:AOBC) and Sturm Ruger & Co (N:RGR), while increasing the sale of deadly weapons abroad. A relaxing of rules could increase foreign gun sales by as much as 20%, the National Shooting Sports Foundation has estimated.

1628,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 06:12PM ET</span>",China's No. 1 University Has a Big Debt Problem,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A crown jewel of President Xi Jinping’s Made in China 2025 plan is faltering.
Tsinghua Unigroup Co. is the business arm of the prestigious Tsinghua University, Xi’s alma mater. The company has been trying to establish itself as a leader in China’s nascent memory-chip industry since 2015, when it famously tried to acquire stakes in U.S. rivals Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). and  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC). Both advances were rejected amid concerns that U.S. regulators wouldn’t approve the deals on national-security grounds. 
Rebuffed abroad, Unigroup resolved to become a domestic champion and poured its resources into developing flash-memory technology. One of its subsidiaries, three-year-old Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., is already bringing its know-how to production. It’s impressive how fast the unit has developed despite lagging behind rivals in efficiency, Bernstein Research notes.
Yet credit investors are getting nervous: Unigroup’s dollar bond due in 2023 has tumbled in recent days, and is now yielding more than 10%. Last week, the chipmaker hurriedly arranged a conference call to reassure investors that its finances were in good order. Surely an asset of such national strategic importance shouldn’t be trading like a junk-rated firm bordering on bankruptcy, management reasoned. 
A big question hanging over Unigroup is: Who’s its real daddy? As part of China’s university reform, which aims to separate academic institutions from business endeavors, Unigroup’s controlling shareholder Tsinghua Holdings Corp. has attempted to disentangle itself from the company multiple times. The latest rout comes amid a protracted custody battle.
Naturally, debtholders shudder every time speculation swirls about Unigroup’s ownership. Last year, its bonds tanked after Tsinghua agreed to sell its shares to an obscure state-owned entity in the second-tier city of Suzhou, only to recover a month later when the university opted for the cash-rich Shenzhen government instead. The bonds plummeted yet again in recent months when Tsinghua abandoned the Shenzhen deal. Then in a conference call last week, Zhao Weiguo, the holding company’s chairman, said Unigroup should remain under the Tsinghua University umbrella, making multiple references to the wishes of the “paramount leader.” For anyone in doubt, that’s Xi.
Figuring out who’s holding the purse strings is particularly important for Unigroup, because like all chipmakers it needs billions of dollars in capital outlays. Industry leader Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., for example, splashed out about $25 billion annually in capital expenditure over the past five years. Yangtze Memory, Unigroup’s flash-memory business, has already spent more than 20 billion yuan ($2.86 billion) on a new plant in Wuhan and earmarked $30 billion in total spending there. The key difference is that, unlike Samsung, the Yangtze subsidiary is behind on technology and unlikely to break even until 2022 at the earliest, estimates  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc. Money has to come from the outside. Sure, Unigroup is getting financial support from China’s various venture-capital-like guidance funds and has a big credit line from China Development Bank. But investors worry that’s not enough. Obscure state-owned entities, and even Tsinghua University itself, don’t have pockets deep enough to bankroll Unigroup as it ramps up production, they wager. Revenue at Unigroup rose 7.5% from a year earlier in the first half, but its Ebitda earnings tumbled 27% to a peanut-sized 1.5 billion yuan, driven by a sharp increase in research expenses. As of June, the company sat on 39 billion yuan of cash but had 58 billion yuan of interest-bearing debt due in the year ahead. 
By now, conspiracy theories abound explaining Tsinghua's decision to scrap its deal with Shenzhen, often considered China’s Silicon Valley. One explanation could be ego: Why would Xi allow his alma mater’s prized asset to be controlled by a mere local state-owned entity?
Investors also question whether geopolitics is at play. If Tsinghua offloaded its stake to Shenzhen, Unigroup would become a bona fide state owned enterprise, making it vulnerable to operations restrictions — from intellectual property transfer to preferential taxation — if China strikes a broader trade deal with the U.S. If Unigroup remains under the umbrella of a non-profit university, on the other hand, it could still develop its chip capacity within a gray zone. 
The naive might argue that Beijing can’t possibly let Unigroup go under. That may well be the case; but as I’ve written, an unhealthy undercurrent is forming in China’s bond market. Increasingly, distressed companies are pushing for quiet deals with institutional investors to delay repayment dates. This is perhaps why investors got even more nervous when news surfaced that Unigroup had asked  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG for its help to amend and extend some bank loans. 
Pinched by the trade war, China is now eager to become self-sufficient, and semiconductors are certainly a good place to start. Last year, China’s trade deficit in chips continued to widen to $228 billion, more than double levels from a decade earlier. But if you think Tsinghua Unigroup will emerge a clear winner from this, think again. As we’ve seen in the past, national service doesn’t necessarily get you a glittering credit score, with local government financing vehicles and regional banks alike now languishing with junk ratings. Unigroup investors would do well to remember that they can't take Xi’s school spirit to the bank. "
1629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 06:07PM ET</span>","Tesla Plans to Build Next Factory Near Berlin, CEO Musk Says","(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk announced he plans to build Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s next factory near the German capital of Berlin, sending a forewarning to some of the world’s most prestigious automakers that he’s headed for their home turf.
The electric-car maker also will establish an engineering and design center near Berlin’s new airport, Tesla’s chief executive officer said late Tuesday. He made the comments while in Germany to accept an award the Model 3 sedan won by beating out the likes of BMW’s 3 Series and Audi’s A4.
“Some of the best cars in the world are obviously made in Germany,” Musk said at an event attended by the CEOs of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, Audi AG and BMW AG. He said the country is “not that far behind” in electric cars while also acknowledging that the market for them is “unproven.”
Musk, 48, is laying the groundwork for his next plant just as Tesla is preparing to start sales of cars built on the outskirts of Shanghai. Building a European factory will raise the stakes for established automakers already facing a serious threat from the electric upstart. The CEO estimated earlier this year that it will probably take Tesla until 2021 to get a manufacturing facility up and running in Europe.
While the future of Germany’s electric car market looks crowded, the politics of shifting away from the internal combustion engine also are going to be messy.  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, is running into labor-union resistance over where future electric cars will be produced ahead of a critical meeting with investors Thursday in London. Audi, the biggest profit contributor to VW Group, faces similar fights over safeguarding employment at its main German factories that specialize in sedans and station wagons.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government and local automakers have agreed to boost incentives for EVs, intensifying Germany’s effort to move away from the combustion engine to reduce exhaust emissions. Still, building vehicles in a country that has some of the highest labor and energy costs worldwide is bound to be a major challenge. European customers also expect a network of dealers and repair shops to reliably handle maintenance and repair work, which Tesla has struggled with lately.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts led by Adam Jonas wrote in a recent note that Germany would be the “logical choice” for Tesla’s so-called Europe gigafactory. The country “is the heart of the global luxury-auto market, with an economy dependent on internal-combustion tech and a government focused on climate change,” Jonas said.
Shortly after dropping the news about Berlin, Musk sent a tweet to make sure it wouldn’t be missed by his 29.3 million Twitter followers, sending out an all-caps post with heart emojis matching the colors of the German flag.
Tesla shares finished the day up 1.4% to $349.93, their highest closing price since December 2018. The stock has surged 37% since the company reported a surprise quarterly profit on Oct. 23.

1630,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 06:07PM ET</span>",Pemex Faces Payment Problems After Cyber Attack Shut System,"(Bloomberg) -- A ransomware attack that hit Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos is disrupting the company’s billing systems, according to people familiar with the situation.
Pemex is relying on manual billing that could affect payment of personnel and suppliers and hinder supply chain operations, the people said, asking not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the press.
Invoices for fuel to be delivered from Pemex’s storage terminals to gasoline stations were being done manually on Tuesday. At the company’s refining arm, some employees couldn’t access emails or the internet on Tuesday and computers were operating more slowly. If the situation isn’t resolved by Wednesday, it could affect Pemex’s ability to to pay personnel and some suppliers, one of the people said.
Pemex said in a Twitter post Tuesday that fuel storage terminals were operating regularly, and gasoline supply was “guaranteed.” That followed a statement on its website late Monday that operations were normal, after it was subjected to cyber attacks Nov. 10 that affected less than 5% of personal computing devices. There are indications that that the malware deployed against Pemex may be DoppelPaymer, according to cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike Inc.
Latest Attack
Pemex’s ransomware attack -- in which systems are frozen by hackers until a ransom is paid -- is the latest cyber incursion to hit the commodities industry. Payment problems could disrupt a supply chain that stretches across fuel retailers, global trading companies, oil industry servicers and trucking firms.
Earlier this year, Norsk Hydro ASA was hit, following previous attacks on companies from zinc smelter Nyrstar NV to oil giants Saudi Aramco and Rosneft PJSC, shipping company AP Moller-Maersk A/S and agriculture trader Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.
The blow comes as Pemex seeks to reduce its debt, now the highest of any oil company, and reverse 14 years of production declines. Pemex’s efforts to balance its books at times conflicts with the need to finance the nation’s budget, which relies on the company for nearly a fifth of its revenue. A fresh downgrade of its bonds looms as the company has failed to deliver a viable strategy to reverse output declines and replenish reserves.
In Villahermosa, Tabasco, employees involved in well-drilling services were told Tuesday they could start their computers, but not log on to the network, another person said. Telephone lines aren’t working, and there’s no access to the company network, corporate emails or Skype.
Staff payments may have to be done by telephone, said another person. In Pemex’s finance department, external emails weren’t coming through, affecting daily payments, people said.
Disruptive technologies have been a double-edged sword in the global oil industry. As oil companies seek to improve efficiency and worker safety by increasingly digitizing their operations, they face unprecedented security risks through ever-more sophisticated cyber attacks.
Ransomware
An internal message Monday indicated that the systems were infected by the Ryuk malware, according to a person familiar.
However, Crowdstrike Inc. has some indication that the malware may be DoppelPaymer, a form of ransomware that the firm first saw deployed in June attacks, according to Adam Meyers, the company’s Vice President of Intelligence.
DoppelPaymer attacks are typically executed against “high value targets” -- such as a health care organization, school district, or printing press -- and executed at at a time when they “need to be up an running” and may therefore feel compelled to pay a ransom, which is typically valued in the hundred of thousands or millions of dollars range, Meyers said.
Meyers found a sample of DoppelPaymer on a malware-sharing repository that contained an embedded payment portal requesting 565 Bitcoin, which is roughly equivalent to $4.8 million. The payment portal was addressed to Pemex, which led Meyers to make the connection between DoppelPaymer and the recent attack.
DoppelPaymer attacks tend to be “financially criminal in nature,” according to Meyers. The hackers responsible typically move laterally, deploying ransomware across victim organizations so that they are “out of business” until they pay the ransom or else take the expensive step of restoring data from backups.

The oil and gas explorer aims to boost revenue from its mining business to $100 million annually within three years, Chief Executive Officer Moin Raza Khan said in an interview. It also plans to bid for a license to extract coal in the Thar desert to fuel new power stations.
“There is a gloomy picture if you look at the current oil and gas scenario,” Khan said from his office in Karachi, adding that the company’s petroleum resources may run out in nine years if it doesn’t take steps to increase them. “We have to diversify into minerals.”
Domestic gas production has plateaued for the past decade, forcing the South Asian nation to import cargoes and become one of the world’s fastest growing markets for liquefied natural gas. To diversify and expand, state-owned Pakistan Petroleum is also pursuing opportunities in international oil and gas ventures and plans to bid for one project this year, Khan said, without giving details.
The energy explorer wants to maintain its oil and gas production at about 1 billion cubic feet a day for the next two to three years before expecting a 10% increase following new discoveries, Khan said. It plans to drill 14 exploration wells and 18 development wells this year.
Revenue this year will probably remain near a record 164 billion rupees ($1.1 billion) achieved last year, or increase slightly following an uptick in production, according to Khan. Pakistan Petroleum expects to receive at least 20 billion rupees from the government’s payment to the energy sector, which may improve the company’s payout, he said."
1632,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 06:06PM ET</span>",Trump’s Big Reveal on Trade Is a Big Letdown,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Markets were widely anticipating that President Donald Trump would use his speech to the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday to trumpet progress on reaching the first phase of a trade deal with China. Instead, all he said was that an agreement “could happen soon.” That’s not exactly the language markets wanted to hear, which helps explain why equity markets spent much of the rest of the day erasing the bulk of their gains.
The S&P 500 Index is now up 23.3% for the year, and whether the rally extends or not is largely dependent on the U.S. and China showing progress in trade talks. But astute market watchers such as Medley Global Macro Managing Director Ben Emons note that Trump’s language toward the talks has become more cautious of late. He’s gone from describing them as “going very well” to saying they are “moving along” to Tuesday’s “could happen soon.” As linguists know, “could” is one of the weaker verbs in the English language because theoretically anything “could” happen. It’s certainly no match for “may.” Emons pointed out in a research note that there was also a softening in Trump’s tone toward the trade talks in April, when the trade hawks gained his ear. The S&P 500 tumbled 6.58% the next month. Some would say this is just semantics, but the ebb and flow of the trade war is the primary driver of markets. The latest monthly survey of global fund managers by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) released on Tuesday showed that 39% of respondents said it’s the biggest risk facing markets, followed by 16% who fear a bond bubble, 12% who cite monetary policy impotence and 11% who said a slowdown in China is the biggest worry.
So, does Trump’s language suggest there will a repeat of the May episode for stocks? It’s impossible to know, but the stakes are higher. The Bank of America survey shows that allocations to global equities are higher and average cash holdings are lower, falling to the lowest since June 2013 at 4.2% of assets.
NEGATIVE RATES? NO THANKSTrump also took a shot at the Federal Reserve, saying it was hurting the U.S. by not copying other central banks in deploying negative interest rates. On the face of it, getting paid to borrow seems appealing. But that ignores the fact that countries with negative rates have deep economic problems, and many central bankers are finding that they do more harm than good. One of those countries is Japan. Its central bank is actively trying to steepen its yield curve, pushing yields on long-term government bonds back above zero. But instead of worrying what this might do to Japan’s economy, the country’s stock market has been on a tear. The benchmark Topix index is up 15.7% since late August, outperforming the MSCI All-Country World Index, which is up just 8.06% in the same period. The biggest beneficiary of positive rates is the banking system, which is why the Topix bank index has done better, surging 19%. More economists say negative rates don’t really increase borrowing and certainly don’t promote lending. The International Monetary Fund forecast last month that Japan’s economy will expand just 0.9% this year, compared with 2.4% for the U.S. This change in sentiment toward negative rates by central banks is one reason the global government bond market has softened, with yields as measured by the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Treasuries Index having risen from a three-year low of 1.17% on average in early September to 1.48% as of Monday.
COMPLACENCY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDERAnother revelation from the Bank of America survey is that fears of a looming global recession have largely vanished. A net 6% of those polled expect a strong economy next year, an increase of 43 percentage points from the October survey and the biggest monthly jump on record. Combine that with the largest allocations toward equities in a year and the declining cash balances, and it’s logical to ask whether investors have become too complacent. The CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX, is back down to some of its lowest levels of the year, which is to say it’s not far from its record lows. Nicknamed “the fear gauge,” the measure tracks implied volatility in the stock market. The lower it goes, the less “fear” there is perceived to be among investors. But those who say this is a sure sign of complacency fail to acknowledge the expanded role of central banks in markets. It’s no coincidence that the rally in equities that gathered steam in October came as the collective balance-sheet assets of the Fed, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and Bank of England rose by 0.6 percentage point to 35.7% of their countries’ total gross domestic product in October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The increase from September was the most for any month since March 2017. At the same time, a custom index measuring M2 figures for 12 major economies including the U.S., China, euro zone and Japan shows their aggregate money supply surged by $846.1 billion in October, the most since June. Central banks clearly have put a floor under markets, which should reduce volatility. 
LATIN AMERICA IS DOWNLatin America is quickly turning into the sick man of emerging markets. The economic problems in Venezuela and Argentina were already well known when protests swept Chile last month. Now there’s strife in Bolivia, resulting in violence, military intervention and the resignation of President Evo Morales, who was granted asylum in Mexico. But that move has caused friction between the U.S. and Mexico, which reversed a pledge not to intervene in affairs of other countries. That may have been a big reason Mexico’s peso sank the most in three months Tuesday, along with a Fox Business report that the U.S. may impose tariffs on autos and auto parts from Mexico. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin America Currency Index is down 2.84% since Nov. 1, sliding much further than the 0.43% drop in the MSCI EM Currency Index. On top of that, dollar-denominated bonds issued by borrowers in Latin America have lost 3.25% of their value since early August, according to Bloomberg News’s Paul Wallace. That’s the worst performance among emerging markets, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s indexes. Of 10 emerging markets with the worst-performing dollar debt in November, half are from Latin America. The IMF last month said it expected the region’s economy to rebound next year, expanding by 1.8% compared with 0.2% this year, but the latest developments rightly have investors questioning whether those forecasts need to be downgraded significantly.
TOO LITTLE TOO LATEThe optimism in recent weeks that perhaps the U.S. and China were on the cusp of some trade detente has provided some support to the long-suffering agriculture market. One raw material that has done especially well is milk. Class III futures, which represent milk used to make cheddar cheese, are up about 45% in 2019 and heading for the best year since 2007. Prices are already the highest since 2014. Alas, the rally wasn’t enough to save top U.S. milk processor Dean Foods Co., which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Dean says it’s the largest U.S. processor of fresh fluid milk and other dairy products, but the company has been squeezed by fierce competition and shrinking profit margins, according to Bloomberg News’s Lydia Mulvany and Katherine Doherty. This is potentially significant from a political standpoint. Dairy is especially important to Wisconsin, where Dean Foods has operations. It’s a state Trump narrowly won in the last election and one many political scientists say he needs to hold on to if he hopes to win a second term in 2020. But the struggles of such a high-profile agriculture company could have a large number of those voters questioning whether Trump’s trade strategy is the right one for their industry.
TEA LEAVESNow on to Jerome Powell. The Federal Reserve chair begins two days of Congressional testimony on Wednesday, providing lawmakers with an update on where the central bank sees the economy going. It won’t be an easy discussion. Although the U.S. stock market continues to set records, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s widely followed GDPNow index, which aims to track the economy in real time, suggests growth of just 1% this quarter. The markets and the economy have clearly diverged. And while there is always the chance for a surprise, Powell will most likely repeat what he said on Oct. 30 after the Fed cut interest rates for the third time since July, which is that monetary policy and the economy are in a good place and that it would require a “material reassessment” of the outlook to justify additional monetary easing.

1633,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 06:05PM ET</span>",Japan’s Shopping Blitz Likely Drove GDP by Less Than in 2014,"(Bloomberg) -- The boost to Japan’s economy from shoppers splurging before last month’s sales tax hike was likely smaller than in 2014, when a previous increase triggered a boom and bust in consumption.
Economists say third-quarter growth figures due Thursday will show pre-tax-hike consumer spending and robust business investment kept the economy expanding as it struggled to maintain momentum amid the global slowdown.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate that gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 0.9% from the previous quarter, slowing from a 1.3% gain in the three months to June.
While private consumption is expected to be one of the biggest drivers of growth, the gain is forecast at less than a third of the size of the equivalent bump in spending five years ago, when whip-lashing consumption triggered a sharp contraction of the economy after the tax hike.
Analysts are betting that policies put in place by the Abe administration to buoy spending, including tax breaks on car and home purchases, will succeed in minimizing the economic damage this time around.
The Tax Hike the Bank of Japan Can’t Afford to Ignore
A less dramatic spending gain in Thursday’s report will be welcome news given the economy’s vulnerable position. The U.S.-China trade war and a global tech slump have battered Japan’s exports, making the economy more dependent on stable domestic demand to generate growth.
Economists forecast the economy will shrink 2.7% in the three months through December, before bouncing back in the new year. GDP contracted 7.3% in the quarter following the 2014 tax hike and it took a full-year to regain the losses.
Labor-Saving Investment
The other question is how long companies will continue to ramp up spending without clear signs of a pickup in global growth.
In the July-September period capital spending by businesses is estimated to have risen at the fastest pace in three quarters. The expected increase reflects spending by companies such as FamilyMart Co. on computers and labor-saving equipment to help boost productivity in the face of chronic worker shortages.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Looking ahead, the economy is set to pull back in 4Q, as the higher sales tax takes a toll on spending. We expect a sharp slowdown next year, with heavy drags from consumer spending and exports.”

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 06:01PM ET</span>","Airbus says could stretch A220 airliner, but has no current plan to do so","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) Canadian-designed A220 narrowbody jet has the potential to be stretched to carry more passengers but the company has no current plans to do so, a top executive said on Tuesday.
Air France KLM SA (PA:AIRF), which has a firm order for 60 A220 jets, has expressed interest in a larger variant of the plane. The A220-100 model can carry from 100-120 passengers while the larger A220-300 takes from 120-150.
In a presentation to investors, Air France KLM last week posted a slide referring to a larger A220-500 plane.
""It's no secret that the aircraft has potential to be stretched, potential to grow,"" said Philippe Balducchi, head of an Airbus-led venture which took over production of the airliner in July 2018.
Airbus' first responsibility was to make sure the two existing planes become established in the marketplace, he told Reuters on the sidelines of an aviation conference. After that the firm would decide how to develop its planes.
""Will (there) be an A220-500 or not? I cannot tell you that today. It's definitely not my priority but there is the potential - we will see,"" said Balducchi.
Montreal-based Bombardier (TO:BBDb) originally drew up designs for the airliner some 15 years ago but sold Airbus a 50.01 percent stake for a token fee of one Canadian dollar in 2018 after sluggish sales and low production rates pushed the program well over budget.
Balducchi sidestepped questions as to whether Airbus would buy Bombardier's 33.58% minority stake, saying that was a decision for shareholders.
""I think Airbus is comfortable with the situation today,"" said Balducchi.
Under the terms of the 2018 deal, Bombardier could oblige Airbus to acquire its stake in the program in 2026 for market value. Airbus could also oblige Bombardier to sell the stake.
Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare recently said the company is ""looking at all options"" regarding its stake, while specifying that such a decision ""is not for today.""
The Canadian province of Quebec continues to hold a 16.41% stake in the program."

1636,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 05:23PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com -- Here's a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Jerome Powell Testimony in Focus
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivers remarks on U.S. economic outlook before the Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday at 11:00 AM ET (16:00 GMT).
The Fed’s chairman’s speech comes just two weeks after the U.S. central bank cut its key rate for a third time this year. And the Fed signaled it would hold rates steady for the remainder of the year.
Powell told reporters at his post-meeting news conference on Oct. 30 that the current stance of monetary policy was “likely to remain appropriate,” as long as there was no material change in the central bank’s outlook on the economy.
Fresh guidance on monetary policy, however, may likely be limited as Powell is “unlikely to have materially altered his thinking since the statement and press conference,” Nomura said in note to clients.
Ahead of Powell’s testimony, President Donald Trump again criticized the Fed. At his appearance before the New York Economic Club, the president charged the central bank's previous round of rate hikes had put the economy at a disadvantage and that he longed for negative interest rates.
Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool forecasts almost no chance of a change in the Fed's federal funds rate, now at 1.5% to 1.75%, at its December meeting and no real chance or a rate cut before next spring.
2. Inflation Data Due
Ahead of Powell’s speech, market participants will look ahead to the release of consumer inflation data due at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists forecast overall inflation measured by the consumer price index in October climbed 0.3% from 0.1% in September, while the core CPI , which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% from 0.1% a month earlier.
Year-over-year CPI growth is seen staying at 1.7% with core CPI edging up to 2.4%.
3. Cisco) Earnings in Focus 
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports fiscal first-quarter results after the closing bell Wednesday against a challenging backdrop that includes concerns that weakness in the global economy and softening cloud demand may weigh on performance.
Cisco said it expected the fiscal first quarter would represent the slowest rate of revenue and earnings per share growth since late 2017.
Sentiment ahead of Cisco’s earnings has soured somewhat after the company’s rival   Arista Networks   (NYSE:ANET) warned about softening cloud demand.
For its fiscal first quarter, ended Oct. 31, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) has guided revenue growth in the range of 0% to 2%, with earnings in a range of 80 to 82 cents.
Cisco is expected to report earnings of 81 cents per share on revenue of $13.07 billion, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com. A year ago, the Dow component reported 76 cents a share in earnings on revenue of $13.07 billion.
Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares were up 0.6% on Tuesday and are up 11.6% on the year, 17th among the 30 Dow stocks. "
1637,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Boeing gives pilot new job after firestorm over leaked messages: sources,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - One of two  Boeing Co  (N:BA) technical pilots who described flaws in a crucial flight control system in leaked 2016 instant messages has been transferred to a new job at the U.S. planemaker, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The 2016 conversation between the employee, Patrik Gustavsson, and then-colleague Mark Forkner, erased some $14 billion of its market value after they became public last month.
Forkner's comments were among those pinpointed by U.S. lawmakers during back-to-back hearings in Washington as evidence Boeing knew about problems with flight control software well before the two crashes in the span of five months killed a total of 346 people. 
Gustavsson was a technical pilot for the 737 program at the time Forkner told him the jetliner's so-called MCAS stall-prevention system was ""running rampant"" in a flight simulator. Gustavsson later replied that other pilots had kept them ""out of the loop"" on changes to MCAS. 
Gustavsson was recently moved to a new job, two people said.
One of them added that Gustavsson was transferred within the last two weeks to Boeing's Test & Evaluation group.
That group includes pilots who put the actual 737 MAX aircraft through hundreds of hours of test flights before the jetliner entered service. Forkner is now a First Officer at Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) after he left Boeing in 2018, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. 
Before the change, Gustavsson was a 737 technical pilot for roughly 5 years, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
Gustavsson and Forkner were part of a team that worked on the flight manuals airlines now used since the 737 MAX entered service in 2017, and fielded operations and systems questions from dozens of global airlines operating thousands of 737 aircraft globally, former employees told Reuters in late October. 
Forkner had worked to calibrate the 737 MAX simulator software to identify and fix glitches and make it feel as much as possible like the aircraft itself.
Before Boeing, Gustavsson spent 11 years in various roles such as simulator instructor at Ryanair Holdings PLC (I:RYA), his LinkedIn profile said. 
While Gustavsson's new role was not immediately clear. If he was made a test pilot in the Test & Evaluation group, he would have likely received a 15%-20% raise, one of the people said. 

(This story corrects to Nov 12 in dateline instead of Nov 11. Also fixes typographical error in 4th paragraph and corrects Gustavsson's title to ""technical pilot"" instead of ""chief technical pilot"")
 
"
1638,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 05:05PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P, Nasdaq See Small Gains After Hitting Highs","Investing.com - Stocks ended basically flat Tuesday as President Donald Trump's speech did not offer clues on when a China-U.S. trade deal will be signed.
The S&P 500 was up 0.16%, or about five points. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes added nearly 0.3%.
The Dow Jones industrials finished unchanged, which is a rare occurence. The Dow had been up as many as 79 points and down as many as 56 points.
The blue chips were held back by weakness in Boeing (NYSE:BA) and   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT).
The finish was a disappointment for bulls because the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 had hit new intraday highs in the morning. The pullback may have been due less to Trump than to investor reluctance to push stocks higher without any firm news.
Tuesday's key moment, at least according to Briefing.com, came when the S&P 500 hit 3,100 at about 10:40 AM ET (15:40 GMT) -- before the president's New York appearance -- and then pulled back. In addition, the S&P's relative strength index briefly topped 75, a key technical level that traders watch. A reading above 75 is a possible sell signal. 
So, expect a lot of focus going forward on whether 3,100 can be decisively breached.
 
Boeing was off 1.1% after The Wall Street Journal said the company has lost more than 200 orders for 737 MAX jets. The company blamed airline bankruptcies and customers swapping out for other models. The decline trimmed nearly 28 points from the Dow.
On Monday, Boeing said it expects Federal Aviation Administration approval for the troubled jet by the end of December, with planes returning to service by the end of January. Whether that occurs is unclear. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has said March is more likely.
Caterpillar's business is influenced by its prospects in China. So no news from the president set off some selling, which cut an additional 11 points from the blue chips.
Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) were the Dow leaders. Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) were among the Nasdaq 100 leaders.
Disney, up 1.35%, launched its Disney + streaming service Tuesday to compete against Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon Prime and other services. The Disney service, which costs $6.99 a month, was hit with tehcnial glitches on its first day, which the company blamed on overwhelming demand.
Walgreens was higher after buyout giant KKR said it has approached the drugstore chain about taking the company private.
Healthcare, materials, communication services and technology were the strongest sectors, with real estate and energy the weakest.
Crude oil prices and interest rates moved lower.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ:REGN) were among the top S&P 500 performers on Tuesday. 
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), hotel-booking site Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) were among the S&P 500's biggest laggards.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>","Trump, Apple CEO Tim Cook to tour Apple operations in Texas: sources","By Alexandra Alper and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook are expected to tour facilities in Texas where Apple products are made as soon as next week to showcase companies that keep jobs in America, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The trip, which has not yet been announced, would highlight Cook's strong relationship with Trump as he seeks further relief for Apple from U.S. tariffs on imports from China. The tariffs are part of a prolonged, tit-for-tat trade war between the world's largest economies.
Apple declined to comment. A White House spokesperson said the office has no scheduling announcements at this time.
In September, Apple said it would make its new Mac Pro desktop computers in Austin, Texas, where it had made previous models at a contract manufacturing facility. The announcement came days after U.S. trade regulators approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions filed by Apple amid a broader reprieve on levies on computer parts.
Earlier this month, Apple also asked the Trump administration to waive tariffs on Chinese-made Apple Watches, iPhone components and other consumer products, according to filings with trade regulators.
Trump has made boosting the U.S. manufacturing sector one of the goals of his presidency, taking to Twitter to pressure U.S. companies into keeping jobs at home, while he has punished China for what he says are unfair trade practices by levying hefty tariffs on billions in Chinese imports, which in turn have hurt U.S. companies.
The visit would allow Trump to tout his strong bond with Cook, after many CEOs resigned from a business advisory board in 2017 following Trump's tepid response to violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Tariff relief for Apple came after the Trump and Cook dined together in August, and Trump said Cook ""made a good case"" that tariffs could hurt the company against South Korean rival Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, whose products would not be subject to the same levies.
Trump hopes to reach a partial trade deal with China soon, but said Friday he has not yet decided what if any tariffs might be removed as part of such an agreement.
The visit will not be Trump's first trip to the Lone Star state to tout U.S. manufacturing jobs. Last month, Trump toured a Louis Vuitton factory in Alvarado, accompanied by his daughter and presidential adviser Ivanka and top executives from parent group LVMH.
The appearance stirred discord, with Louis Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquiere decrying Trump's visit to the factory, which is in addition to Vuitton's two U.S. manufacturing hubs in California."
1640,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>",Vendors squeezed in Wells Fargo cost cutting push,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - At least seven vendors have given  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) a partial refund for their services after bank executives pressured the contractors to return 2.5% of revenue earned last year, according to sources familiar with the matter.
In a bid to cut costs to offset higher regulatory spending, Wells Fargo gathered about 14 of its IT vendors in Charlotte in July and asked for a rebate for 2018. In doing so, the bank claimed the vendors had benefited from increased business from its various scandals.
Many vendors felt compelled to pay up out of fear they may lose out on future business from the Wall Street giant.
Wells Fargo spokesman Peter Gilchrist said participation in the voluntary rebate would not be considered when awarding future contacts. ""Wells Fargo’s investment in technology remains a strong priority, and we value the strategic relationships we have with our vendors.”
Still, many vendors feared not fulfilling the refund request would make their firms less competitive as Wells Fargo scales back its use of outside contractors. The bank is expected to issue a new request for business proposals from its IT vendors in the first quarter of next year.
The San Francisco-based bank has leaned on cost cuts in recent years as the fallout from a wide-ranging sales practices scandal has stunted revenue growth. However, increased spending on headcount and technology to satisfy regulators has caused the bank to back away from its expense targets.
Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry recently pointed to professional services, or work by consultants, as a expense line that analysts and investors can expect to be reduced in the next quarter. Costs attributed to outside professional services and data processing declined 17% last year.
In 2018, the bank spent $660 million on outside data processing, according to financial filings. If the bank recouped 2.5% of that cost, or $16.5 million, it would only make a small dent in its $56 billion annual budget. But for smaller IT firms like Richmond, Virginia-based Apex Systems, giving a 2.5% refund to a large client like Wells Fargo could mean paying employees less or taking a hit to earnings.
A Wells Fargo representative urged vendors not to pass on the expense to employees in the form of pay cuts, according to an email exchange viewed by Reuters.
Some of Well Fargo's IT vendors have already paid the 2018 rebate in full while others have asked to pay by installments, according to the sources familiar with the situation.
But the sources, who requested anonymity since the matter is private, said at least two vendors have refused to pay the rebate as a matter of principle.
""They’re just expecting to unfortunately have the relationship end,” one of the sources said."
1641,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 04:48PM ET</span>",Flying 14 hours or more? Boeing sees longer routes as 'key' for growth,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Serving airlines that will operate flights lasting 14 hours or longer is a ""key consideration"" for Boeing Co's (N:BA) global growth strategy over the next 20 years, an executive said on Tuesday. 
Those flights, sometimes called ultra-long haul, have grabbed headlines in recent weeks as Qantas Airlines Ltd (AX:QAN) tested a 19-hour flight between New York and Sydney using a Boeing 787-9 and prepares to test an even longer flight between Sydney and London with the same plane. 
""Globally, if long haul is growing 5% per year, ultra long haul is growing twice that per year,"" Darren Hulst, a managing director at Boeing, told Reuters in Sao Paulo while discussing market forecasts for the next 20 years. 
Commercial aviation overall is expected to grow 4.6% per year on average between 2019 and 2038, according to a Boeing market study released in September, representing a slight slowing from the previous pace of about 5%, according to figures compiled by the World Bank.
Growth in the ultra-long haul sector highlights changing habits among passengers, who are willing to travel longer. It is also a tribute to the increasing fuel efficiency of aircraft that allow for such routes to be flown profitably. 
But Hulst said this market has developed without Boeing expecting it to, pointing specifically to the carrier's use of the 787-9 plane to fly ever longer trips. 
This plane is now the ""key player"" for ultra long-haul flights involving midsized wide-body planes. 
""When we designed the airplane, I think the sweet spot for where we saw the airplane operating was between nine and 14 hours,"" Hulst said. 
Boeing competitor Airbus SE (PA:AIR) is also targeting the segment above 14 hours with the A350-900ULR, which Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) currently uses to fly the roughly 18 hours between Singapore and the New York metro area. That flight is the longest currently in commercial operation. 
Airbus also plans to soon launch an Ultra Long Range version of the A350-1000. 
Qantas currently operates a regularly scheduled flight between Perth, New Zealand and London which is the longest commercial flight using a Boeing 787-9. But that title could change if the carrier decides to operate the Sydney-New York route commercially. 

""This is more capability than we originally thought our customers would use it for,"" Hulst said.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>","U.S. auto showrooms need more electric cars, environmental group says","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Environmental group the Sierra Club on Tuesday urged automakers and dealerships to help cut U.S. carbon emissions and fight the climate crisis by making more electric vehicle available in U.S. showrooms.
""It’s past time for the auto industry to put some action behind its promises of progress and work to tackle emissions from transportation,"" said Hieu Le, the report's primary author.
The Sierra Club said its survey https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/press-room/2153%20Rev%20Up%20Report%202019_3_web.pdf of more than 900 U.S. dealerships found that 74% did not stock a single EV, but noted about 40% of dealerships in states that have adopted California's zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate had EVs for sale.
The report found that 44% of dealerships offering EVs had no more than two EVs available in showrooms. Dealer salespeople regularly failed to provide information on tax incentives or had trouble answering questions about EV technology, the report found.
The group said automakers should boost EV production and offer then in more states, provide better incentives for dealerships selling EVs and make it easier for dealers to get certified to sell them.
The Sierra Club noted the United States accounts for 15% of global emissions, with the leading source being the transportation sector and said ""accelerating the adoption and sales of EVs is crucial to tackling the climate crisis.""
Asked for comment, National Automobile Dealers Association spokesman Jared Allen responded that ""the number of battery electric vehicles stocked on franchised dealership lots is literally a function of supply and demand – nothing else."" He also noted that many automakers do not yet manufacture electric vehicles that could be put in a showroom.
Through the first nine months of 2019, U.S. plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicle (EV) sales remained flat from a year earlier at around 240,000, according to two groups tracking sales. EV sales accounted for about 1.9% of U.S. vehicle sales. Of 2019 EV sales, about half are Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) vehicles.
Californians bought 50% of all EVs sold in 2018, but the auto dealer group's Allen noted other U.S. consumers ""don’t have access to the same recharging infrastructure, incentives, HOV access, etc., necessary to make owning an EV desirable, practical or feasible in many cases.""
Roughly half of the 32,000 U.S. dealer franchisees ""can’t possibly stock a purely electric vehicle because their automaker doesn’t manufacturer one for sale,"" Allen added.
Automakers are investing tens of billions of dollars in EV technology over the next five to 10 years and promising dozens of new offerings.
On Wednesday, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) will hold a ceremony in Tennessee to mark the start of groundbreaking of an $800 million expansion to build electric cars starting in 2022. On Sunday,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) will unveil its Mustang-inspired electric SUV as part of its plan to invest $11.5 billion electrifying its vehicles by 2022.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said that ""while electric vehicle sales remain low, they are growing, and automakers expect to see a tipping point when these vehicles become more mainstream.""
The Sierra Club is one of a number of environmental groups that have challenged the Trump administration's efforts to block California from setting its own stricter tailpipe emissions limits and setting ZEV requirements. There are no federal ZEV requirements."

(Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 stock index eked out a slim gain on Tuesday as President Donald Trump said the United States is close to signing an initial trade deal with China but offered no new details about negotiations.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs during trading but stocks ended off session highs after a highly anticipated midday speech from Trump, with investors concerned ahead of time about any comments that would worsen the tariff dispute that has convulsed markets for more than a year.
Trump said U.S. and Chinese negotiators were ""close"" to a ""phase one"" trade deal, but largely repeated well-worn rhetoric about China's ""cheating"" on trade in remarks at The Economic Club of New York.
“People were hoping to get a little bit more clarity on the trade front and that doesn’t seem to have been the case,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
Investors have pointed to U.S.-China trade tensions as the main market uncertainty as stocks have climbed to record levels, fueled by rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, third-quarter earnings coming in above low expectations, and signs the economy may be bottoming. 
Still, Carlson said, ""the market to some extent is starting to try not to be too reactive one way or the other to what the president is saying about trade."" 
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) remained unchanged at 27,691.49, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 4.83 points, or 0.16%, to 3,091.84 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 21.81 points, or 0.26%, to 8,486.09.
Most S&P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, with healthcare (SPXHC) the top gainer. Real estate <.SPLRCR> lagged the most, falling 0.8%.
Among stocks, Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) rose 1.3% as the company said demand for its much-anticipated streaming service, Disney+, was well above its expectations in a launch.
Shares of Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) fell 0.7%.
Rockwell Automation Inc (N:ROK) shares jumped 10.5% after the U.S. factory equipment maker easily beat quarterly results and forecast 2020 earnings above estimates.
CBS Corp (N:CBS) shares dropped 3.6% after the media company missed quarterly revenue estimates. Shares of Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), which is merging with CBS, slid 3.8%.
With third-quarter earnings season drawing to a close, about three-quarters of S&P 500 companies have topped profit estimates, but overall they are expected to have posted a 0.5% drop in earnings, according to Refinitiv.
Earnings from big firms including Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) and Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO), as well as a fresh set of economic data, are due this week. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, the ratio was roughly even.
The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 109 new highs and 104 new lows. 

About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, just below the 6.8 billion-share daily average over the last 20 sessions.

TORONTO/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Michael Sabia, president and chief executive of the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec (CDPQ), Canada's second largest pension fund, will step down earlier than planned to take the helm of the University of Toronto's global affairs program, the fund and university said on Tuesday.
Sabia, 66, who served as the CDPQ's first non-Francophone CEO for 11 years, will leave in February 2020, the CDPQ said in a statement. He had been expected to remain until March 31, 2021. 
The board of the CDPQ, which managed C$326.7 billion ($246.9 billion) at end of June, expects to conclude its search for Sabia's replacement at the beginning of 2020 with a successor approved by the government, according to the statement.
That successor will have to contend with some of CDPQ's challenging holdings, including a Greater Montreal area rapid transit system facing delays and cost overruns; the troubled SNC-Lavalin Group (TO:SNC), of which Caisse is the biggest shareholder and which the fund expressed growing concern over in July; and Bombardier (TO:BBDb), whose transportation division is facing performance problems with its contracts in New York and Switzerland. 
The Caisse, which invests on behalf of some 6 million workers and retirees in Canada's mostly French-speaking province of Quebec, has a nearly 30% stake in Bombardier's rail unit.
Any number of potential candidates from across Canada, rather than just Quebec, could be in the running to succeed Sabia, according to Yvan Allaire, executive chair of the board at the Institute for Governance, and a former Caisse board member. 
""It may well be that there’s a great push to have a woman CEO this time,"" Allaire said. ""Certainly one would require a great deal of familiarity with all aspects of finance.""
Under Sabia's leadership, Caisse produced 9.9% annualized returns over the past decade, and nearly tripled its assets, CDPQ said. The returns compare with 11.1% at the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the country's largest pension fund, and 10.1% at Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, the third biggest.
Sabia ""felt it was the right time to leave for a new challenge,"" Caisse spokesman Maxime Chagnon said by phone. ""The Caisse is very strong now so it was a good moment for him.""
Sabia's compensation in 2018 was C$3.8 million, compared with C$4.6 million for Mark Machin, his counterpart at the CPPIB and C$4.9 million for Ron Mock at Ontario Teachers. 
He will become the director of the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy at the University of Toronto, the university said.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court declines to shield gun maker from Sandy Hook lawsuit,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a blow to the firearms industry, rejecting Remington Arms Co's bid to escape a lawsuit by families of victims aiming to hold the gun maker liable for its marketing of the assault-style rifle used in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre that killed 20 children and six adults.
The justices turned away Remington's appeal of a ruling by Connecticut's top court to let the lawsuit proceed despite a federal law that broadly shields firearms manufacturers from liability when their weapons are used in crimes. The lawsuit will move forward at a time of high passions in the United States over the issue of gun control.
The family members of nine people slain and one survivor of the Sandy Hook massacre filed the lawsuit in 2014. Remington was backed in the case by a number of gun rights groups and lobbying organizations including the powerful National Rifle Association, which is closely aligned with Republicans including President Donald Trump. The NRA called the lawsuit ""company-killing.""
The Dec. 14, 2012 rampage was carried out by a 20-year-old gunman named Adam Lanza, who shot his way into the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut and fired on first-graders and adult staff before fatally shooting himself as police closed in.
The United States has experienced a succession of mass shootings in recent decades, including several that have staggered the public such as the 2017 attack at a Las Vegas concert that killed 58 and one at a nightclub in Orlando in 2016 that killed 49. Assault-type rifles have been a recurring feature in many of the massacres.
The U.S. Congress has not enacted new gun control laws in the wake of the mass shootings largely because of Republican opposition. 
The plaintiffs have argued that Remington bears some of the blame for the Sandy Hook tragedy. They said the Bushmaster AR-15 gun that Lanza used - a semi-automatic civilian version of the U.S. military's M-16 - had been illegally marketed by the company to civilians as a combat weapon for waging war and killing human beings. 
The plaintiffs said that Connecticut's consumer protection law forbids advertising that promotes violent, criminal behavior and yet even though these rifles have become the ""weapon of choice for mass shooters"" Remington's ads ""continued to exploit the fantasy of an all-conquering lone gunman."" One of them, they noted, stated, ""Forces of opposition, bow down.""
Josh Koskoff, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the families are grateful that the court denied Remington's appeal.
""We are ready to resume discovery and proceed toward trial in order to shed light on Remington's profit-driven strategy to expand the AR-15 market and court high-risk users at the expense of Americans' safety,"" Koskoff said in a statement.
A Remington representative could not be reached for comment.
The company argued that it should be insulated from the lawsuit by a 2005 federal law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was aimed at blocking a wave of lawsuits damaging to the firearms industry. 
The case hinges on an exception to this shield for claims in which a gun manufacturer knowingly violates the law to sell or market guns. Remington has argued that the Connecticut Supreme Court interpreted the exception too broadly when it decided to let the case go ahead. 
Though the case does not directly implicate the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, the NRA told the justices in a filing that the lawsuit could put gun manufacturers out of business, making the right meaningless.
A state trial court initially threw out the claims but the Connecticut Supreme Court revived the lawsuit in March, prompting Remington's appeal. 
The justices already have taken up one important gun rights case in their current term. They are due to hear arguments on Dec. 2 in a lawsuit by gun owners and the state's NRA affiliate challenging New York City restrictions on handgun owners transporting firearms outside the home.

The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes all hit new intraday highs but pulled back after the president offered no timetable on when to expect a trade deal with China. 
The S&P 500 was up less than a point at 3 PM ET (20:00 GMT). The Dow Jones industrials were off 0.1%. The Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 were 0.1% higher.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) and   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) were the biggest drags on the Dow. Boeing was off nearly 1% after The Wall Street Journal said the company has lost more than 200 orders for 737 MAX jets. The company blamed airline bankruptcies and customers swapping out for other models. Caterpillar's business is influenced by sales in China.
Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS), Merck (NYSE:MRK), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were among the Dow leaders. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were among the Nasdaq 100 leaders.

Trump's speech was a rousing defense of his presidency, along with a full-throated round of bashing the Federal Reserve. But all he would say about the U.S.-China trade talks was that a deal was near.


Healthcare, communication services and technology were the strongest sectors, with real estate and energy the weakest. Crude oil was higher. Interest rates were off slightly."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. pork prices rose in recent weeks at a time when they would normally be falling, as a fatal pig disease in China is tightening global meat supplies, the chief executive of  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) said on Tuesday.
The price increase is probably the first time African swine fever (ASF) has significantly affected the United States, CEO Noel White said, after the company posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. 
The increase is ""extremely unusual,"" White told analysts on a conference call, because prices usually drop in the autumn. The United States also has more hogs than ever. Processors are slaughtering about 2.7 million pigs per week, up from about 2.6 million a year ago.
But African swine fever is reshaping global meat markets and China is scouring the world to replace millions of its pigs killed by the disease. 
Higher U.S. pork prices could benefit meatpackers like Arkansas-based Tyson, though they were overshadowed in the company's latest earnings by an August fire at a U.S. beef plant. Reduced international supplies are also expected to help Tyson rivals like Seaboard Corp, JBS USA and WH Group's Smithfield Foods. 
""Since the product is being produced for export today, we are seeing product prices move higher,"" White said.
Tyson shares climbed more than 6% after his comments.
""We urge investors to buy here before the impact of ASF is felt,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note.
African swine fever has killed up to half of China's hog herd since August 2018 and lifted Chinese pork prices to record highs. Vietnam, the Philippines and other nations are also struggling with outbreaks. 
U.S. processors face a disadvantage for sales to China, compared with other suppliers, because Beijing imposed steep tariffs on U.S. pork as part of the countries' trade war. Still, Chinese prices are so high that importers are willing to pay the tariff, affecting the U.S. market. 
From January to September, U.S. pork exports to China and Hong Kong were up 47% in volume from a year earlier. Chicago Mercantile Exchange December lean hog futures have risen about 12% since hitting a one-year low in September.
""China has already taken a lot of product,"" said Steve Meyer, economist for Kerns and Associates. ""They're going to take more and more.""
Tyson fell short of Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit, after the slaughterhouse fire hurt sales volumes in its beef business, the company's biggest segment. 
Excluding items, the company earned $1.21 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.29, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total sales rose nearly 9% to $10.88 billion on strength in its pork and chicken segments, but missed the average estimate of $11 billion.

Losses narrowed to 89 cents a share, from $1.55 a share in the year-ago period, but missed estimates from Investing.com for a loss of 56 cents a share. Revenue fell 21% to $347 million, short of estimates of $376 million.
Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK) slumped 15%, with selling intensifying on reports that the company filed for a possible offering of stock of up to $150 million in shares.
The retailer blamed the loss on a plunge in product sales, driven by a sharp fall in marketing activities, which was part of its effort to return its retail business to profit.
Sales and marketing expenses fell 38% to $34.2 million in the quarter from a year earlier. 
In January 2018, Overstock ramped up sales and marketing expenses to attract new customers and generate revenue growth, but abandoned this strategy a few months later in August.
“We significantly reduced spending in the sponsored search and display ads on social media marketing channels,” the company said.
The U.S.-China trade war also proved a headwind during the quarter as search traffic was taking longer than expected to translate into buying customers amid waning consumer confidence.
Overstock, however, has been diversifying its sourcing over the last several years.
Sales generated from products that received tariff increases fell to 12.2% since the U.S. S tariffs were implemented, bringing down the total assortments from China to about 50% from nearly 85% after the 2008 recession."
1650,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",Boeing orders sink as customers opt to swap MAX,"(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) took 10 new plane orders last month, but saw some customers swapping the U.S. planemaker's grounded 737 MAX planes in favor of more expensive wide-body planes as doubts lingered about the MAX's return to service.
Net orders so far this year came to just 45 at the end of October, down from 56 in September, further widening the gap on sales this year with the company's European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) which has now sold nearly 500 more planes.
After an accounting adjustment representing jets ordered in previous years, but now unlikely to be delivered, Boeing's net total for orders this year sank to a negative 95 airplanes.
The orders included what Boeing called a ""conversion"" by  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) of 15 MAX orders into five 787 Dreamliners. Turkmenistan Airlines also removed three MAX planes from the order book.
Air Lease, which had 135 outstanding orders for the 737 MAX as of October, down from 150 orders in September, has said the conversion reflected greater demand from airline customers for the 787 in future years.
Though several airlines have taken the MAX out of their flying schedule till March next year, Boeing on Monday indicated it expects U.S. regulators to approve the return to commercial service of the jet in the coming weeks, allowing it to possibly begin deliveries of the grounded planes next month.

Boeing's orders and deliveries have lagged Airbus this year due to the prolonged grounding of its best-selling MAX jets following two fatal crashes that have killed hundreds of people.
To cope with the fallout after the grounding, Boeing has slowed production to 42 MAX jets per month from 52 earlier, causing the planemaker to take billions of dollars in charges.
Boeing deliveries fell nearly 50% to 321 aircraft in the 10 months through October, compared with a nearly 11% increase in Airbus' deliveries to 648 jets, during the same period.
Airbus has booked 542 net orders, including a record order for 300 aircraft from India's IndiGo (NS:INGL) announced last month.
Airbus wide-body orders include 12 A330neo jets sold last month to leasing giant GECAS, the aircraft leasing unit of  General Electric  Co (N:GE), according to people familiar with the matter. The jets are powered by engines made by Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (L:RR), a GE rival.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 01:32PM ET</span>",FAA expands area to inspect for cracks in Boeing 737 NG planes,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was revising its order requiring checks for structural cracks in Boeing (N:BA) 737 NG planes to cover a larger area after the company said additional cracks had been found.
The FAA first said in September it was ordering checks for cracks on what is known as the ""pickle fork,"" a part that attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure. Checks were required within seven days on planes with heavy usage.
Boeing said on Tuesday after completing a round of inspections for cracking on some 737 NGs with a large number of take-offs and landings, one airplane was found to have a small crack in an adjacent location.
""Boeing has asked those operators to also inspect the adjacent area to ensure any potential issue is identified and repaired,"" the company said in a statement.
""The additional inspections are already underway. We regret the impact to our customers and have a repair plan in place to address any findings.""
To date, less than 5% of the 1,200 airplanes that have undergone the initial inspection were found to have cracks, Boeing said. The secondary issue has been discovered on three in-service airplanes and one airplane that was undergoing maintenance.
The FAA said in a notice it was now expanding the inspection to the area around eight fasteners. Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) found cracks in three airplanes after the initial inspections and has taken them out of service pending repairs.
Southwest said after it completed required inspections it decided to continue ""inspections until every NG aircraft in our fleet has been checked."" 
The FAA directive requires airplanes with 30,000 or more cycles be re-inspected within 60 days, Boeing said. Airplanes with 22,600 to 30,000 cycles will need inspections of the full area within 1,000 cycles. A cycle is generally one take-off and landing.
Last week, Lion Air found structural cracks on two 737 NG planes with fewer flights than an FAA threshold for checks. The Lion Air jets with cracks had fewer than 22,000 cycles and are now grounded for repairs, a spokesman for the airline said.
Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (SA:GOLL4), Australia's Qantas Airways (AX:QAN) and  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) are among the other airlines that have grounded planes after discovering cracks.
First delivered in 1997, the NG is the third generation of the 737, preceding the grounded MAX which is unaffected by cracking.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 01:06PM ET</span>",Rising Medicare prices will shrink Social Security inflation adjustment next year,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The cost of Medicare is going up next year - way up.
Federal officials announced late last week that the standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B (outpatient services) will jump 6.7% to $144.60. The annual deductible will rise by a similar amount.
The increases come on the heels of last month’s news that the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security will be just 1.6% for 2020. But the actual COLA will be much smaller for most beneficiaries, since Part B premiums are deducted from Social Security benefits. For example, if your Social Security benefit is $1,500, your COLA will be just under 1% - an increase of $14.90 rather than $24.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) said the Part B hikes are mainly due to higher spending on “physician-administered drugs."" That is a reference to situations where physicians buy and administer drugs to patients, and earn a profit on what they bill Medicare’s Part B program. Physician-administered drug spending rose at a rapid 9.6% annual clip between 2009 and 2017, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission https:// an independent federal body that studies Medicare and reports to Congress.
CMS has proposed a reform plan https:// that would reduce the cost of these drugs by tying their prices to an international index.
The Medicare-and-COLA math underscores the broad challenge retirees face in protecting themselves against inflation. Social Security is the only retirement benefit that provides any type of built-in inflation protection - one of the key reasons that the program is so valuable.
Still, rising healthcare costs pose a broader threat for retirees. Medicare’s trustees are forecasting annual Part B premium increases averaging 5.9% through 2028 - well ahead of general inflation. 
Advocates for Social Security expansion hope to address the widening gap between healthcare and general inflation by adopting a COLA formula called the CPI-E (for elderly). This is an experimental index maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that more accurately reflects the inflationary forces impacting seniors, such as healthcare. It has risen slightly more quickly than the CPI-W over the past decade - so it would help, but only a bit.
THE 2020 MATH
The 2020 Part B premium hikes will impact all but the lowest-benefit Social Security enrollees - those receiving $570 per month or less this year, according to the Senior Citizens League (SCL). This group will be protected by the so-called hold harmless provision of federal law, which protects Social Security enrollees from any decline in benefits. The rule prohibits the dollar increase in the Part B premium from exceeding the dollar increase in your Social Security benefit.
All other Social Security beneficiaries will bear the full weight of the Part B premium hike, and the higher deductible applies to everyone. Other Medicare enrollees who will pay full freight on the changes include anyone enrolled in Medicare who has not yet claimed Social Security, federal or state government workers who do not participate in Social Security but do use Medicare, and anyone enrolling in Medicare for the first time next year.
Affluent seniors who pay high-income Medicare premium surcharges also will see their premiums rise. 
Since 2007, high-income enrollees have been paying surcharges on their premiums for Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs). Relatively few people on Medicare pay the so-called Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA). Roughly 7% of enrollees pay IRMAAs, according to Medicare.
IRMAA brackets are defined by a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) formula that includes the total adjusted gross income on your tax return plus tax-exempt interest income. The determination is made using the most recent tax return made available by the IRS to the Social Security Administration. For example, the IRMAA you pay in 2019 would be based on AGI reported on your 2017 tax return. (You can appeal for a reduction if your income declined due to any one of a number of defined “life-changing” circumstances - and one of those is stopping work. File your appeal using Form SSA-44 from the Social Security Administration)
This year, IRMAA kicks in for single filers with MAGI above $85,000, and double that figure ($170,000) for joint filers. In that first bracket, for example, the Part B premium next year will be $202.40 next year. From there, the surcharges move up through a series of brackets; in the highest bracket, the Part B premium next year will be $491.60 - but only if you have $500,000 or more of MAGI. (If you are in that rarified air, you probably will not have much trouble shouldering your IRMAAs.)
Next year, IRMAA brackets will be indexed for inflation for the first time -  and those figures also were announced by Medicare last week. They begin for single filers with MAGI of $87,000 or above - joint filers simply double that number.
The costs of Medicare Part A also will be higher next year. Medicare enrollees do not pay premiums for Part A (hospitalization), but the deductible there will rise 3.2%, to $1,408 for the first 60 days of care. (Click here https://go.cms.gov/33KliaN for details on all the new Medicare premiums and deductibles.)
THE BROADER INFLATION QUESTION
An annual study by the Senior Citizens League has consistently found that the CPI-W fails to do an adequate job of keeping seniors even with inflation. The league’s report on the buying power of seniors looks at a market basket of goods, including prescription drugs, housing, health insurance, food and various taxes. The most recent report found that benefits have lost 33% of their buying power since 2000.
“Older Americans are not living on a fixed income,” said Mary Johnson, the Social Security and Medicare policy analyst for SCL. “They are attempting to live on a shrinking one - their standard of living is declining as their Social Security benefits purchase less.”

By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - It's nice work if you can get it.
The average annual compensation for non-executive directors at S&P 500 companies rose 2 percent to $304,856 last year, topping $300,000 for the first time and 43 percent higher than it was 10 years ago, according to a new report released by executive headhunters Spencer Stuart.
But thanks largely to stock grants some earned a lot more than that. 
Directors at biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) received, on average, $1.2 million in compensation last year. That figure does not include the more than $6 million received by Regeneron's independent chairman, company disclosures show. 
And the non-executive directors of Wall Street powerhouse  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) made $599,279 on average in 2018, the highest for any financial company in the S&P. That was, though, down from $604,837 in 2017. The investment bank, which had 13 board meetings last year, declined to comment beyond disclosures in its proxy statement.
S&P 500 boards met, on average, just 7.9 times, in person or via telephone, during 2018. That's down from 9 a decade ago, according to Spencer Stuart.
The bigger payouts are being made at a sensitive time for Corporate America. A top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election, Elizabeth Warren, has the boardroom in her sights as she seeks to tackle inequality in American society. As well as proposals such as a wealth tax aimed at billionaires, Warren has proposed that workers at U.S. corporations elect at least 40% of board members. 
Warren's campaign declined to comment. 
Investors are also taking an increasingly feisty view of directors' compensation, which is typically set by the board itself. A growing number of shareholder lawsuits are challenging big-ticket board compensation packages. 
As a result, more companies are expected to put these matters to a shareholder vote at company annual meetings, said Paul Hodgson, a compensation expert and senior adviser at ESGuage, a corporate governance data and analysis firm.
""There's a certain amount of nervousness within companies about what they're paying directors,"" Hodgson said. ""More attention is being paid to outliers than in the past."" 
Compensation limits are also becoming more prevalent, with advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis backing demands from some shareholders, according to global risk advisory firm Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW). 
A study by the firm found that the number of companies with an annual compensation limit for directors increased to 63% in 2018 from 55% the previous year. 
For some, being a director can mean doing as little as attending regularly scheduled meetings. 
Board experts say, though, that the job can be a lot more demanding than that. The National Association of Corporate Directors estimates board members commit at least 250 hours a year to their responsibilities. 
A director may visit company factories and offices, read and comment on background papers, and is often involved in board committee work. Regeneron director Christine Poon, for example, participated in 21 meetings last year, including 10 as chair of the compensation committee. 
Directors at software developer Roper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) Inc, who on average received nearly $910,000 in 2018, participate in at least 15 days of board meetings a year, according to the company's proxy filing. That works out at over $60,000 per day.
Roper says the compensation reflects their contribution to the company's superior performance - a cumulative return of 1,084% over the past 15 years compared with the S&P 500's 207%, according to the proxy.
Roper did not return email and calls seeking comment.
Some companies are proud to be miserly.  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates received just $3,300 last year for his work as a director of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, which is run by fellow billionaire Warren Buffett. 
And directors at fashion company Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) received nearly all of their pay in cash in 2018, and made a lot less than their peers, pulling down just $107,299, according to Spencer Stuart. At some companies, there is a delay in directors receiving the full benefit of their service. That is the case at Goldman, whose directors don't receive shares from their restricted stock grants until they retire.
Smaller, lesser known biopharmaceutical companies can offer the biggest compensation packages. 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX) awards a $400,000 restricted stock grant to directors that vests after one year. It's the key feature in a package that averaged $613,128 per director last year. Vertex did not return messages seeking comment. 
Regeneron Chairman Roy Vagelos received $6.35 million in 2018, benefiting from big stock option awards, and that was down from $11.8 million in 2017. 
Regeneron, known for drugs that treat eye disease, held six board meetings in 2018. Vagelos, a former CEO of Merck & Co Inc, attended all of those as well as three technology committee meetings.
""The quality of our board is unparalleled – over half our directors are members of the National Academy of Sciences and two of our directors are Nobel laureates,"" said Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie when asked about the compensation 
Last year, though, Regeneron did agree to curb its director pay as part of a settlement with investors who sued the company, claiming Vagelos and other directors received excessive compensation. 
A new compensation plan in effect this year has resulted in a nearly 50% year-over-year decrease in the reported value of director stock awards on the day they were granted. That will probably start to be reflected in 2019 numbers. 
Pharmaceutical company Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) Corp, whose board members made an average of $493,657 in 2018, also re-evaluated the way it structured directors' compensation after getting investors' push back.

Incyte eliminated grants that fixed the number of shares given to directors at the same level each year. When the shares climbed this immediately gave them a year-on-year windfall. 
The company now makes annual stock grants based on a target dollar value. Incyte also discontinued an enhanced initial grant of stock for new directors. 
""These changes make our board compensation consistent with other companies,"" Incyte spokeswoman Catalina Loveman said. 2019-11-08T171504Z_1_LYNXMPEFA71M9_RTROPTP_1_BUFFETT-GATES.JPG

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 12:41PM ET</span>",Thyssenkrupp's elevator business gets at least 3 bidders: sources,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp has received bids from at least three major bidding groups for a majority stake in Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) elevator business, four people familiar with the matter said.
Thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology (ET), which sources said could fetch as much as 17 billion euros ($18.73 billion), is the German group's most profitable asset and has been put on the block as the conglomerate needs cash for pensions, to cut debt and invest in its other divisions.
Bidders are pitching to buy a majority of ET, which would command a higher price because it includes a so-called control premium, the people said.
The bidders are also prepared to take a minority stake if it helps to win over key Thyssenkrupp stakeholders. Activist fund Cevian, which is Thyssenkrupp's second biggest shareholder, favors an outright sale, while labor representatives oppose this.
Finland's Kone (HE:KNEBV), which has been interested in ET for some time, has submitted a bid and teamed up with private equity firm CVC to address potential antitrust concerns, the people said.
Private equity firms Blackstone (N:BX), Carlyle (O:CG) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have also submitted a joint bid, these people said.
A third bid came from Advent, Cinven and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the sources said.
Suitors are also prepared to make concessions on jobs and sites to convince labor representatives at Thyssenkrupp, which control half of the group's 20-member supervisory board.
Top representatives at IG Metall, Germany's biggest union last month said they would not approve a sale of ET unless potential buyers give far-reaching concessions to staff.
Japan's Hitachi (T:6501), which had been the only other strategic suitor apart from Kone, has dropped out of the race, the people said.
All parties were not immediately available for comment or declined to comment.

Overall, incentives at the end of this year, which include cash bonuses and equity awards, will decline by 5% from a year ago, ending a short streak since 2016 when payments had generally risen, according to the study.
Employees in equity sales and trading divisions will likely see the largest decline of 10-15% compared to last year, while investment banking underwriting and management staff may see theirs decline by 5-10%.
Fixed-income sales and trading and asset management employees can expect payouts to be flat to down 5%.
""All signs are pointing to an overall disappointing and lackluster year on Wall Street,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of the firm that did the report.
Payments are pressured by a number of factors, including increased competition among investment banks, declines in equity trading and underwriting activity this year, and overall higher expenses, in part from technology investments and hiring.
""All the big banks are well run and solidly profitable, but the investment banking businesses continue to face extreme competition,"" Johnson said.
Johnson said he expected those factors - steep competition and higher expenses from technology and hiring in the tight U.S. labor market - to continue to weigh on firms in 2020. Those costs could lead to ""selective layoffs and less hiring"" next year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, employees at hedge funds, private equity firms and in advisory roles at investment banks can expect slightly higher payments. Workers in those divisions could expect payouts to be little changed to as much as 5% higher than in 2018."

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) was sued on Tuesday by workers in Michigan who accused the fast-food chain of allowing pervasive sexual harassment to flourish at its restaurants nationwide.
The proposed class action lawsuit filed in a Michigan state court accused McDonald's of lacking policies to address sexual harassment, failing to train managers to prevent it, and retaliating against workers who complain.
It said McDonald's ""creates and permits a toxic work culture from the very top,"" citing last week's firing of Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook for having an improper consensual relationship with an employee.
Easterbrook has said he made a mistake. He has not been accused of sexual harassment. 
McDonald's said in a statement it is implementing safe-workplace training at its corporate-owned restaurants, and encouraging franchisees to do the same.
""There is a deeply important conversation around safe and respectful workplaces in communities throughout the U.S. and around the world,"" McDonald's said, echoing comments made in August by its new chief executive, Chris Kempczinski.
Roughly 95% of McDonald's U.S. restaurants are franchised, and the plaintiffs' lawyers said the Chicago-based company does not push hard enough to improve training at the franchised restaurants.
Workers have filed more than 50 similar complaints against McDonald's and its franchisees in the United States over the last three years.
Tuesday's lawsuit was among the first brought as a class action, representatives of the plaintiff Jenna Ries said.
Ries, 32, worked for 1-1/2 years at a franchised McDonald's in Mason, Michigan, near the state capital of Lansing.
She said a restaurant manager there subjected her to repeated sexual epithets and contact, including by pinning her against a wall in a walk-in freezer.
""I constantly lived in fear of losing my job,"" Ries told reporters on a conference call. ""I needed the money.""
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of women who worked at the Mason restaurant in the last three years. It seeks improved training, added protections for employees, and more than $5 million of damages.
Ries is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, and supported by Fight for $15, which seeks higher wages and better treatment for workers in fast food and other industries.
The plaintiffs could find it difficult to hold McDonald's responsible for the actions of the Michigan franchisee.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco last month said McDonald's does not exercise enough control over franchise workers to be considered a ""joint employer.""

The Moscow Exchange, Russia's leading trading platform by its number of clients and turnover, said it would launch the new system on Nov. 25 for the dollar-rouble and the euro-rouble foreign exchange pairs on its spot market.
High-frequency trading uses powerful computers to execute a large number of orders within fractions of a second, based on algorithms to analyze the market. Critics say it gives big institutions which can invest in such systems an advantage.
Other players on the Moscow Exchange and Russia's central bank have complained that such traders can distort the market for those using traditional and slower means of FX trading.
The Moscow Exchange, which wants to attract more corporate clients, not only big banks, has said it would enhance its infrastructure.
""Speed bumps will allow eliminating arbitrage in technical access for various market participants,"" the exchange said.
Igor Marich, managing director of the money and derivatives market at the Moscow Exchange, said ""speed bumps"" would give companies and other players not involved in high-speed trading to secure a better price for larger volumes of deals.
""We think that corporate clients will have a greater interest in the currency market when we implement these plans,"" Marich told reporters earlier in November.
The Moscow Exchange reported 5.7 trillion roubles ($89.32 billion) worth of FX transactions for October."

Shares of CBS and sister company Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) were down more than 3% in morning trading.
CBS stations went dark for more than 6.5 million DirecTV, DirecTV Now and AT&T U-verse customers in at least 14 U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, before CBS and AT&T signed a new content carriage agreement on Aug. 8.
Sales from advertising, which was also hurt by the timing of the broadcast of certain sporting events, fell 6.8% to $1.18 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. The year-ago period was boosted by the 2018 U.S. midterm elections related ads.
The distributor of renowned shows such as ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""NCIS"" reported an 11.5% increase in its affiliate revenue, or the fees collected from cable, satellite and online distributors, to $1.12 billion.
CBS is in the process of re-uniting with Viacom to create a larger multi-platform content company and re-make media mogul Sumner Redstone's U.S. entertainment empire at a time of intensifying streaming wars. The merger would bring in an expansive slate of over 3,600 movies and 140,000 television episodes for ViacomCBS Inc.
Net earnings fell to $319 million, or 85 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $488 million, or $1.29 per share, a year earlier. 
Adjusted earnings came in at 95 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 92 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

CBS posted a 1% rise in revenue to $3.30 billion, but missed analysts' average estimate of $3.36 billion.

Flint, Michigan-based Diplomat, facing customer losses in its PBM business in the face of intense competition, earlier this year said it was reviewing options including a sale of the whole company.
The company, which started out in 1975 as a neighborhood pharmacy and also provides specialty pharmacy services, forayed into the PBM business in 2017 with back-to-back purchases of LDI Integrated Pharmacy Services and National Pharmaceutical Services.
""Strategic alternatives process seems to have transitioned to distressed sale,"" Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said in a client note.
""This is a very bad update as Diplomat seems to be nearing the end of its current incarnation.""
The company said it may not be able to meet certain covenants in its credit agreements, which would give lenders the right to terminate funding for the company's line of credit and accelerate its debt.
Diplomat said it intends to work with its lenders to renegotiate the covenants but this uncertainty will lead to its quarterly filing with U.S. security regulators to include commentary expressing ""substantial doubts"" about its ability to function as a going concern.
Diplomat also said there had been interest in both the whole company and its businesses and that it was engaged in advanced discussions.
The company's stock, down 54.5% at $2.82, was the second-biggest percentage loser across U.S. exchanges in early trading."

The Texas-based firm said it was in talks over a potential sale of its assets with Dairy Farmers of America, a company owned by farmers.
Dean Foods has been struggling in recent years as health-conscious U.S. consumers shift to non-dairy and private-label alternatives.

The company said it has received a $850 million debtor-in-possession commitment from certain of its existing lenders, led by Rabobank, to keep its operations running.
Dean Foods, which has a market valuation of about $74 million, had a net debt of about $968 million at the end of June.
Earlier this year, the company explored options, including a sale, but ended that review in September and decided to execute a ""standalone"" operating plan under a new CEO.

After sitting on the sidelines for most of the year, investors are now rushing to the equity market, afraid of missing out on the brisk rally amid increased optimism about global growth, according to a survey of fund managers by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
Expectations for a worldwide economic recovery surged by a record amount at the start of November compared to October, according to responses from participants that oversee a total of $574 billion. Cash levels plunged to the lowest level since June 2013.
“The bulls are back, global recession concerns vanish and ‘Fear of Missing Out’ prompts wave of optimism and jump in exposure to equities and cyclicals,” said BofA strategists led by Michael Hartnett.
The S&P 500 surged to a record high and global equities rallied over the past few weeks as optimism that the U.S.-China trade talks are progressing and growth won’t falter fueled appetite for riskier investments. The mood was also reflected in the survey’s asset selection, as investors sold more defensive stocks, such as utilities and staples, as well as bonds and turned to value shares, banking and euro-area equities.
The survey also showed that allocation to U.K. equities has significantly improved on easing Brexit concerns, with global fund managers now 21% underweight the country’s stocks, from 32% underweight in the October poll.
Equities are seen as poised for the best performance among major asset classes in 2020, followed by commodities and cash, according to the survey. At the same time, the fund managers predict that the S&P 500 will peak at 3,246, which is just 5.2% above Monday’s close.
Although stock markets around the world rallied this year, many traders stuck to cash or invested in safe and defensive sectors amid concerns that the end of the cycle is near. The mood changed in October as the U.S.-China tariff negotiations went ahead, with the likes of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Private Wealth Management saying that equities are the best source of future returns.
In contrast to the powerful appetite for equities seen in the latest survey, bonds fell out of favor, with investor allocation to fixed income falling to a November 2018 low, with 47% underweight.
The survey took place between Nov. 1 and Nov. 7 and 178 participants responded to the global poll.

(Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI) topped expectations for profit and revenue in the fourth quarter and forecast 2020 home sales above analysts' estimates, as cheaper mortgage rates buoyed demand from buyers, sending shares in the biggest U.S. homebuilder up 3%.
Home sales rose 9.2% to 16,024 units in the quarter, underpinning a 10-cent beat on profit as it predicted it would sell more than 60,000 homes next year.
JMP Securities analyst Peter Martin said that lower official interest rates and the company's strategy of building more affordable homes had eased some of the tensions hurting its results a year ago.
""Last year this time we had the highest pessimism because of rising interest rates, people were pulling back on affordability and builders were out of homes at the lower-end price points,"" he said.
""If they (Horton) can keep supplying homes at a lower price point, and stay in the current range of interest rates, I think they are going to have a very nice year.""
The Federal Reserve has lowered borrowing costs twice this year to offset headwinds caused by more than a year long trade war between the United States and China, and slowing global growth.
Horton, which builds roughly 10% of all new U.S. homes, said it expects sales in 2020 to be between 60,000 and 61,000 homes, compared with analysts' estimates of 59,737 homes.
Orders, an indicator of future demand, rose 14.1% to 13,130 homes in the quarter.
U.S. homebuilding tumbled from a more than a 12-year high in September, but single-family home construction rose for a fourth straight month, suggesting the housing market remains supported by lower mortgage rates even as the economy is slowing.
Horton also forecast 2020 revenue between $18.5 billion and $19.0 billion, compared with estimates of $18.58 billion.
Net income attributable to the company rose 8.4% to $505.3 million, or $1.35 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Revenue rose 11.7% to $5.04 billion.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.25 per share on revenue of $4.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

GrubHub has now become 2019’s most lucrative short with a mark-to-market profit of around $829 million, according to Nov. 11 data provided by S3 Partners research head Ihor Dusaniwsky. The company is followed by Uber, which shows a $626 million mark-to-market gain for shorts this year.
The pair unseated Tesla, which topped the list earlier this year. Now Tesla short-sellers are looking at $709.6 million in mark-to-market losses for 2019, according to S3.
Bears gained the upper hand at GrubHub as it plunged a record 43% after its fourth-quarter revenue guidance missed analyst estimates. Some of the company’s largest rivals, Uber Eats and DoorDash, are taking share from GrubHub’s core U.S. market, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. Its sales growth is expected to “decelerate meaningfully in 2020,” he wrote in a recent note.
Uber has declined 3.1% since its 180-day lock-up period expired last week and is hovering around the lowest level since it went public in May. A regulatory filing showed that the company’s founder, Travis Kalanick, sold 20% of his stake in the company.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said on Tuesday some codeshare agreements with partners on routes to and from the United States could be disrupted, after the U.S. aviation authority downgraded Malaysia's air safety rating.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) downgraded Malaysia's rating on Monday, preventing the country's airlines from adding new flights to the United States.
""This may or may not affect Malaysia Airlines’ existing codeshares to/from the USA with several partner airlines, subject to the respective airline’s own assessment/consideration,"" state-owned MAS said in a statement. 
MAS passengers fly to the United States on partners in the oneworld airline alliance. This includes a codeshare deal with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), another oneworld member. MAS said it had informed oneworld about the downgrade.
Under Malaysia's new Category 2 rating, the FAA will not allow reciprocal code-sharing arrangements between U.S. carriers and Malaysian airlines.
The new rating means Malaysian airlines are restricted to current levels of service to the United States. They also face additional inspections at U.S. airports.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) said it hoped to restore a Category 1 rating swiftly. ""We are confident we can attain it in 12 months,"" CAAM board member Afzal Abdul Rahim told reporters. 
He said CAAM needed to address 33 weaknesses found by the FAA, including those related to the technical certification of officers, regulatory gaps and CAAM's structural issues. 
Afzal said CAAM would propose amendments to relevant laws to the government to meet the FAA's requirements.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) on Tuesday became the latest U.S. airline to launch a low-fare option in an effort to rival basic economy offerings from major airlines and meet competition from ultra low-cost carriers.
The new fare, to be called ""Blue Basic,"" will allow one carry-on bag - space permitting - and free seat selection 24 hours before the flight, but those passengers will be the last to board the plane.
""There is a growing customer segment that really values low fares and that are willing to trade off certain benefits,"" JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty told Reuters.
The three biggest U.S. carriers -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) - have all rolled out basic economy fares in reaction to the growth of no-frills carriers  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) and Frontier Airlines, even as they court higher-paying passengers with new premium fare options.
""Basic economy has proven to be a revenue driver for airlines that have implemented it and should drive incremental revenue growth in 2020 despite expectations for industry unit revenue to decline,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a recent note about JetBlue to investors.
For travelers willing to pay for early boarding, free advanced seating and flexibility with travel changes, JetBlue is launching a separate fare option called ""Blue Extra.""
New York-based JetBlue, which boasts that it has the most leg room in coach, has said it expects its new fare options to add about $150 million to revenue in 2020.
The ""Blue Basic"" fare can first be found on routes like Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to Nassau, Bahamas or New York's JFK to Long Beach, California before being rolled out to most of JetBlue's other routes over the next month or two, a spokesman said."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Lonza (S:LONN) lost its second chief executive in less than a year on Tuesday, leaving the Swiss contract drug manufacturer looking for a new leader to revamp its stagnating specialty ingredients business and build its biotech manufacturing.
Investors were taken by surprise by the departure for ""personal reasons"" of Marc Funk, an insider who succeeded Richard Ridinger as Lonza CEO in March, and its shares fell.
Funk, 58, said he would stay until January for a smooth transition and Lonza chairman Albert Baehny, the ex-CEO of plumbing equipment maker  Geberit  (S:GEBN), will be interim CEO.
""The board respects Marc's decision and would like to thank him for his service to Lonza and wish him well for his future endeavors,"" said Christoph Maeder, a Lonza board member who was named lead independent director.
Lonza said a search for a new CEO was under way and its plans to convert specialty ingredients into an autonomous division while building up pharmaceuticals, biotech and nutrition will not change with Funk's exit.
Shares in Lonza, where are up 35% this year, were 4.6% lower at 0900 GMT as investors digested the exit by Funk, the second CEO to depart Lonza since Baehny, 67, became chairman last year.
""We certainly like the Lonza investment case and its strong long-term growth prospects,"" said Vontobel analyst Daniel Buchta, who has a ""buy"" rating. ""But this announcement raises the question whether there is any issue below the surface."" 
Lonza declined to provide more details on the reasons for the departure of Funk, a trained lawyer who previously headed Lonza's Pharma & Biotech division. 
Ridinger headed the Basel-based company from 2012 and oversaw acquisitions including the $5.5 billion takeover of pill packaging company Capsugel in 2017. The 61-year-old announced his retirement in January.
LEFT IN A FUNK?
Under Funk, Lonza began carving its specialty ingredients business that makes corrosion control chemicals for oil drillers, among other products, into an autonomous unit.
This is seen as a challenging task that requires untangling dozens of activities shared with other Lonza units. 
The business has struggled with falling sales and profitability, and Funk left all options open, including a disposal, stock listing or further development. 

Funk had also focused on growing Lonza's pharmaceuticals, biotech and nutrition business, including a $415 million expansion of drug manufacturing facilities in Visp, Switzerland, as it tries to woo more drugmakers to outsource production.

A run on Yingkou Coastal Bank in the northeastern Liaoning province, China's second bank run in less than two weeks, has revived worries about the health of the country's smaller lenders.
""The banking industry is a very sensitive industry, which requires us to improve the mechanism of liquidity risk management, and fend off systematic financial risks,"" Liu Rong, vice department chief of city commercial banking at China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), told a media briefing in Beijing.
He said the Yingkou Bank run was a one-off event triggered by negative rumors and that the bank's operations were back to normal.
Some Chinese banks have accumulated risks due to the economic cycle or poor corporate governance, CBIRC spokesperson Xiao Yuanqi said. 
""It is very normal and good to see some banks exiting ... due to the complex environment and fierce market competition,"" Xiao added.
Asked about a roadmap to resolve problems facing high-risk institutions, Liu said regulators will first encourage them to rescue themselves via capital replenishment and improved corporate governance. 
Other approaches include restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers and bankruptcy, Liu said. 
But Zhou Liang, vice chairman of CBIRC, was quoted by financial news outlet Caixin on a Sunday forum as saying the CBIRC would not force mergers among smaller banks. 
China has more than 4,500 financial institutions overseen by the banking regulator, most of which are small or midsized.
The rare seizure by government of Baoshang Bank earlier this year and state rescues of Jinzhou Bank and Hengfeng Bank have sharpened concerns about the health of hundreds of small lenders as China's economic growth slows to near 30-year lows.
Commercial banks' non-performing loan ratio was 1.86% by end-September, according to a separate release by the CBIRC on Tuesday, up 0.05% from end-June. The core tier 1 capital ratio, a key metric of the sector's capability to buffer risks, stood at 10.85%, up 0.14% for the same period.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Auto suppliers Continental (DE:CONG) and Osram (DE:OSRn) plan deeper cost cuts after reporting weaker results on Tuesday, as a global slowdown hits the car industry.
Demand in China, the world's biggest auto market, has fallen for 15 months, while carmakers are under pressure to invest in cleaner and self-driving technologies set to reshape the industry.
BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have all announced cost cutting plans because of the industry downturn that could tip Germany, which releases third-quarter gross domestic product data on Nov. 14, into recession for the first time since 2013.
On Tuesday Japan's Nissan (T:7201) reported a 70% plunge in quarterly profit.
""Osram does not expect global automobile production to recover in the short term,"" the maker of headlights and other components said, unveiling plans to cut 220 million euros ($242 million) in costs between 2017 and 2021.
It will also cut 800 jobs in Germany, trade union IG Metall said.
Osram fell to a full-year loss and said it would not pay a dividend. Medium-term targets will be achieved two years later than expected, it added.
Continental's third-quarter operating profit fell 20%, leading the brakes and tyres maker to look at layoffs as it forecast a slowdown in automotive production over the next five years.
""We are in talks with works council representatives,"" Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Schaefer told Reuters, adding the company would seek to strike job reduction deals with staff by the end of this year.
""We have said that this program has been started, and that this is not yet the end, and that we may have to consider further measures,"" Schaefer said.
Meanwhile, German chipmaker Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn), a specialist in semiconductors used in electric drivetrains and wind turbines, beat its own profit guidance in the fourth quarter, but remained cautious about the car sector.
""We are feeling the effects of weak global auto demand and do not expect any improvement for the time being,"" CEO Reinhard Ploss said.
""The general economic environment remains fraught with macroeconomic and political uncertainty,"" said Ploss, adding he did not expect markets to recover before the second half of the fiscal year."
1690,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 06:13AM ET</span>",Nissan cuts profit forecast after 70% quarterly plunge,"By Naomi Tajitsu
YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) reported a 70% drop in quarterly profit on Tuesday and cut its full-year forecast to an 11-year low, hit by a strong yen and falling sales, and highlighting the turmoil at the Japanese automaker after the ouster of Carlos Ghosn.
The latest weak showing from Nissan, which also slashed its interim dividend by 65% after its worst second-quarter performance in 15 years, illustrates the scale of the work ahead for its new executive team, which is due to take over on Dec. 1.
Following the ouster of former chairman Ghosn almost a year ago, Nissan has been battered by falling profit, uncertainty over its future leadership and tensions with top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) - whose shares fell 2% to their lowest since April 2013 after Nissan's downbeat guidance.
Nissan shares, down 19% this year, closed up 1% at 714.5 yen before the results announcement.
Operating profit at Japan's second-biggest automaker by sales came in at 30 billion yen ($275 million) in July-September versus 101.2 billion yen a year earlier.
That compared with a mean forecast of 47.48 billion yen from nine analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Nissan announced an interim dividend of 10 yen per share, down from 28.50 yen a year ago.
The company's global vehicle sales fell 7.5% to 1.27 million in the quarter. Sales in China, its biggest market, fell 2.5%, while those in the United States fell 4.5%. 
""Our sales in China outpaced the market, but sales in other key regions, including the U.S., Europe, and Japan underperformed,"" Stephen Ma, a corporate vice president who will become chief financial officer next month, told reporters.
Slowing demand for cars in the United States and China, the world's biggest auto markets, has led to cut-throat competition, and Nissan's slump in first-half sales has knocked operating profit off course from the automaker's full-year target. 
""We are revisiting all our assumptions, and as you can see that is why we revised down our forecast for sales volume for the full year,"" Ma said.
Nissan slashed its full-year operating profit forecast by 35% to 150 billion yen, which would be its worst full-year performance in 11 years.
It now sees global retail sales at 5.2 million vehicles, down from a previous forecast for 5.5 million, bracing for its worst annual sales in six years. 
For a graphic on Nissan operating profit, margin, click: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/NISSAN-RESULTS/0H001QEL97HT/eikon.png
Nissan in the past few weeks has announced a revamp of its top ranks with younger executives including Ma, while naming the head of its China business, 53-year-old Makoto Uchida, as its next chief executive. The company is seeking to draw a line under the legacy of Ghosn, who is awaiting trial in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies.
The automaker said it would hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting on Feb. 18, 2020, to vote on a proposal for Uchida and other members of the new executive team to become company directors, while former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, outgoing interim CEO Yasuhiro Yamauchi and former Renault CEO Thierry Bollore were scheduled to vacate their director posts.
Years of heavy discounting and fleet sales, particularly in the United States, has cheapened the automaker's brand image while lowering vehicle resale value and denting profit.

Nissan is implementing a global recovery plan under which it will axe nearly one-tenth of its workforce and cut global vehicle production by 10% through 2023 to rein in costs which it has said ballooned when Ghosn was CEO.

The British insurance market, which comprises 99 members and focuses on large commercial insurance, is offering syndicates the ability to set up without a physical presence at its City of London base, under wide-ranging plans to modernize its 330-year old business.

1692,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 05:21AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Chipmakers Escape Auto Sector Doom Loop,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Any recovery in the auto sector is going to have to wait. 
That’s the verdict this morning not from the carmakers themselves, but from various suppliers to the industry, all of whom tell much the same story in their respective ways.
Chipmaker Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn) said it doesn’t expect any improvement in the auto market for at least another six months. Component supplier   Continental AG   (DE:CONG) decided to put on ice the planned initial public offering of its powertrain unit Vitesco, while Osram Licht (DE:OSRn), a big supplier of lights and sensors to the auto industry, finally gave up hope for a better takeover offer and recommended shareholders accept a buyout offer from Austrian-based Ams (SIX:AMS).
Infineon was grateful for a bumper quarter of orders for its power semiconductors for renewable energy applications and consumer device sensors to rescue its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in September.
""We are feeling the effects of weak global auto demand and do not expect any improvement for the time being,” CEO Reinhard Ploss said in a statement. “The general economic environment remains fraught with macroeconomic and political uncertainty. We do not expect markets to recover before the second half of the fiscal year.""
The company said it expects revenue growth of around 7% over the next 12 months with an operating margin of 16%, up from 15.1% in the three months through September. The dividend will remain unchanged (although it’s paying out more cash due to a 10% capital increase earlier in the year).
Rival Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) had a similar story of salvation-through-diversification to tell. Dialog dissolved its Automotive & Industrial unit earlier this year to reflect its efforts at finding more sustainable sales channels. Like Infineon, it has seen increased demand from consumer device makers (including from a smartphone industry that has growth problems of its own). Its Connectivity and Audio segment raised revenue 27%, while the new division that houses the former automotive business stagnated.
Infineon’s shares rose 6.8% to their highest since May, while Dialog’s rose 6.3% to their highest in two and a half years. Continental’s, by contrast, fell 1.5%.
The mixed outlook was reflected in the German ZEW Economic Sentiment index for November Tuesday, which rose to its highest in six months despite another deterioration in the assessment of current conditions.
Overall, the survey strengthened a budding feeling that the German economy may be bottoming out after a severe manufacturing recession over the last six months. The DAX index rose 0.5% to within touching distance of the 22-month high it hit last week.
The Euro Stoxx 600 rose 0.2% to 405.16, while the U.K. FTSE 100 rose 0.3%, with most other markets up broadly in line."

(Reuters) - European shares were little changed on Tuesday, as positive earnings updates from  Deutsche Post  and Infineon were offset by caution ahead of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump that could offer clues about a trade deal with China.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.1% on hopes Washington will delay tariffs on cars and auto parts imported from the European Union.
Telecoms shares (SXKP) led gains, boosted by the world's second largest mobile operator  Vodafone  (L:VOD) after it increased its full-year earnings guidance.
Limiting gains for the auto index (SXAP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) tumbled to a 6-1/2 year low as Japanese carmaker Nissan (T:7201), in which the French firm is a top shareholder, reported a 70% drop in quarterly profit and slashed full-year outlook.
German peer  Continental AG  (DE:CONG) slipped 1.6% after reporting a 20% drop in quarterly operating profit and flagged a drop in production of cars and light trucks.
Investors are keenly awaiting a speech by Trump to the Economic Club of New York later in the day to look for any new word on the Sino-U.S. Phase one trade deal.
""Our base case is they're moving toward some form of a limited trade deal,"" said Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood. ""The hope is that he will confirm that some existing tariffs maybe rolled back.""
Investors will also be watching for a survey from the ZEW institute on German economic sentiment for November.
Trade-sensitive chipmakers took the spotlight, with Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) jumping 6.1% after it lifted its gross and operating margin forecasts.
Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn) gained 5.2% and was set for its biggest percentage gain in 11 months despite forecasting slower growth in the year ahead. Analysts said the outlook suggests a strong recovery in the second half of 2020.
German post and logistics group Deutsche Post DHL (DE:DPWGn) rose 4.6% after reporting an almost tripling of third-quarter operating profit and said it expected a strong fourth quarter.
Shares in Barry Callebaut AG (S:BARN), which makes chocolate and cocoa products for firms like Nestle (S:NESN) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), slid 7.7% after investment firm Jacobs Holding said it was selling a 2.85% stake in the company.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares inched higher on Tuesday as investors awaited a speech by President Donald Trump on U.S. trade policy and on news he was likely to delay a decision on European auto tariffs.
Bond markets also seemed increasingly confident a recession will be avoided as EU officials said Trump was expected to announce this week that he was delaying the tariff decision on EU cars and parts for another six months.
The news boosted expectations about Trump's speech later in the day and for some resolution to his administration's long-running trade war with China. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 shuffled 0.2% higher, back towards 4-year highs helped by upbeat chipmaker shares. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had climbed 0.5%, following a sharp 1.2% pullback on Monday.
Japan's Nikkei, which dithered either side of flat most of the day, ended 0.8% higher. But Shanghai blue chips eased 0.2% after bank lending growth undershot analysts' estimates, while Australian shares were down, too. 
A positive signal on U.S.-China trade would likely satisfy traders even without specific details, said Rob Marshall-Lee investment leader for Emerging Market and Asian Equities at Newton Investment Management.
""I think that there will be some kind of deal that comes of all of this,"" Marshall-Lee said, adding that whatever emerges both Washington and Beijing will want to claim it as a win domestically.
Trump wrongfooted markets over the weekend when he said there had been incorrect reporting about U.S. willingness to lift tariffs on China. 
Investors were also anxious about the situation in Hong Kong after a violent escalation of protests had knocked 3% off the Hang Seng and nearly 2% off Asia-exposed banks HSBC and StanChart in recent days.
Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday said protesters who are trying to ""paralyze"" the city were extremely selfish and hoped all universities and schools would urge students not to participate in violence.
Lam was speaking a day after police shot a protester and a man was set on fire in some of the most dramatic scenes to grip the city during the more than five months of civil unrest. The Hang Seng managed to claw back 0.5%. 
BORIS GETS BREXIT BOOST
Bond markets were also stirring again.
A partial holiday in the United States had closed the Treasury market on Monday but there was an early milestone on Tuesday with the gap between short-term 3-month and longer-term 10-year yields hitting the widest level of the year so far.
That widening, or steepening of the 'curve' as it is also known, adds to signs that faith in the global economy in gaining again after fears it was heading into recession.
Treasury yields on 10-year notes were fractionally higher at 1.9350% having dropping away from last week's three-month top of 1.97%. European yields were also a touch higher. 
Wall Street futures for the S&P 500 inched up 0.1%. Monday's partial holiday had made for a quiet session after the record highs of last week. The Dow ended up 0.04%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.20% and the Nasdaq 0.13%. 
In currency markets, the main mover was sterling which gave back ground after surging on Monday after the Brexit Party said it would not contest previously Conservative held seats in the last UK election.
It had jumped to a 6-month high versus the euro and as much as 1% on the dollar but shed around 0.3% to 0.86 per euro and $1.2823 when Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage then said on Tuesday he would not give any more ground. 
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar steadied at 98.224. The euro hovered around $1.1030 just away from a three-week low of $1.1015, while the dollar faded to 109.26 yen.
Gold looked to be heading for a third day of declines, touching its lowest since early August at $1,447.89 per ounce. It was last trading at $1,453.01.

U.S. crude gained 28 cents to $57.14 a barrel, while Brent crude futures added 35 cents to $62.53.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) said its future in India could be in doubt unless the government stopped hitting operators with higher taxes and charges, after a court judgment over license fees resulted in a 1.9 billion euro group loss in its first half.
Chief Executive Nick Read said India, where Vodafone formed a joint venture with Idea Cellular in 2018, had been ""a very challenging situation for a long time"", but it remained a sizable market where Vodafone had a 30% share.
""Financially there's been a heavy burden through unsupportive regulation, excessive taxes and on top of that we got the negative supreme court decision,"" he said on Tuesday.
Vodafone had asked the government for a relief package comprising a two-year moratorium on spectrum payments, lower license fee and taxes and waiving of interest and penalties on the Supreme Court case, which centred on regulatory fees.
Asked if it made sense for Vodafone to remain in India without any relief package, he said: ""It's fair to say it's a very critical situation.""
Read said Vodafone was not committing any more equity to India and the country effectively contributed zero value to the company's share price.
Vodafone's shares were up 0.6% at 161 pence at 0931 GMT as investors focused on an upgrade to its earnings forecast rather than India.
Vodafone, the world's second largest mobile operator, reported improving organic revenue growth as it saw signs of improvement in Spain and Italy and as it integrates its German cable acquisition. 
It reported organic service revenue growth of 0.3% in the first half, as it returned to growth in the second quarter, while organic core earnings rose 1.4%.
It increased its forecast for adjusted core earnings to 14.8-15.0 billion euros from its previous forecast of 13.8-14.2 billion euros, but said India and lower cash flows following the sale of assets in New Zealand meant free cash flow would be ""around"" 5.4 billion euros, rather than ""at least"" 5.4 billion euros, as it previously forecast.
Read said he was pleased with progress in executing his strategy.
""This is reflected in our return to top-line growth in the second quarter, which we expect to build upon in the second half of the year in both Europe and Africa,"" he said on Tuesday. 
Read cut Vodafone's dividend for the first time in May after tough market conditions and a need to invest in its networks and airwaves caused him to backtrack on his pledge not to reduce the payout.

A majority of rich investors expect a significant drop in markets before the end of next year, and 25% of their average assets are currently in cash, according to a survey of more than 3,400 global respondents. The U.S.-China trade conflict is their top geopolitical concern, while the upcoming American presidential election is seen as another significant threat to portfolios.
“The rapidly changing geopolitical environment is the biggest concern for investors around the world,” said Paula Polito, client strategy officer at UBS GWM, in a statement. “They see global interconnectivity and reverberations of change impacting their portfolios more than traditional business fundamentals, a marked change from the past.”
Nearly four-fifths of respondents say volatility is likely to increase, and 55% think there will be a significant market sell-off before the end of 2020, according to the report which was conducted between August and October and polled those with at least $1 million in investable assets. Sixty percent are considering increasing their cash levels further, while 62% plan to increase diversification across asset classes.
In the same survey in May, an even higher amount -- 32% -- of investor portfolios was in cash.
Still, it seems that wealthy investor caution is strictly for the short-term. Almost 70% of respondents globally are optimistic about investment returns over the next 10 years.
“The challenge is that they seem to want to respond” to short-term uncertainty “by really shortening their time horizons and shifting to assets like cash that are safe,” said Michael Crook, a managing director on the investment strategy team. Though with many of these people investing on a time horizon across decades and for future generations, that “seems like a mismatch.”"

Morrisons' sales fell 1.7% in the 12 weeks to Nov. 3, trailing market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and Asda (N:WMT), which saw declines of 0.6%, 0.2% and 1.2% respectively, market researcher Kantar said.
In contrast, Lidl's sales rose 8.8% and Aldi's were up 6.7%, giving the discounters a combined market share of 13.9%.
Unlike the big four players, Aldi and Lidl continue to open lots of new stores.
Shares in Morrisons were down 0.4% at 0834 GMT, Tesco was down 2.1% and Sainsbury's was up 0.7%.
Overall UK grocery sales grew 1.0% over the 12 weeks. ""The increase is slightly behind the equivalent rate last month, against a backdrop of political uncertainty and a persistently wet autumn,"" Kantar said.
Grocery inflation was 0.8% over the period, it said. Prices are rising fastest in markets such as fresh sausages, frozen fish and ambient cooking sauces, while falling in fresh poultry, butter and instant coffee.
Walmart-owned Asda is due to update on third quarter sales on Thursday."
1699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 03:54AM ET</span>","European Earnings Are Pretty Good, Except for Energy","(Bloomberg) -- Not so bad. That’s the view of most strategists examining the European earnings season. As we approach the reporting period’s final stretch, the picture isn’t as grim as initially feared as most sectors are actually delivering growth. But overall, the region is in an earnings recession and looking forward, companies may struggle to meet expectations for the fourth quarter and for next year without some improvement on the macro-economic front.
We recently highlighted that Europe might have recorded profit growth in the third quarter if it hadn’t been for the energy sector. Bloomberg Intelligence strategists even show that without a few “bad apples” in each country, companies posted a decent beat.
The table below is pretty clear: energy stocks and financials provided the bulk of the earnings drag. The problem with those laggards is that they carry a heavy weight in indexes. For example,  BP  (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) make up almost 16% of the FTSE 100.
Aside from energy, earnings have not only been brighter than consensus expectations, but also better than that implied by feeble Purchasing Managers’ Index economic data, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists say.
They also point out that overall, sales growth is 2% year-on-year, which is particularly encouraging given the fall in commodity prices. This is usually a “good lead indicator for revenue growth.” The top line could pick up further, provided that commodity prices stay at current levels or bounce back, JPMorgan says.
Not everyone is so keen though.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists say the earnings beat has been of “low quality,” and that companies on the MSCI Europe Index are on track to deliver a third consecutive quarter of negative earnings growth on average. Most of all, they struggle to see the validity of the consensus at this stage, with analyst expectations of 10% earnings-per-share growth for the next two quarters and full-year 2020. We probably haven’t seen the end of the earnings downgrades yet.
In the end, as a potential positive outcome on the trade front looks increasingly priced in, it may all come down to the macro improvement. JPMorgan strategists expect European PMIs to follow the improvement in money supply and China export orders, noting that global manufacturing PMIs have been stable for three months. The Stoxx Europe 600 ignored the deterioration in the figures this year and now the composite PMI has stabilized just above the contraction zone. As for Europe’s manufacturing index, the picture is gloomier as shown below."
