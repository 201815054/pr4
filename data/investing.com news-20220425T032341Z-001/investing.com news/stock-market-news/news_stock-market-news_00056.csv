7,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 07:16AM ET</span>",Ferrari confirms guidance as new CEO takes the wheel,"MILAN (Reuters) -  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) reported a 7 percent rise in second-quarter adjusted core earnings and confirmed its outlook for the year as a new boss takes charge at the Italian supercar maker following the death of Sergio Marchionne. 
The release marks the first set of results to be presented by new CEO Louis Camilleri, who was appointed on July 21 to succeed Marchionne who fell seriously ill and later died after suffering complications following surgery.
Shareholders will vote on Camilleri's appointment as executive director in September. 
The sudden change jolted investors who had expected Marchionne, who nearly tripled Ferrari's value since taking it public in 2015, to stay on as CEO and chairman until 2021.
It also left Camilleri, 63, to finish scripting a midterm strategy that is due in September and is meant to show how the company known for its racing pedigree and roaring combustion engines would shift towards making an SUV and electric cars.
Ferrari said in a statement it ""remains committed to pursuing the values (Marchionne) embodied and achieving his vision with unabated determination, ambition and passion, in line with Enzo Ferrari's legacy"".
The company said it would hold a capital markets day on Sept. 17-18 at its headquarters in Maranello, Italy, to present the strategy it will pursue to meet the midterm financial goals announced earlier this year. 
In February, Ferrari said it would double core earnings to 2 billion euros by 2022 by pushing into hybrids, SUVs and new special editions and by expanding a customization program. 
In the April-June quarter, the company said adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose to 290 million euros ($339 million) from 270 million euros a year earlier, helped by sales of the 812 Superfast model and cars from the 488 family. 
This was roughly in line with a Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate of 286 million euros. 
Profit margins rose to 31.9 percent from 29.4 percent. 
Sales were slightly down at current currencies to 906 million euros, below expectations of 921 million euros. 
Net industrial debt rose to 472 million euros at the end of June, from 413 million euros three months earlier.

Milan-listed shares in Ferrari were volatile after the results release and were down 0.4 percent by 1050 GMT compared with a 0.7 percent fall in Milan's blue-chip index (FTMIB).

15,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 06:28AM ET</span>",Greenlight's bet against Tesla crashes fund's second-quarter returns,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn told investors on Tuesday that a sharp rally in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares, which he bet against, turned into heavy second-quarter losses at his Greenlight Capital fund, and stuck by his dim outlook for the electric carmaker.
Greenlight lost 18.3 percent in the first six months of 2018, Einhorn wrote in a letter to investors seen by Reuters. Tesla shares, which rose 29 percent in the last quarter, was the fund's ""second biggest loser"" during that period, he added.
Hours after sending the letter, Einhorn notified investors that the fund's returns fell again in July. After a dip of 0.4 percent this month, the fund is down 18.6 percent for the year, an investor told Reuters.
Tesla's Model S residual values are falling, Einhorn wrote, noting he has been frustrated by power windows and touch screen problems in his own Model S sedan and got rid of the vehicle as his lease ended.
The company's more affordable Model 3 got modest reviews and bad publicity, which Einhorn said was ""probably having a negative impact on the brand."" He said he doubted the car could be ""produced profitably anytime soon, if ever"" and criticized the company's plan to rush cars to customers.
He called Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk ""erratic and desperate,"" after Musk said an analyst asked a ""boring boneheaded question"" during the company's last quarterly earnings call.
""Tragic,"" Elon Musk tweeted as he responded to Einhorn's comments. 
""Will send Einhorn a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time,"" Musk tweeted early Wednesday.
Musk regularly takes to Twitter to criticize people with opposing views and has seen a backlash from investors for his comments. Earlier this month, he apologized to British caver Vern Unsworth after making insulting comments that pushed Tesla shares down.
Einhorn, along with fellow hedge fund manager Jim Chanos, is one of the electric carmaker's fiercest critics, accusing it of putting ""dangerous products"" on the road and saying it was burning through cash.
Despite Einhorn's steady complaints, Tesla's stock price has raced ahead, turning his own short bet into a wreck that rivals say he should have trimmed.
His own investors have complained about Einhorn's stubbornness and criticized his unwillingness to say how much he has lost on the bet and come up with specific ideas to improve the portfolio's long-running underperformance.
Einhorn acknowledged mistakes and said the fund's returns over the past three years have been ""far worse than we could have imagined."" He also said several investors have run out of patience and asked for their money back. A filing from the end of March showed Greenlight had assets of roughly $4 billion.
""Right now the market is telling us we are wrong, wrong, wrong about nearly everything,"" he wrote. However, he added that he still liked his market position. ""Looking forward from today we think this portfolio makes a lot of sense,"" he said.
He said he had tried to stem the losses. ""We have taken action to mitigate our problems,"" Einhorn wrote, explaining that he covered most of the firm's Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) short position between January and April at $281.46 and used more put options in the short book.
He said he exited a bet on Japanese bank Resona Holdings, sold retailer Dillard's at a loss and covered a five-year bet against Elekta AB with a small gain.
The fund also took a new bet on Altice Europe.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Elliott cut its stake in  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI) after Qualcomm (O:QCOM), the world's biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, called off a $44 billion deal to buy NXP last week, a recent filing with the U.S. regulator showed.
Activist Elliott first announced a stake in NXP a year ago, launching a campaign to push for a higher price tag in the Qualcomm deal, which drove the bid up from $38 billion.
Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP failed when the Chinese regulator refused to approve the deal by a deadline on June 25.
China's State Administration for Market Regulator said in a statement in Friday that proposals put forth by the firms to resolve antitrust concerns were insufficient, but it hoped to continue communication with Qualcomm.
Elliott reduced its position to 3.5 percent, from 5.5 percent, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 31 showed. It is no longer NXP's top shareholder.
An Elliott spokeswoman declined to comment.
Many hedge funds bought into NXP months ago in a bet the deal would succeed but investors and analysts had pointed to reasons to hold on to the stock.
Shares in NXP fell more than 6 percent after the deal collapsed but have since regained around 3 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares retreated slightly on Wednesday as a mixed batch of corporate earnings failed to offset concerns about the U.S.-China trade conflict and subdued euro zone manufacturing growth. 
Caution was also palpable ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision, due on Thursday, with the U.S. central bank expected to keep interest rates on hold before two hikes later this year.

 Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) added to pressure on the sector as disappointing results sent its stock down 4.3 percent despite news of an additional $1 billion share buy-back. 
British airline services company's BBA Aviation (L:BBA) was the worst performing STOXX 600 share with a 13.7 percent fall to a near 1-1/2-year low after disappointing results.

The company is looking to raise funds in China to finance at least a portion of the investment for the plant, one source told Bloomberg.
According to the report, Tesla will begin producing its new Model 3 vehicle at the factory near Shanghai in 2020.
Last month, chief executive officer Elon Musk made an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a new its first factory outside the U.S. and the move was expected to double the size of the electric car maker’s global manufacturing.
The agreement was reached not long after Tesla raised prices on U.S.-made vehicles it sells in China in order to offset the cost of new tariffs imposed by Beijing in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s heavier levies on Chinese goods.
The news comes on the back of a Wall Street Journal report that said Monday that Tesla was also in talks with authorities in Germany and the Netherlands to build its first major European Gigafactory, designed to build cars and batteries in the same place.
The reported price tag hits the wires as Tesla prepares to report second quarter earnings after Wednesday’s market close.
Consensus is looking for a quarterly loss of $2.78 per share on revenue of $4.03 billion.
Analysts will also be paying close attention to see if Tesla is shipping more than 5,000 Model 3 units per week."

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in British hedge fund firm  Man Group  (L:EMG) rose more than 5 percent on Wednesday after it generated higher returns from fees and saw assets under management climb by 4.2 percent in the first half.
Gross management and other fees rose 26 percent to $423 million at June 30, compared to $378 million in the first six months of 2017.
Man Group's total assets under management by end June rose to $113.7 billion from $109.1 billion at the end of December, above analyst forecasts, with net inflows of $8.3 billion offset by performance losses and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
Adjusted profit before tax rose 5 percent year on year to $153 million.
""Management fees were a strong part of the mix of the adjusted profit before tax, and management fees are more persistent than performance fees,"" an analyst told Reuters. 
A note from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) also said there was a better-than-expected mix, biased towards higher quality management fees. 
""These results also provide some reassurance that Man is reaching the point of improved core fee margin stability,"" said the note.
Man Group shares were up 5.2 percent at 0905 GMT, making it one of the biggest movers on the mid cap FTSE 250 index. 
Headwinds included investment losses of $1.7 billion and negative currency movements of $2 billion as the dollar strengthened against most major currencies.
""Given the difficult market backdrop and weaker performance in the first half, funds under management and adjusted profit growth were more limited,"" Chief Executive Officer Luke Ellis said in a statement.
Over $1 billion of negative performance was driven by losses in Man Group's Japanese long-only and emerging market long-only strategies, partially offset by gains in European and UK-focused discretionary strategies.
Trade tensions between the United States and China weighed on sentiment and a stronger dollar and higher U.S. interest rates contributed to pressure on emerging markets, the company said.
REDEMPTIONS UP
Redemptions rose 25 percent to $11.6 billion from $9.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Investors pulled their cash from Man Group's multi-manager strategies, which saw $400 million in net outflows.
They also withdrew cash from the hedge fund manager's discretionary convertibles strategy, which saw $300 million in net outflows.

27,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>","Rio Investors Win $7 Billion Returns on Asset Sales, Profit Gain","(Bloomberg) --  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group, the world’s No. 2 mining company, pledged to return more than $7 billion to investors after a spree of asset sales and first half-profit hit a four-year high.
The producer declared an interim dividend of $1.27 a share, from $1.10 in the same period a year earlier, and also approved plans to hand investors about $4 billion of proceeds from asset sales. Rio’s total package of $7.2 billion of cash returns, compares with a payout of $3 billion in the first half of 2017, according to filings.
Underlying profit rose 12 percent to $4.4 billion in the six months through June on better base metals prices and higher iron ore volumes, London-based Rio said in a statement on Wednesday. That compared with $3.9 billion a year earlier and a $4.45 billion average estimate among three analysts’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
The miner’s balance sheet is being bolstered by asset sales announced this year of about $8.5 billion, including Australian coal mines and an interest in Indonesia’s Grasberg, the second-largest copper mine.
Rio will continue to invest in growth and look to “further strengthen our portfolio and maintain a strong balance sheet in order to deliver superior returns to shareholders in the short, medium and long term,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques said.
The biggest miners are using bumper cash flows to reward investors and fund development of new projects as continued strong demand in China supports higher profits.  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc last week approved a $5 billion copper mine in Peru as first-half profit rose, while Vale SA said it will buy back $1 billion of its own shares after earnings jumped.
China’s efforts to support its economy are helping to sustain commodities, allowing producers to shrug off concerns over global trade tensions. For top iron ore exporters including Rio, there’s an additional boost from Beijing’s clamp down on pollution, a factor that’s boosting prices for higher-quality raw materials.

The world’s largest steelmaker reported its highest quarterly profit in seven years and said it expects global demand to grow faster than it previously expected.
For years, ArcelorMittal has been decrying unfair trade conditions in its key markets of Europe and the U.S. But President Donald Trump’s tariffs have slammed the door shut on cheap imports, leading to the highest prices in years, and Europe is increasingly protecting its domestic producers. At the same time, Chinese exports are falling and steel demand in almost every major market is forecast to rise this year.
“The outlook for the second half of the year is encouraging as we anticipate current favorable market conditions continuing,” Lakshmi Mittal, ArcelorMittal’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “We believe improvements in underlying industry fundamentals are sustainable, although there is still more to be done to thoroughly address the issue of global overcapacity.”
ArcelorMittal increased its forecasts for steel demand, saying it expects global consumption to rise as much as 3 percent in 2018, up from its earlier forecast of as much as 2.5 percent. Demand in the U.S. and Europe could grow as much as 3 percent, higher than its last forecast in May. It also upgraded its outlook for China.
That strong demand, along with Trump’s strategy of a 25 percent tariff on steel imports to the U.S., has driven up prices. ArcelorMittal reported big increases in its average selling price in both North America and Europe, and also shipped 1.8 percent more steel in the quarter.
The good macro news is being turned into profits. ArcelorMittal’s second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was $3.07 billion, up from $2.11 billion a year earlier. That exceeded the $2.94 billion average analyst estimate. Net income rose 41 percent to $1.87 billion.
ArcelorMittal is also looking to grow. The European Union has approved its 1.8 billion euro ($2.1 billion) bid for Italy’s Ilva SpA, Europe’s biggest steel plant. The company is also trying to buy Essar Steel India Ltd. in India.
Still, the company is dealing with significant debt. Borrowings fell to $10.5 billion by the end of the first half, well short of its $6 billion goal. The company has said that it needs to reach debt targets before increasing dividends.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2018 01:35AM ET</span>","China Baidu's second quarter exceeds expectations, powered by ad sales growth","By Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese internet search giant Baidu (O:BIDU) beat expectations for quarterly profit and revenue on the back of strong growth in its core online advertisement business, easing the pressure of funding a major expansion into new technology areas. 
Consecutive quarters of strong profits also show Baidu has learnt to navigate regulatory potholes in China after previous missteps even as competitors suffer temporary bans and fines for failing to censor content.
Baidu said online advertising revenue rose by 25 percent to 21.1 billion yuan ($3.10 billion) in the second quarter ended June 30, partly driven by growth attributed to its growing newsfeed product, an app similar to Facebook Inc's (O:FB) feed. Total revenue rose by nearly a quarter to 26.0 billion yuan, topping estimates of a 22.4 percent rise.
Net income rose 45 percent to 6.4 billion yuan, or 18.14 yuan per American depositary share, compared to an estimated 13.4 percent rise by 18 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Several competing video platforms and feeds have been impacted by censorship restrictions in recent months, including  Bilibili Inc  (O:BILI), which saw its stock drop almost 4 percent since last week after announcing its app would be temporarily removed from app stores by authorities. 
""We are able to maintain a high standard and a close dialogue with regulators,"" Robin Li, Baidu's chief executive, said on a call with analysts on Wednesday, referring to the company's news feed. ""We've seen changes or fluctuations from time to time and we are able to cope with that going forward.""
Baidu has more than doubled its profits in several recent quarters. That followed a rough period in 2016 when a Chinese government crackdown on suspect medical ads gutted Baidu's search ad business.
The firm has since sold off its food delivery business and folded its group buying site Nuomi and other units.
NEW INVESTMENTS
It is spending heavily to boost its artificial intelligence (AI) and auto businesses. Baidu announced a 10 billion yuan autonomous driving fund last year and has launched new projects including AI chips, smart speakers and ad features. It has also opened a series of new AI labs in China and the United States.
Its most promising bets in AI and autonomous driving, though, are still at nascent stages meaning margin growth will be constrained for some time, analysts say.
""The company continues to pursue new engines with AI and newsfeed for long term growth. As a result, we believe the margin will not see any expansion in the foreseeable future,"" TH Data analyst Tian Hou said in a research note ahead of the earnings.
Spending on personnel has risen sharply since Baidu's shift to AI, and research and development costs - mainly attributed to personnel - have doubled to 4 billion yuan in the latest quarter from 2 billion yuan in the first quarter of 2016. 
Investors were rattled recently when the head of Baidu's AI drive, Lu Qi, stepped down as chief operating officer in May, sending the company's stock down 9.5 percent.
The company said it expects third-quarter revenue of 27.37 billion-28.77 billion yuan, representing an increase of 23-30 percent year-over-year, higher than an estimated 18.9 percent rise by 18 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

U.S.-listed shares of Baidu, which reported results after market hours, were up 1.7 percent in after-hours trading. After surging nearly 43 percent last year, they are up just 5.5 percent so far this year.

33,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Chinese Investors Flee Into Money Market Funds From Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese investors flocked into money-market products at a rate outpacing equities and bonds last quarter, adding to what is already the biggest segment of the nation’s mutual fund industry.
Mutual funds investing in low-risk, short-term debt instruments grew 5.4 percent last quarter to 7.7 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion), compared to the 3.7 percent increase in bond funds and a drop of 1.3 percent in equity funds, data compiled by the Asset Management Association of China show.
After a shadow banking crackdown shrank the pool of investment products in China, money market funds are seen as a safer investment as trade war uncertainties weigh on stocks, while offering returns close to those of bonds. While Chinese equities have rebounded from their lows and corporate notes jumped last month amid a government shift toward easing, analysts say money-market funds will continue to be attractive to retail investors.
“Money market funds offer high risk-adjusted returns and provide good liquidity to retail investors,” said Huang Li, a Shanghai-based fund analyst at Fitch Ratings. “Annualized returns of around 4 percent, against the backdrop of poor performances in stocks and bonds this year, is very attractive. This relative value isn’t likely to change much for the rest of the year.”
China’s money-market funds have nearly doubled in size from 2016, making it the world’s second-largest market behind the U.S., according to UBS Asset Management. Money-market funds accounted for 61 percent of the nation’s mutual funds at the end of June, data from the association showed, with China International Capital Corp. estimating individuals account for more than half of that investment. Money market funds account for just 12 percent of mutual funds globally, according to Fitch.
Wealth Management Crackdown
China’s draft rules to regulate banks’ issuance of wealth management products, issued last month as part of a crackdown on the nation’s shadow-banking industry, is also helping to shift cash to the more traditional mutual funds. The Politburo meeting held on Tuesday reaffirmed the continuation of the campaign. And with stocks entering a bear market and surging bond defaults hitting some portfolios hard, money-market funds have emerged as one of the few viable options for investors.
“There’s not a lot of derivatives in the onshore market,” said Hayden Briscoe, Asia Pacific head of fixed income at UBS Asset Management in Hong Kong. “What happens is when you get these selloffs, particularly in credit or in equities, there’s no derivative instruments to hedge. Everybody is a physical trade so they just dump and they move their cash.”
Money market funds’ falling returns last quarter didn’t deter investors from buying them, reflecting the demand for safety amid global uncertainties and volatility. The average yield of such funds tumbled 34 basis points to 3.85 percent, according to CICC, as the central bank cut the reserve requirement ratio and stepped up injections via the medium-term lending facility, driving the seven-day repurchase rate -- where many money-market funds refer to as the benchmark -- to the lowest since February 2017.
The world’s top money market fund, Yu’EBao, marketed by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s Ant Financial affiliate, saw record outflows in the second quarter in the wake of efforts to control its expansion. Funds flowed into rival money market funds as competitors picked up the lost market share. Assets under management for Bosera Cash Income Fund jumped to 147 billion yuan at June-end from 3 billion yuan in March.
“The trend is likely to continue as smaller funds take up outflows from Yu’EBao amid the regulatory curbs,” said Luo Yunfeng, Beijing-based head of fixed-income research at Essence Securities Co. “It looks like one of those ‘cash is king’ periods, and hence money-market funds maybe the best of type of assets to hold.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) is loaning up to $2 billion to the company that owns some of what used to be some of Sears Holdings Corp's (O:SHLD) best real estate.
A subsidiary of Buffett's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska, is offering what is known as a term loan facility to a New York-based real estate investment trust that owns the struggling retailer's formerly owned retail space.
The real-estate trust,  Seritage Growth Properties  (N:SRG), was formed as a spin-out of some of Sears' 235 top properties into a publicly traded company of its own in 2015. The U.S. department store operator then leased back some of the properties.
Buffett was an early backer of Seritage. He is personally one of the real estate trust's top owners, holding nearly 6 percent of its outstanding shares.
A term loan facility is a financial assistance program offered by a lending institution to help a company that requires operating capital, that has to be repaid within a time limit.
This loan matures on July 31, 2023 and bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 7 percent plus additional fees.
The financing will help Seritage boost its role as a retail and mixed-use developer across the country, its chief executive, Benjamin Schall, said in a statement.
Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The conglomerate has been under pressure to whittle down a $108.6 billion stockpile of cash, and in the past has struck advantageous deals to loan money to other companies.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 08:58PM ET</span>",U.S. insurers grilled on exposure to $4.7 billion J&J talc verdict,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Wall Street is trying to figure out whether the U.S. insurance industry will bear any costs from a record $4.69 billion judgment against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) awarded to customers and their families who claimed that asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer.
Analysts have flagged talc litigation as a financial risk for insurers, including Travelers Companies Inc, Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd and The Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG) Inc.
On company earnings calls in recent days, they peppered executives with questions about where exposure might lie. Many of the policies were written decades ago, and some liability may have been offloaded to reinsurers, making it hard to tell who might be on the hook for payments.
""I wanted to get a sense as to whether this is going to turn into a bigger deal and catch us by surprise,"" said Buckingham Research Group analyst Amit Kumar, who asked about the issue during W.R. Berkley Corp's call last week. ""The J&J news prompted us to revisit this topic.""
J&J has repeatedly denied that its talc products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos or cause cancer. 
Insurance executives have not given definitive answers, citing uncertainty about how litigation will play out or what role reinsurance might play. Policies that may cover asbestos liability were underwritten at least as far back as the 1970s.
""In J&J's case, we would not be surprised if the plaintiffs' bar found a way to trigger coverage under its old liability policies, which we think could lead to additional exposure for insurers,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jay Gelb wrote in a research note on Tuesday.
Travelers, Chubb and The Hartford may have exposure, Gelb said.
Representatives for Chubb, Travelers, the Hartford and W.R. Berkely declined to provide additional comments beyond their executives' remarks during the calls.
Asked whether the J&J judgment is launching a new era of risk for insurers, Chubb Chief Executive Evan Greenberg said he is not concerned. He noted that asbestos litigation against different industries crops up every few years.
""It could have been Congoleum manufacturers who made floor tiles,"" Greenberg said last week. ""This gets a headline because it's baby powder.""

The New Jersey-based healthcare conglomerate has said it believes the verdict will not stand on appeal.
""We are confident that there are multiple grounds for reversal of this jury verdict and that, ultimately, the case will be reversed,"" J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said earlier this month.
The company has had previous success overturning large verdicts in cases alleging harm from its products. 
J&J, which faces 9,000 cases nationwide over talc, stopped buying product liability coverage in 2005 because it was expensive and not widely available, according to a regulatory filing. Instead, it has a self-insurance program through a subsidiary, Middlesex Assurance Company Ltd, according to a filing and court documents.
J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz did not respond to requests for comment on its insurance coverage.
It is unclear how much of a role reinsurance will play for insurers or J&J.
The Hartford entered a reinsurance pact with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's National Indemnity Company in 2016 for asbestos and environmental claims. But the terms excluded coverage for ""alleged connections between talc and ovarian cancer,"" Hartford Chief Financial Officer Beth Bombara said during a conference call on Friday.
The Hartford spokesman Matthew Sturdevant declined further comment. Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman for insurance operations, Ajit Jain, declined to comment.
Other insurance executives said they have been monitoring talc litigation for years and will continue to do so.
""The general theme is to let the process play out,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Elyse Greenspan said in an interview.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 08:34PM ET</span>","Apple's pricey iPhone X, subscriptions deliver earnings beat","By Stephen Nellis and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales led by the pricey iPhone X pushed quarterly results far beyond Wall Street targets on Tuesday, with subscriptions from App Store, Apple Music and iCloud services bolstering business.
The world's most valuable technology company also forecast revenue above expectations for the fall, when it typically launches new iPhone models, reassuring a nervous tech sector that saw sell-offs last week in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB),  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) on concerns about their future growth. 
The Cupertino, California company has responded to a plateauing global smartphone market by launching ever-more expensive phones and diversifying into services, prospering even as rival Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd missed targets for its flagship Galaxy S9 and China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] took the No. 2 global smartphone sales spot.
Apple also regained growth in China, where sales rose 19 percent. Sales there fell dramatically in 2016 after Chinese consumers shunned the iPhone 7, whose overall appearance differed little from its predecessor.
And a $20 billion stock buyback in the quarter spurred by sweeping U.S. corporate tax cuts brought Apple's buyback tally this year to a record $43 billion and exceeded the stock market value of almost three-quarters of the companies in the S&P 500.
""The lesson Apple’s management has learned from the iPhone X, is when you sell a smartphone for more than $1,000 you can sell fewer units and still reap the financial benefits,"" said analyst Thomas Forte from D.A. Davidson & Co.
Shares rose 3.7 percent in extended trade to $197.34, a record high, putting its market capitalization at $954 billion. The stock would need to hit $206.49 for Apple to become the first publicly traded U.S. company to cross the $1 trillion threshold, based on Apple's share count at the end of the quarter. Apple may have reduced its share count since then.
Apple sold 41.3 million iPhones in the fiscal third quarter, half a million less than expected, but the average iPhone selling price topped expectation by $30, hitting $724, according to FactSet. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that customers were buying costlier models and the $999 iPhone X was the quarter's best seller.
Apple posted third-quarter revenue of $53.3 billion and profits of $2.34 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $52.3 billion and $2.18 per share, respectively, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LNgw6q)
It also forecast revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, which will include early sales of soon-to-be-announced phone models, beating the $59.6 billion analysts expected, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Despite the beat, James Cordwell, an analyst from Atlantic Equities, said the high selling prices might cause investors some concern because ""there’s a limit to how much Apple can grow the iPhone franchise by pushing pricing.""
Apple services include streaming music and video, where Apple faces competition from rivals including Spotify Technology SA and Netflix.
But several of Apple's services do not face strong rivals. Maestri told Reuters that sales from Apple Care, the company's warranty offering, were up 27 percent versus a year ago. 
Apple's biggest selling products do not yet face duties stemming from the U.S.-China trade disputes, but President Donald Trump has threatened hundreds of billions of further tariffs whose product categories have not yet been enumerated.
Apple is looking at whether it will be hit by tariffs on purchases the company must make, possibly related to data centers, Chief Executive Tim Cook said on a conference call with investors. 
He credited ""wearables"", a category which includes wireless earphones and the Apple Watch, with making growing contributions, and the Watch could be hit by tariffs. Maestri told Reuters that Apple could not keep up with demand for AirPods headphones.
Services revenue was $9.5 billion, beating analyst expectations of $9.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The revenue included $236 million from resolving lawsuits such as Apple's long-running dispute with  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd .
Apple executives emphasized the recurring nature of much of that revenue, saying the company had reached 300 million subscriptions on its devices, a figure that includes both Apple's own services such as music and third-party subscriptions such as Netflix, where Apple takes a cut of the revenue when it handles the billing.
Cook said Apple Music has more than 50 million users when free trials are counted and hinted at the company's video content efforts. Apple has hired prominent television executives from Sony Corp (T:6758) and started making deals for content such as a dramatic series with Hollywood stars Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston.

Apple has yet to say how it will distribute those shows or how much it will charge, but Cook said Apple is ""thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it.""

39,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",U.S. Considers Higher Tariffs on $200 Billion in Chinese Imports,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration will propose raising to 25 percent its planned 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports, ratcheting up pressure on Beijing to return to the negotiating table, three people familiar with the internal deliberations said.
The U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products in early July, and the review period on another $16 billion of imports ends Wednesday. President Donald Trump has threatened an additional $200 billion with levies of 10 percent, a level the administration may raise to 25 percent in a Federal Register notice in coming days, one of the people said. The change isn’t final yet and may not go forward after a public review, the people said.
At the same time, representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations, according to people who spoke about the deliberations on condition of anonymity.
The public comment period on the U.S. tariffs aimed at $200 billion ends Aug. 30 after public hearings Aug. 20-23, according to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office. Announcing a higher tariff is required ahead of the hearings and will send a signal that the Trump administration is upping the pressure on China to make serious concessions.
Trump directed trade representative Robert Lighthizer to raise the tariff rate to 25 percent, the people said.
Officials have cautioned that a specific timetable, the issues to be discussed and the format for talks aren’t finalized, but added there was agreement among the principals that more discussions need to take place. Chinese officials haven’t yet commented on the prospects for resuming talks.
While American and Chinese officials have hinted at the possibility of restarting talks in recent weeks, it’s been almost two months since they last held high-level negotiations.
“China and the U.S. have had several rounds of consultations and reached important consensus, but regrettably the U.S. did not fulfill its obligations,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. “Nor did it make concerted efforts with China.”
The next wave of U.S. tariffs is set to kick in as soon as Wednesday, with the possible imposition of duties on another $16 billion of Chinese imports. The implementation could be delayed for weeks as the administration works out the details of which products it will target. Officials in Beijing have vowed to respond with the same amount of tariffs on U.S. products.
One person familiar with the internal deliberations said the U.S. is trying to secure certain concessions and if China agrees, it is possible the U.S. would back off additional tariffs.
Complicating Mnuchin’s efforts is a harder line taken by Lighthizer, who has jurisdiction over the U.S.’s 301 investigation that sparked the tariffs. That case concluded China was stealing American technology and tariffs were needed to offset the damage.
A U.S. Treasury spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The two sides held three rounds of formal talks, beginning with a delegation to Beijing led by Mnuchin in May. After Liu visited Washington later that month, the nations released a joint statement pledging to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, among other things. But within days, Trump himself backed away from the deal, saying talks would “probably have to use a different structure.”
In a sign the trade standoff is reverberating through Chinese politics, the Politburo signaled Tuesday that policy makers will focus more on supporting economic growth amid risks from a campaign to reduce debt and the dispute with Trump.
The communique, which followed a meeting of the country’s 25 most senior leaders led by President Xi Jinping, said the nation’s campaign to reduce leverage will continue at a measured pace while improving economic policies to make them more forward-looking, flexible and effective in the second half of 2018.

Carlyle (O:CG), a global asset manager which on Monday said it raised $18.5 billion for its largest buyout fund ever, agreed to take floors 36-38 in the 1,401-foot skyscraper rising next to Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.
All of Carlyle's roughly 300 personnel at nearby 520 Madison Avenue will move to One Vanderbilt, a company spokeswoman said.
The tower designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates is now 37 percent leased and has risen 34 stories, five weeks ahead of its planned completion in the third quarter of 2020, SL Green said.
The building occupies an entire block and its column-free floors will provide unobstructed 360-degree views of New York.
One Vanderbilt, along with new construction downtown at the World Trade Center and in the Hudson Yards district on the West Side, is pushing the skyline higher and adding much-needed office space as Manhattan enjoys its biggest boom in decades.

(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Third Point LLC is meeting with some of  Campbell Soup  Co's (N:CPB) largest shareholders to seek support for changes at the U.S. consumer company, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The meetings come after Campbell Soup Chief Executive Denise Morrison unexpectedly stepped down in May, after the company issued a bleak forecast for the year and said it would embark on a review of its many brands.
Third Point, which has a sizeable stake in Campbell Soup, is hoping to win enough support from the family clans that collectively own 41 percent of the company to call for its sale or a major break-up, the sources said.
It is not clear whether Third Point will win enough support, and the hedge fund may choose not to make any public demands, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
""Campbell does not comment on rumors or speculation around the trading activity within our stock,"" Campbell Soup said in a statement. 
""We maintain an open, engaged dialogue with all of our shareholders, and welcome all investments in our company. The company, along with its outside advisors, is currently undertaking a Board-led comprehensive strategic and operational review of the business, including the composition of its entire portfolio, to examine all potential paths forward to maximize shareholder value,"" the company said. 
Third Point declined to comment.
The New York Post first reported earlier this month that Third Point was targeting the company and was in talks with family members.
The descendants of former Campbell Soup Chairman John Dorrance own big stakes in the company: Mary Malone owns 17.72 percent, Bennett Dorrance has 15.41 percent, and Archie van Beuren 8.59 percent. They have traditionally been attached to the company and resisted a sale. 
Food companies like Campbell have been pressured as consumers increasingly move away from processed food toward healthier options. Shifting consumer tastes are partly to blame for four straight years of declines at Campbell's U.S. soup business, a period that Morrison oversaw.
Campbell in 2015 reorganized into three divisions, creating the Campbell Fresh unit after combining what was a Packaged Fresh division with soups sold to supermarket delis. But Campbell Fresh struggled, resulting in a two-year decline in organic sales.
Campbell expects to discuss the outcome of its strategic review when it reports fourth-quarter results in late August, the company has said. Analysts have said that the most logical path for the company may be to separate its profitable but debt-laden snack business from its slower-growing soup business.

Third Point, a $18 billion hedge fund run by billionaire Daniel Loeb, has made a number of investments in food-related companies over the years. Most recently, it has called for Nestle SA (S:NESN) to shake up its business.

The U.S. Treasury in April imposed sanctions against billionaire Oleg Deripaska and eight companies in which he is a large shareholder, including aluminum exporter Rusal, in response to what it termed ""malign activities"" by Russia.
Deripaska has held a controlling interest in En+, which in turn controls Rusal, the world's largest aluminum producer outside of China. Automaker GAZ is also part of his business empire.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that the United States was in productive talks with Rusal to remove it from Washington's sanctions list.

Credit Suisse said in its quarterly report it received notification from the European Commission on July 26 alleging that it ""engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with its foreign exchange trading business"".
EU enforcers typically lay out charges of illegal activities conducted by companies before imposing fines which can reach 10 percent of their global turnover. 
The Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A number of banks are under investigation on suspicion of manipulating foreign exchange rates, with several ready to admit wrongdoing in exchange for a cut in their fines, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. They did not name the companies. 
In a regulatory filing last year, HSBC said it was under EU investigation related to its foreign exchange activities.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) has also received a questionnaire from the Commission on possible collusion among financial institutions to manipulate certain benchmark currency exchange rates, according to a 2017 regulatory filing. 
Other banks have confirmed investigations by various competition agencies without naming them.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York University on Tuesday won the dismissal of a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of thousands of employees who accused the school of mismanaging their retirement plans.
U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest said the plaintiffs failed to prove that NYU's retirement plan committee acted imprudently or caused losses by saddling them with poorly performing investment options and excessive recordkeeping fees.
""While the court finds the level of involvement and seriousness with which several committee members treated their fiduciary duty troubling, it does not find that this rose to a level of failure to fulfill fiduciary obligations,"" the Manhattan judge wrote in a 78-page decision.
The plaintiffs included six professors and an instructor who said NYU's imprudence caused more than $358 million of losses at two 403(b) plans, named for a section of the U.S. tax code.
One plan covering faculty and research staff had 18,551 participants and $2.62 billion of assets in 2016, while a plan for NYU medical school employees had 8,560 participants and $2.02 billion of assets.
Forrest ruled after an eight-day non-jury trial in April, the first in at least 11 similar lawsuits against universities by the lawyer Jerome Schlichter, a specialist in retirement plan litigation.
Other lawsuits targeted retirement plans offered by Cornell, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, among others.
“Placing high priced retail funds in the NYU multibillion dollar plans is a fiduciary breach and the fees charged were excessive,"" Schlichter said in a statement. ""We will continue to pursue this case in order to make the NYU employees and retirees financially whole.""
The university welcomed Forrest's decision.
""NYU is and always has been a careful, conscientious steward of the retirement plans for its employees and retirees, and the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof to suggest otherwise,"" NYU spokesman John Beckman said in a statement.
Forrest faulted some committee members for being ""unfamiliar with basic concepts"" about their jobs, and said one might have thought her short of time because of what she called her ""big job,"" as a human resources vice dean.
But she said the committee ""performed its role adequately,"" citing its reliance on a consultant with ""deep knowledge and understanding"" of the plans, and guidance from ""more well-equipped"" members.
Schlichter has settled many lawsuits targeting alleged deficiencies in companies' 401(k) retirement plans, including settlements in 2015 of $62 million from  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and $57 million from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Corp.

Stocks have been increased for all therapeutic areas by about four weeks to a total of 14 weeks' supply, excluding medicines that are in constant shortage. The stock for vaccines, of which Sanofi is a large producer, has also been increased where possible, the WSJ report said. 
Quality control, for which Sanofi sends batches of medicine back to the continent from its two plants in Britain, would no longer be possible in the case of a hard Brexit and some reductions to its 1,800 strong UK workforce would become necessary, the report said. 
Sanofi's Brexit-related preparations began about a year ago and its UK division began building up its stocks about six months after, the report added.
More than 2,600 drugs have some stage of manufacture in Britain and 45 million patient packs are supplied from the United Kingdom to other European countries each month, while another 37 million flow in the opposite direction, industry figures show.
Brexit threatens the free flow of these goods, given stringent medicine regulations that will require the retesting of drugs shipped across borders in the absence of an agreed trading arrangement.
The European Medicines Agency has warned drugmakers they needed to be ready for a possible hard Brexit in 2019 and said it had ""serious concerns"" about preparations in the case of 108 medicines made only in the UK.
Earlier this month, British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) said it was increasing stockpiles of those medicines in Britain and continental Europe that could be affected by Brexit by around 20 percent.

Sanofi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

54,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Apple Beats the Street
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) should deliver the tech-sector a much-needed lift Wednesday after reporting quarterly earnings after the bell that beat on the top and bottom lines.
Apple reported a fiscal third-quarter profit of $2.34 per share, topping forecasts for a profit of $2.16 per share. Revenue of $53.3 billion was above expectations for $52.3 billion.
Shares of Apple rose about 2% right in postmarket trading right after the numbers were released.
The numbers will lend some support to the FAANG stocks and the tech sector as a whole after disappointing results from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
2. FOMC Won’t Budge on Rates, but Watch Statement
The Federal Open Market Committee concludes its two-day policy meeting Wednesday and it’s almost a foregone conclusion that it will keep rates steady.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, 96.9% of traders expected the Fed to stand pat.
What may be of interest is if the FOMC says in its statement that it sees further gradual rate increases appropriate “for now,” echoing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress. That would indicate a possible softening of the stance on hikes.
On Tuesday, the core PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, showed a tame rise in prices.
""The Fed can continue on its path of gradual rate hikes for now, but unless inflation pressures start to build, they may have to scale back their forecasts of how high interest rates actually need to go in this business cycle,"" said MUFG Union Bank.
3. Jobs and Manufacturing Data and Oil Inventories on Tap
Ahead of the Fed, the market will get a hint of July employment conditions a couple of days before the big payrolls report arrives.
ADP’s measure of private sector employment for July is released at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT). Economists expect that 186,000 jobs were added last month, up from 177,000 in June.
At 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT) the ISM Manufacturing PMI is released. Manufacturing activity is expected to remain strong, with the PMI ticking down to 59.4 in July from 60.2 the month before.
The Energy Information Administration releases its latest figures on U.S. oil inventories at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT). Oil stockpiles are near a three-year low and analysts expect a drop by about 2.8 million barrels for the week."
55,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Bond Traders See Fed as Only Game in Town for Policy Tightening,"(Bloomberg) -- Global bond markets are sending a clear signal: The Federal Reserve is the only central bank worth wagering on when it comes to tightening policy.
Two-year Treasury yields are close to a record high relative to their German and U.K. counterparts, while versus Japan the gap is about the biggest since 2007. The spreads have widened before Wednesday’s decision by the Fed, which is expected to reaffirm its plan to gradually raise rates amid a tight labor market.
While U.S. traders may not be fully on board with the Fed’s projected hiking path, they’re comfortable pricing in a third 2018 hike in September. Meanwhile, officials at the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have barely left base camp in their attempts to curb crisis-era stimulus. And investors have little confidence the Bank of England will follow an anticipated hike this week with further increases. What it all adds up to is that anyone betting on synchronized global tightening is seeing their hopes dashed.
Instead, investors are left watching incremental shifts in “the pace of the Fed tightness versus the pace of the less easiness of the ECB or BOJ,” said Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth Management, which oversees about $52 billion. “On an absolute basis, the Fed is the tightest game in town for now.”
Shifting Focus
In a week that started with traders anticipating a possible shift in the BOJ’s stance, Wednesday’s Fed decision is set to refocus the market on the prospect of U.S.-led policy divergence.
Japanese officials wound up introducing more flexibility to their massive stimulus program, but quashed speculation that they’d signal a move toward withdrawing accommodation. Meanwhile, the Brexit impasse has traders doubting the BOE will hike beyond this week. And the ECB has pledged to keep rates at record lows “at least through the summer of 2019.”
The euro region’s growth may be showing signs of slowing, but a robust U.S. economy, kicked into overdrive with the help of fiscal stimulus, has intensified the divergence in expectations for monetary policy. America’s gross domestic product expanded last quarter at the fastest pace since 2014, with some analysts crediting last year’s tax overhaul.
“The decoupling that’s being observed is almost 100 percent a function of politicians in the U.S. doing things that politicians in Europe, and Japan and the U.K. just haven’t done,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn). “All of this has been providing more tailwinds to the already wide yield spreads we had between U.S. 10-year Treasuries and bunds, and Japanese government bonds.”
Nevertheless, U.S. money-market traders aren’t convinced the current state of the economy warrants a tightening path as aggressive as the Fed is indicating. That skepticism may be at least in part a function of muted inflation expectations. Bond traders still see wage pressures remaining tame, even with the U.S. jobless rate close to the lowest since 2000.
The upshot is that for all the doubts about how much the Fed will lift rates in this cycle, investors at least have a roadmap to ponder. And that’s more than they’ll get anywhere else."

58,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 04:27PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P 500 Closes Higher Amid Trade Optimism, Tech Rebound","Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed higher as investors cheered a report that the U.S. and China were in talks to avert full-blown trade war.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.43%. The S&P 500 rose 0.49%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.55%.
Bloomberg reported, citing sources, the U.S. and China are trying to restart talks on trade to avert a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
The prospect of the U.S. and China returning to the negotiation table to reconcile their differences on trade sent trade-sensitive stocks sharply higher, helping the broader market snap a three-day losing streak.
3M (NYSE:MMM),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) stocks - notable names most sensitive to escalating trade conflagrations - closed sharply higher.
Investor optimism on the trade-war front comes as the next wave of tariffs on imported goods from China is expected to come into effect Wednesday, with China vowing to retaliate in kind.
The broader averages were also supported by a rise in tech for the first time in at least two sessions as a cluster of closely-watched tech stocks rebounded.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) stocks posted gains for the day.
Energy stocks kept a lid on gains, however, as oil prices settled sharply lower, posting their biggest monthly loss since 2016 amid easing expectations for steep losses of Iranian crude from the market.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September fell 1.9% to settle at $68.80 a barrel.
Ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates due Wednesday, market participants digested a raft of economic data showing inflation remained close to the Fed's 2% target and upbeat consumer confidence.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 0.1% in June and rose 1.9% in the 12 months through June.
That did little to alter investor expectations for an unchanged decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
On the corporate earnings front,  Pfizer  and Procter & Gamble stocks recovered from an early slump after posting mixed quarterly results.
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock closed above 3% after the drugmaker posted earnings and revenue that topped expectations, but guided full-year earnings lower.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock closed 0.85% higher after the household goods manufacturer reported an above-forecast earnings, while sales fell short.

The decision to not pursue the accusations was taken in February 2018, according to a copy of a charge evaluation sheet provided by the District Attorney's office. The claims were made by a woman who was not identified.
""The applicable statutes of limitation have expired as to all three incidents,"" the document said.
CBS and Moonves declined comment.
On Friday, New Yorker magazine reported on claims by six women who accused Moonves of sexually harassing them between 1985 and 2006. It was not clear if the woman referenced in the Los Angeles document was among them.
Moonves said in a statement on Friday that he ""may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances,"" which he called mistakes that he regretted immensely, but that he understood ""'no' means 'no'"" and never used his position to harm anyone's career.
On Monday, the CBS board said it had taken steps to select an outside counsel to lead an independent investigation into the matter.

The Los Angeles charge evaluation sheet said that the woman met Moonves ""through employment in the television industry"" and that she alleged sexual abuse by Moonves in 1986 and on two occasions in 1988. It did not give details of the alleged abuse.

64,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico utility debt restructuring deal points to path forward,"By Karen Pierog
(Reuters) - A preliminary deal with owners of more than $3 billion of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) bonds, announced late on Monday, puts the bankrupt utility on a tentative path toward transformation and privatization, but more challenges remain.
The restructuring agreement announced by a bondholders group largely made up of mutual funds and the utility would exchange existing bonds for new debt and link future payments to the island's economic recovery. 
The deal marks a major development in the government-owned utility's four-year effort to restructure its debt. That process produced multiple proposals that were ultimately stymied, including one that was rejected by Puerto Rico's federal oversight board last year.
Monday's deal sent prices on some PREPA bonds higher in secondary market trading. 
Governor Ricardo Rossello's office estimated the tentative agreement would result in more than $3 billion in debt service cost savings over 20 years.
Oversight board Chairman Jose Carrion called the deal ""a milestone"" in the debt restructuring process aimed at transforming and privatizing PREPA into ""a modern, world-class utility.""
Sinking under a debt load of $9 billion, PREPA filed for bankruptcy in July 2017. [nL1N1JT0GX] Its financial and operational problems were compounded by Hurricane Maria, which slammed into the island in September, decimating an electric grid already struggling due to poor rate collection, heavy management turnover and lack of maintenance. 
Unlike previous proposed deals with creditors, the new agreement links future debt payments to Puerto Rico's economic recovery and minimizes risk to rate payers by setting a fixed annual transition charge, according to the territory's oversight board, which was also part of the agreement. That board was created by the U.S. Congress under the so-called PROMESA Act. 
James Spiotto, a municipal bankruptcy expert at Chapman Strategic Advisors, said on Tuesday the deal shows progress toward a consensual resolution.
""It's a very positive step,"" he said in an interview. ""Is it done? No.""
DEBT EXCHANGE
The agreement would give bondholders 67.5 cents on the dollar in the form of 40-year ""tranche A"" bonds and 10 cents on the dollar in the form of 45-year ""tranche B"" bonds that would receive excess cash flow once the tranche A bonds are repaid.
""This negotiated agreement, the first of its kind in the commonwealth's restructuring, is a significant positive achievement for all parties involved,"" the Ad Hoc Group of PREPA bondholders said in a statement.
Some PREPA bonds due in 2042 traded at 61 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, up from 45 cents on the dollar earlier this month.
The preliminary agreement lays out several potential events that could result in its termination, including the dismissal of the bankruptcy case.
Not included in the preliminary deal are PREPA bonds backed by insurance companies that guarantee debt payments. Assured Guaranty, a bond insurer, said on Tuesday it will continue ""to vigorously enforce our property rights as a secured creditor"" in PREPA's bankruptcy case, while also seeking to consensually resolve matters.
The oversight board said that in addition to finalizing the deal, it seeks to reach debt restructuring agreements with insurers and fuel line lenders. 
Rossello in January announced a plan to privatize the crippled utility, which recently experienced management changes that led to a congressional oversight hearing last week. [nL2N1PH1Y7] [nL1N1UL26L]

Earlier, Iraqi intelligence said the network had been uncovered and a number of members of the gang detained, in coordination with Lebanon's General Directorate of General Security.
The gang published false news and fabricated information with the aim of extorting Lebanese banks, claiming their ownership of deeds of assets to the value of millions of U.S. dollars, Major General Abbas Ibrahim, the head of General Security, said in Beirut. 
""More than one bank was targeted but the big operations were happening against Bank Audi,"" Ibrahim said. 
""We want to see who is behind this gang...The matter may exceed $1 billion,"" he added. ""There is certainly targeting of the Lebanese banking sector.""
Those arrested were Iraqis, he added. General Security had been following the case for more than a year.
An intelligence source in Iraq said Iraqi and Lebanese authorities had ""managed to compromise a criminal network that attempted to blackmail some Baghdad-based banks, including Lebanon's Audi, by using forged documents to withdraw huge cash (amounts) in U.S. dollar"".
Some people in the network were still in large and were being sought, the intelligence source said.
Bank Audi, in a statement, thanked the Iraqi authorities and Lebanon's General Directorate of General Security for their ""intensive effort and timely action"".

66,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 02:51PM ET</span>","Cummins to recall 500,000 U.S. trucks over faulty emissions part","WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) -  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI) has agreed to recall about 500,000 medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the United States to correct a faulty emissions control system in the engines it made for the trucks, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday.
The EPA said the Cummins recall of vehicles produced between 2010 and 2015 was the largest ever voluntary recall of trucks due to emissions problems. The catalytic reduction systems were found to be less durable than required and will be replaced, it said.
A spokesman for Cummins said the recall was ""in the best interests of our customer and the environment.""
The recall is to replace a faulty emissions control systems component that causes excess nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. The problem is the result of a defective part and was discovered during emissions standards compliance tests by the California Air Resources Board, which said Cummins ""worked collaboratively"" with the regulator on the recall.
The Cummins spokesman said the recall will be rolled out in two phases, starting with heavy-duty trucks in August and medium-duty trucks next March.
A previous recall that is underway involves Cummins engines in around 232,000 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. 
The EPA said the problem does not involve illegal software known as ""defeat devices,"" which increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests.
Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) has been found guilty of using such software to pass U.S. emissions tests in the ""dieselgate"" scandal which came to light in 2015. 
Audi AG's Chief Executive Rupert Stadler was suspended after his arrest in mid-June as part of a broader probe into emissions cheating at the premium brand, which is part of the VW group.
Stadler has appealed to a court to be released from custody.

67,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 02:46PM ET</span>",Pfizer CEO expects Trump to eliminate drug rebates,"By Michael Erman and Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) Chief Executive Ian Read said on Tuesday he believes the Trump administration intends to stop the practice of allowing rebates on prescription drug purchases, suggesting that U.S. drug pricing reforms may focus on middlemen rather than drugmakers.
""I believe the administration does want to remove rebates, and they consider it a priority,"" he said in an interview, following similar comments made on Pfizer's conference call to discuss second quarter earnings.
The administration has already proposed a rule that would scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs). Read said he believes the administration wants to get rid of them entirely.
These rebates are rarely passed along to U.S. patients. 
Read said Pfizer had discussed the administration's plan for rebates ""in broad terms"" with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. The CEO said he does not know how quickly changes to rebate policy could be implemented.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made lowering prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers a top priority. His administration has placed blame on ""middlemen"" such as PBMs - which administer drug benefits for employers and health plans - and health insurers for driving up drug prices by demanding hefty rebates in exchange for broad access to patients. 
Read said Pfizer currently receives around 58 percent of its list prices on drugs, suggesting that about 40 percent goes to middlemen. He said ending the rebate system would allow drugmakers to keep price hikes in line with health care inflation.
The largest U.S. drugmaker retreated from planned price hikes on about 40 of its drugs earlier this month, following criticism from President Trump. Read has spoken with Trump and visited the White House since deferring those price increases.
Bowing to intensifying political pressure, several major drugmakers have also announced drug price freezes until the end of the year. 
Pfizer shares rose $1.09, or 2.8 percent, to $39.68 in afternoon trading, closing in on near 16-year highs.
Pfizer on Tuesday also reported better-than-expected second quarter profit, but trimmed its full-year revenue forecast due to the strengthening dollar.
Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said investors were encouraged by management optimism about new drugs and long-term growth prospects after prior disappointment that Pfizer had not done a big acquisition.
""There's more optimism around the internal pipeline and their ability to expand margins long term,"" she said.
Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 81 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 7 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Pfizer said it now expects 2018 revenue of between $53 billion and $55 billion, versus its a prior forecast of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion.
It raised both ends of its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast range by 5 cents and now expects $2.95 to $3.05 per share.
Second quarter results were helped by higher-than-expected sales of rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz at $463 million, and by the staying power of its former top-seller Lipitor.
The off-patent cholesterol drug still generated worldwide sales of $521 million.

Total revenue in the quarter rose 4.4 percent to $13.47 billion, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $13.31 billion.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","Parent of MoviePass raises prices, cuts service; shares sink","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The parent company of embattled movie theater subscription service MoviePass announced on Tuesday that it will seek to limit losses by hiking its monthly fees by 50 percent within the next 30 days while limiting opportunities for subscribers to see most films during their first two weeks in theaters. 
Shares of MoviePass parent Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc (O:HMNY) were down 36 percent at midday in see-saw trade that saw shares surge briefly by over 150 percent on the announcement. Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings (N:AMC), the biggest U.S. movie theater chain which offers a rival ticket service, jumped 7.5 percent in midday trading.
""We believe that the measures we began rolling out last week will immediately reduce cash burn by 60 percent and will continue to generate lower funding needs in the future,"" Chief Executive Officer Ted Farnsworth said in a statement. 
The company's shares have plunged 96 percent over the last week after it was unable to make required payments to its merchant and fulfillment processors. Service interruptions left its 3 million customers unable to access movie tickets. 
The company, which says it accounts for roughly 6 percent of U.S. box office receipts, is one of just a few disruptive technology companies that chose to go public during its growth phase. [L1N1SA1SY] This has heightened investor attention and made its share price more volatile. 
Farnsworth in his statement noted that the company has ""challenged an entrenched industry while maintaining the financially transparent records of a publicly traded company.""
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the price hike and service cuts could hurt MoviePass as a competitor in the marketplace. He noted that the price increase from $9.95 to $14.95 puts the price point just $5 lower than the $19.95 subscription service offered by AMC. 
At the same time, the AMC service, called A-List, includes IMAX and 3D films and allows subscribers to view up to three films a week, he added. 

""Raising the price and making people wait may get (MoviePass) to break even, but the question is how many of them will stick around when you can spend five dollars more and go to an IMAX showing on opening night,"" Pachter said. ""My guess is they will lose a lot of customers. And maybe survive.""

(Reuters) - More than 100 people said they had fallen sick after eating at a  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) restaurant in Ohio, sending shares of the burrito chain down as much as 9 percent on Tuesday.
The customers said they suffered from food poisoning and diarrhea after eating dishes including tacos and burrito bowls at the Powell, Ohio restaurant over the past few days, according to food safety website iwaspoisoned.com.
The Delaware General Health District, which is investigating the food safety incident, told Reuters the county health department had got more than 100 calls since receiving the first complaint linked to the restaurant on Sunday.
Public information officer Traci Whittaker said the department was investigating food samples from the outlet, but is still not aware of the pathogen that caused the illnesses.
The reports come just after the agency had routinely inspected the restaurant on July 26 and found that lettuce and beans were not stored at the right temperature. However, the infractions were immediately corrected, Whittaker said.
Chipotle shut the restaurant on Monday after it received complaints of illness from two customers, Laurie Schalow, the company's chief communications officer, said in an email.
""We acted quickly and closed this single restaurant out of an abundance of caution yesterday. We are working with the local health department and we plan to reopen this restaurant today,"" Schalow said on Tuesday.
The Powell outlet said in a phone call that it was working to get the restaurant open by Tuesday afternoon.
The news is another setback to the company, which was recovering from a series of high-profile food safety lapses in 2015 that sickened more than 100 customers with E. coli and salmonella and bruised Chipotle's reputation and stock price.
It is also the first major food safety issue under new Chief Executive Brian Niccol as he works to bring back customers to the Mexican food chain that once was an investor darling. The stock traded over $700 just two months before the 2015 food safety incidents.
""If this story gains traction, it might have more serious implications for the stock. It certainly, at this point, is a negative. I think it is something the CEO should address,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said.

The company's shares were down 5.6 percent at $439.60, erasing gains made since Chipotle reported stronger-than-expected profit and same-restaurant sales for its second quarter on Thursday.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former  State Street  Corp (N:STT) executive avoided prison on Tuesday after cooperating with U.S. authorities investigating a scheme to defraud clients of the bank by applying secret commissions on billions of dollars in securities trades.
Richard Boomgaardt, who was the head of State Street’s transition management desk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, faced up to five years in prison after pleading guilty in 2017 to conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud.
He was instead sentenced to one year of probation by U.S. District Judge Denise Casper in Boston after a prosecutor argued he deserved credit for deciding early on to come forward and assist the U.S. Justice Department's investigation.
""I wish I could go back and do things differently,"" Boomgaardt, a citizen of Canada and the Netherlands who lives in England, said in court.
Boomgaardt, 45, is one four former employees of the Boston-based bank who have since 2016 faced U.S. charges they engaged in schemes to overcharge institutional clients, allowing State Street to earn millions of dollars.
He testified as a government witness during the trial of Ross McLellan, a former State Street executive vice president who was convicted in June of conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud.
The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging six customers mark-ups on certain transactions. 
In 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations and entered a deferred prosecution agreement. 
Prosecutors said that from 2010 to 2011, McLellan, Boomgaardt and another executive, Edward Pennings, conspired to add the secret commissions for trades made for the six customers, which had been utilizing the bank's ""transition management"" business. 
The service helps large institutional clients like pension funds move their investments between and among asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios with the objective of minimizing the costs of transitioning the investments. 
The six customers included the Kuwait Investment Authority, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, and Irish, British and Dutch pension funds. 
The scheme resulted in those clients being overcharged by more than $20 million, prosecutors said.
Pennings pleaded guilty in 2017 and also testified against McLellan. Both men are scheduled to be sentenced in October.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, led by gains in industrials and a rebound in technology stocks, after a report that the United States and China hoped to resume talks to defuse a trade war between the world's two largest economies.
Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. 
The escalating trade dispute, with the two countries levying tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods earlier this month, has weighed heavily on the equity markets. The likelihood of a respite boosted the markets, with nine of the 11 major S&P sectors higher.
""The most important influence on the markets today is some tempering of the trade war escalation,"" said Bill Northey, senior vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana.

76,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Siemens thinks big with small-batch production,"By John Revill
KARLSRUHE, Germany (Reuters) - German engineering group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) is redoubling its efforts in an area where it has traditionally lagged: managing the processing of materials into medicines, chemicals or foodstuffs.
Siemens excels at helping makers of cars, planes and trains make their production and assembly smarter by using its software to create distinct items and components - so-called discrete manufacturing.
But when it comes to process industries such as petrochemicals, Siemens has been at a disadvantage to rivals such as industrial machinery and controller makers Honeywell (N:HON) or ABB (N:ABB), which have longer-standing relationships with major oil and gas players.
Now Siemens is investing in the technology used to control mixing, heating, and pressurising ingredients in the process industry - enabling the small-batch and hybrid production of products like drugs, where personalized and niche products are becoming more common.
""We have been developing very well, and have been gaining market share,"" Eckard Eberle, Siemens's head of process automation, told Reuters.
Under a new strategy likely to be announced on Thursday along with quarterly results, analysts expect Siemens to announce it is incorporating process automation within its broader factory automation business, which aims to digitize and streamline production for clients to improve efficiency.
""The market in process automation is growing at around 3 to 4 percent per year and our intention is to grow faster than that,"" Eberle said in an interview at the division's offices in Karlsruhe, Germany. ""We are doing that already.""
Siemens, one of Germany's most famous industrial names, was founded in 1847, and is active in electrification, automation, industrial software and the manufacture of products from trains to turbines.
The Munich-based company, employs 377,000 people worldwide and generated revenue of 83 billion euros in 2017. 
Unlike the Digital Factory division, which houses Siemens' discrete manufacturing software and has been the star performer, Process Industries and Drives (PID) has been one of the weakest-performing divisions.
PID, which represents about 10 percent of group sales, saw its revenue fall 1 percent last year, while orders grew by only 2 percent. It also had the second-lowest operating profit margin, at 5 percent, less than half the overall 11.2 percent.
But analysts reckon Siemens has a decent chance of success at galvanizing its process automation business.
""With large scale process automation, such as downstream oil and gas, there are not many greenfield opportunities and the incumbents sitting on a large installed base have a clear advantage,"" said James Stettler of  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""With more smaller batch manufacturing and hybrid projects there's more contracts around to go for.""
At present Siemens has a 15 percent share in the $14 billion global market for distributed control systems - the computer ""brains"" which oversee production - lagging market leaders ABB and Honeywell, according to ARC, an industrial analyst company.
HOLY GRAIL
One such opportunity that Siemens has grasped is at German biotech company BioNTech, which enlisted Siemens to help develop personalized anti-cancer treatments made with just a few drops of medicine rather than mass producing thousands of liters.
The Mainz-based company, which is working with Roche's (S:ROG) Genentech arm, uses Siemens software to produce trial batches of drugs which identify and attack cancerous cells.
""Each person's cancer is 95 percent different, so the ultimate target is to produce medicines for the individual in only small quantities which enable the immune system to identify their specific cancer and attack it,"" said Sierk Poetting, BioNTech's chief operating officer.
""It is not something you can produce in large quantities and put on the shelves to treat lots of people.""
BioNTech's project would not have been possible without a digital set up.
""In the past, an individual dose would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but we are looking to reduce this to a tenth or a 15th of the cost,"" Poetting said. 
This kind of small-batch production will require more automation and digitization of processes.
""Being able to produce in a batch size of one product is the Holy Grail for industrial firms,"" said David Humphrey, an analyst at ARC.
Simon Toennessen, an analyst at Berenberg, said Siemens was doing well in acquiring new business in process automation.

""I've heard they are in the top three in new installations right now,"" he said. ""The company's expertise in software is a big reason for this. They are trying to leverage the strong design and simulation capabilities they have in the automotive and aerospace side and now deploying that into process industries.""

77,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 12:56PM ET</span>","Shell, Petrobras units probed for Brazil price-fixing","By Pedro Fonseca
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's three largest fuel distribution companies are under investigation for fixing prices at the pump, police said on Tuesday, reigniting debate over potential collusion among gas station owners in Latin America's largest oil producer.
The firms targeted by the probe are  Petrobras Distribuidora  SA (SA:BRDT3), a subsidiary of state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4); Ipiranga, a unit of Ultrapar Participações SA (SA:UGPA3); and Raízen, a Cosan SA (SA:CSAN3) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (AS:RDSa) joint venture.
Police in the southern state of Parana were serving eight arrest warrants and 12 search and seizure warrants in connection with the probe in the city of Curitiba, the state capital, according to police.
The probe comes two months after Brazil's economy was paralyzed by a trucker strike over soaring diesel fuel prices. While the government resolved that protest with new subsidies and other measures, antitrust regulators also raised concerns about a lack of competition in the highly concentrated sector.
Police said they were targeting managers and sales representatives of the three firms in the investigation, which has been underway for over a year.
They accused the fuel distribution companies of dictating the prices at the pump charged by individual gas station owners, a violation of Brazilian market rules that the owners should have freedom to set prices freely.
Shares in Petrobras Distribuidora, Ultrapar, and Cosan all tumbled at least 3.5 percent in late morning trade, dragging Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index (BVSP) down some 1.3 percent. 
To make sure the dictated prices were being applied by the gas station owners, the distribution companies hired people to ride motorbikes around the city of Curitiba to take pictures of the gas stations and their pricing banners, according to police.
Petrobras Distribuidora, also known as BR Distribuidora, said in a statement that it follows ""the best commercial, competitive and ethical practices toward the consumer"" and demands the same behavior from its partners and workforce.
Raízen said fuel prices were set by individual gas station owners with no interference from the distributor.
""The company operates in total conformity with applicable legislation and always acts toward the consumer in a competitive way and in favor of free competition,"" it said in a statement.
Ipiranga said that it ""does not incentivize illegal practices,"" and that it operates in compliance with competition regulations.
The three companies under investigation together control more than two-thirds of the national fuel distribution market, according to data from oil regulator ANP.
The operation is the latest effort by Brazilian authorities to clamp down on collusion and price fixing in the fuel distribution market, which has been the most common target of accusations for cartel behavior by antitrust watchdog Cade.

The government had asked Cade earlier this year to investigate fuel stations for potential anticompetitive practices that could account for the large spread between fuel prices at refineries and at pumps.

92,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Former HSBC currency trader wins appeal against U.S. extradition,"LONDON (Reuters) - A former HSBC (L:HSBA) executive has won a British court battle against the U.S. government over his extradition, according to the judge's ruling published on Tuesday. 
The United States had wanted to extradite Stuart Scott, HSBC's former head of cash trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, to face fraud charges over allegations he and a colleague defrauded client  Cairn Energy  Plc (L:CNE) in a $3.5 billion currency trade in 2011. 
Scott took his case to London's High Court in the hope of overturning an earlier court decision to send him to the United States in a case that has already seen his colleague, Mark Johnson, sentenced to two years in prison.
The judge, Lord Burnett, ruled in favor of Scott's appeal, saying it was not in the interests of justice for him to be extradited because most of the alleged crimes took place in Britain and because Scott has no significant connection to the United States. 
""Conversely, those factors which told in favor of extradition were of significantly less weight,"" he said in a written ruling.
""In these circumstances this court is entitled to say that the judge's overall evaluation was wrong ... the appellant's extradition is not in the interests of justice and the appeal should be allowed.""
The court's rare decision to block a U.S. extradition request for now allows Scott to avoid the fate of Johnson, who became the first banker to be tried in the United States as a result of worldwide investigations into the multi-trillion-dollar per day currency market. He was convicted in October.
The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment.
U.S. prosecutors allege that Scott and Johnson, formerly head of HSBC's global foreign exchange cash trading desk, schemed to ramp up the price of British pounds before executing the trade for Cairn, making millions for HSBC at Cairn's expense. 
Cairn had hired HSBC in 2011 to convert $3.5 billion into British pounds sterling in connection with the sale of an Indian subsidiary. 
Scott's lawyer, Anne Davies, said he was ""very pleased"" with the court's judgment, but added that the United States has indicated an intention to appeal. 
""As proceedings are ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment any further,"" she said in a statement. 
Scott's lawyers argued that the extradition request misrepresented the relationship between HSBC and Cairn, which they said had made clear HSBC was not acting as an agent of the firm and did not owe it any fiduciary duty, and that no crime had been committed under English law. 
HSBC declined to comment. The bank agreed to pay Cairn $8.08 million under a settlement reached in July 2017.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 11:53AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lloyd's of London reviews operations after losing $2.6 billion and CEO,"By Carolyn Cohn and Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London is reviewing all aspects of its business, including its centuries-old structure, to ensure it is cost-competitive and responsive to both clients and members, especially after Britain leaves the EU, industry sources said.
The review, coming after a 2-billion-pound ($2.64-billion) loss last year and the news in June that CEO Inga Beale will step down, goes to the core of the institution's hybrid personality, senior insurers and other officials in London's financial services sector said.
Lloyd's has been holding board and other internal meetings and separate discussions with broader market participants on the best way forward, the officials said. Precise details of the review have not been disclosed, they said.
""A strategic review is being worked on,"" said one financial services source, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to discuss it. Another source, a senior executive at a firm that supplies services to Lloyd's members, said he understood that included looking at its unique structure. 
""The most fundamental question is, what does Lloyd's actually want to be?"" the executive said. 
At present, Lloyd's is both a marketplace for its 80-plus syndicated members and an umbrella body that sometimes acts like an insurer by getting deeply involved in members' day-to-day practices. It also regulates the members under the auspices of the UK government. 
Asked whether Lloyd's was conducting a strategic review, Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown told Reuters on Monday he would not use that term.
""To me a strategic review implies some kind of crisis, where you've got to put everything into a big hat and end up boiling the ocean. We are not interested in that. What I think we have is a series of improvements and ideas,"" he said in a telephone interview. 
He said Lloyd's was looking at all aspects of the business, however - cost structure, technology, its role as a marketplace and a regulator, and how it mutualises risk. He said recommendations from an ""annual strategy day"" in June were presented to the board last week and a number of ""workstreams"" were being set up.
""I think what we need to do is to look at all aspects of what we do, to try to make sure everything we are doing is done better and turn it into more of an exercise to keep turning the stones over of the things that we do to figure out if we can make things more efficient,"" he said.
Carnegie-Brown said he did not see Lloyd's relinquishing its regulatory duties but said there were ""whole aspects of regulation that we need to look at to make sure that we are not duplicating what is already done by other regulators"".
MARKETPLACE
If Lloyd's was a pure marketplace, member syndicates could be more innovative, accommodating short-term losses for future gains, industry sources said. Doing so would risk Lloyd's losing the single-A credit rating that benefits all members, however.
""If it's a marketplace, it's for each party to come to the market, it's for them to work out what they want to offer,"" the senior executive said, while an insurer would incorporate the individual groups operating within it to form a company. 
""I do not think it is being crystal clear which one it is, or wants to be."" 
The UK government is keen that Britain, the world's largest commercial insurance center, remains competitive in financial services after Brexit. Lloyd's is setting up a subsidiary in Brussels to maintain access to Europe's single market. 
""Lloyd's needs to ensure that London keeps its edge in insurance, which is vital for the wider financial future of London,"" the financial services source said. 
Lloyd's started life in Edward Lloyd's coffee house in 1688. The futuristic look of its 14-storey headquarters in the City belies an emphasis on customs and tradition. 
Most business is still conducted face to face. Underwriters and brokers use briefcases or suitcases to carry paperwork around the building; some marine insurers record the sinking of ships with quill pens. The requirement for men to wear ties was relaxed only recently. 
The market was almost brought to its knees by asbestos-related claims in the 1990s, which wiped out many of its individual investors, known as ""names"". 
Members include small underwriters as well as listed UK firms like Beazley (L:BEZG) and  Hiscox  (L:HSX) and units of global insurers, specializing in complex commercial risks such as marine, aviation and niche energy markets.
Julia Graham, deputy chief executive at insurance buyers' association Airmic, said Lloyd's has set up a working group with her client organization to discuss improving their relationship. She said Airmic regularly met Lloyd's at board level but that a meeting this month was ""a bit more intimate"".
""The main point is that they asked us,"" she said. ""Lloyd's is still a leader. It's important that it remains relevant.""
COSTS
Last year's two-billion-pound loss, the first in six years, followed a record year of insurance losses from natural disasters globally. London also faces competition from rivals like Bermuda and Singapore.
Lloyd's will be looking at ways to cut members' costs, which have ballooned as a result of increasing regulatory and compliance paperwork and rising commissions from brokers, industry sources said. The high costs of operating from London and administrative expenses have also weighed, they said. 
A new electronic processing system introduced by Beale, the first female chief executive of Lloyd's, was unpopular with smaller brokers and underwriters.
""If you are pushing it through an electronic system, there will be little scope for enhancements or individual treatment, which is what a lot of people come to Lloyd’s for,"" said industry veteran Andrew Bathurst, director of London and Dubai insurance broker PWS Gulf and a director of Mystic Capital.
Whether to continue implementing the new system at the current pace - 30 percent of all business this year rising to 80 percent next year - is likely to be part of the review, two insurance sources said.
Lloyd's insurers have an expense ratio of 40 percent, according to ratings agency AM Best, which Paul Merrey, a partner specializing in insurance at KPMG, said is about 10 percentage points higher than competitors.

""The costs of operating are getting out of hand"" due to increased regulation, said one senior underwriting source. He agreed the biggest question mark was over structure, however: ""What is Lloyd's? Is it a market or is it an insurer?""

(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co's (N:PG) fiscal fourth-quarter sales fell below Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, hurt by lower pricing and weak demand at its units that make Pampers diapers and Gillette shaving products.
Big consumer goods makers are struggling to grow sales as consumer habits evolve, with many shoppers choosing fresher brands or changing the way they groom themselves. P&G and its rivals have also been dogged by surging transportation and commodities costs, particularly for pulp used in diapers and tissue products.
Net sales rose 2.6 percent to $16.50 billion. Analysts had forecast sales of $16.54 billion.
The company, whose board members include activist investor Nelson Peltz, said cost cuts and higher prices would help it report stronger organic sales and core earnings in the second half of fiscal 2019 than in the first half. 
Shares of Procter & Gamble, the world's second-largest packaged goods company after Nestle SA (S:NESN), were down 0.5 percent at $79.82. 
P&G is rolling out an average 4-percent increase in Pampers prices in North America, and has begun notifying retailers of an average 5-percent price rise for Bounty, Charmin and Puffs tissue products.
Higher prices may not sit well with U.S. retailers that have been aggressively cutting prices and tightening inventory levels to keep pace with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
""While P&G announced 4-5 percent price increases for key U.S. businesses, questions remain whether pricing will stick in the current environment,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note.
For fiscal 2019, P&G said it sees core earnings per share growth of 3 percent to 8 percent, or $4.45 at the mid-point. Analysts were expecting $4.39 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
FEWER SHAVES
In order to claw back market share lost to upstarts such as Dollar Shave Club, P&G cut prices on products in its grooming business by 3 percent during the quarter. Sales in the unit fell 1 percent to $1.65 billion, while volumes dropped 1 percent.
P&G Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller blamed the unit's lower sales on consumers shaving less frequently, saying the company's price cuts had helped it take back some market share. 
Revenue fell 2 percent at P&G's Baby, Feminine & Family Care business - its second-biggest contributor to revenue - amid lower demand in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.

Net income attributable to the company fell to $1.89 billion, or 72 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended June 30. Excluding items, P&G earned 94 cents per share, ahead of analysts' estimates of 90 cents.

102,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Big Oil's Winners and Losers Emerge as Crude Prices Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- Crude prices rose to three-year highs, operating costs were down and profit was growing by double or triple digits, but investors still found plenty to complain about in Big Oil’s second-quarter earnings.
The past week’s financial reports showed a surprising variation in the strength of the world’s largest energy companies. Some were perfectly poised to rocket out of the worst industry downturn in a generation by boosting production just as oil prices soared. Others failed to lift off and fell back to Earth with a bump.
Rocket Fuel
Surging oil prices lifted everybody, with  BP  (LON:BP) Plc’s fourfold profit increase leading the pack. Companies cut costs in the downturn and have largely kept them in check, giving them an extra benefit as crude rises. After years of borrowing to pay shareholders, most of the world’s biggest non-state energy firms generated enough cash to cover dividends and investments.
“We’ve turned around and retooled the company over seven years,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a Bloomberg television interview. “It shows more confidence than we’ve had in a long time.”
Winners and Losers
It was evident that each company was at a different point in its investment cycle, and the market reacted accordingly.  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) showed the best timing, positioning itself to reap the rewards of earlier investments by increasing its production forecast just as oil prices rise.
BP couldn’t match Total’s output boost, but confidently asserted that it had the financial strength to both increase dividends and chase growth with its biggest deal in decades.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX).’s profit fell short, but it successfully wooed holders by resurrecting buybacks after a three-year hiatus. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc also missed estimates, but its focus on paying down debt meant a slower-than-anticipated start to share repurchases.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). displeased investors on almost every front. It’s at the opposite end of the cycle to Total, spending heavily to reverse a drop in production. Cash flow didn’t cover investments and dividends -- meaning no buybacks.
Spending Again
Investors remain vigilant for any signs that oil giants’ spendthrift ways are returning as crude trades above $70 a barrel. Yet there are also signs they can be persuaded to tolerate higher expenditures.
That was evident in the market reaction to BP’s July 27 announcement that it was buying most of BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd.’s onshore U.S. oil assets for $10.5 billion, its biggest deal in almost two decades. Shares initially fell as much as 2.4 percent as analysts fretted over the price and the lack of synergies with its existing business.
After a bit of persuading from BP’s top brass over the merits of the acquisition, shares recovered and ended the day 0.5 percent higher. The company’s consensus-beating earnings on Tuesday justify the deal, said Iain Armstrong, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin Ltd.
Meager Rewards
It’s four years since the great oil slump began, with Brent crude falling from above $100 in June 2014 to as low as $27 in January 2016. The market is in much better health today, thanks to a combination of rapid demand growth and supply reductions from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
For anyone who stuck with major oil companies through those years of pain, the rewards so far haven’t exactly been impressive. Share prices have recovered, dividends have been maintained or increased, and buybacks are underway, yet average shareholder returns barely exceed, or in some cases severely lag the broader market.
The majors have “further work to do to capture the full free cash flow per barrel upside at higher oil,” Christyan Malek, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). said last week. Investors are starting to ask the question: “Where is the cash?”

103,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 10:13AM ET</span>",MORGAN STANLEY: The stock market is heading for its biggest sell-off of the year — here's how to protect yourself,"A stock market sell-off worse than the February correction is coming, Morgan Stanley's equity strategists forecast.
Earlier in July, they advised clients to turn defensive on the market in preparation for a rotation to sectors like utilities. They also  downgraded the tech sector, making two decisions that even they acknowledged many clients weren't excited about.
But the team led by Michael Wilson showed no sign of backing down on its views in its weekly note on Monday. In fact, the recent sell-off in tech, which led stocks lower Monday, only confirmed that the rotation to more-defensive sectors was gaining traction, Wilson said.
""The bottom line for us is that we think the selling has just begun and this correction will be biggest since the one we experienced in February,"" Wilson said. ""However, it could very well have a greater negative impact on the average portfolio if it's centered on tech, consumer discretionary and small caps, as we expect.""
It didn't help that  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) missed earnings expectations last week, with the social-media network setting a record for the  biggest one-day valuation wipeout. Netflix tumbled into a  bear market on Monday.
Because the damage was mostly contained to the stocks with disappointing earnings, investors got ""an even greater false sense of security in the market,"" Wilson said.
But a strong  report of US gross domestic product on Friday and  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s strong earnings left investors wondering what to look forward to. By then, Wilson said, ""the market appeared finally exhausted.""
""The selling started slowly, built steadily, and left the biggest winners of the year down the most,"" Wilson said.
His observations are based on the broader view that the stock market is in a rolling bear market this year — a  tougher environment to make money in.
""Perhaps the best way to express our rolling bear market view may be to simply overweight value vs growth as we are currently recommending in our sector weights,"" Wilson said.
Morgan Stanley is overweight utilities, energy, industrials, and financials.
Wilson added that while this recommendation may mean ditching the popular momentum stocks that have led the market higher, it's worth it at this stage. He noted that the outperformance gap between large-cap growth and value stocks was at its widest since the dot-com bubble. This gap isn't ""justified"" by forward growth and earnings expectations, he added."
104,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>",Trade war and iPhone sales: What to watch for in Apple earnings," Apple has a chance to give investors another reason to keep Apple's bullish streak going when it reports  earnings after markets close on Tuesday. Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up 15% in the past three months,  buoyed by a massive capital return program announced in April. 
In its fiscal 3rd quarter earnings, which cover the three months ending in June, Apple will reveal whether the iPhones it launched last September are enjoying sustained demand, or whether the more expensive $1,000 iPhone X fizzled in the slow season after last year's all-important holiday quarter. Generally, Apple's spring quarter is its slowest both in terms of revenue and iPhone sales. 
""Our checks suggest demand for iPhone 8 and 8 Plus remain seasonal while iPhone X inventory has normalized and older models continue to do well in emerging markets,"" Citi analyst Jim Suva wrote earlier this month.
Wall Street is looking for Apple to report revenue of $52.3 billion, up 15% year-over-year, and earnings per share of $2.16. 
But investors will also keep a close eye on commentary and details buried in the report that might suggest where Apple is going, especially this fall, when it's expected to launch new iPhones. 
Here's what Wall Street is looking for:
Given that the iPhone makes up the majority of Apple's revenue, it's only logical that investors would want to know how many iPhones were shipped and the average price they were sold for.
Even a small difference in that number can change Apple's earnings from a good day to a bad day for the stock. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Katy Huberty, for example, is expecting Apple to say that it shipped 39.8 million iPhones in the June quarter, underneath the consensus estimate for about 41.8 million iPhones shipped. 
But increasingly, investors are looking at Apple's services — the money it makes selling subscriptions to people who own iPhones — as the primary driver of what could make Apple a more valuable company than it already is. 
""Given iPhone results matter less late in a cycle ... we expect investors to focus increasingly on Services results as a sign of whether Apple's installed base monetization efforts can drive overall company growth despite declining device revenue,"" Huberty wrote in a July 23 note. 
Apple defines services as revenue it gets from iCloud, Apple Music, App Store, iTunes, and AppleCare, and sometimes Apple comments on its growth, especially during slower quarters. 
""Services is an increasingly important piece of the AAPL story and a major driver of gross margins,"" RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent note. ""The segment currently accounts for ~15% of revenues and is on track to become a ~$50B business by 2020.""
Huberty is looking for Services to grow 32% year-over-year, which would be a big jump. 
The Chinese market remains the area where Apple could see the greatest growth, given the country's growing middle class.
But Apple also faces  intense competition from domestic makers of Android phones, as well as regulatory issues in the middle kingdom. So far, Cook and his managing director of China, Isabel Ge Mahe, have managed to successfully navigate the tricky regulatory landscape. 
""China production data (int’l down 29% in F3Q) implies Apple’s Greater China sales growth will slow from 21% in F2Q,"" Nomura's Jeffery Kvaal wrote. 
Often guidance for Apple's fiscal 4th quarter will include a little bit of sales from Apple's newest phones, which are typically announced in September and go on sale shortly afterward.
However, one week of sales isn't usually enough to know whether the new product cycle is going to be a hit or not. That hasn't stopped analysts from speculating that if Apple's guidance is strong, it could be a hint that the company expects a big iPhone launch.
""While all eyes will be on Apple's will FQ4 guidance, we note that historically, revenue guidance for FY Q4 has *not* been a helpful predictor of the strength of the forthcoming cycle,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote. 
Apple is working on several new technologies that could unlock huge new markets: self-driving cars, augmented reality, and health and medicine.
All of these ""special projects"" and ""technology investigations"" are secretive. But sometimes, Apple officials during an earning call provide commentary that suggest that they see them as big projects and can guide expectations for increased revenue in the future. 
""In our opinion, revenue contribution can be significant even without Apple introducing any dedicated AR hardware,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note. ""Specifically, we estimate that AR can add $1 billion revenue by end of fiscal 2020 from App Store downloads alone.""
Apple has made data privacy a key marketing and engineering priority for the company, and it started to pay off earlier this year when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) came under fire for allowing companies like Cambridge Analytica to access people's data. 
CEO Tim Cook even took a few barely veiled shots at Facebook. 
So some analysts, like D.A. Davidston analyst Tom Forte, are looking for ""comments by management on the importance of data privacy and its efforts to address that in the updated versions of its operating systems.""
Reuters reported earlier this month that Apple's Apple Watch may be affected by tariffs proposed by the Trump administration. 
This could lead to an increase in the price of the Watch or a decrease in Apple's margins.
Analysts will be watching to see if Apple leadership provides any commentary on how the simmering trade war could affect any Apple products. 
""If there were any incremental tariffs invoked, we believe Apple would pass that cost to consumers and our view is any price increase is not a positive for demand,"" Citi's Suva wrote.
""We also note iPhone is not in the July 2018 tariff list for 818 goods,"" he continued.
Earlier this month, Apple announced that it had consolidated its Siri department under one head: John Giannandrea, which the iPhone giant hired away from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) earlier this year. 
This could signal a bigger emphasis on Siri and artificial intelligence in general at the company.
Commentary from Cook or CFO Luca Maestri could clarify the reasoning and hopes for the personnel change. 
""While we still see Apple playing catch up with Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s digital assistant, we are encouraged by the April 2018 addition of John Giannandrea (Google’s former chief of search and AI) to bolster Siri,"" Forte, the Davidson analyst, wrote. 
One bear case for Apple is that people replace their iPhones less often as the technology gets more mature. The closer replacement rates edge to three years instead of two years, the stronger the case gets. 
""iPhone replacement rates have normalized over the past few years in the 2.5-year range after being as low as 2.2 years on the iPhone 6 cycle,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long wrote. ""We believe there could be further lengthening if the new product cycle is not compelling."""
105,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>","U.S., China Said to Seek to Restart Talks to Defuse Trade War","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China are trying to restart talks aimed at averting a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest economies, two people familiar with the effort said.
Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations, according to the people who spoke about the deliberations on condition of anonymity. They cautioned that a specific timetable, the issues to be discussed and the format for talks aren’t finalized, but added there was agreement among the principals that more talks need to take place.
Negotiations to resolve the dispute have been stalled for weeks, with both sides refusing to budge. High-level U.S. talks on the trade posture with China are taking place this week, according to a third person who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Complicating Mnuchin’s efforts is a harder line taken by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has jurisdiction over the U.S.’s 301 investigation that sparked the tariffs. That case concluded China was stealing American technology and tariffs were needed to offset the damage.
The next wave of U.S. tariffs is set to kick in as early as Wednesday, with the possible imposition of duties on another $16 billion of Chinese imports. Officials in Beijing have vowed to respond with the same amount of tariffs on U.S. products.
A U.S. Treasury official didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."

107,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 09:28AM ET</span>",BMW to build 1 billion euro car factory in Hungary,"FRANKFURT/BUDAPEST (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) will invest 1 billion euros ($1.17 bln) to build a new plant in Hungary at a time when a rise in protectionism is forcing carmakers to curb inter-continental exports and to refocus production networks to serve regional trading blocs. 
A trade dispute between China and the United States has already hurt exports between the two nations, forcing global carmakers including  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), GM (N:GM) and FiatChrysler (MI:FCHA) to cut their profit outlooks.
As part of a strategic push to ""build where you sell"", BMW this year stopped exporting its X3 offroader to Asia from a plant in South Carolina because it can avoid tariffs by making the vehicle at a plant in China instead. 
BMW declined to say whether the decision to build the new Hungarian plant, its first new factory in Europe since 2005, was taken in response to increasing trade tensions.
The Munich-based carmaker said the plant will be built near the city of Debrecen about 230 kilometers east of Budapest and will have a production capacity of 150,000 cars. 
BMW did not specify which models would be manufactured in Hungary but said the new factory will help to expand its manufacturing footprint in Europe, a market where it sells 45 percent of its cars.
""Our new plant in Hungary will also be able to manufacture both combustion and electrified BMW models – all on a single production line,"" Oliver Zipse, BMW AG Board Member for Production said in a statement.
BMW has already beefed up production capacity in continental Europe by expanding its business with contract manufacturers VDL Nedcar in the Netherlands and Magna in Austria at a time when Britain is preparing to leave the European Union.
BMW joins Daimler (DE:DAIGn) and Audi (DE:NSUG), both of which already have car plants in Hungary. Audi recently announced investments to launch serial production of electric engines in the country.
Car manufacturing accounts for around one-third of Hungary's exports, and with BMW this could rise to 40 percent or even more, said Peter Virovacz, an analyst at ING in Budapest.
Virovacz said BMW's new capacity could help partly offset an expected slowdown in economic growth in 2019 and 2020 as European Union funds run out, and will bring foreign investment to a less developed eastern region of the Central European country.
However, he said the project will also boost Hungary's dependence on the car industry and thus its exposure to any cyclical slump in car sales if there is a global economic downturn.
""The biggest question mark regarding this investment will be the Hungarian labor market ... it is already very hard to find 1,000 employees, let alone in 2 years from now,"" he said.
Hungary, along with other Central European economies, has been struggling with a serious shortage of workers, partly due to a mass emigration to the west for higher wages.
Outside of Europe, BMW is expanding production in China and is due to open a new factory in Mexico next year.

CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - With toilet roll and tissues swept up in an escalating international trade row, it's not just Procter & Gamble's (N:PG) Charmin that's going to get the squeeze.
Higher prices in the wake of possible tariffs would exacerbate what is already mounting pressure on consumer product company profits from soaring costs from pulp, a main ingredient in tissues, diapers and sanitary towels.
P&G, the purveyor of Charmin toilet paper, Bounty towels and Puffs tissues, said on Tuesday that it had recently begun notifying retailers of a 5-percent average price increase on all three brands. The company said it had also started rolling out an average 4-percent price increase on Pampers diapers in North America.
Kimberly-Clark (N:KMB) raised prices on Kleenex and other tissue products around the world by 2 percent in the most recent quarter, while cutting its full-year profit forecast.
Pulp, made from wood chips or recycled paper, is the only component in many tissue products, and is part of most diapers and pads. As many as 1,000 rolls of toilet paper can be made from the pulp of one eucalyptus tree. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LsxxUj)
The price of hardwood pulp, an ingredient in tissues and toilet paper, has surged by about 60 percent since late 2016, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council, which tracks prices based on global customs data. The price of softwood pulp, used in diapers and sanitary pads, jumped by 21 percent during that period.
""They have to raise prices – if you're paying 21 percent more for softwood pulp and 60 more for hardwood, you have to pass that price on to someone or you're just not going to be able to stay in business,"" said Arnaud Franco, senior analyst at the council.
Demand from China, the world’s biggest and fastest-growing consumer of pulp, is at the heart of the global shortfall. Pulp prices were at an all-time low in 2016, weakened by China’s slowing economy. A pick-up in economic momentum in 2017 spurred higher demand for hard and softwood pulp, which the market could not meet due to a few large mills closing unexpectedly.
Additionally, in an effort to shed its role as the main recycler of the world's waste, China only imported 7.1 million tons of waste paper in the first half of 2018, down 52 percent from last year. Its ban on imported, unsorted mixed recycled paper came into effect December 31, leaving the Chinese in sudden need of large quantities of recovered pulp, used in packaging.
Trade battles are further complicating matters. Canada levied tariffs on $575 million worth of U.S. tissue, toilet paper and paper towel exports earlier this year as part of its trade dispute with the United States.
Industry executives worry that tariffs from China could be next on the horizon, if the United States goes through with a threat to tax a further $200 billion of Chinese imports.
If China reacted in kind, and placed tariffs on a similar amount of U.S. imports, that would cover about $2.4 billion worth of U.S. paper and pulp exports to China, said Jake Handelsman, senior director of international trade at the American Forest & Paper Association.
""China is a very important market for our industry,"" said Handelsman. ""This is definitely not welcome news.""
RIPPLE EFFECTS
Not only is pulp a core component in consumer products such as paper towels, but many companies also use packaging made with it. As costs to produce and ship paper goods climb, consumers may have to pay more for everyday items such as tissue or sanitary napkins.
U.S. shoppers have already been spending more this year for many of these products, according to Nielsen data, analyzed by investment management firm Bernstein.
Ultimately, the price shoppers pay is up to retailers - which balance prices across a range of products - and may not always reflect costs passed along by the manufacturer. Retailers may hike prices for paper towels, for instance, to avoid raising them on diapers.
So, while P&G said in June it has avoided raising prices on its products despite higher pulp costs, U.S. consumers shopping at retail stores are still paying more this year for Charmin toilet paper. Bernstein's analysis of the data showed the average U.S. retail price Charmin rose by 6.4 percent in the month ended mid-July. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2K1YqsC)
Similarly, retail prices for Bounty paper towels began rising about six months ago, though retail prices for Puffs tissues have mostly fallen or been flat since the start of the year. P&G declined to comment on the Nielsen data.
""Pulp is pervasive. When pulp moves, it's the proverbial golf ball through the garden hose that ripples through the industry's entire cost structure,"" AlixPartners consumer products consultant David Garfield said.
At Sweden’s Essity, pulp accounted for 25 percent of its costs in consumer tissue, which relies almost solely on virgin, not recycled, pulp for its softness, it said. The company said its year-on-year pulp costs jumped 35 percent and gobbled up nearly half of its consumer tissue unit's potential operating margin in the second quarter.

""A year ago, some players thought that maybe higher pulp prices were a temporary thing,"" Essity CEO Magnus Groth told Reuters. ""No one believes that anymore.""

126,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 07:37AM ET</span>","Honda resists U.S. tariff hit for now, first-quarter profit at 12-year high","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor (T:7267) said the impact of U.S. steel and aluminum import tariffs on its bottom line had so far been limited, as it posted a surprise jump in quarterly profits to their highest in more than a decade on improving North American sales.
The automaker also forecast a less than previously expected drop in annual operating profit and, while it lowered its global vehicle sales view given floods in Mexico are expected to drag on output, the number is still expected to be a record high.
The promising results and earnings outlook from Japan's No.3 automaker stands in stark contrast to the dull forecasts from several major automakers hurt by rising raw material costs. A possible hike in U.S. tariffs on imported cars is further muddying projections for the sector globally.
Detroit automakers General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) lowered their full-year profit forecasts just last week amid worries escalating tariffs would hurt margins and sales. 
Honda, however, said its policy of localizing production and procurement was acting as a buffer for now in the United States - a key market for the company.
""Roughly 90 percent of our steel and aluminum needs in the United States are procured locally,"" Honda Senior Managing Director Kohei Takeuchi said at an earnings briefing on Tuesday. ""Overall we're not seeing a big impact (from tariffs) so far.""
For the first quarter ended June, Honda's operating profit rose 11.2 percent to 299.3 billion yen ($2.69 billion), highest since early 2006 and above an average estimate of 250 billion yen from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
This was driven by a 3 percent rise in global vehicle sales, led by a 7.7 percent jump in North America.
SALES TO HIT RECORD, BUT SMALLER
Honda's U.S. sales have improved after it raised output of SUVs including its Pilot model, shifting production away from its mainstay Civic and Accord sedans, demand for which have plummeted over the past few years.
Sales were slightly lower in Asia, Honda's biggest regional market, over the quarter. 
While the automaker has been facing a slump in sales in China, the world's largest vehicle market, amid a quality issue with its popular models, it said it would stick to its annual target to sell 2.2 million vehicles in Asia.
But it downgraded its global group vehicle sales forecast as it expects floods in Mexico to cut production by 75,000 units, resulting in lower sales in North America.
It expects to sell 5.29 million vehicles globally in the year to March, still a record high but below a previous estimate for 5.38 million units.
It sees annual operating profit at 710 billion yen, versus 700 billion yen previously and down 15 percent from a year ago.
The automaker said it had not made any decisions on whether to change its operations if the United States raises tariffs on vehicle imports - a move that could significantly raise the cost of doing business in the world's No. 2 car market.
The United States in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to quickly impose tariffs of up to 25 percent.

Denso Corp (T:6902), one of world's largest auto component makers, has said U.S. auto tariffs, if implemented, would wipe around $700 million from its profits this year.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Funds lift U.S. stocks to highest allocation in more than three years,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors increased their U.S. equity holdings to the highest in more than three years in July, but trade conflict between the United States and China encouraged them to trim their exposure to emerging-markets stocks. 
Reuters' monthly asset allocation poll of 50 wealth managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan was carried out July 16-31.
During this period the U.S. economy reported second-quarter growth of 4.1 percent, the fastest pace in nearly four years,, while U.S. President Donald Trump threatened fresh tariffs against China, raising the stakes in their bitter trade dispute.
But investors remained bullish despite the growing protectionism, raising their U.S. stocks allocation by 2.3 percentage points to 41.9 percent, the highest since June 2015.
The S&P 500 (SPX) looks set to end July up around 3 percent despite a late-month wobble in technology, with industrials providing support.
""We prefer U.S. to Europe due to a more solid economic environment, historically strong buyback activity and a stronger corporate earnings momentum, even without taking into account the fiscal package positive effect,"" said Cedric Baron, head of multi-asset strategies at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments, referring to corporate tax cuts.
Investors also raised their global equity exposure to 47.5 percent, the highest since April, from 46.8 percent in June.
TRADE WAR CROSSHAIRS
But they trimmed their emerging-market stocks allocation to 12.2 percent from 12.4 percent in June, with many poll participants saying these export-oriented markets were likely to suffer most in the event of a full-blown trade war. 
Investors are doubly focused on China and its integrated supply chains following a U.S. deal with the European Union to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the two negotiate 
""Assuming that the dispute, at least in the short term, will mainly involve the U.S. and China, the countries most exposed to these two countries (Vietnam, Taiwan, Colombia, South Korea, Malaysia) could be more vulnerable,"" said Pascal Blanque, group chief investment officer at Amundi.
Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management, was one of those adding to more defensive U.S. equities while cutting emerging markets, citing weaker global growth and a strong dollar, which have led to underperformance. 
MSCI's benchmark emerging stocks index (MSCIEF) is down 6 percent year-to-date, although it is on track to end July in the black after five losing months.
Investors also reduced Japanese equities by almost 2 percentage points to 17 percent, the lowest since January. Several poll participants identified Japan as another potential loser in a full-blown trade war. 
In fixed income, investors cut their U.S. bonds exposure by 1.5 percentage points to 37.7 percent, a three-month low. Some 82 percent of poll participants who answered a question on the U.S. 2 to 10-year Treasury yield curve do not expect it to invert by year-end.
An inversion of the yield curve - the spread between short-term and long-term debt securities - is considered a signal of a possible recession.
Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, expects a flat yield curve for some time as the market prices in ""further improvements in U.S. growth, some underlying inflation, considerable pressure from public sector debt issuance as the U.S. deficit expands, and strong demand from pension funds and households for higher yielding assets"".
BREXIT TURMOIL
Investors were also asked their view of British Prime Minister Theresa May's ability to deliver Brexit following a turbulent month in which several cabinet ministers resigned.
Some 80 percent of poll participants who answered this question expect May to succeed, although some said this would be a Brexit in name only, and the risk of a leadership battle had grown.
""It is starting to look like there is no form of Brexit that will command overwhelming parliamentary support,"" Greetham said. 
Investors have cut their UK equity holdings to 9.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in June 2016, the month Britain voted to leave the EU. UK gilts are down to 7.6 percent from 12.6 percent over the same period, reflecting investor concerns.
Justin Onuekwusi, a fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management, warned that a reversion to the frictions of WTO trade regulations would almost certainly result in a recession, and the pound could collapse in such a scenario.
""Whilst we think the possibility of a hard Brexit remains low, the market implications could be severe,"" he said.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Panasonic expects Tesla battery biz to contribute to profit as early as October,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp on Tuesday said it expects its battery business with U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to contribute to profit from the second half of its business year, as production of mass-market Model 3 cars picks up pace.
The Japanese firm is the exclusive battery cell supplier for new vehicles made by Tesla, which in June reached a long-elusive target of making 5,000 Model 3 cars per week, albeit amid concern about whether it could sustain that level of production.
""Production at Tesla is gaining momentum,"" Panasonic Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda said at a briefing. ""We are ramping up a new (battery production) line now and expect the business to contribute not just to our revenue but also to our profit from the second half (starting in October).""
Panasonic's energy business - most of which is batteries of various kinds - posted an operating loss for April-June which widened about five times to 8.4 billion yen ($75.34 million), mostly due to costs of raising production at the so-called Gigafactory it runs with Tesla.
Due to strong demand for factory automation equipment, however, Panasonic's first-quarter operating profit rose 19 percent from a year prior to 99.96 billion yen - roughly in line with the average of seven analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
SHARE DECLINE
Panasonic's share price has been on a downward trend this year as investors worry the firm's $1.6 billion Gigafactory bet has made it reliant on Tesla.
Last week, the U.S. electric vehicle maker said it had asked a small number of suppliers to cut prices on ongoing, long-term projects to improve its future cash flow. Umeda on Tuesday said Panasonic did not receive any such request.
""For the past two years, Panasonic has spent on capex and R&D without being able to record revenues against those costs,"" analysts at Jefferies said in a recent client report.
""By the end of this financial year, as Model 3 production run-rate becomes stable and sustainable, it (Panasonic) should be able to record profits in its Tesla battery business.""
Panasonic maintained its profit forecast for the year through March at 425 billion yen, 2 percent below the average of 21 analyst estimates.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 06:55AM ET</span>","World shares under tech cloud, no lift from Japan's dovish policy pledge","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Reassurance by the Bank of Japan that it will keep its super-easy monetary policies in place for an extended period pushed the yen and global bond yields lower on Tuesday, though mounting concerns about the tech sector kept world stocks under pressure.
A recent Reuters report that the BOJ could be debating scaling back its massive stimulus program had sent Japanese bond yields to 1-1/2 year highs, spilling into euro zone and U.S. debt markets. That helped push the yen more than 2 percent off six-month lows hit against the dollar in early July.
But while the BOJ announced some tweaks to its equity purchase program and said its stimulus plan would be more flexible, the changes did not show any inclination for radical shifts from its accommodative stance. 
In response, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds  ""The BOJ is important in the sense of what they didn't do,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh. ""It was disappointing for some investors who thought they would be more hawkish in their approach and the market reaction, with lower yen and bond yields, shows that view which many people held, is mistaken."" Euro zone yields later inched up to trade around flat after data showed inflation above forecast, though this was driven by higher energy costs. Separate data revealed the bloc's economic growth had been slower than expected in the second quarter of 2018.  The yen fell 0.4 percent to trade around 111.2 yen per dollar. Many analysts now see it easing to around 113, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve delivers a hawkish interest rate message when its policy meeting ends on Wednesday. (For a graphic on 'Yen, bond yields fall after dovish BOJ pledge' click https://reut.rs/2KethlI) The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies but looks likely to snap a three-month streak of gains as markets have more or less priced in two more Fed rate hikes this year. The greenback had rallied more than 5 percent in the second 2018 quarter.  The BOJ's dovish pledge failed to offer a boost to equities, however. Markets have been roiled by growing concerns about the global tech sector which had seemed relatively immune to trade tensions between the United States, Europe and China.  Lackluster earnings from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have triggered losses across the tech sector, with Wall Street's tech index shedding 6 percent in the past three sessions.  (For a graphic on 'FAANGs losing bite?' click https://reut.rs/2KeglfE) That pushed world stocks to one-week lows and even Japan's Nikkei failed to hold on to earlier BOJ-fuelled gains. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific tech shares fell almost one percent. European tech followed suit, losing 0.6 percent and lagging broader equities that were flat on the day. Wall Street was set for a modestly firmer open, futures signaled as investors await second quarter earnings from the biggest company, iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  But the tech retreat has overshadowed an otherwise buoyant U.S. earnings season, with average 22.6 percent profit growth and 83 percent of companies beating consensus estimates so far.  Milligan attributed the setback to a re-assessment of share prices and summer profit-taking rather than a fundamental loss of confidence in the sector. World stocks are still set to end July with the best monthly returns since January, he noted.  World stocks set for best month since Jan https://reut.rs/2K7PvFV ""The market is saying 'you are fairly valued around these prices so let's wait for the next big story'. That will either be on the downside with trade tensions in autumn or it could positive if Chinese stimulus turns out to be greater than expected,"" Milligan added. He was referring to Beijing's announcements, offering more fiscal stimulus to counter the effect of U.S. trade tariffs and incentives for banks to lend to small business. Markets now await Wednesday's Fed policy statement to see if the expected two rate hikes for the remainder of 2018 can be cemented in.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam personally traveled to Saudi Arabia to apply for a banking license, he said on Tuesday, confirming Reuters information the Swiss bank is seeking a full banking license in the Middle East's biggest economy.
""I have been to Riyadh, I met the head of SAMA (the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority), I made the application myself,"" Thiam said in response to a query during the bank's second-quarter news conference.
An increasing number of western banks and fund managers are looking to expand in the kingdom since the government unveiled a transformation plan aimed at privatizing vast swathes of the economy.
 Citigroup  (N:C) got a Saudi investment banking license in April, which will allow it to return to the kingdom after more than 13 years, while Goldman Sachs (N:GS) received approval last August to trade equities in Saudi Arabia.
Credit Suisse has been growing its team in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the past year or so, with bankers added within wealth management, private banking and investment banking, according to LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
However, Qatar Investment Authority owns a 4.94 percent stake in Credit Suisse and bankers had said in the past that the Swiss bank's close ties with Doha could pose a risk for winning more Saudi business. 
The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a boycott on Qatar in June 2017, severing diplomatic and transport ties and accusing it of supporting terrorism, which it denies.
Thiam on Tuesday denied facing any issues in the kingdom related to the these ties.

""I can most categorically deny"" that there have been delays or issues in the application process, he said. ""There is no issue for Credit Suisse in Saudi Arabia.""

136,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 06:19AM ET</span>",Samsung Electronics profit growth slows as Galaxy S9 misses sales targets,"By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) posted its slowest quarterly profit growth in more than a year on Tuesday as its Galaxy S9 device missed sales targets and competition heated up, casting doubt on its leadership of the smartphone market.
The Apple Inc (O:AAPL) components supplier and smartphone rival said operating profit from the mobile business recorded its steepest rate of decline since the first quarter of 2017, as cheaper Chinese-made handsets put pressure on margins.
The South Korean tech giant gave investors little reason to hope for a quick turnaround in the mobile business, flagging stiffer competition in the second half amid concerns its premium phones lack innovation to drive sales growth.
""Samsung was already lost to China in price competition and is getting threatened by Chinese models in designs and hardware strength,"" said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management that owns Samsung shares.
""It is not an easy game for Samsung unless it really meets consumers needs for new smartphones.""
Higher marketing expenses and the disappointing performance of the flagship S9 smartphone, which fell short of its sales target, weighed on its mobile performance, Samsung said.
Samsung is pinning its hopes on foldable phones to become the next big thing. Its screen manufacturing unit said last week its unbreakable, bendable screen had passed U.S. safety testing, a key step towards bringing foldable phones to market.
""We are hoping that such adoption will serve as a catalyst in the stagnated mobile market,"" KyeongTae Lee, vice president of Samsung's mobile business, told analysts.
In the near-term, Samsung said competition would intensify in the second half as new smartphone models were released, prompting it to introduce a new Galaxy Note earlier than usual. Samsung is scheduled to launch a new Note early next month.
The mobile business booked a 34 percent fall in operating profit to 2.7 trillion won ($2.4 billion) in the second quarter, its biggest decline since the Galaxy S7 was Samsung's flagship model early last year.
It remains to be seen whether Samsung's difficulties in the mobile business, which accounts for about 40 percent of its revenue, are the result of its own failings or reflect the industry slowdown more broadly.
Apple is expected to report a rise in revenue and profit for the third quarter on Tuesday, helped by resilient sales of its iPhones.
China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], the world's third-largest smartphone maker, earlier on Tuesday posted the slowest growth in its first-half sales since 2013.
CHIPS ARE UP
The world's biggest chip and smartphone maker said operating profit rose 5.7 percent to 14.9 trillion won ($13.3 billion) in the second quarter, slightly ahead of its 14.8 trillion won estimate.
Revenue for the April-June period fell 4 percent to 58.5 trillion won.
Samsung shares slid 0.3 percent by 0620 GMT, compared with the flat broader market (KS11). 
While the mobile business struggles, the chip business remained Samsung's top earner in the second quarter as sales to the cloud-computing and crypto-currency industries propped up DRAM chip prices even as NAND flash memory prices slipped.
The chip unit posted a record 11.6 trillion won operating profit in the second quarter, up 45 percent from a year ago and nearly 80 percent of its total operating income. 
Samsung said demand for DRAM chips, its main memory product, would stay strong in the second half thanks to the growth of server data centers used for cloud computing.

That view echoed South Korean rival SK Hynix Inc's (KS:000660) forecast last week of solid DRAM chip sales for the rest of the year, comments likely to ease investor concerns that an unprecedented two-year boom in the chip business is about to come to a rapid end.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 06:08AM ET</span>",UK watchdog takes no action against RBS over small business unit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog said it will take no enforcement action against Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) over alleged mistreatment of its small business customers in the wake of the financial crisis.
Some firms have said they were pushed into bankruptcy and that RBS's Global Restructuring Group (GRG) unit stripped their assets between 2008 and 2013.
RBS has rejected the most serious allegations against the unit, but it has accepted some wrongdoing.
Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said on Tuesday that GRG was largely unregulated and the watchdog's powers to take action in such circumstances were very limited.
""Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success,"" Bailey said in a statement.
Firms and lawmakers have criticized the FCA for not concluding its investigation into the GRG sooner.
The watchdog consulted with independent, external leading counsel, who confirmed that the FCA's conclusions were correct and reasonable, Bailey said.
RBS Chairman Howard Davies said the bank's board welcomed the FCA's decision, and continues to focus on ensuring past mistakes cannot be repeated. 
""We ... will reflect carefully on its [the FCA's] findings to learn any further lessons from what was a hugely challenging time for the bank, its customers and the wider economy,"" he said in a statement. 
Lawmakers defied the FCA in February and published in full the watchdog's confidential report detailing mistreatment by the GRG during and after the financial crisis.
""I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion,"" Bailey said.
""The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behavior of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.""
The FCA said it does have powers to ban individuals if it deemed they were not behaving in a ""fit and proper"" way, but it does not believe that a prohibition case would have reasonable prospects of success in this case.
RBS set aside 400 million pounds ($525 million) to compensate thousands of small businesses that said they were mistreated by the GRG.
The bank said this month however that the scheme would close to new complaints after paying out just 10 million pounds so far for direct losses.
RBS shares were trading about 1 percent higher at 0951 GMT.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Britain's car industry cautions: No-deal Brexit is our nightmare,"By Andy Bruce and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - A no-deal Brexit would seriously damage the car industry in Britain and the European Union by raising costs and sowing chaos for carmakers and consumers alike, the head of Britain's car industry warned on Tuesday.
With less than eight months until Britain is due to exit the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to find a proposal to maintain economic ties with the bloc that pleases both sides of her divided party and is acceptable to negotiators in Brussels.
May has stepped up precautionary planning for a so-called ""no-deal"" Brexit that would see the world's fifth largest economy crash out of the EU on March 29, 2019, a step that could spook financial markets and dislocate trade flows across Europe and beyond.
Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said carmakers were increasingly concerned about the lack of clarity around the manner of Britain's departure from the EU.
That has raised the prospect of Britain leaving with no deal and falling back on World Trade Organization rules that could leave British car exporters facing EU import tariffs of around 10 percent.
""No deal... is just not an option. It would be seriously damaging to the industry not just in the UK but in Europe as well,"" Hawes told reporters as he presented SMMT's mid-year update on British car production.
At stake is the future of one of Britain's few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s - a car industry employing over 850,000 people and generating annual turnover of $110 billion. Much of the industry is owned by foreign companies.
The world's biggest carmakers including Toyota (T:7203), BMW (DE:BMWG) and Ford (N:F) have urged Britain to ensure that they can import and export without hindrance after Brexit.
Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain's $2.9 trillion economy, but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU, which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration.
""NO DEAL""?
Under the current timetable, both London and Brussels hope to get a final Brexit deal in October to give enough time to ratify it by exit day.
However, the potential for major political upheaval remains, with May's minority government facing a series of make-or-break moments in the Brexit process over coming months.
She must find a way to strike a deal with the EU, which has already rejected her preferred plan on trade, then sell that deal to her deeply fractured Conservative Party, before putting it to a vote in parliament. 
Failure at any of those three hurdles could cost her job and thrust the United Kingdom into crisis. 
In an attempt to rally support for May's proposals, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt visits Paris and Vienna this week.
""I will be explaining to my counterparts in Paris and Vienna that it is time for the EU to engage with our proposals, or we potentially face the prospect of a no-deal by accident, which would be very challenging for both the UK and EU,"" Hunt said.
Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn could come under pressure at its annual party conference in September to agree to support a referendum on any deal that May can secure, the Guardian newspaper reported.
There is deep concern in boardrooms about the prospect of Britain leaving the bloc without a deal, or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade.
That could be highly damaging for a car industry which is dependent on the speedy movement of huge numbers of parts across borders. The average car, for example, has about 30,000 parts.
Confidence among British consumers and businesses remains stuck well below levels before Britons voted in 2016 by a narrow majority for Brexit, surveys showed on Tuesday, two days before an expected interest rate increase by the Bank of England.
The Financial Times reported that the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had softened his opposition to May's Brexit plan for financial services after the UK acknowledged Brussels would have ultimate control over the City of London's access to EU markets.

British car output in the first six months of 2018 fell by an annual 3.3 percent to 834,402, with disappointing domestic demand cancelling out strong exports, SMMT said.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Asia-focused lender  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) said it was confident of delivering better returns in the medium term as restructuring measures pay off, while its limited exposure to the U.S.-China trade dispute will also cushion the bottom line.
Despite higher profits and lower bad loans, StanChart shares fell 3.5 percent in London as shareholders focused on the bank's higher expenses from investments aimed at improving performance.
StanChart CEO Bill Winters played down the impact of tensions between China and the United States. The world's two largest economies have already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's imports.
""Our direct exposure to increasing tariffs between the U.S. and China is minimal, less than 1 percent of income,"" StanChart CEO Bill Winters said on a conference call with reporters.
""It's not a disastrous thing for Standard Chartered ... but if the trade war escalates it could be more disruptive for the global economy and our clients,"" he added.
Some of StanChart's customers have slowed cross-border investment decisions because of the escalating trade tensions, Winters said, adding that would continue until there is clarity on the breadth and size of tariffs between the two countries. 
Pretax profit for StanChart rose to $2.35 billion in the first half of the year, from $1.75 billion in the same period last year, the lender said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.
COST CONTROL
The bank's costs grew 7 percent in the first half versus a year ago, as it invested in digital initiatives to improve businesses including wealth management and retail banking, indicating the path to achieving its return on equity (ROE) target would be tough.
The bank said its ROE, a key measure of profitability, was 6.7 percent in the first half, against a medium-term target of 8 percent that analysts have described as 'modest' when global peers are making 10 percent or more.
""In the context of such subdued return expectations,
we struggle to see overly material near-term upside for the shares,"" said Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec Bank in London.
Much of the bank's increased costs have come from its efforts to improve financial crime prevention after it suffered a series of penalties and regulatory investigations between 2012 and 2014 following lapses in anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance controls.
The bank last week has named Tracey McDermott as group head of compliance after the previous holder of the left the bank in June following an investigation into his behavior.

StanChart has increased spending on financial crime compliance ten times since 2012, Winters said, as it deals with the fallout from past misconduct that landed it with a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. authorities that was extended earlier this month.

Earnings were the big focus following results from big hitters BP (L:BP),  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN).
Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) rose 1.3 percent after the Swiss lender doubled its second-quarter profit but rival Standard Chartered (L:STAN) fell 3.2 percent after its half-year update.
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) led travel and leisure (SXTP) stocks higher. Shares in the German airline jumped 6 percent after its second-quarter operating income beat estimates. 
Shares in French media conglomerate  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) gained 5.2 percent after it reported results and said it was considering selling up to half of its UMG music division.
Barclay's European equity strategists said that so far European second quarter results are ""reassuring"" and that they expect European equities to fare better into the year-end.
""Europe still lacks self-help, it remains hostage to messy politics and is thus overly dependent on the fate of the global cycle. The region is unlikely to decouple, but it is making slow progress on structural reforms,"" strategists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note.
""We believe the positives outweigh the negatives and are overweight equities for now. But risks are mainly tilted to the downside, which warrants a balanced risk allocation within our portfolio,"" Barclays strategists added. They prefer UK equities to the euro zone. 
So far this earnings season, half of MSCI EMU companies have beaten analysts' expectations, with reported actual year-on-year earnings growth clocking in at 8.6 percent, according to I/B/E/S data.
BP's shares gained 0.7 percent after the oil major's second-quarter profit beat expectations on the back of higher oil prices and increased output.
Along with BP,  Lundin Petroleum  (ST:LUPE) helped boost Europe's energy index (SXEP). The Swedish independent oil firm rose around 7 percent after its second-quarter core profit beat expectations and its costs fell.
A number of smaller UK companies saw some big share price moves after their results. Shares in  Travis Perkins  (L:TPK) tumbled more than 10 percent and was one of the worst STOXX 600 performers after the building materials supplier cuts its profit outlook on the back of a weak DIY market.

The Bank of Japan hadn’t taken so long to announce a policy decision since the introduction of yield-curve control in September 2016. And finally, at 1:03 p.m. in Tokyo Tuesday, the central bank left its key interest rates unchanged while announcing policy tweaks, including a shift in purchases of exchange-traded funds toward assets linked to the Topix index and flexibility in bond operations.
For equity strategists, all eyes were on the announced ETF program shift after speculation swirled that the central bank, dubbed the Tokyo whale, was considering changing how it buys shares through the ETF fund program. For investors focused on JGBs, the central bank’s decision to only allow the a wider trading range sent the benchmark bond yield lower.
Bank stocks were the biggest casualties, dragging the benchmark Topix index to a one-week low on speculation the shift will stoke wider volatility in bond yields, while the Nikkei 225 Stock Average was basically flat. Japan’s 10-year bond yield dropped 3.5 basis points to 0.06 percent, while the yen fell 0.2 percent to 111.22 against the dollar.
Here’s what strategists and investors said:
Impact Limited
“As long as the BOJ maintains its annual pace of the ETF buying unchanged, the overall impact on the stock market is limited,” said Naoki Fujiwara, chief fund manager for Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“The stock market will likely shift its focus to corporate earnings after the BOJ event is over. Japanese stocks will likely rebound gradually with solid earnings.”
Inflated Expectations
“Expectations for a various different things went a bit too far,” said Tetsuo Seshimo, a portfolio manager at Saison Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“People had strong expectations the BOJ would do something about interest rates but now banks are being sold.”
Stronger Yen
“My key takeaway from this is stronger yen,” Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney said.
“Lower confidence in inflation and the downgrade in inflation forecast point to higher real yields and upward pressure on the yen unless easy monetary policy finds a way to be transmitted to the real economy.""
Slightly Dovish
“Most people would think of this as largely in line with market expectations but to some it could’ve been slightly dovish than what they anticipated,” said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“Some people thought the BOJ may lift its long-term yield target because there’d been such media reports. It feels like for 70 to 80 percent of the people, the results are in line with expectations where as maybe 20 to 30 percent are taking this as somewhat dovish.”
Keeps Easing
“By introducing forward guidance in its statement, the BOJ wants to show that it will persistently continue easing and won’t raise the level of yields rapidly or sharply,” said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities Co.
That it didn’t address concerns about the side effects of its policy indicates the “decision today is merely technical to make the current easing scheme sustainable for a long time as price outlook was lowered.”
Not Winding Back?
“Having lowered the price outlook, the BOJ is in no position to wind back the YCC scheme,” said Akio Kato, general manager of trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“While the bond buying plan is unchanged, the BOJ is likely to keep cutting purchase amounts as necessary.”

The London-based company is pursuing growth again after spending much of the past eight years shaking off the impact of the fatal Gulf of Mexico oil spill and a deep industry downturn. Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley is seeking to prove all that hard work won’t be undone and his $10.5 billion acquisition of U.S. shale assets is good value.
To woo shareholders, BP raised its dividend payout last week for the first time since 2014, while also pledging to hold annual spending steady, continue stock repurchases and keep debt at manageable levels. That effort was reinforced on Tuesday by the company’s fourfold increase in second-quarter profit, which beat analysts’ estimates. Rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). fell shy of expectations.
“We continue to make steady progress against our strategy and plans, delivering another quarter of strong operational and financial performance,” Dudley said in a statement. “Given this momentum and the strength of our financial frame, we are increasing our dividend for the first time in almost four years.”
BP’s profit adjusted for one-time items and inventories was $2.82 billion in the second quarter, higher than analysts’ estimate of $2.66 billion. Cash flow from operations, excluding payments related to the Gulf of Mexico spill and including a working capital release, was $7 billion compared with $6.9 billion a year earlier. Gearing, the ratio of net debt to capital, dropped to 27.8 percent from 28.8 percent a year ago.
Annual capital expenditure will be about $15 billion this year, despite the deal to buy the shale assets from BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd., BP said. Gearing will not rise above 30 percent and it will buy back shares issued to fund the shale deal “over time” by selling as much as $6 billion of assets.

Brent crude averaged more than $70 a barrel in the second quarter for the first time in more than three years. Though prices are still some way off the heady days of $100, investors expect the oil companies to generate large profits while maintaining their discipline on costs and spending.
The industry failed to entirely meet those expectations last week. Shell’s profit rose and it started a much-awaited share buyback, but earnings missed estimates. Exxon Mobil and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) trod similar paths. Only  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) seemed to give everyone what they wanted."

Country Garden said on Friday it had halted all projects in China for security inspections following an accident at its construction site in the eastern province of Anhui that killed six people.
Chief financial officer Bijun Wu said on the call held late on Monday that she expected the remaining 10 percent of projects would resume construction within days and the stoppage had no impact on the company's full-year new-start and completion targets for its projects, the analysts told Reuters.
News of the accident and construction halt had sent the company's shares down 7.4 percent on Monday. The stock fell a further 2 percent by midday on Tuesday.
Country Garden confirmed to Reuters the Monday investor call and the unchanged targets.
The developer has already had two other safety incidents over the past two months, Chinese media reports say. The Anhui accident raises questions about quality control as developers chase fast cash collection and amid a common industry practice of outsourcing construction work to other companies.
According to the analysts, CFO Wu told investors on Monday that construction work of around 20 percent of the company's 2,100 projects was not led by the company, as many were co-invested with other developers.
She also said the company, which has expanded quickly in smaller cities in the past few years, would be more selective in choosing cities going forward, they said. The analysts declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media about the call.
Country Garden told Reuters it will only expand in small cities where there is enough demand. Regarding construction suppliers, it said it chooses companies according to their industry ranking and reputation, and would suspend co-operation if any issues crop up during inspection.
Brokerage CLSA said in a research report on Monday before the call it expected Country Garden's sales growth might slow in the second half compared to the previous six months, as the company rethinks its strategy in third-tier cities where margins are compressed.

The lawsuit, filed by four congressmen for the left-wing Workers Party against the federal government and Embraer, seeks an injunction to freeze talks between the two planemakers, the Brazilian company said. 
While Embraer is a private company, the government holds a special stock that grants it veto power over major business decisions.
The lawsuit is just the latest headache for a deal that has drawn fire from critics worried about its impact on Brazilian jobs and those concerned about Embraer's financial viability without the lucrative commercial jet unit.
The proposed deal with Boeing would not include Embraer's defense and executive jets business, where the Brazilian government would maintain veto power. 
A Brazilian labor judge this month rejected a call to make the proposed acquisition dependent on a pledge to preserve all local jobs at the company.
That injunction request was filed by Brazil's labor prosecutors, a special group that investigates potential violations of the country's strict labor laws. They responded to the judge's rejection by announcing plans for a civil lawsuit against the government.

Embraer executives said earlier this month they do not expect to finalize the deal until late next year, forcing Embraer to compete single-handedly against the European and Canadian rivals.

While the price drop is trimming the profit margins of manufacturers, it is welcome news for purchasers of solar systems, who had been facing higher prices since the tariffs went into effect in February.
""If you are building a large power plant your pricing has certainly come back at least halfway to what it was pre-tariff if not all the way,"" Tom Werner, the CEO of SunPower Corp (O:SPWR), said in an interview following the company's second-quarter financial results announcement. ""It's muting the impact of tariffs.""
Solar module prices are down about 12 percent globally since China announced changes to its incentives for solar power on June 1 that have led to an oversupply of panels that had been intended for installation in China, the world's largest solar market.
SunPower is both a manufacturer of solar panels and an installer of solar power systems. The San Jose, California-based company makes its products primarily in the Philippines and Mexico and is seeking an exclusion from the U.S. tariffs.
SunPower makes high-efficiency, premium-priced panels, and Werner told analysts on a conference call that the company was ""responding"" to the price declines and would not allow its premium to expand.
The company is in the process of buying rival SolarWorld Americas, expanding its domestic manufacturing in Oregon to stem the impact of the tariffs. 
The price decline ""makes domestic manufacturing that much more challenging,"" Werner said, adding that SunPower was committed to closing its deal to acquire SolarWorld.
""We're going to have to increase scale to compete,"" he said.
SunPower expects to spend $51 million on tariffs in the second half of this year, an amount the company would prefer to invest in its next-generation technology and scaling up its U.S. manufacturing, Werner said on a conference call with analysts.
SunPower reported a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss and revenue that topped estimates due to strength in its rooftop solar business and cost controls. The company also said it would begin manufacturing its next-generation technology later this year.

SunPower's stock was up 4.8 percent at $7.22 in after-hours trade.

At least two customers wrote on food safety website iwaspoisoned.com that they suffered nausea and diarrhea after eating at the Powell, Ohio restaurant, but added that they had not visited a doctor.
""We acted quickly and closed this single restaurant out of an abundance of caution and we are working with the local health officials to reopen this restaurant as soon as possible,"" a Chipotle spokeswoman said via email.
Addressing food safety concerns is among the top priorities for Chipotle Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol, who took the helm in March.
A series of high-profile food safety lapses in 2015 has bruised Chipotle's reputation and stock price.
Last July, Chipotle retrained kitchen crews on food safety after identifying a sick employee as the cause of a Norovirus outbreak that forced it to briefly close a restaurant in Virginia.

Chipotle's stock fell 3.3 percent in after-hours trading on Monday after Business Insider first reported the news.

The maker of yellow bulldozers and backhoes said when it reported second-quarter earnings Monday that recently imposed tariffs “are expected to impact material costs in the second half of the year by approximately $100 million to $200 million.” The Deerfield, Illinois-based manufacturer plans to raise prices to help offset the hit.
“We have the mid-year price increase announced and our teams will continue to look at all these variables moving forward,” Interim Chief Financial Officer Joe Creed said in a telephone interview. “We feel like that’s what the market will bear, but we’re always assessing it and looking at it.”
Surging demand and a 25 percent American tariff on steel imports have combined to send the benchmark steel price in the U.S. surging about 40 percent this year.
“The biggest piece of that cost inflation is likely steel, and we all know what happened there with the very first salvo of tariffs involving steel,” Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co., said by telephone. “In the past, what we’ve seen is that CAT is capable of passing costs through to its customer base, so it’s not surprising to us that CAT is able to do it again. It has already likely provided that information to its customers that they’re coming.”
Caterpillar boosted its 2018 earnings outlook Monday as it benefits from rising sales and a years-long effort to increase efficiency, even as it said it expects supply-chain “challenges” to continue to pressure freight costs.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 06:42PM ET</span>",CBS CEO Moonves survives board meeting amid misconduct probe,"By Carl O'Donnell and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - CBS Corp's (N:CBS) board left Chief Executive Leslie Moonves in his post on Monday as it discussed sexual harassment claims against him and took steps to select an outside counsel to lead an independent investigation into the matter, the company said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear if Moonves would stay on for the duration of the investigation. 
Moonves, 68, is one of the global media industry's highest-paid executives and could receive a severance package of more than $180 million based on his contract and the terms of his departure, according to CBS filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The media and TV company on Friday disclosed plans for a probe after the New Yorker magazine published an article https:// detailing claims by six women who said Moonves sexually harassed them in incidents between 1985 and 2006. 
Moonves, who joined CBS in 1995 and has been CEO since 2006, has said that he ""may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances"", which he called mistakes that he regretted immensely, but that he understood ""'no' means 'no'"" and had never used his position to harm anyone's career.
Moonves is the latest executive to come under scrutiny by the #MeToo social movement, which has sought to hold accountable male business leaders, politicians and entertainers for sexual misconduct, leading to resignations in major corporations, Hollywood and among lawmakers.
CBS's lack of immediate action against Moonves was a ""slap in the face to the brave women who came forward,"" said Melissa Silverstein, founder of the blog Women and Hollywood, in a Twitter post, as social media reacted quickly to CBS's announcement. 
Corporate governance experts said there could be several reasons why CBS's board may not want to fire Moonves, including its fiduciary duty to shareholders to minimize the company's legal liabilities.
""If you (CBS) were to take action today and you are wrong, you open yourself up to potential liability,"" said Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.
Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Widener University Delaware Law School in Wilmington Delaware, said that the board would want to place Moonves on administrative leave if it believed there was a risk he could act inappropriately while remaining in his position.
Following the publication of the New Yorker story, some senior female CBS executives have expressed support for Moonves, including Jo Ann Ross, the company's president and chief advertising revenue officer, and Angelica McDaniel, an executive vice president of daytime programming. Moonves' wife, Julie Chen, a CBS presenter, has also publicly supported him. 
MERGER WITH VIACOM
Moonves is locked in a battle over control of CBS with the company's largest shareholder, National Amusements Inc, which is owned by Shari Redstone and her father Sumner Redstone. Shari Redstone has proposed merging CBS with media company Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), also owned by National Amusements, a plan that Moonves has opposed.
CBS shares have lost more than 10 percent of their value since Friday, when the sexual harassment claims against Moonves emerged. Viacom shares, conversely, have risen 3 percent during that time on investor expectations that the chances of a merger with CBS have increased.
CBS said on Monday it would postpone its 2018 annual shareholder meeting that was previously scheduled for Aug. 10 to an unspecified date. National Amusements could exercise its voting power in such a meeting to oust directors it sees as loyal to Moonves, analysts have said. Shari Redstone has a seat on CBS's 14-member board, alongside her personal lawyer Robert Klieger and National Amusements Director David Andelman. 

Redstone is challenging a plan by CBS to issue a special dividend aimed at cutting National Amusements' voting power in the company to 17 percent from 80 percent. The trial in a Delaware court is expected to start in October.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",U.S. seeks to end criminal fraud case against bond trader Litvak,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Monday moved to dismiss their criminal fraud case accusing former trader Jesse Litvak of lying to customers about bond prices, after two convictions of the former Jefferies managing director were overturned on appeal.
In a motion filed with the federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, U.S. Attorney John Durham said, ""the interests of justice would not be served by a third trial"" of Litvak, given the ""totality of the circumstances unique to this case.""
Both convictions resulted in two-year prison terms for Litvak, 43, a married father of two. He had been serving his sentence when the federal appeals court in Manhattan voided his second conviction on May 3 and ordered him freed.
Kannon Shanmugam, a lawyer who handled Litvak's appeals, declined to comment.
The dismissal request is a defeat for the government, which has failed to sustain any convictions in its 5-1/2-year crackdown on suspicious sales tactics on Wall Street, which began in January 2013 when Litvak was charged.
Prosecutors accused Litvak of lying to customers including AllianceBernstein, Invesco and Soros Fund Management, causing them to overpay for bonds they bought and accept lower prices for bonds they sold.
They said Litvak did this to generate $2.25 million of extra profit for Jefferies, now part of Jefferies Financial Group Inc (N:JEF), and to boost his own pay.
Defense lawyers argued that Litvak's customers were sophisticated and would have known if he lied.
The defendant was found guilty in March 2014 on 10 securities fraud counts and other charges, but the appeals court overturned that verdict in December 2015, saying the trial judge wrongly excluded expert testimony for the defense.
Litvak was convicted on a single fraud count at a January 2017 retrial. The appeals court found that verdict tainted by the admission of irrelevant evidence.
At least five people have been tried in the government's probe.
Two were acquitted, Litvak and former Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) trader Michael Gramins had their convictions set aside, and former Nomura trader Ross Shapiro was acquitted on all but one count, where jurors deadlocked.
The cases against Gramins and Shapiro remain pending.
Jefferies in 2014 agreed to pay $25 million to resolve U.S. criminal and civil probes into how it supervised Litvak and other traders. 

The case is U.S. v. Litvak, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, No. 13-cr-00019.

171,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Apple Is Next in the Tech Earnings Parade
Tech stocks were in control of the market’s bearish action Monday and that weak sentiment could persist into Tuesday’s open with no major names reporting before the bell.
Wall Street will get results of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), among others.
But tech investors may want to keep their powder dry until Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the last of the FAANG stocks still to report, issues earnings after the bell.
Apple’s profit per share is expected to rise about 30% from the year-ago period, with sales remaining about the same. The key to quarterly performance will likely be the company’s ability to boost services sales in the face of a slump in iPhone sales.
Apple shares were the most resilient of the FAANGs on Monday, falling less than 1%.
2. Bank of Japan Meeting Could Move Markets (Really)
There are a host of central bank meetings this week and the Bank of Japan could significantly impact the currency markets when it wraps up its meeting Tuesday. The focus will be on whether the BOJ tweaks its massive asset-buying campaign.
""(T)here is increasing speculation the BOJ may tweak its yield curve control settings in part because of lower bank profitability and muted inflation in Japan,"" Elias Haddad, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note. 
The BOJ could also modify its annual objective of accumulating 80 trillion yen ($720 billion) of Japanese government bonds, as well as potentially lifting its target yield for Japan 10-Year JGBs.
But it wouldn’t be a surprise “to see the central bank stand pat for now, especially with policymakers likely having to revise down their inflation and GDP forecasts to account for the recent soft patch in economic data,” Matthew Weller of Faraday Research wrote.
3. Fed Gets Its Favorite Inflation Numbers
The Federal Open Market Committee starts its two-day interest rate policy meeting Tuesday. The market expects the Fed to keep rates unchanged, but will be looking for any hints about the pace of future hikes.
The Fed will have more data to work with tomorrow when its preferred inflation gauge -- the personal consumption expenditures prices excluding food and energy (core PCE) -- for June arrives.
On average, economists expect that core PCE index rose 2% year-on-year, the same as in May, and was up 0.1% month-on-month, compared with a 0.2% rise in May.
Personal income and spending are both expected to post a 0.4% rise for June."

176,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 04:07PM ET</span>","U.S. debt sales set to surge, hit short-term maturities most","By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Karen Brettell
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Monday said it expects to borrow $56 billion more during the third quarter than previously estimated, and market participants expect shorter-dated Treasuries to absorb the brunt of the new supply as the Trump administration grapples with a mushrooming budget deficit.
The federal government is ramping up bond issuance to cover a budget hole fueled by big spending increases and falling corporate tax receipts. It also has to fill gaps left as the Federal Reserve cuts its massive bond portfolio.
The Treasury Department said in a statement that it expects to issue $329 billion through credit markets during the July-September period, assuming an end-September balance of $350 billion. It also forecast $440 billion of borrowing in the final three months of the year.
The borrowing estimate for the third quarter is the highest since the same period in 2010 and fourth largest on record for the July-September quarter, according to a senior Treasury official. In the second quarter, net borrowing totaled $72 billion.
Social security costs, military spending and debt service expenses are all on the rise at the same time as corporate tax income is declining after last year's tax reforms. As a result, the U.S. fiscal picture is darkening, with the federal budget deficit expected to reach $833 billion this year, up from $666 billion in the budget year ended last September, according to the Treasury's June budget report.
“Because of surprising declines in corporate tax revenues, the federal deficit is constantly under discussion this month,” said Jim Vogel, an interest rate strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.
The Fed is also trimming the vast holdings of Treasury debt that it accumulated to help foster the recovery from the 2007-2009 recession, adding to the supply of bonds hitting the market.
SUPPLY BULGE AT FRONT OF CURVE
The Treasury on Wednesday will detail how it expects to spread the new supply across bond maturities ranging from one month to 30 years.
Bond market participants expect faster increases in maturities out to five years, which could push their yields up at a quicker pace than those for longer-dated securities, which should see less of a supply increase.
The Treasury is expected to increase sales of two-year (US2YT=RR) and three-year (US3YT=RR) notes by $1 billion a month, similar to its increases in the second quarter. Securities maturing in seven years (US7YT=RR) to 30 years (US30YT=RR) should see increases of $1 billion per quarter.
Some analysts also estimate that five-year note (US5YT=RR) sales could ramp up to $1 billion more per month compared with the same amount for the whole of the second quarter.
Short- and intermediate-dated debt are seen as having strong demand and relatively attractive rates. Focusing on those maturities also eases pressure on long-term rates, where large increases in yields could create an economic drag.
The disparity in supply increases could add to yield curve flattening. The gap between short- and long-dated yields is already at decade lows and being closely watched as a potential sign of an economic downturn.
Still, many investors are bearish on Treasuries across the curve. The latest data from U.S. futures exchanges show that hedge funds and speculators last week accumulated a record short position in five-year, 10-year and 30-year Treasuries futures, and also expanded their short position in two-year notes.

In addition, investors will be watching for any new information on when the Treasury plans to introduce new two-month bills and five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) . Both have been discussed among market participants, but many analysts see these as unlikely to be introduced this quarter.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 04:07PM ET</span>",GE hires bankers to mull sale of digital assets: WSJ,"(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) has hired an investment bank to organize an auction for its digital assets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday citing people familiar with the matter.
GE's multibillion-dollar digital business, which includes its Predix software system and applications, has been struggling with technical issues and weakening sales. 
GE has been seeking partners to invest in GE Digital as it narrowed the target markets for the division and abandoned plans to build a cloud platform, instead partnering with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) clouds. 
Faced with cash constraints and falling profits at its large power business, GE chose to reduce investment in the digital unit and focus on partnerships. 
The Wall Street Journal report did not reveal the exact assets for sale or the potential deal value.GE declined to comment.
Former GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt invested more than $4 billion in GE Digital and placed it at the strategic center of what he called GE's new role as a ""digital industrial company."" 
But technical issues and competition from less costly systems slowed the unit's growth, forcing GE to shift strategy. 
The unit, which became a standalone business in 2015, has not reported profit and loss as other GE units do. It posted revenue of $4 billion last year, a 12 percent increase from 2016, GE said. 
But growth has slowed. Revenue growth was flat in the latest quarter, compared with a year ago, and new orders fell 23 percent, GE said earlier this month. 
GE also has been laying off programmers at the GE Digital's San Ramon, California, headquarters. 
The potential sale of digital assets comes amid a broader GE restructuring. The Boston-based conglomerate said in June that it plans to spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services firm  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE), effectively breaking up the 126-year-old company. 
The slimmed-down company under Chief Executive John Flannery will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy, which GE hopes will reward battered shareholders who have seen the stock lose more than half its value over the past 20 years.

GE shares were up 0.7 percent at $13.14 in afternoon trading on Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.57%. The S&P 500 fell 0.58%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 1.39%.
The fallout from both Facebook's and Twitter's disappointing earnings last week continued to weigh on risk sentiment as investors fled tech stocks.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock closed 2.2% lower, while Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock tumbled more than 8%. Plunges in both Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock exacerbated downside momentum in the broader market.
Mixed second-quarter earnings from some notable corporate heavyweights did little to lift sentiment on equities. Yet the trend of strong second-quarter earnings remained intact, data from FactSet showed.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) stock fell despite delivering above-forecast second-quarter results and raising its full-year outlook. Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) stock closed lower after topping earnings and revenue estimates, while First Data (NYSE:FDC) stock closed higher as quarterly profit beat consensus.
As of Friday, 83% of the companies in the S&P 500 that had reported results posted stronger-than-expected earnings and 73% beat estimates on revenue, according to FactSet.
The decline in tech stocks and mixed earnings offset gains in telecoms and energy as the latter was supported by rising oil prices on investor concerns over global crude supplies.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery gained 2.13% to settle at $70.13 a barrel. Crude prices eased modestly after settlement, however, as U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be prepared to meet with Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani at ""any time,"" without restrictions.
In other the corporate news,  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) came under pressure following a Wall Street Journal report that the company’s foreign exchange department increased currency conversion rates without informing customers.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 02:46PM ET</span>",Caterpillar paints upbeat picture of global economy,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) on Monday gave a promising outlook for the global economy despite ongoing trade tensions and mounting cost concerns, and the heavy equipment maker lifted its full-year earnings forecast after quarterly profits nearly doubled. 
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company now expects adjusted profit per share to be in a range of $11 to $12 in 2018, compared with $10.25 to $11.25 projected earlier.
The second increase to the profit outlook in the past two quarters helped somewhat allay investors' concerns that the industrial cycle and even broader economic activity are approaching their peak.
""There is continuing improvement in many of our end markets,"" Jim Umpleby told analysts on a conference call. ""Our order rates in the backlog remain strong."" 
Caterpillar said it has not yet seen the impact of ongoing trade tensions on its business, but said tariffs are estimated to inflate material costs in the second half of 2018 by up to $200 million. 
Overseas markets account for half of Caterpillar's sales. Caterpillar is better placed than many companies to deal with the tariffs as its manufacturing footprint is spread across the globe.
Yet, the stock has lost about 18 percent since January, buffeted by increasing trade frictions and mounting costs. The stock last month fell to its lowest level since late October before recovering modestly. It was last trading up 0.4 percent at $143.20.
Higher freight prices, which drove up manufacturing costs in the last quarter, are expected to remain elevated. 
The company expects to take higher costs in its stride through price increases it carried out on July 1 and through cost discipline.
Analysts at JP Morgan reiterated their ""Overweight"" rating on the stock, saying potential earnings upside is not fully priced in the company's shares.
STRONG DEMAND, PRICING POWER 
Monday's results showed that a strong global economy, which is having its best run since 2011, is helping manufacturers like Caterpillar book more orders and deliver higher profits despite cost pressures.
For example, the company said demand for oil and gas and mining machines is so strong that it was taking orders for delivery well into 2019. At the end of the second quarter, its order backlog was $17.7 billion, up about $200 million from the first quarter.
It saw positive pricing in all of its principal business segments except construction industries. 
Overall, the company expects product prices to more than offset increased costs in the second half of the year. 
This is in contrast to companies such as  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG), which are battling weak demand and do not enjoy the same pricing power to offset increased input costs.
In resource industries, higher commodity prices and strong global growth have helped improve the finances of mining customers. However, the company said customers have yet to start full-scale fleet replacements. 
In Caterpillar's energy & transportation division, robust oil prices are supporting demand for well-servicing and gas compression applications in North America.
In the Asia-Pacific region, which accounted for nearly a quarter of company revenues, equipment sales were up 39 percent from a year ago, helped by infrastructure investment in China.
Caterpillar reported an adjusted profit of $2.97 a share in the second quarter, compared with $1.49 a share last year. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.73 a share. 

The company repurchased $750 million of shares in the second quarter and announced an up to $10-billion buyback authorization from January 2019.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 02:33PM ET</span>",Factbox: Impact of U.S.-China trade tariffs on U.S. companies,"(Reuters) - U.S. companies are putting in place measures to cushion the impact of escalating trade tensions between the United States and China.
The world's two largest economies have already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's imports.
In his latest threat to the Asian nation, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The following is a list of recent comments made by U.S. companies:
-  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) said U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are expected to increase its material costs by about $100 million to $200 million in the second half of the year. The heavy machinery maker plans to offset most of the higher costs with mid-year price hikes.
-  General Electric  Co (N:GE) estimated that new tariffs on its imports from China could raise its costs by $300 million to $400 million overall, before steps to lessen the impact.
- Detroit automakers General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) lowered their full-year profit forecasts due to escalating tariffs. 
-  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is concerned about the impact of possible trade tariffs on the cost of running its supply chain, but has not yet seen any impact from U.S.-Chinese trade tensions on its business, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said.
- U.S. industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) said it would increase the use of supply chain sources from non-China countries to counter growing costs related to a tariff war between the world's two largest economies.
- Home furnishings chain  At Home Group Inc  (N:HOME) said it would make adjustments to its supply chain to mitigate the impact of the proposed tariffs on goods imported from China.
- Home furnishing retailer  Pier 1 Imports  (N:PIR) says the company does not expect financial results in fiscal 2019 to be materially affected by proposed tariffs. About 59 percent of the company's fiscal 2019 net sales are expected to be derived from merchandise produced in China. 
Of the 59 percent of 2019 sales from Chinese merchandise, about half is expected to have products subject to proposed tariff.
- U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) said it expected incremental costs of about $15 million to $20 million for the remainder of the year from the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by Trump. It also says it will take further hits from retaliatory moves from the European Union.
-  Polaris Industries  Inc (N:PII), which makes Indian motorcycles, raised its 2018 cost estimates related to tariffs to $40 million from $7 million, and said it expected to ramp up motorcycle production in Poland for European market in 2019 to offset higher costs.
- Diversified industrial manufacturer 3M Co (N:MMM) said it expects an impact of about $10 million, or 1 cent per share, on an annualized basis from the tariffs passed so far. The company also said it was prepared to make changes to supply, sourcing and pricing in response to any further tariffs.
- Paper and packaging company International Paper (N:IP) Chief Executive Officer Mark Sutton says the company has so far not had any direct impact from tariff disputes.
- Otis elevator maker United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) said based on tariffs which have been enacted so far it expects to see 5 cent per share impact in 2018. The company expects to see a much bigger impact in 2019. 
- Medical device maker Boston Scientific (N:BSX) said it buys a ""very small portion"" of components from China and that it has the ability to substitute with other suppliers outside of China since it does not manufacture in the country. - Upscale home furnishing chain RH (N:RH) expects to reduce significantly the amount of goods sourced from China in its 2019 fiscal year to mitigate the impact of proposed new tariffs by the United States.
-  Gentex Corp  (O:GNTX), a maker of aircraft windows and rear-view mirrors, said it expected cost increases of between $5 million and $8 million for the second half of 2018 related to its planned purchases of raw materials from China.
- Meat Processor  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) cut its full-year profit forecast, citing the uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs that have hurt domestic and export prices of meat.
- Toymaker  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) said it was moving more production out of China as a result of the tariffs, adding 30 percent of its manufacturing was now done elsewhere. 
- Danaher Corp (N:DHR), which develops technology for the dental, life sciences, diagnostics and environmental industries, said it expected an earnings impact of 1 cent per quarter, and that it would look to modify manufacturing locations.

- U.S. pipeline operator  Plains All American Pipeline  (N:PAA) said the tariffs were tolerable for the company, but it applied for exemptions. However, the company added that if it could not get the exemption or the required quota of steel, ""it would just basically extend and delay growth.""

181,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 01:22PM ET</span>",Ferrari bets on tobacco veteran in post-Marchionne era,"By Agnieszka Flak and Martinne Geller
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Ferrari's (MI:RACE) new boss Louis Camilleri has big shoes to fill but the tobacco industry veteran may have just what is needed to steer the luxury sportscar maker through its next lap, analysts and industry insiders said. 
Camilleri was appointed  Ferrari  (NYSE:RACE) chief executive on July 21, succeeding Sergio Marchionne who fell seriously ill and later died after suffering complications following surgery.
The sudden change jolted investors who had expected Marchionne, who nearly tripled Ferrari's value since taking it public in 2015, to stay on as CEO and chairman until 2021. 
It also left Camilleri, 63, to finish scripting a midterm strategy that is due only in September and is meant to show how the company known for its racing pedigree and roaring combustion engines would shift towards making an SUV and electric cars.
Those who followed Camilleri's career at tobacco group Altria and later at Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) (PMI) said he has proven himself in an industry with a tough legal and regulatory environment. 
Like Marchionne, he's known for growing shareholder value via spin-offs: he hived off Altria's stake in Kraft Foods (NASDAQ:KHC) and later PMI to remove it from the U.S. stub's litigation risks. 
""He understands the consumer, branding and premiumization. He is a strong executor,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) tobacco analyst Bonnie Herzog said.
But at Ferrari he has a tough act to follow. 
Marchionne had orchestrated Ferrari's spin-off from parent  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), positioned it as a luxury icon rather than a car manufacturer and managed to do what few thought possible: sail through a self-imposed cap of 7,000 vehicles per year without sacrificing its pricing power and exclusive appeal.
When its share price hit a record high of 129.90 euros last month, the company that sold just under 8,400 vehicles last year was worth around 24 billion euros ($28 billion), almost as much as Fiat Chrysler, which shipped 4.7 million cars. 
With profit margins of 30 percent, strong pricing power and a healthy customer waiting list of well over a year, Camilleri inherits a business that is firing on all cylinders.
Ferrari has clocked up several years of record earnings, helped by a number of special edition models. 
But maintaining the high valuation will not be easy as emissions rules tighten, capital spending increases and the diverging interests of investors, racing fans, owners and collectors are increasingly more difficult to balance. 
(For a graphic on 'Ferrari share performance since Wall Street debut', click https://reut.rs/2K0n6Sb)
Camilleri will face investors and analysts for the first time on Wednesday, when Ferrari reports second-quarter earnings.
But while Camilleri is not a car man, he is no stranger to Ferrari: as chairman and former CEO of PMI, a longtime Ferrari Formula One sponsor, he has been attending Grand Prix for years. 
Born in Egypt to a Maltese family, Camilleri has sat on the board of the Maranello, Italy-based company since 2015 and is said to be a Ferrari collector himself. He was close to Marchionne, who in turn sat on the Philip Morris board. 
His familiarity with Marchionne's plans was one of the reasons behind his appointment to ensure continuity, a person familiar with the company said.
But it is Camilleri's track record at PMI, where he has proven to be a pioneer in guiding the company towards reduced-risk cigarette alternatives that make him a good choice to lead Ferrari into its next phase, analysts said. 
""He was talking about risk-free products long before we ever heard of IQOS,"" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham, referring to PMI's electronic smoking gadget which heats tobacco instead of burning it. 
Ferrari said in February it would double core earnings to 2 billion euros by 2022 by pushing into hybrids, SUVs and new special editions and by expanding a customisation program.
At the time of the IPO, Marchionne had promised to expand Ferrari into other luxury categories beyond cars, but the plan was put on ice to focus on vehicles first. It is yet to be seen whether Camilleri will resurrect that. 
One of Camilleri's toughest challenges will be alleviating fears that any push into new territories - like an SUV - would happen on Ferrari's terms without sacrificing its exclusivity. 
Marchionne had sought to calm fears by saying any utility vehicle with the prancing horse logo would be ""Ferrari style"" for ""the selected few"" and its claim to fame would not be ""being able to climb rocks"". 
Investors said they were confident Ferrari would continue powering ahead over the next 12-24 months because its fundamentals were strong, but it might be difficult to grow a stock that already rides on multiples higher than any other auto company and above many luxury goods makers. 
""Like any jewel, Ferrari is extremely tricky to manage and that makes me nervous,"" said Michele Pedroni, a fund manager at Decalia Asset Management.

""With a push into SUVs, an electric car or a further volume expansion, the room for error is high ... we need to see a strategy that ensures the exclusive appeal is not compromised. Even Marchionne would have found that challenging.""

The practice, mainly within the forex department, was occurring until early this year and dates back to at least 2004, the Journal reported.
Shares of the company were down nearly 3 percent at $100.75 in midday trading.
The practice mostly targeted small and midsize businesses, where a salesperson would tell potential clients that AmEx would beat the price they were paying banks or other financial institutions to convert currency and send money abroad, the Journal reported.
However, the salespeople did not inform customers that the margin, a markup that AmEx tacks on to the base currency exchange rate, was subject to increase without notice, the WSJ reported.
To spot the change, customers generally would have to log in to their accounts and compare the rate AmEx was offering to the market exchange rate at the time of the transaction, it added.
AmEx spokeswoman Marina Hoffmann Norville said the company would be conducting a review with an external party in order to determine whether all of its standards are being met. 
""We take allegations like these very seriously ... If we find that we fell short of the mark, we will fix the problems and take appropriate actions to make sure it doesn't recur,"" Norville said. 

AmEx's forex unit accounts for less than half of a percentage point of its total revenue and has a training, control and compliance oversight, the company said.

The electric vehicle maker has had preliminary discussions with two German states vying to host its Gigafactory in Europe to build cars and their batteries under one roof, the Journal reported.
The talks are still in their early stages and may not yield an agreement, according to the report. 
Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in June that he favors Germany as the location for its first European Gigafactory.
""Perhaps on the German-French border makes sense, near the Benelux countries,"" Musk had said https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1009014824280342529 on Twitter, responding to a public tweet.
Tesla already has an engineering division in Pruem, Germany, that is about 30 kms from Belgium and about 100 kms from the French border.
A Tesla spokesman declined to comment.
Earlier this month, the company announced plans to build its first overseas plant in China.
Although Musk has said the company will be cash-flow positive this year, analysts have predicted that Tesla will raise capital to fund a long list of projects, including launching an electric semi truck and a pickup truck.
Tesla has been struggling to meet its self imposed production goals for its Model 3 sedan.

201,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Earnings misses and tech fragility drag European stocks down,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares retreated from a six-week high on Monday as industrials and tech stocks slipped and disappointing earnings, including from brewer Heineken, dented investors' confidence.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.3 percent, starting a packed earnings week on the back foot after sealing on Friday its strongest weekly gain in nearly five weeks. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) edged down 0.5 percent.
A negative open on Wall Street also comforted traders to stick to a risk-off mode until the close.
Shares in Heineken (AS:HEIO) tumbled 6.5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after the world's second largest beer maker reported weaker than expected first-half earnings and cut its full-year margin guidance.
""Heineken’s first-half EPS missed expectations due to the consolidation of Kirin Brasil, adverse currency effects and higher input costs,"" Liberum analysts said in a note.
France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) fell 2.5 percent to the bottom of the CAC 40 (FCHI) after its first-half operating income proved disappointing.
Another faller after earnings was  Siemens  Healthineers (DE:SHLG), which declined 2 percent after the world's largest maker of medical-imaging gear reported a 10 percent slump in net profit, driven down by a strong dollar.
Its parent company Siemens (DE:SIEGn) also fell 0.4 percent, one of the biggest weights among industrials stocks.
Several companies however delivered positive results, including German industrial machinery group GEA (DE:G1AG), which rose 4.5 percent to a three-month high after it reported.
""GEA Group’s second-quarter figures are characterized by better than (expected) order intake, partially wiping out the 1Q18 slump, solid sales growth and operating earnings surpassing the 2Q17 level and expectations,"" Baader Helvea analysts said.
British bookmaker GVC (L:GVC), which owns the  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral brands, climbed 5.4 percent to a record high after announcing it had sealed a joint venture with MGM Resorts (N:MGM) to set up an online betting platform in the United States.
Shore Capital analyst Greg Johnson said U.S. sports betting could grow to be a $20 billion market, and saw a 10 percent market share as potentially generating value of 270p per share for GVC.
""A tie-up with MGM significantly increases the chances of achieving such a market position with a lower risk profile."" 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares also rose 2.9 percent after the German lender said it had moved a large part of its euro clearing activity to Frankfurt from London.
TECH PAIN, FINANCIALS GAIN
Earnings aside, the tech sector (SX8P) declined 1.6 percent, reflecting moves in Asia and Wall Street after shocking drops in big tech names Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) last week shook investors' belief in tech's resilience. 
 Cap Gemini  (PA:CAPP) and SAP (DE:SAPG), heavyweights in tech, fell 2.2 and 2.9 percent.
Financials, on the other hand, provided the biggest boost to overall index gains. They remain, however, the worst-performing sector year-to-date.
After visiting clients, Citi analysts said U.S. investors remain underweight on EU banks but had more interest in buying them than on any of their recent marketing trips. 
Overall, MSCI Europe earnings are expected to grow 8.4 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. Earnings growth for the index is also being revised up for 2018 and 2019.
But Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts say the rate of positive earnings surprises is trailing the historical average thus far in Q2.

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite fell more than 1 percent on Monday for the third straight session, as disappointing forecasts from a clutch of technology and internet companies fueled worries about the continued growth of the high-flying tech sector.
Gains by energy companies, as oil prices rose, and bank stocks ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting helped the benchmark S&P 500 cut its losses.
The technology index (SPLRCT) tumbled 1.65 percent, falling more than 1.5 percent for the third straight day as underwhelming results from the likes of Facebook (O:FB) and Netflix (O:NFLX) spooked investors about the prospects of a sector that has led the equity market to record highs.
The so-called FAANG group fell on Monday. Facebook dropped 4.3 percent and Netflix (O:NFLX) slid 4.6 percent. Amazon (O:AMZN) declined 1.2 percent and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) dropped 1.5 percent despite both reporting healthy results.
Apple (O:AAPL), which is due to report earnings on Tuesday after the bell, fell 0.6 percent.
""Investors are still trying to digest results from FAANG stocks last week, and trying to figure out if it's just another bump in the road or if something more meaningful is in play,"" said Cliff Hodge, director of investments for Cornerstone Wealth in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""People are worried these stocks won't hold up or will not continue to grow. They are looking at the big picture and wondering if we're getting later and later in the cycle and trying to decide if it's time to be more defensive.""
Still, six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. The biggest boost to the market was from the energy sector's (SPNY) 0.63 percent gain as oil prices rose with investors remaining cautious over supply outlook. [O/R]
At 11:29 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 42.84 points, or 0.17 percent, at 25,408.22, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 9.45 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,809.37 and the Nasdaq (IXIC) was down 82.14 points, or 1.06 percent, at 7,655.28.

The Swiss bank is in the process of notifying London-based staff about the moves that will affect its main divisions, namely investment banking, wealth management and asset management, the source said.
Credit Suisse, which employs about 5,500 people in London, will grow its Madrid headcount to almost 300 after the moves, while the Spanish capital will also serve as a hub for South America where the bank wants to expand its client network.
The news, which was first reported by Spanish paper Vozpopuli, comes as slow progress in post-Brexit negotiations with Brussels has raised fears of a so-called ""hard Brexit"" that would cause major disruption to global banks who run their European businesses from Britain.
With an October deadline on the trading relationship between Britain and the EU, banks are losing hope that they will be able to retain ""passport"" access to EU financial markets and have started implementing contingency plans.
U.S. banks including Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JPMorgan (N:JPM) are looking to beef up regional offices across Europe including Paris, Madrid and Milan.
 Barclays  (L:BARC) has begun shifting 40 to 50 investment banking jobs from Britain to Frankfurt, while  Citigroup  (N:C) is boosting its operations in France ahead of Brexit with a series of senior appointments.

For Credit Suisse, Madrid will not be the only destination as it is looking to relocate staff to multiple EU locations, the source said, while adding that London will still play a role even after Brexit.

US Foods said it expected to achieve about $55 million in annual run-rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2022 and that the deal was likely to add to its adjusted profit in the second year following the closing of the transaction. 
The deal will be funded primarily through a $1.5 billion term loan from J.P. Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and the remaining through its existing liquidity resources, US Foods said.
For the reported quarter, US Foods' sales were $6.16 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $6.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

All of the FAANGs retreated, with  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). sinking 3.3 percent and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). falling as much as 5.3 percent. The FANG index retreated 2.1 percent, widening its three-day loss to 8.6 percent. This compares with a 1.2 percent loss for the S&P 500 over the same time.
Investors have been bailing from the space since the Facebook’s earnings hit July 25, prompting the biggest market-cap decline in U.S. history. Market darlings since the 2016 presidential election, the group of tech megacaps has seen investors heading for exits with the advance seen as having gone too far, too fast.
“Sentiment is turning sour in FANG, especially after earnings,” Michael Antonelli, an institutional equity sales trader and managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co, said in an email. “They are dragging the Nasdaq 100 down by its feet.”
The selloff has widened losses in the S&P 500 Information Technology Index to 5.1 percent, the biggest three-day retreat since March.

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) -  HDFC Bank Ltd  (NS:HDBK) launched separate share sales on Monday in the United States and its home Indian market in a bid to raise as much as 155 billion rupees ($2.26 billion).
The Indian lender, which is also listed in New York (N:HDB), is offering up to 19 million American Depositary Shares, representing 57 million equity shares, according to a filing.
HDFC, the Indian bank with the highest market capitalisation, also opened a share sale in India, which according to a deal term sheet has a base size of 20 billion rupees with an option to upsize to up to 37.5 billion rupees.
The second-biggest Indian lender by assets has set a floor price of 2,179.13 rupees ($31.75) for both of the share sales. Based on the floor price, the American share sale could raise as much as 124.21 billion rupees, Reuters calculations showed.
With its focus on retail clients and a lower bad-loan ratio, HDFC Bank is an investor favourite at a time when India's banking sector has been plagued by a record $150 billion in non-performing loans.
HDFC Bank, which has the lowest bad-loan ratio among leading Indian lenders, announced plans in December to raise a total 240 billion rupees ($3.5 billion) to fund growth.
It has already raised 85 billion rupees by selling shares to its parent, mortgage lender HDFC Ltd (NS:HDFC).

214,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 11:06AM ET</span>",Walmart stumbles with its 'last mile' package delivery plan,"By Nandita Bose
EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (Reuters) - Standing before an audience of 14,000 people last year, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc executives described a radical plan to help it fend off Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online delivery services from stealing its customers.
Walmart's own store employees would bring online orders directly to shoppers' homes after completing their usual shifts of up to nine hours on the sales floors. Aiming to lower the retailer's shipping costs by tapping its massive workforce, the program was part of a multi-pronged strategy to boost its $11.5 billion U.S. ecommerce business and tackle one of the biggest challenges in retail: the so-called ""last mile"" of delivering goods to online customers. 
Its workers, meanwhile, could earn extra money on top of their hourly pay, which starts at $11 an hour.
""Just imagine associates all over the world delivering orders to customers on their way home,"" Marc Lore, head of Walmart's e-commerce operations, said at its annual meeting in June 2017. ""That can be a real game-changer.""
But months later, Walmart quietly retreated from its original vision for the pilot program - launched in New Jersey and Arkansas - and ended it altogether in January, according to company documents obtained by Reuters and interviews with more than two dozen Walmart employees.
The story behind the foundering employee delivery initiative, which has not been reported, offers insight into Walmart's ongoing attempts to find unconventional ways to close the gap with Amazon in the game of cheap, rapid, doorstep delivery of packages. According to Walmart data, people who shop in stores and become online customers spend nearly twice as much as those who shop at one or the other.
Here in New Jersey, Walmart started the program with the idea that store employees could courier all items that would fit in a car. But the initiative failed to gain traction with skeptical employees who had to use their time after work, according to sixteen workers who participated in the trial.
Walmart is now testing a more modest service with just four Walmart employees who deliver goods from a single store in Woodstock, Georgia, Reuters has learned. In this latest initiative, Walmart is also overhauling the guidelines for employees and limiting deliveries to groceries and related items such as paper plates. 
Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman confirmed that the retailer ended its first experiment early this year, without elaborating. Walmart is testing a variety of ways to deliver merchandise, she said, and is ""encouraged by what we're seeing"" in the Georgia store. 
Despite having 4,700 U.S. stores within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, Walmart is still trying to figure out how to efficiently make deliveries and has poured billions of dollars into ecommerce in recent years. 
But as recently as the last holiday season, its online sales disappointed some investors.
Walmart caters to U.S. online shoppers by having them drive up to their local store themselves to collect merchandise they ordered online. It also partners with shippers such as FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), the United States Postal Service (USPS) for routine deliveries.
Still, Walmart aims to be able to deliver groceries to more than 40 percent of households in the country by the end of this year. Globally, Walmart is experimenting with deliveries by motorbike in Mexico and with new small supermarkets in China to make deliveries in 30 minutes or less. In Japan, Walmart is opening a new warehouse to support orders, and expanding its online offerings to include meal kits. 
Earlier this year, Reuters reported the retailer's delivery partnerships with Uber and Lyft ended after the ride-hailing services struggled to deliver people and packages together. It continues to rely on third-party companies such as Postmates, Deliv and Doordash to help deliver groceries, and last week partnered with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo.
SKEPTICAL DRIVERS
Walmart's associate delivery pilot program in the leafy, middle-class suburb of East Brunswick, New Jersey, started with store managers pitching employees an unusual new way to boost pay. Those who passed background checks could moonlight as drivers for the Walmart.com delivery service, they said.
Some staffers, who did not wish to be named fearing retribution for speaking to the media, told Reuters they balked at having to use their own cars and personal insurance policies for a program that would benefit Walmart. 
To entice them to sign up, Walmart offered free TVs and iPads as gifts, they said. Eventually, about 50 of the store's more than 150 associates initially signed up, they added, though many had no prior experience as couriers with a delivery service.
Walmart declined comment on this. 
Fourteen of the sixteen Walmart employees told Reuters that they were put off by the program's poor compensation. And all of them expressed concern over who would be responsible if they got into an accident or if merchandise was lost.
For example, the East Brunswick Walmart paid store associates $2 per package, with participants making three to five total drop-offs during a typical trip within a ten mile radius, participants told Reuters. It also reimbursed them 54 cents for fuel per mile, over the federal fuel reimbursement rate of 53.5 cents in 2017, and offered them an extra hour of overtime pay. 
But every employee Reuters spoke to who signed up said they typically lost at least 30 minutes of time, waiting at the store after their shifts ended to collect the items and were never compensated for it.
Walmart didn't offer more than one hour of overtime even if it took more than an hour to deliver orders after finishing their 40 hour work week, former participants said. Walmart disputed this saying it paid workers overtime when they exceeded 40 hours. 
All sixteen workers who had participated in the program said delivery of five packages would generally take them more than two hours to complete. If a worker drove 10 miles to drop five packages, that would earn them $15.40 in compensation per package and fuel, before overtime pay.
Rival Amazon pays independent drivers $18 to $25 an hour for deliveries, and the fuel costs belong to the driver, according to the Amazon Flex website. Amazon declined to comment on the story.
One of the Walmart employees said in only one instance did she earn an additional $100 at the end of the week – after making nearly a dozen deliveries.
""The money was never worth it... and they stopped paying mileage in the end,"" said an employee who did not wish to be named. 
Twelve out of sixteen employees said they were not paid mileage for the final deliveries they made before the program was shut. Walmart did not comment on mileage payments that employees said were not made. 
As for insurance, risk and liability for accidents and lost packages, many of the employees Reuters spoke with said they were unclear if Walmart would shoulder the responsibility or not. 
DOWN TO A TEAM OF FOUR
Now, an initiative known internally as 'Associate Delivery 2.0' is being run with four employees hired specifically as delivery drivers in Woodstock, Georgia, according to company documents and interviews.
To build demand, Walmart will waive the fee for the first delivery order if it is for $50 or more, according to a Walmart promotional pamphlet at the store. For subsequent orders, the retailer's mobile app offered delivery on a minimum $30 order for a fee of $7.99 to $9.95.
The team of three men and one woman, working separately, load up their cars to make deliveries to shoppers within ten miles. 
Maurice Thomas, who is one of the four Walmart employees, illustrates the retailer's new tack. A hybrid between a delivery driver and a store employee, Thomas's role is newly created to revive the initiative, he and other store employees in Georgia said. 
Thomas took a job at the Woodstock store three years ago unloading trucks. Now he uses his own car, fuel and personal insurance to deliver 6 to 7 packages to shopper's homes every day. 
""I have a fixed schedule and doing this is much better than unloading trucks,"" said Thomas, who is 28. 
Walmart pays Thomas $12.50 an hour and reimburses 54.5 cents a mile, comparable to the 54.5 federal fuel reimbursement rate in 2018, he said. If Thomas drove 10 miles within an hour to make deliveries, he would earn $18.30. 
Thomas said every two weeks he is usually left with about $130-$140 dollars after buying fuel. 
Walmart informed employees in Georgia they would have to use their own car insurance policies when they were hired, Blakeman said. But the retailer will cover any expenses that their personal insurance policies won't cover, she added. 
An internal document seen by Reuters provides Walmart delivery workers with a specific new protocol. Among the guidelines: ""do not mix orders"" and ""make sure you have your 'thank you' cards ready"" to leave inside their deliveries. 

""We're testing and learning how best to use associates,"" said Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt. ""There's a reason for pilots.""

(Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) cut its full-year profit forecast on Monday, citing the uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs that have hurt domestic and export prices of meat, sending its shares down 6 percent.
Following U.S. tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. pork and beef, while Mexico and Canada also implemented levies, leading to over supplies and subsequently lower prices for these proteins in the domestic market.
This has in turn hurt the consumption of chicken in the United States, forcing producers such as Tyson to reduce prices to spur demand.
""We still face pressure on chicken sales volume and pricing due to the abundance of relatively low-priced beef and pork on the market,"" Chief Executive Officer Tom Hayes said. 
""Our forecasted earnings range reflects the current market volatility in meat prices,"" Hayes said. 
The company now expects adjusted earnings per share of about $5.70-$6.00 for fiscal 2018, down from its earlier forecast of $6.55-$6.70.
Analysts' on average were expecting the company to earn $6.53 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Jefferies analyst Akshay Jagdale lowered his profit estimates for Tyson and peers  Sanderson Farms  Inc (O:SAFM) and  Pilgrims Pride Corp  (O:PPC), as he expects demand for chicken weaken due to increased availability of competing meats.
""Commodity chicken prices will remain weak through at least Q1 of 2019,"" Jagdale wrote.
Shares of Sanderson Farms dipped 3 percent, while Pilgrims Pride's stock was down 1.6 percent.
Tyson Foods said the benefit it would get from the U.S. tax reform is now about 77 per share, down from a previous projection of 85 cents per share. 
""Our fourth quarter is off to a slower than expected start driven primarily by market related factors,"" Hayes added.

The company is expected to report third quarter results on August 6.

(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) is launching lightweight motorcycles in Asian markets and electric bikes in the hope of sparking demand as it faces declining sales in the United States and the threat of trade tariffs increasing its costs.
The 115-year-old Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company, known for its heavy touring motorcycles, is scrambling to revamp its operations as its mainstay customer base ages by tapping into younger buyers, particularly in Asia, by offering nimbler motorcycles with smaller engines.
Laying out a plan it calls ""More Roads to Harley-Davidson"", the company expects to spend $675 million-$825 million over the next four years, looks to chop costs and generate more than $1 billion of incremental annual revenue in 2022.
Harley will develop motorcycles with smaller engines of 250cc to 500cc for Asia, including India, which the company said was one of its fastest growing markets in the world.
""If nothing else, Harley-Davidson is acknowledging the ongoing shift in global consumer tastes and sluggish U.S. participation rates, and is willing to make course corrections – and investments – to pursue areas of growth,"" Raymond James analyst Joseph Altobello said.
In a bid to attract customers globally, the company is also revamping stores, partnering with online retailers and launching a 1250cc custom model, Pan America, and a middleweight 975cc Streetfighter model in 2020.
Harley has been at the center of a trade war between the United States and the European Union, with the company planning to shift production for European customers overseas to avoid the EU tariffs, a move that was slammed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
""The accelerated strategy will require significant investment to change the trajectory of the business globally, and the company plans to fund it entirely through comprehensive cost reduction and reallocation of previously planned investment and resources,"" the company said.
Harley has also been spending on product development and marketing, including promoting its learn-to-ride academies at showrooms and developing electric motorcycle technology.
The company said it plans to launch its electric motorcycle in 2019 and will release additional models through 2022.
""The plan centers on bold new product introductions and is largely geared to expanding Harley's appeal in faster-growth international markets,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia said.
Zackfia added that the new products are a significant departure from Harley's signature style and are likely to raise questions as to whether the means of attracting new customers could alienate the core.
Harley last week forecast a lower-than-expected hit to profit margins from Trump's trade tariffs, despite rising raw materials costs and higher tariffs on bikes shipped to Europe.

Shares of Harley were up 1.3 percent in early trade. The stock has fallen 13 percent this year.

218,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 10:04AM ET</span>",German prosecutors investigate VW ex-CEO's financial transfers,"HAMBURG/ZURICH (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Monday they are investigating whether former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn moved some of his assets out of Germany following an inquiry into his role in the manipulation of anti-pollution tests.
Winterkorn was head of VW Group in September 2015 when U.S. regulators uncovered the carmaker's cheating and he stepped down days after the scandal broke. Prosecutors in Germany and the United States are investigating whether top Volkswagen managers knew about, and could have prevented, the pollution breaches.
""The circumstances around possible transfers of wealth may play a role examining the question whether the accused Winterkorn knew about diesel manipulations and potentially reacted in some way,"" the prosecutor's office in the German city of Braunschweig said in a statement on Monday.
Felix Doerr, a lawyer representing Winterkorn, did not respond to requests seeking comment. Winterkorn has previously denied advanced knowledge of emissions fraud or failing in his duty to inform investors in a timely manner.
Bild am Sonntag reported on Sunday that transfers worth 7 million euros were made on January 31, 2017 from a bank in Nuremberg, Bavaria to an auditor's office in Munich. Around 3.4 million euros of this ended up at Bank Vontobel in Switzerland, the paper said.
The Braunschweig prosecutor's office said it was not investigating Winterkorn for tax evasion, but had passed on some of its findings to the tax authorities. 
Bank Vontobel said on Monday it complies with all laws and rules, and does not comment on individual clients or accounts. The Swiss financial markets regulator declined to comment.
Prosecutors are examining whether Winterkorn was attempting to move money to a safe haven ahead of a possible prosecution, Bild am Sonntag added.
Volkswagen struck a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice On January 11, 2017, pleading guilty to criminal and civil penalties and agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines and settlements. In total, VW has paid out at least $25 billion relating to the scandal.
The Department of Justice then pressed to indict Winterkorn on March 14, 2018 and made public their intention to have him arrested on May 3, 2018.

Switzerland effectively abolished bank secrecy in 2017 by agreeing to an automatic exchange of information with Germany concerning bank accounts.

220,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 09:51AM ET</span>","The Big Mac at 50: McDonald's CEO on 'MacCoin,' the Big Mac Index, and why there will probably never be a veggie Big Mac"," 
It's a big year for the Big Mac. 
This week,  McDonald's is kicking off its iconic burger's 50th anniversary celebrations. 
""It's not often that any food item is as relevant today as it was 50 years ago,"" McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook told Business Insider in a recent interview. 
On Sunday, the chain unveiled the MacCoin, a ""global currency"" that can be redeemed for a free burger at McDonald's locations around the world. Customers can receive a MacCoin with the purchase of a Big Mac on Thursday, August 2, to be redeemed starting the next day at McDonald's in more than 50 countries around the world. 
The deal was inspired by  the Big Mac Index, an annual report that uses Big Mac prices at countries around the world to see whether currencies are properly valued.
While Easterbrook admits it may not always be the perfect approximation, it is one that reveals the international power of the Big Mac. There are few other items — in or out of the fast-food industry — with the global reach of the Big Mac, with McDonald's serving millions of theoretically identical burgers at more than 36,000 locations around the world. 
That reach and the burger's 50 years of history gives the Big Mac a certain power that few other fast-food items can hope to grasp. That's great in many ways (Easterbrook says the company sold 1.3 billion Big Macs around the world last year), but it can also force the company to tread carefully when it comes to tweaking the burger. 
McDonald's has made very few adjustments to the Big Mac over the years, with one of the few changes being the removal of high-fructose corn syrup from its buns  in 2016, something the company was careful to do without impacting the burgers' flavor.
McDonald's has found success with offering different sizes in the form of the Grand Mac and Mac Jr. for limited periods. However, Easterbrook says the chain is cautious of making big changes like swapping the patty for a veggie burger or chicken. 
""We think the Big Mac needs to be sacrosanct,"" Easterbrook said. 
Another thing McDonald's won't get the Big Mac mixed up in: cryptocurrency.
Despite the MacCoin's phonetic similarities to Bitcoin, Easterbrook assured Business Insider that the ""currency"" was purposefully created to be ""tangible,"" in keeping with the Big Mac's meaty tradition. "

According to the Journal, the company's sales team would gain clients by offering them low rates, then later increase them without explicitly saying so. This meant more money for American Express.
Sources said the department increased conversion fees without telling its customers as part of a practice that was widespread since at least 2004 and continued until earlier this year.
According to the Journal, they stopped when allegations of similar practices at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) became public.
American Express responded to the Journal by saying that its rates are ""fair and transparent."" However, they did not specifically deny increasing rates without telling people.
Spokeswoman Marina Norville told The Wall Street Journal: ""We have training, control and compliance oversight and believe that our transactions are completed and reported in a fair and transparent manner at the rates which the client has authorized.""
The current and former employees said that they would tell potential clients that they could beat the price they were currently paying to convert and send money abroad. They did not inform these clients that the margin was subject to increase without notice. The salespeople would later increase the margin without telling the customer.
In order to notice the increase, a customer would have to log in to their accounts and compare American Express' rate with the market exchange rate at the time.
Current and former employees and emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal showed that when customers did notice a change and asked about it, salespeople sometimes would blame a glitch or other technicality and lower the margin for that customer.

Both China and Mexico have imposed import tariffs on American pork recently in retaliation against U.S. duties on metal shipments. The measures have sent hog prices plunging, eroding the profitability at Tyson’s port business. The Springdale, Arkansas company said Monday it’s also grappling with higher commodity-market volatility and ""sluggish"" domestic demand for chicken.
""The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,"" Chief Executive Officer Tom Hayes said in a statement Monday.
Earnings in fiscal 2018 excluding one-time items will be about $5.70 to $6 a share, compared with a previous view of $6.55 to $6.70, the company said. Its shares slumped 7 percent to $59.40 at 8 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York. Rival poultry producers Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. and Sanderson Farms Inc. also declined.
“Through pricing and aggressive cost management, we’re working to stabilize the impact of freight and feed ingredient costs,"" Hayes said. ""However, we still face pressure on chicken sales volume and pricing due to the abundance of relatively low-priced beef and pork on the market. We are working to mitigate these pressures, but our fourth quarter is off to a slower than expected start.""
Tyson plans to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Aug. 6.

Credit issued to developing-economy borrowers excluding banks has surged to $3.7 trillion by the end of March, fueled by a 16 percent year-on-year rise in new debt supply, the Bank for International Settlements said on Monday. Close to $500 billion comes from China, by far the biggest single issuer, with African and Middle Eastern nations also rapidly increasing their borrowing.
The latest numbers underscore the relentless boom in the dollar credit cycle, even as investors fret over rising borrowing costs and an upswing in the U.S. currency. The premium money managers demand to hold developing-economy dollar bonds over Treasuries rose to the widest since 2016 last month before easing in recent weeks.
The international use of the dollar is likely to increase further. Chinese companies and banks sold dollar bonds at a record pace last year and underwriters expect growth in the coming years to continue in part because the greenback helps fund acquisitions and investments abroad.
The BIS has for years warned that overseas debt loads may prove unsustainable as global interest rates normalize. Despite a tumultuous year for emerging-market assets, defaults remain relatively low. The trailing 12-month speculative-grade default rate was just 1.1 percent at the end of April, according to S&P Global Inc."

LONDON (Reuters) - Delays to the planned sale of Toshiba's (T:6502) NuGen nuclear project in Britain have prompted a review of the roles of 60 direct employees, who are mainly based in Manchester, raising further doubts over its future.
The plant in Moorside, north-west England, was expected to provide around 7 percent of Britain's electricity when built, but has faced several setbacks after Toshiba's nuclear arm Westinghouse went bankrupt last year.
Following the Westinghouse bankruptcy, NuGen joint venture partner Engie (PA:ENGIE) pulled out of the project, leaving the Japanese firm searching for new investors.
Toshiba put NuGen up for sale and South Korea's Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) (KS:015760) was chosen as preferred bidder last year, but the process has stalled. 
Britain needs to invest in new capacity to replace aging coal and nuclear reactors that are due to close in the 2020s, but large new plants have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices.
""Toshiba has pursued a sale of NuGen to KEPCO and the prolonged time it has taken reach a conclusion has required NuGen to undertake a review,"" a spokesman for NuGen said.
""As such additional options are being pursued for NuGen's future direction to deliver the next generation of nuclear new build in the UK,"" he said.
NuGen has around 60 direct employees, mostly based in Manchester, while the roles of around 40 contractors would also be placed under a 30 day consultation period later this week, the spokesman added.
Britain's government has yet to announce any kind of deal for the NuGen project.
""We continue to engage with new build developers, though the detail of these discussions is commercially confidential,"" a spokeswoman for the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department said.
Another plant, to be built by a unit of Japan's Hitachi Ltd (T:6501), has also struggled to find funding, leading the British government to consider direct investment. 
However, EDF's (PA:EDF) Hinkley Point C will be the first new nuclear plant built in the country in more than twenty years after securing additional backing from the French government, investment from China General Nuclear Power Corp, and a long-term power price guarantee from Britain.

The government has been criticised for being too generous in the terms it has set for this deal.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG) plans to cushion the impact of trade tensions between the United States and China by changing its supply routes to ship goods from its European factories, its chief financial officer said on Monday.
The United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, including medical imaging equipment, in early July and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $500 billion of imports.
Speaking to journalists following the medical equipment maker's third-quarter results, Jochen Schmitz said Healthineers' global supply-chain network meant it could ship deliveries that previously went to the United States from China from its factories in Europe instead.
""This won't happen without leaving some trace on our results because we have to change logistic chains ... depending on how the situation develops,"" he said.
However, he said he expected the tariffs to have a low single digit million euro impact on Healthineers' results this year, which could rise to a double-digit million euro impact next year.
""When it stays in this range it won't be a catastrophe but of course the topic is very, very regrettable because it significantly impairs global trade,"" he said.
Healthineers has manufacturing sites in more than 10 countries, including Germany, the United States, Britain, China, India and South Korea among others. 
As of the end of last year, Healthineers had 23 manufacturing and R&D sites in the Americas, 17 in Europe, Middle East and Africa and 11 the Asia pacific region, according to its IPO prospectus.
The U.S. accounted for 34 percent of Siemens Healthineers sales in its fiscal year ended Sept 30, 2017 and China accounted for 12 percent, according to the prospectus.

Healthineers' profit for its fiscal third quarter was hit by currency moves and the cost of rolling out a new diagnostics machine, disappointing investors in the world's largest maker of medical imaging equipment.

(Reuters) - State-owned carrier Air India has sought 21.21 billion rupees ($309 million) of additional equity from the government for the fiscal year 2018-19 to make pending payments to its vendors, a source at the airline told Reuters on Monday. 
Air India owes about 18 billion rupees to its vendors, including lessors and banks that have demanded payment from the beleaguered airline, after the government's unsuccessful efforts to find a buyer for its 76 percent stake. 
The airline expects to receive the additional equity within the next 7 to 10 days after which it will be able to clear all dues, the source said, adding that this is above the 6.5 billion rupees it has already received for the year.
India last month shelved a plan to sell a majority stake in Air India due to lack of interest from bidders, in the latest setback in its ambitious efforts to rescue the ailing airline that has survived for years using taxpayer funds.
The government will continue to support the loss-making airline's financial requirements while it works on alternatives, Junior Civil Aviation Minister Jayant Sinha had said, without giving a specific timeline for a new plan.
Three banks and two aircraft leasing firms have served default notices on Air India over the last few weeks, the Business Standard newspaper reported earlier on Monday, raising concerns about the state-owned carrier's finances and credit-worthiness.
San Francisco, United States-based  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Trust Services and UAE's state-owned Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE) have sent letters of demand for pending rental payments, the newspaper said, citing sources. 
A DAE spokesman told Reuters that they were not owed $10 million by Alliance Air, and that they had not issued a notice of default to Alliance.
Alliance Air is a unit of Air India that operates regional flights to smaller towns and cities in India.
Wells Fargo could not be reached outside usual U.S. business hours.
Three lenders from a 22-bank consortium have also written to Air India raising concerns that the company is turning into a non-performing asset, Business Standard said. The three banks are  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank,  Dena Bank  (NS:DENA) and  Bank of India  Ltd (NS:BOI).
The airline has received a notice from banks for non-payment of dues that is being looked into by the government, the source confirmed.

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has begun clearing a ""large part"" of new euro-denominated derivatives trades in Frankfurt instead of London, a spokesman confirmed on Monday as a key Brexit battleground in financial services heats up.
The shift by Germany's largest bank is will help Deutsche Boerse's (DE:DB1Gn) efforts to attract a large part of the euro clearing market from London as Britain exits the European Union.
Clearing ensures a transaction is completed, even if one side of the deal goes bust.
The worry for the City of London is that if chunks of clearing move elsewhere, other activities like trading and jobs could follow, eating away at Britain's biggest economic sector.
London Stock Exchange's (L:LSE) LCH division has long dominated clearing of euro-denominated derivatives like interest rate swaps used by companies to cover themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs.
LSE had no immediate comment.
The move is largely symbolic and was widely expected given that Deutsche Bank's home base is in Frankfurt, where the bank is also transferring some other activities due to Brexit.
The Deutsche Bank spokesman said no jobs were being transferred and that the bank was effectively pushing a different button to route the clearing to Eurex, Deutsche Boerse's clearing division.
International banks with European bases in London have already been opening hubs in the EU to avoid Brexit disrupting their business.
The European Central Bank in Frankfurt told Reuters last week that being connected to local market infrastructure like clearing is a requirement for a euro zone license.
The ECB declined to comment on Monday on Deutsche Bank's shift in euro clearing.
A spokeswoman for Eurex said that it now has a market share of 8 percent of euro clearing, up from virtually zero a year ago, still tiny compared with LCH.
The shift in Deutsche Bank's clearing was first reported by the Financial Times.

Deutsche Boerse has set up a clearing business model similar to that of LCH by introducing a profit-sharing scheme last October to attract interest rate swap clearing.
There are now 29 firms in the scheme with more to come.
""Our focus for the next six months will be to increase buy side activity based on the good price quality provided by the banks participating in our partnership program,"" Eurex said.
The ECB has long wanted euro-denominated clearing relocated from London to the euro zone, arguing it should have some oversight, given that it would be called on to inject euros in the market if a clearing house got into trouble.
The EU is in the process of approving a draft law that will mean direct EU oversight of LCH in London after Brexit if it wants to continue clearing euro transactions for customers in the bloc, otherwise clearing would have to relocate to the euro zone.
Officials at the Bank of England, which regulates LCH, have argued that splitting euro clearing would fragment markets and bump up costs for users, a view disputed by Eurex.
But industry officials say a shift in some volume could even help LCH by making forced relocation less pressing.
Some LCH euro repo clearing has already moved from London to LCH's Paris subsidiary, but this may not be enough to satisfy the ECB.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2018 06:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Russian steelmaker MMK changes tack after tariffs, Iran sanctions","By Polina Ivanova and Andrey Kuzmin
MOSCOW (Reuters) - MMK (MM:MAGN), one of Russia's largest steel producers, has postponed the launch of a lucrative project in Turkey due to uncertainty created by global trade wars, Andrey Eremin, the company's director for economics, told Reuters in an interview.
The project - the re-launch of hot-rolled steel production at its Turkish site - was expected to add between $90 million and $100 million to MMK's core earnings, Eremin said, but a sudden surge in global trade barriers caught the company off guard, forcing it to delay.
""We had completely restored equipment at the plant to working condition, had figured out all the contracts for supplying energy and raw materials,"" Eremin said.
""Unfortunately, we made this decision before the U.S. introduced tariffs against metallurgical companies. We did not know that this would happen.""
The MMK Metalurji complex, located near Iskanderun on Turkey's Mediterranean coast and in Istanbul, was built by MMK between 2007 and 2010, at a cost of over $2 billion. 
Hot-rolled steel production at the site was put on hold in 2012 amid a global slump in steel prices, but was due to restart this summer as the market recovered.
Now MMK has put the re-launch on hold, and plans to decide its fate in November, when the dust has settled on a wave of protectionist measures introduced by the United States and Europe in recent months. 
""We hope that by that point, the transformation on global markets will have ended and there will be clarity,"" Eremin said.
U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in March in a move mainly aimed at curbing imports from China.
Last week, the European Union introduced a quota and tariff policy in response, fearing the impact on its own producers of a surge of steel imports following Trump's decision.
MMK is not affected directly by these measures as it does not export steel to the U.S. and EU markets, but 30 percent of production at its Turkish plant was intended for the European market and neighboring countries.
IRAN SANCTIONS ALSO BITE
Tariffs are not the only Trump policy to affect MMK's strategy. The steelmaker has also stopped deliveries to Iran, Eremin said, against the backdrop of new sanctions Washington has promised to impose on Tehran.
The U.S. measures, announced soon after Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama, are due to kick in next month and include a ban on the sale, supply and transfer to or from Iran of raw or semi-finished metals.
Although the Kremlin opposes the move and says that unilateral U.S. actions against a third country should not affect how Russia does business, steel traders told Reuters earlier this month that Russian metals firms were cutting back on sales to Iran for fear, at least in part, of falling foul of the sanctions.
MMK, which previously shipped hot-rolled steel coils to Iran along with its Russian competitor Severstal (MM:CHMF), was not affected by the move, Eremin said, as it had already redirected deliveries to other markets. 
This was the result of Iran's growing domestic production and consequent reduction in the volume of its imports. 
""Even before the introduction of sanctions, deliveries were insignificant,"" Eremin said. ""We even cleared out the port warehouses where stocks were intended for delivery in that direction, and sold off supplies,"" he said. 
DOWNGRADING DEMAND
In terms of the Russian domestic steel market, MMK has halved its forecast of growth in demand this year, from 4 to 2 percent, Eremin said.
""Last year, demand for steel products in our range grew around 6.5 percent in Russia,"" he said.
""This year, the pace has slowed, and we assess it to be around 2 percent this year, despite the fact that just recently we expected growth to be at 4 percent,"" Eremin said.
MMK changed its forecast following the government's proposal to raise value-added tax (VAT), from 18 percent to 20 percent.

""In essence, VAT may increase. We believe that this could slow down the pace of growth in demand for steel in Russia,"" Eremin said.

MILAN (Reuters) - World stocks fell and the dollar steadied on Monday as a busy week of central bank meetings and company updates started. Japanese government bonds sold off before possible monetary policy tweaks.
Disappointing updates from U.S. tech heavyweights soured the mood across stock markets, knocking European shares off their six-week highs at the open and dragging down by 0.11 percent a MSCI index that tracks shares in 47 countries (MIWD00000PUS).
""Quarterly results continue to be more than good overall, but markets appear to be particularly sensitive to the sporadic negative updates, especially from tech stocks,"" said Alessandro Balsotti,"" strategist and fund manager at JCI Capital.
The week features quarterly earnings from more than 140 S&P 500 companies, including Apple (O:AAPL). It will be closely watched after disappointing results from Facebook (O:FB) and Twitter (N:TWTR) shook investor belief in tech resilience. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reported relatively aggressive moves into ""value"" stocks - in particular banks - and away from shares leveraged to economic growth.
""Tech really began cracking on Tuesday before the floodgates opened on Friday,"" analysts at the U.S. bank wrote in a note.
""The rotation will likely continue, benefiting value categories at the expense of momentum/tech as rates are biased higher,"" they added. ""Europe's higher weighting to banks/resource will help it vs the U.S."" 
In Europe, 70 companies on the STOXX 600 are due to report their updates this week with figures from big banks, including  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), Lloyds (L:LLOY) in the spotlight.
CENTRAL BANK TEST
Away from earnings, the top focus will be three central bank meetings. Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will be eyed for possible policy tweaks, while the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to deliver surprises.
The Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected to keep rates unchanged and reaffirm the outlook for further rate rises. The market is almost fully priced for a hike in September and leaning towards a further move before the end of the year.
The BoJ meeting that ends on Tuesday will be closely watched amid speculation the central bank might tweak its massive asset-buying program and take a step towards less monetary policy accommodation.
As the market tried to test the central bank's intention, Japanese government bond sagged, sending the benchmark 10-year yield to its highest level in almost a year and a half.
That forced the BoJ to conduct a special bond-buying operation for two sessions in a row and to end up buying a record amount to stem rising bond yields. 
On currency markets, the chance of a BoJ shift has sent the yen higher in the last week or so, leaving the dollar around 111.05 yen  from a peak of 113.18 earlier in the month.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar was hovering at 94.606 (DXY), having repeatedly failed to clear resistance around 95.652 this month.
The euro edged up to $1.1664 (EUR=) against the dollar in early European trading, after the European Central Bank reaffirmed last week that rates would remain low through the summer. 
In Asia, eyes were on China's yuan after it suffered the longest weekly losing streak since November 2015. It duly weakened further, slipping past 6.8400 per dollar  for the first time since June last year.
In commodity markets, oil prices rose but gains were limited as the fallout from trade tensions weighed on markets. [O/R]

However, Ofgem said it will set the revenue National Grid can earn from the upgrade based partly on the regulator's experience in tendering contracts to own new transmission links to offshore wind farms.
The Hinkley–Seabank (HSB) project will cost 650 million pounds ($852 million) and allow for the safe connection of EDF Energy's (PA:EDF) planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power station.
The project will also provide additional capability and relieve transmission constraints in the South West of England.
National Grid said it will review Ofgem's decision an consider all options before Ofgem formalizes its proposals in the grid operator's license later this year or early in 2019. 
""Ofgem's decision does not affect our commitment to delivering HSB to time and to quality as per our license obligations,"" it added.
Ofgem expects to deliver savings of more than 5 billion pounds to consumers through tougher price controls for energy networks.

The price controls set the revenue monopoly network owners can earn from charges to consumers.

The world’s second-largest brewer on Monday forecast a drop in profitability this year as it expands more quickly than expected in Latin America’s biggest economy, where its beer business is less profitable than elsewhere. The shares fell as much as 5.6 percent in Amsterdam, the most in almost three years.
Heineken became Brazil’s second-biggest brewer last year when it bought Kirin Holdings Co.’s business there for about 2.2 billion real ($590 million). The Japanese company had stumbled amid competition with industry giant AB InBev, and now Heineken is stepping up the fight with increased marketing, causing a decline in its overall profitability even as it sells more beer.
“We weren’t expecting these products to accelerate so fast in the first year,” Chief Financial Officer Laurence Debroux said in a phone interview.
The company’s roster of brands in Brazil now includes Schincariol in the mass-market segment as well as more expensive Devassa and Eisenbahn lagers. Kirin’s Brazil unit wasn’t profitable at the time of acquisition, though it is now and margins should catch up to Heineken’s average level in three to five years, Debroux said.
“This should lead to low- to mid-single-digit downgrade, on a stock which had performed well,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts led by Olivier Nicolai wrote in a note to investors.
The full-year margin will shrink about 20 basis points, Heineken said, also pointing to currency headwinds. Adjusted operating profit rose 1.3 percent to 1.75 billion euros ($2 billion) in the first half, missing analysts’ estimates.
Heineken had forecast its margin to improve 25 basis points this year in February, lower than its target for past years. Higher raw material costs and a currency headwind are also reasons the brewer gave for cutting its forecast Monday.
AB InBev reported earnings below estimates last week as marketing spending on the soccer World Cup hurt second-quarter profit growth.
Heineken’s beer volume rose 4.5 percent on an organic basis, compared with the estimate of 3.1 percent.

""We would expect that net loan book growth to continue in the second half of the year.

Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) policy meeting on Tuesday is expected to receive some focus as traders believe the central bank could tweak its massive asset-buying campaign.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares fell on Friday after the chipmaker announced delays for next generation chips while Twitter sank after reporting a drop in monthly active users. On Thursday, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) plunged close to 20% following a weak earnings report.
Meanwhile, U.S. second-quarter GDP grew at 4.1%, marking the quickest pace of growth since 2014, although its impact on equities seemed to be limited. The U.S. Federal Reserve is due to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and is widely expected to reaffirm the outlook for further gradual rate rises, as the market is almost fully priced for a rate hike in September and expects a further move before the end of this year.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 declined 0.65% by 10:34 PM ET (02:34 GMT) from the previous session. Data on Monday showed the country’s retail sales rose 1.8% in June, compared with the median estimate for a 1.6% annual gain and followed a 0.6% increase in May.
Investors are likely to focus on whether the BOJ will fine tune its policy later this week.
""Our base case scenario is for the BOJ to make no policy change. But there is increasing speculation the BOJ may tweak its yield curve control settings in part because of lower bank profitability and muted inflation in Japan,"" Elias Haddad, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 09:30PM ET</span>",CBS board to discuss CEO Moonves investigation on Monday: sources,"By Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - CBS Corp's board will discuss the investigation into allegations of personal misconduct against the U.S. broadcasting and media company's Chief Executive Leslie Moonves on Monday, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The allegations come as Moonves is embroiled in a legal battle over control of CBS with the company's largest shareholder, National Amusements Inc, owned by Shari Redstone and her father Sumner, who also control media company Viacom Inc.
CBS said on Friday it would investigate accusations against Moonves, 68, made by six women in a New Yorker magazine article featuring several instances of alleged sexual harassment spanning 1985 to 2006.
Moonves said in a statement on Friday that he regretted ""immensely"" making some women uncomfortable by making advances, but added that he abided by the principle that ‘no’ means ‘no,’ and stated he has never misused his position to harm or hinder anyone's career.
At a regularly scheduled board meeting on Monday ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings on Thursday, CBS directors will discuss forming a special committee to handle the Moonves investigation and decide which law firm the company will hire to help with the probe, one of the sources said.
Some CBS directors are also expected to raise the issue of whether Moonves should step aside while the probe takes place, the second source said.
CBS's board will also discuss how to investigate allegations that the company's culture facilitated personal misconduct, according to the sources.
The sources asked for anonymity from Reuters to discuss confidential deliberations. A National Amusements spokesman declined to comment on behalf of the company and Redstone. A CBS spokesman also declined to comment on behalf of his company and Moonves. Moonves himself did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Shari Redstone has a seat on CBS's 14-member board, alongside her personal lawyer Robert Klieger and National Amusements director David Andelman. It is unclear how much pressure Moonves will face at the board meeting on Monday to step aside. 
While many CBS directors were appointed to the board by Sumner Redstone, some turned against the Redstone family in May as part of a special board committee that sought to challenge the Redstone family's voting control.
Deadline Hollywood reported on CBS's upcoming board meeting earlier on Sunday. https://deadline.com/2018/07/cbs-board-meets-leslie-moonves-allegations-1202436111
Moonves clashed with Shari Redstone earlier this year when he rejected her latest attempt to merge CBS with Viacom Inc , another media company that is also majority-owned by National Amusements.
Moonves has been resisting a deal to unite CBS and Viacom because he has said CBS's prospects were better without taking on Viacom's turnaround challenges. Without Moonves at the helm, a major obstacle to Redstone's aim of merging the two companies would be removed.

CBS and National Amusements are also scheduled to battle it out in a Delaware court in October over CBS's plan to issue a special dividend aimed at cutting National Amusements’ voting power in the company to 17 percent from 80 percent. Without Moonves as CEO, it's not clear whether CBS would continue with this legal challenge.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>","Economy, dollar, trade key to U.S. stocks' global edge","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The ability of the U.S. stock market to keep an edge this year over equities elsewhere in the world hinges on the United States maintaining its economic and earnings growth advantage, the strength of the dollar and how global trade tensions resolve, investors said.
Spurred by fiscal policy benefits including a corporate tax cut, the U.S. economy's standout momentum relative to other regions has underpinned Wall Street's advantage this year, investors said.
“The outperformance of U.S. stocks reflects not just earnings, but expectations about U.S. economic growth versus other regions,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. 
""Conventional investor wisdom is that the U.S. is going to continue to outperform other economies this year and hence investors should move more of their exposure to the U.S.,” Hooper said.
A clearer read of the U.S. economy comes next week with data such as the government's monthly employment report on Friday and quarterly results from more than 140 S&P 500 companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) .
According to an International Monetary Fund report this month, the United States is projected to post economic growth of 2.9 percent this year, up from 2.3 percent in 2017, while European advanced economies, and Japan and China, have slower growth than a year ago. The U.S. economy grew 4.1 percent in the second quarter, data on Friday showed, its fastest pace in nearly four years.
The Trump administration has set a goal of 3 percent growth annually over the next several years, and while economists believe growth is likely to moderate from the second-quarter's surge, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday said the economy was on track to reach the president's target.
""I don't think this is a one- or two-year phenomenon. I think we definitely are in a period of four or five years of sustained 3 percent growth at least,"" Mnuchin told ""Fox News Sunday."" While returns for the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index trail last year's - they are up 6 percent so far in 2018 against a 10.5 percent gain at a similar point in 2017 - U.S. equities are easily beating indexes covering Europe, Japan and emerging markets after lagging or just keeping pace for all of last year.
NEAR ALL-TIME PEAK
After rebounding from a 10-percent correction earlier this year, the S&P 500 is close to an all-time high and on track for its best year relative to stocks in the rest of the world since 2014.
“Returns themselves have been lower than many investors have come to expect. But on a relative basis, the U.S. continues to be the market leader,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
U.S. stocks separated from equities elsewhere in particular during the second quarter, with investors citing a divergence in growth expectations. 
Citi Research's gauge on U.S. economic data surprises was solidly positive in April and May, when its barometer for euro zone surprises was sharply negative. 
""There was a change in expectation from synchronized global growth to U.S. growth being better than the rest of the world really due to the fiscal tailwinds,” said Sunitha Thomas, regional portfolio manager for  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management.
The dollar surged against other major currencies starting in the second quarter, and investors said the greenback's path will be an important factor determining relative equity performance.
The dollar's gains aided U.S. equity fund returns against international funds, which required a costly translation into the greenback, investors said. 
The dollar's strength weighed on emerging markets, where debt costs have increased and weaker currencies sparked an investor retreat. Emerging market stocks overall have particularly lagged this year, declining 6 percent.
""All of these fundamental factors in emerging markets were triggered by the stronger U.S. dollar that were not good for economic momentum in those countries,” Thomas said. 
ROSY EARNINGS
S&P 500 profits are expected to surge 22.7 percent this year against an 8.5 percent rise for companies in Europe's Stoxx, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, but the benefits from a cut in corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent will wane next year.
Expectations for economic growth in Europe and Asia appear more realistic, after being too high before, said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).
“It really takes some very strong U.S. economic momentum, maybe even better than what’s expected today, to see a repeat of what we saw in the first half,” Kleintop said, adding it wouldn't surprise him if there wasn't a major performance difference for the rest of the year.
Any resolution of tensions between the United States and its trade partners resulting in more free trade stands to benefit stocks globally. But trade disputes have weighed more on non-U.S. markets, investors said, so those could be poised for a greater rebound.

“If trade simmers down, that’s disproportionately positive for international” markets, said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2018 01:07AM ET</span>",Exclusive: BMW to raise prices of two U.S.-made SUV models in China,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) said it will raise the prices of two U.S.-made crossover sport-utility vehicles in China to cope with the additional cost of tariffs on U.S. car imports into the world's biggest auto market.
In a move due to take effect on Monday, BMW said in a statement to Reuters over the weekend that it will increase maker-suggested retail prices of the popular, relatively high-margin X5 and X6 SUV models by 4 percent to 7 percent. 
The rates of increase suggest that BMW is willing to absorb much of the higher costs stemming from bringing the SUVs to China from its factory in South Carolina, underscoring the fierce competition among luxury car brands in China. 
BMW's move comes after China imposed new tariffs earlier this month on about $34 billion of U.S. imports, from soybeans and cars to lobsters, as part of a widening trade row.
Beijing, which this year cut tariffs on all automobiles imported into China, slapped an additional 25 percent levy on U.S.-made cars as of July 6. As a result, China now levies a 40 percent import duty on all cars imported from the United States. 
""BMW stands for free (trade) but can't stand still without taking actions to respond to the market changes,"" a BMW spokeswoman said in an email message to Reuters.
BMW imports X4, X5 and X6 crossover SUV models from the United States for sale in China where demand for SUVs has been booming. Last year, the German automaker shipped more than 100,000 vehicles from the United States to China. 
The company made no reference to pricing of its X4 model.
BMW's decision to absorb much of the impact of the higher tariffs echoes an earlier move by U.S. carmaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), which said it would not increase its prices for now in an effort to sustain its business momentum.
China-based car dealers told Reuters that German rival Mercedes Benz, operated by  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), moderately raised the price in mid-July of its GLE, a sporty midsize SUV produced in the state of Alabama, in China.
A Daimler spokeswoman referred Reuters to comments made by the company last week.
Daimler's chief executive Dieter Zetsche said last Thursday the car maker was looking at ways to mitigate the impact of the trade war. This would include a review of whether to shift some U.S. production to China. 

Daimler also said last week its 2018 pre-tax profits would fall from last year because the new Chinese import tariffs would hurt sales of Mercedes-Benz SUVs.

The newspaper, citing unnamed industry sources, said internal discussions were at an early stage and no change was likely imminently.
However, the sale of a stake in the airline - possibly to Chinese conglomerate Fosun (HK:0656), an existing 12 percent shareholder in the group - would make it easier for both the travel business and the airline to expand, the newspaper said.
A Thomas Cook spokesman told the newspaper that the company had previously said it was open to industry consolidation but that it had ""no current plans"" to sell its airline.
Thomas Cook said in May that it was on track to meet analysts' expectations of a 7 percent rise in its post-operating profit to 352 million pounds ($461 million) for the 12 months to Sept. 30, on a constant currency basis.

Airline bookings rose 18 percent in the first half of its financial year, boosted by the collapse of German and British rivals Air Berlin and Monarch.

Leumi said in a statement on Saturday it would receive 2 billion shekels for its 80 percent stake, and that real estate developer Azrieli had agreed to sell its 20 percent stake.
Israel's Harel Insurance Investments and Financial Services (TA:HARL) said it was lending Warburg Pincus 850 million shekels for the purchase.
The Bank of Israel said it would begin an examination into Warburg Pincus and its business plan before the deal could move forward, a process it estimated would take about four months.
In a bid to increase competition, regulators have instructed Israel's top two banks sell off their credit card companies.
Leumi's main rival,  Bank Hapoalim  (TA:POLI), last month submitted an initial prospectus with Israel’s securities regulator for a possible initial public offering of its Isracard credit card unit that also includes other sale options.

Leumi said that Warburg Pincus, which manages $45 billion in assets, will pay 1.05 billion shekels upon completion of the deal, a further 342 million shekels a year later, and the remaining amount after two years.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 08:27PM ET</span>","City Council aims to make New York first U.S. city to cap Uber, others","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City is moving toward becoming the first major U.S. municipality to cap ride-sharing services, sparking a tsunami of protest on Friday from Uber [UBER.UL] and others, which warned that those living in far-flung neighborhoods will suffer most.
The City Council is considering five bills aimed primarily at reducing traffic congestion and increasing driver paychecks in the wake of explosive growth of for-hire vehicles and a rash of suicides among financially challenged yellow taxi drivers. 
""We are pausing the issuance of new licenses in an industry that has been operating without checks,” Council Speaker Corey Johnson told reporters on Friday. 
The council's move to vote on the measures as soon as Aug. 8 is the city's second try to restrain an industry that has grown exponentially since Mayor Bill de Blasio's failed 2015 attempt to rein it in.
Resurrection of the effort in New York - Uber's largest U.S. market - outraged ride-hailing businesses, including Uber, Lyft and Via. 
In an email barrage to nearly 5 million New Yorkers on Friday, Uber said riders would be hurt most by the squeeze, facing higher prices, longer wait times and less service in the city's outer reaches by drivers more heavily dependent on higher demand in Manhattan, only adding to, rather than reducing, congestion.
""@NYCCouncil I'm a New Yorker, and I rely on @Uber to get around the city, especially when public transit isn't available. Don't leave me stranded and #DontStrandNYC,"" tweeted thousands of New Yorkers, some using a link provided in the Uber email. 
Since Uber and other app-based services debuted in New York City about five years ago, the industry has grown to more than 100,000 cars, according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission. At the same time, less demand for New York's iconic yellow cabs has decimated that one-time route to middle-class income.
Six struggling professional drivers - including three yellow cab drivers - have killed themselves in recent months.
The New York Taxi Workers Alliance cheered the City Council's pledge to move ahead with the bills.
The impending New York City limits come amid a worldwide effort to crack down on ride-hailing companies, including a move by Honolulu's city council to cap fares charged when demand spikes.

London, in a test of Uber's new senior management, in June, issued a probationary license to operate as long as Uber can show it has improved on safety and other concerns.

(Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS), a shareholder advisory firm whose recommendations are followed by major mutual funds, said on Friday that  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD) investors should vote down its $24 billion merger with Albertsons Cos.
The ISS report is a blow to grocery chain Albertsons and its majority owner, private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, which are hoping that acquiring Rite Aid, a drug retailer, will help win new business amid pressure from retail giants Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
""It does not appear that Rite Aid shareholders would receive a fair ownership interest in the combined company, a concern heightened by potential conflicts of interest during the negotiation process and apparently reflected in the company's underperformance since announcement,"" the ISS report said.
Rite Aid spokeswoman Ashley Flower said in a statement that the company strongly disagrees with ISS's recommendation. The deal ""will significantly improve Rite Aid’s growth prospects, financial strength and ability to deliver compelling long-term value for shareholders,"" she said.
Representatives for Cerberus and Albertsons did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ISS peer Glass Lewis has also recommended that Rite Aid shareholders vote against the deal.
Rite Aid shareholders would get 30 percent of the combined company under the terms of the agreements with Albertsons. They are scheduled to vote on the deal on Aug. 9.
The company formed by combining Albertsons and Rite Aid will operate about 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington, D.C., serving more than 40 million customers per week, the companies said at the time of the deal.
Most Albertsons Companies pharmacies would be rebranded as Rite Aid, and the company would continue to operate Rite Aid stand-alone pharmacies.

In early June, Highfields Capital Management, which is Rite Aid’s fourth-largest shareholder, owning 4.4 percent of Rite Aid’s outstanding shares, came out in opposition to the deal while a number of individual shareholders have also rallied against the deal's proposed form.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg were sued on Friday in what could be the first of many lawsuits over a disappointing earnings announcement by the social media company that wiped out about $120 billion of shareholder wealth.
The complaint filed by shareholder James Kacouris in Manhattan federal court accused Facebook, Zuckerberg and Chief Financial Officer David Wehner of making misleading statements about or failing to disclose slowing revenue growth, falling operating margins, and declines in active users.
Kacouris said the marketplace was ""shocked"" when ""the truth"" began to emerge on Wednesday from the Menlo Park, California-based company. He said the 19 percent plunge in Facebook shares the next day stemmed from federal securities law violations by the defendants.
The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified damages. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Shareholders often sue companies in the United States after unexpected stock price declines, especially if the loss of wealth is large. 
Facebook has faced dozens of lawsuits over its handling of user data in a scandal also concerning the U.K. firm Cambridge Analytica. Many have been consolidated in the federal court in San Francisco.
Thursday's plunge also hit Zuckerberg's bottom line.
Zuckerberg had been tied with Warren Buffett as the world's fourth-richest person, but the  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) chairman's current $83 billion fortune tops Zuckerberg's $66 billion, Forbes magazine said.
Buffett now ranks third among the world's billionaires, while Zuckerberg is sixth.
Facebook shares fell another 0.8 percent on Friday, closing at $174.89 on the Nasdaq.

The case is Kacouris v Facebook Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-06765.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) bond investor Rick Rieder halved exposure in recent months to a once-major bet in his portfolios on emerging markets on concerns including that the dollar could move higher, he told Reuters on Friday.
""I still would argue volatility is going to be higher, the dollar could potentially continue to grind higher,"" said Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income.
""It's just prudent to run a smaller exposure.""
Rieder cut emerging markets to just 7 percent of the $35.7 billion Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (O:BASIX) he manages at the end of June, from 17 percent in February, according to periodic disclosures on the company's website.
He said the shift down in emerging markets exposure comes as liquidity drains out of the bond markets and with the U.S. Federal Reserve and poised, he said, to stop reducing its bond holdings and to signal a move toward the end of that balance-sheet reduction policy as soon as September.
The dollar (DXY) has gained 3 percent this year against its major trading partners, driven by strong U.S. economic data, rising interest rates and the possibility that a trade war could cause inflationary pressures and reduce the trade deficit of the world's largest economy.
The trade rift, strong dollar and other factors have conspired to make life more difficult for emerging markets from China to Turkey and Brazil.
U.S. bond yields are likely to ""grind"" a bit higher from where they are now, Rieder said, if for no other reason than because inflation is moving higher.
BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, overseeing $6.3 trillion in stocks, bonds and other investments.

Low-fee shares of Rieder's Strategic Income Opportunities Fund are up 1.6 percent over one year, a bit ahead of its average peer, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.30%. The S&P 500 fell 0.66%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 1.46%.
A second-straight day of selling was seen in tech, dragging the broader market lower. Twitter and Intel stocks tumbled after their quarterly numbers failed to impress investors.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock fell 20.54% after the social media company's in-line earnings and above-consensus revenue was overshadowed by monthly active users (MAUs) growth that fell short of consensus and weak earnings guidance.
Twitter added 335 million MAUs in the second quarter, but that was short of the 338.5 million MAUs analysts had forecast.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock fell 8.6%. The chipmaker posted an earnings beat on both the top and bottom lines, but said it was delaying the launch of its next-generation chips, raising fears that rival, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), could gain market share.
The slump in both Twitter and Intel more than offset modest gains in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock after it posted above-consensus earnings on Thursday.
Falling tech stocks dominated market direction, even as investors cheered data showing the U.S. economy remained on solid footing. But analysts warned that the pace of growth may not last.
Gross domestic product increased at a 4.1% annual rate in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said Friday in its first estimate, in line with economists' forecast.
""While we expect the economy to remain strong in the near term, we see growth slowing sometime next year as fiscal stimulus fades and tighter monetary conditions begin to bite,"" BNP Paribas said in a note to clients Friday.
Sentiment on equities was also soured by a fall in energy stocks as oil prices settled sharply lower Friday and as investors digested disappointing earnings from oil majors who struggled to match the rally in oil prices.

(Reuters) - U.S. broadcasting and media company CBS Corp (N:CBS) said on Friday it was investigating allegations of personal misconduct by its chief executive Leslie Moonves ahead of an upcoming New Yorker article that is expected to detail the claims.
The claims against Moonves involve incidents that go back, in part, more than 20 years, the Hollywood Reporter said earlier on Friday, citing sources with knowledge of the matter and the New Yorker magazine story who it did not identify.
""Upon the conclusion of that investigation, which involves recently reported allegations that go back several decades, the board will promptly review the findings and take appropriate action,"" CBS said in a statement. 
It was not clear when exactly the New Yorker would publish its story or what its contents would be. Moonves and the New Yorker did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ronan Farrow, the author of the possible story, tweeted late Friday that he does not comment on work that has not been published yet.
""If you’re reading about my work from secondary sources you're often not getting the full or correct story,"" Farrow said on Twitter. 
The allegations come as Moonves is locked in a battle over control of CBS with the company's largest shareholder, National Amusements Inc, owned by Shari Redstone and her father Sumner Redstone who proposed merging CBS with media company Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), also owned by National Amusements.
Viacom declined to comment on the claims against Moonves.
""The timing of this report comes in the midst of the company's very public legal dispute,"" the CBS statement added. ""While that litigation process continues, the CBS management team has the full support of the independent board members"" CBS added.""
A spokeswoman for National Amusements Inc said, ""(Shari) Redstone hopes that the investigation of these allegations is thorough, open and transparent.""
Moonves clashed with Redstone earlier this year over her bid to merge CBS with Viacom. Moonves resisted that deal because he believed CBS's prospects were better without taking on Viacom's turnaround challenges. 
A CBS board committee in May turned down the potential merger with Viacom and sued to strip National Amusements of its control of CBS. 
Viacom shares jumped 5 percent to $29.35 on Friday, while CBS shares fell more than 6 percent to $54.01, as investors speculated that the chances of a merger had increased. 
Combining CBS, which owns cable networks including Showtime as well as the CBS TV Network and CBS TV Studios, with Viacom, whose businesses include Paramount Pictures, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV, would have more negotiating leverage with cable and satellite companies, analysts said.
Moonves, 68, joined CBS as an entertainment president in 1995 and has been CEO since 2006. He is widely credited with turning CBS into one of the top-performing U.S. media companies.
Moonves has been married to CBS news anchor and presenter Julie Chen since 2004.
Multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against politicians, business leaders and entertainers in the U.S. have been made in the past year, leading to resignations, often inspired by the #MeToo social movement.

307,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Factbox: Dollar impact on U.S. corporate results and outlooks,"(Reuters) - A rapid rise in the dollar has hurt second-quarter financial results for many U.S.-based multi-national companies, and some companies are warning that the pressure could persist in future quarters. 
The U.S. dollar has risen 2.7 percent so far this year (DXY) against a basket major currencies, with most of the gains coming in the second quarter. As a result, companies have been reevaluating their currency hedging strategies. 
Here are some of the U.S. companies blaming the stronger greenback for weaker revenue or profits:
- Auto parts supplier Tenneco Inc (N:TEN) said on Friday that currency could cut roughly 2 percent of its third-quarter revenue based on exchange rates as of June 30.
-  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said on Wednesday that currency - a tailwind in the last several quarters - would be a ""slight headwind"" in the second half of the year.
- Tupperware (N:TUP) said second-quarter diluted earnings per share fell to $1.17 from $1.21 in the year-ago quarter, including a hit of 6 cents a share from currency fluctuations and it cited currency as a factor in its 2018 guidance.
- Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) said last week that current-quarter operating profit margins would be narrower than previously expected because of strength in the U.S. dollar. Most of Netflix' growth comes from overseas, but the majority of its costs remain dollar-denominated.
- Illinois Tool Works Inc (N:ITW) saw its shares tumble Monday after it slashed its full-year outlook, citing the strong dollar. It forecast a 12-cent per share negative currency impact compared with its previous forecast for the second half of the year and set 2018 full-year EPS guidance in a range of $7.50 to $7.70 per share, down from its previous target range of $7.60 to $7.80 per share, issued in April
- Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) lowered its full-year 2018 forecast for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $6.60 to $6.80 from a previous $6.90 to $7.20, citing a stronger dollar along with higher commodity prices.
- EBay Inc (O:EBAY) said on July 18 it expects the strong dollar to hit revenue by $150 million for the full year, and it cut its full-year revenue forecast to a range of $10.75 billion to $10.85 billion, from $10.9 billion to $11.1 billion.
- Omnicom Group Inc (N:OMC), already hurt by shifts in spending by U.S. clients, warned on July 17 that the strong dollar would hurt revenue by 1 percent in the third and fourth quarters this year.
-  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) said on June 19 it expects exchange rates to shave 1 percent off its current-quarter revenue. 
- Cruise operator Carnival Corp (N:CCL) said on June 25 that exchange rates and fuel price increases would eat into 2018 adjusted earnings per share, currently expected to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.25. {nPn1HQfw0a]

-  Akamai Technologies Inc  (O:AKAM) on June 26 cited a stronger U.S. dollar when it cut the upper end of its target range for second-quarter adjusted profit and revenue. The company, due to report results on July 31, said it expects adjusted profit of between 79 cents and 81 cents per share, cutting the high end of the range from 83 cents per share. It now expects revenue between $658 million and $663 million, cutting the high-end of the range from $670 million.

(Reuters) - The New York State Public Service Commission said on Friday it revoked its approval of the 2016 merger agreement between  Charter Communications  Inc (O:CHTR) and Time Warner Cable, saying Charter failed to build out its network for enough homes and that the company must end its operations in the state.
The commission said the U.S. broadband provider failed to live up to its agreement as part of the merger to build internet access to an additional 145,000 households and businesses in rural areas of New York under-served by internet providers.
Charter said in a statement that its Spectrum internet brand ""has extended the reach of our advanced broadband network to more than 86,000 New York homes and businesses since our merger agreement"" with the Public Service Commission, and is working to deliver broadband to more New Yorkers.
The commission said it will begin a special proceeding or action in the New York State Supreme Court to seek penalties for Charter's violations.
Charter has 30 days to appeal the commission's decision to revoke its agreement to the merger.
A Charter spokesman did not respond to requests for further comment.
""The Company has had multiple opportunities to correct these issues and either has not done so or has been openly brazen in its efforts to avoid them,"" the commission said. 
The commission gave the company two months to find a new cable provider to replace its operations.

310,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",U.S. appeals court to reconsider Hyundai-Kia gas mileage settlement,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court will reconsider its decision to throw out a $210 million nationwide class-action settlement for owners of  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) vehicles whose fuel economy was inflated.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Friday said a Jan. 23 decision by a three-judge panel to decertify the 2013 settlement was no longer precedent, and an 11-judge panel will review the matter.
No explanation was given, and no timetable was set for the so-called ""en banc"" rehearing.
Hyundai said in a statement that it ""continues to support the nationwide class action settlement"" and is pleased there will be a rehearing. Kia said in a separate statement that it ""appreciated the opportunity"" to have the case reheard.
The settlement came after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found flaws in Hyundai's and Kia's testing procedures, and the automakers lowered their fuel efficiency estimates for about 900,000 vehicles in the 2011, 2012 and 2013 model years.
In the January decision, a 2-1 majority said a lower court judge failed to assess whether differences in state laws prevented certification of a nationwide class, and therefore approval of the settlement.
It also said owners of used cars should not have been part of the settlement because it was unclear whether they relied on the automakers' fuel efficiency claims.
The $210 million figure represented the estimated lump sum payout available to the proposed class members, the court said. Some objectors said the accord undervalued their claims.
In dissent, Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen said the majority ignored legal precedents, and wrongly dealt a ""major blow to multistate class actions"" by requiring class-action lawyers or judges to survey the laws of all 50 states before certifying nationwide classes in cases with state law claims.
Hyundai and Kia lawyers said in court papers requesting a rehearing that requiring such ""procedural formalism"" would sow confusion and ""obstruct fair and efficient resolution of class actions through this nation's most active class action circuit.""
The 9th Circuit covers nine western U.S. states, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
It was where Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) in 2013 completed a $1.1 billion class-action settlement of claims that its vehicles accelerated without warning.

The case is In re Hyundai and Kia Fuel Economy Litigation, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 15-56014, 15-56025, 15-56059, 15-56061, 15-56064, 15-56067.

311,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 03:45PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Facebook's Plunge Sets a Record
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) sent a huge tremor through tech stocks this week with a worrying warning about revenue that sent the stock spiraling to a record-setting market-cap loss.
Shares of Facebook sank nearly 19% on Thursday, slashing the company’s value by about $120 billion. That was the largest single-day loss in market cap in Wall Street history.
Revenue missed expectations, but it was the conference call that really spooked investors.
“Looking beyond 2018, we anticipate the total expense growth will exceed revenue growth in 2019,” CFO Dave Wehner said on the conference call. “Over the next several years, we would anticipate that our operating margins will trend toward the mid-30s on a percentage basis.”
Facebook also predicted its total revenue growth rate would continue to decelerate in the third and fourth quarters.
2. Twitter’s Platform Health Hurts Stock
Just a day after Facebook’s drop, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) caused its own shockwaves in the social media space.
The stock tumbled more than 20% on Friday after the company reported a surprise drop in average monthly users.
Average monthly users dropped to 335 million from 336 million in the first quarter, due to deletion of fake accounts and bots, or, as the company put it, “prioritizing the health of the platform.”
Shares of Twitter had wavered earlier in the week after President Donald Trump accused the company of shadow banning Republicans (effectively making the user impossible to find). The company responded that it does not shadow ban in any cases.



3. GDP Hits Strongest Level Since 2014
The latest measure of U.S. economic growth came in right in line with what Wall Street was expecting. GDP grew 4.1% in the second quarter, its strongest reading since the third quarter of 2014.
Strategists noted, though, that 4% of the growth came from personal consumption. That would be heavy lifting for the consumer to continue to prop up overall growth in the future. Growth may also have received a bump from foreign countries raking in supplies ahead of expected tariff implementation.
With respect to Federal Reserve policy, the numbers support the Fed’s current plan of gradual interest rate hikes.
Fed fund futures continued to price in a rate hike in September and the probability for a hike in December was last at 68.9%, compared to 69.5% before the release.
4. Oil Ends Higher as Supply Worries Persist
Crude oil prices ended the week slightly lower after a selloff Friday. But supply concerns remained front of mind for traders.
Data released this past week showed that crude oil inventories fell to their lowest level since 2015 as exports jumped and imports fell sharply.
Also, Saudi Arabia temporarily paused shipments through the Bab el-Mandeb strait, which joins the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, after two of its oil tankers were reportedly attacked by Houthi rebels.
The disruptions in the Middle East come as market participants continue to bet on further disruptions in oil flows underpinning oil prices.
""The potential for further disruptions remains high in Libya, Venezuela and Nigeria with last week seeing new disruptions in Norway and Iraq, and Saudi has little incentive to let inventories rise,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients Thursday.
5. Trade Tensions Ease, Between U.S. and the EU at Least
The market’s trade-war worries may have hit an inflection point this past week.
Trump proclaimed the United States and the European Union had launched a ""new phase"" in their relationship following a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday.
The leaders pledged to expand European imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas and soybeans and both vowed to lower industrial tariffs.
They also agreed to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the two sides launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers, as well as re-examine U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory duties imposed by the EU “in due course.”
The upbeat remarks helped ease some of the fears of a transatlantic trade war. But there is still China to consider.
China said Thursday it was ready to retaliate against any increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports -- be it $16 billion or $200 billion -- an official in Beijing said, according to Bloomberg."
312,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Hammerson overhaul plan fails to quell investor worries over strategy,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Hammerson's (L:HMSO) plan to offload property assets and buy back shares has failed to assuage investor unease over the British shopping center owner's strategy following its decision to spurn a 5 billion-pound ($6.6 billion) takeover by rival  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM) earlier this year.
The property group on Tuesday said it would sell 1.1 billion pounds of assets, including its 13 out-of-town retail parks, by the end of 2019, buy back up to 300 million pounds of shares, and save at least 7 million pounds of costs a year.
But two large shareholders in  Hammerson  told Reuters on Friday that they did not believe the overhaul proposed by the owner of Birmingham's Bullring shopping center would be enough to lift its share price close to 635 pence, which was the level of French firm Klepierre's final unsuccessful cash-and-paper bid for the London-listed group. 
Hammerson stock closed at 509.8 pence on Friday and is down 3.1 percent since the company unveiled its new strategy. 
""On its own, no I don't think what they've announced is enough to meaningfully close the gap,"" said a top 20 Hammerson shareholder, adding that the company's plan was ""in the right direction"" but ""could have been a bit bolder"" and included more disposals.
A Hammerson spokesman declined to comment.
The investor also said that he had spoken to U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott, which has a near 5.3 percent stake in Hammerson, since the property group disclosed its revised strategy. 
According to the shareholder, Elliott had indicated to him that it too would have preferred Hammerson to have been more ambitious with its overhaul plan. A spokeswoman for Elliott declined to comment.
SHAREHOLDER PRESSURE
Hammerson, led by Chief Executive David Atkins, has had a turbulent year.
Shareholder pressure has been growing ever since last December, when Hammerson agreed a 3.4 billion-pound deal to buy rival shopping center group  Intu Properties  (L:INTUP), which rattled its investors and sent its shares tumbling. 
Shareholders were concerned the deal to buy the owner of Manchester's Trafford Centre would ramp up Hammerson's exposure to Britain's troubled retail sector, which has been hit in recent months by the collapse of a series of shop and restaurant chains. 
As investor worries mounted, Klepierre sought to gate-crash the Intu deal with a 615 pence-a-share bid for Hammerson in March, which was rejected.
The French group abandoned its takeover attempt in April after Hammerson spurned its second, 635 pence proposal. 
Hammerson then bowed to shareholder pressure and dropped the Intu deal the following week, when it also launched a strategic review.
""I don't think there were any big surprises in there,"" a top 10 shareholder said of Hammerson's new plan, adding that the strategy was ""unlikely"" to push Hammerson's shares back toward the level of Klepierre's second bid.
Hammerson's 10.6 billion-pound property portfolio encompasses Bristol's Cabot Circus and London's Brent Cross shopping centers, as well as stakes in premium outlets including Bicester Village in Oxfordshire.
By offloading all of its UK retail parks, Hammerson will tilt more toward Europe, where it already owns assets including stakes in premium outlets such as Milan's Fidenza Village and Barcelona's La Roca Village.
Britain's takeover rules mean that Klepierre is in the middle of a six-month ban on making a fresh unsolicited approach to Hammerson that started when it withdrew its interest in April.

(Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Friday awarded International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) $83 million in a patent dispute with e-commerce company  Groupon Inc  (O:GRPN).
A jury in Delaware said Groupon used IBM's patented e-commerce technology without authorization following a two-week trial.
"" IBM  invests nearly $6 billion annually in research and development, producing innovations for society,"" IBM spokesman Douglas Shelton said in a statement. ""We rely on our patents to protect our innovations. We are pleased by the jury's verdict.""
""We continue to believe that we do not infringe on any valid IBM patents,"" Groupon spokesman Bill Roberts said in a statement. ""To the extent these patents have any value at all — which we believe they do not — the value is far less than what the jury awarded.""
The jury said Groupon's infringement was willful, allowing IBM to ask a judge to award additional damages. 
IBM had sought $167 million in damages, saying it developed widely licensed technology crucial to the development of the internet. Two of the patents relate to Prodigy, IBM's late-1980s precursor to the web.
Groupon argued that some of IBM's patents should not have been granted because they describe obvious ideas, and said the computing company's damages request was unreasonable.
Armonk, New York-based IBM has secured more U.S. patents than any other company for the past 25 years. 
The case was closely watched in the technology industry because it offered a glimpse into IBM's efforts to license its large patent portfolio to other companies. 
An IBM licensing executive testified that Amazon Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), LinkedIn and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) have each paid IBM $20 million to $50 million as part of cross-licensing deals that gave them access to the patent portfolio.
In 2017 IBM generated about $1.2 billion in revenue from its licensing activities. 
During the trial Groupon lawyer J. David Hadden portrayed IBM as using outdated patents to squeeze money out of other tech companies with threats of litigation. 
IBM lawyer John Desmarais told jurors the company had no choice but to sue after Groupon refused to take responsibility for using IBM's foundational technology.

""The verdict is a vindication for IBM's licensing program,"" Desmarais said by phone.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Interactive Brokers increases margin requirement for Tesla,"(Reuters) - Interactive Brokers Group said on Friday it will increase margin requirements for clients making Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc bets due to recent volatility in shares of Elon Musk's electric car company. 
The electronic brokerage said it told clients in a memo on Thursday that it will raise its margin requirements to 30 percent for regular accounts, which typically have a 25 percent margin requirement, and to 20 percent for margin accounts, which typically have a 15 percent requirement.
Due to the change, which takes effect after the market close on Tuesday, July 31, clients making long or short Tesla bets through shares, options, futures or other means will need more cash in their accounts as collateral for any losses. 
Roughly 35.4 million Tesla shares, or 27.95 percent of its float, are currently sold short and the cost of borrowing Tesla shares has risen to 2.6 percent this year from less than 1 percent last year, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. 
Tesla short sellers are down $469 million for the year to date even after gains of $1.23 billion for July on a mark to market basis, according to S3. 
Tesla shares last traded down 2.8 percent on the day at $298.19 after Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Group money manager, told Bloomberg TV he is betting against Tesla due to negative cash flow. Eisman's bets against the housing market before the 2008 crisis were chronicled in Michael Lewis's 2010 book ""The Big Short.""
Tesla shares were on track for a 13 percent drop for July and have fallen 4.3 percent so far this year. 
The stock often swings wildly in either direction. While some investors have been betting heavily that there will be strong demand for Tesla cars, others have been skeptical due to concerns including cash needs, production problems and controversies surrounding Musk, Tesla's founder and chief executive. 

Tesla has reached a high of $373.73 so far in 2018 and a low of $244.59.

Wall Street will also watch out for the company's commentary on order backlog to assess the strength of global demand amid escalating trade tensions.
Analysts polled by Reuters, on average, expect the company's adjusted net profit to rise to $2.73 per share in the second quarter, from $1.49 per share a year ago. Net profit for the quarter is estimated to rise to $2.58 per share from $1.35 last year.
Deerfield, Illinois-based Caterpillar, which serves as a bellwether for global economic activity, has benefited from a humming global economy which is having its best run since 2011. After battling the longest downturn in its history, the company expects full-year 2018 profit to be the best ever.
Yet the stock has lost about 18 percent since January amid increasing trade frictions and mounting pressure on costs. The stock last month fell to its lowest level since late October before recovering modestly.
""The market has become very focused on the risk that the industrial cycle is starting to get weaker and even the broader economic cycle,"" Stephen Volkmann, an analyst with Jefferies, said on Wednesday. ""That seems to be the primary concern.""
The International Monetary Fund warned this month that worsening trade skirmishes could derail global economic recovery and depress medium-term growth prospects.
To be sure, Caterpillar is better placed than many companies to deal with the tariffs as its manufacturing footprint is spread across the globe. It also enjoys superior pricing power thanks to a robust global demand.
But the company said in April that its outstanding first-quarter performance was the ""high-water mark"" for the year as it would not have the same pricing power to pass on increased material costs.
To offset rising costs, it implemented price hikes on July 1. Still, analysts surveyed by Reuters expect cost of production to be higher than it was in the previous quarter.
President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have raised domestic prices, denting earnings of many manufacturers. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) on Wednesday cut its full-year profit forecast on higher metals costs, which also dented the earnings of Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR).

However, some companies like Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) have found a way to soften the blow on their profit margins.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers stepped up pressure on President Trump's pick to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, demanding more information on her role in the administration's immigration policies and her stance on consumer finance issues, according to letters seen by Reuters on Friday.
The requests for information filed with the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, Catherine Cortez Masto and Robert Menendez could delay Kathy Kraninger's confirmation as CFPB chief if it emerges she had a bigger role in the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy on immigration than she revealed during her confirmation hearing last week.
Kraninger, a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), fended off repeated attacks by Senate Democrats regarding her role in the policy that separated more than 2,000 children from their parents.
She told Congress she had no role in setting or developing that policy but that she had attended meetings relating to its implementation.
""You dodged questions about your involvement in the administration's policy to separate children from their parents at the [Mexico-U.S.] border, refusing to answer or using passive language to avoid describing your personal role,"" the senators wrote.
They demanded Kraninger further clarify the exact nature of her role, including a list of those meetings and who else attended. Under the confirmation process, Kraninger must provide a written response for the Congressional Record by July 31, a spokeswoman for the committee told Reuters on Friday.
Brown and Warren previously wrote to Kraninger in June to press her on the immigration issue but received no response.
In Tuesday's letters, the senators also probed Kraninger, who runs the financial regulation file at OMB, to clarify her position on an extensive range of consumer finance and enforcement issues. 
The CFPB was created after the 2007-2009 financial crisis to protect consumers from predatory lenders.
Republicans say the agency has overstepped its legal statute and are hoping Kraninger, who would take over from interim chief Mick Mulvaney, will continue to rein it in. Democrats and consumer advocates hope to defend it from being further weakened.
Kraninger and the OMB did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. The White House has previously said her extensive management experience in government makes her well-qualified for the role.

On Wednesday, two Washington-based consumer advocacy groups filed a lawsuit seeking details about Kraninger's work at OMB, including travel, pay and expenses she had incurred.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Loan market shrugs off prison financing protests,"By Kristen Haunss, Jonathan Schwarzberg and Yun Li
NEW YORK (LPC) - The U.S. leveraged loan market appeared to shrug off protests at the center of a national immigration debate that saw illegal immigrants separated from their children as advocates take aim at banks financing companies that run detention centers.  
Advocacy groups in New York gathered Wednesday near JP Morgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon’s apartment, calling on the bank to stop lending to private prison and immigration detention companies, according to the Center for Popular Democracy, one of the protest organizers.
Banks including JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) have extended more than a combined $2.5 billion of loans and other debt to the Boca Raton, Florida-based GEO Group and Nashville, Tennessee-based CoreCivic, operators of private prisons and detention centers.
Immigration is the subject of a heated national debate after President Donald Trump in April signed a memorandum ending the policy known as ‘catch and release,’ in which illegal immigrants were not held while awaiting a court hearing. 
Massive protests followed after children were separated from their parents at the border. Following a court order, the government said Thursday that around 1,400 of the approximately 2,500 children separated from their parents have been reunited with their families, Reuters reported. Advocates are now turning their attention to the banks backing detention centers.
“The Wall Street firms are in some ways hiding behind the veil,” said Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy. “Without these investments, these companies simply couldn’t operate.”
Despite the protests, GEO Group’s $792 million term loan has held steady, quoted at 99.75-100 cents on the dollar Thursday, unchanged from Tuesday, according to two sources. CoreCivic’s $200 million term loan is not widely quoted.         
“You do have categories of investments that are toxic,” said Richard Farley, chair of leveraged finance at law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel. “But I don’t see any evidence that the [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)] issue is anywhere near a level of toxicity where banks would be concerned with reputational risk.”
Dimon sent a message June 19 to all US JP Morgan employees saying the bank strongly supports U.S. immigration reform, noting the problems are “tearing apart our body politic and damaging our economy,” according to the memo.
He noted that the Business Roundtable, a group of US chief executive officers that he chairs, released a statement urging “the administration to end immediately the policy of separating accompanied minors from the parents. This practice is cruel and contrary to American values.”
JP Morgan helped finance both GEO Group and CoreCivic.  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), BAML,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), SunTrust and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) also led GEO Group’s financing, while a group including SunTrust, BAML and PNC joined JP Morgan in arranging CoreCivic’s credit facility, according to regulatory filings.
A JP Morgan spokesperson declined to comment.
Wells Fargo said it respects the seriousness of the country’s ongoing debate about immigration and the criminal justice system. “However, we do not as a corporation take positions on public policy issues that do not directly affect our company’s ability to serve customers and support team members,” a bank spokesperson said.
Spokespeople for other lenders either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.  
“It is understood that banks are largely comfortable with lending to the sector at this time, but many have ongoing review processes based on the publicity surrounding the issue,” a senior banker said.
A CoreCivic spokesperson did not respond to an email seeking comment. In June the company released a statement that says it does not enforce immigration laws or policies. It says that none of its facilities provides housing for children that are without parental supervision.
In an April lender presentation to cut its interest payments, GEO Group offered an industry overview of immigration enforcement, according to a source. It highlighted President Trump’s executive order to end ‘catch and release’ as well as additional government funding available for more detention beds.
Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday said GEO Group’s B1 corporate family rating reflects its solid liquidity position, stable operating performance and increased capital market access.
GEO Group is a long-standing service provider to the government and does not have a role in setting criminal justice or immigration policies and does not advocate for or against criminal justice or immigration enforcement and detention policies, a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. He said the facilities it manages on behalf of the federal government have never housed unaccompanied minors.
Last year, Moody’s revised GEO Group’s rating outlook to stable from negative and CoreCivic’s outlook to stable from negative after Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ February 2017 memorandum reversed the US Justice Department’s August 2016 plans to phase out its use of privately-operated prisons.

(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) shares fell 9 percent on Friday, after the chipmaker's upbeat results were overshadowed by concerns that Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) may be chiseling off market share from its high-margin data center business.
The company's profit and revenue beat Wall Street targets, but double-digit growth in its data center chip business fell short of analysts' expectations and disappointed investors.
""Intel stock continues to be under pressure as investors are looking past near term outperformance and struggling with the storyline of potential future share loss to AMD,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said.
AMD shares are up 8 percent at $19.88 in early trade. Intel shares were trading down at $47.61.
Intel was at the forefront of selling chips used in making servers where data is stored remotely or in so-called cloud servers. Over the past few years as more companies rushed to the cloud to move data online, Intel enjoyed healthy cloud revenue growth.
Amazon (O:AMZN), which beat profit estimates on Thursday due to its cloud business, and Microsoft (O:MSFT) have been the main beneficiaries of the cloud adoption.
Intel's Xeon server chips had dominated the market, but started facing competition last year following AMD's re-entry into the business after a decade with EPYC processors that earned positive reviews.
EPYC chips outperformed Xeon in certain tasks and provided better performance-per-dollar than what Intel chips offered, according to tests done by Anandtech after the launch last year.
AMD currently has a small share of the server business, but any gain will hamper Intel's plans to focus on data centers to diversify away from a stagnating PC business, where it is the market leader.
Intel has delayed the launch of its next-generation 10nm processors due to production woes, which could erode its market share further.
While AMD is already sampling its 7nm processors and will launch them later this year, Intel's 10nm chips will hit the market next year. 
""We see the stock as increasingly binary around their ability to hold off AMD in the data center,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said of Intel. ""We don't see the stock outperforming if AMD successfully takes 3-4 points of server market share in the next 2 quarters and gets to 10% by the end of next year.""

At least four brokerages cut their price targets on Intel stock, while six brokerages had raised their targets on AMD stock after its strong quarterly results earlier this week, mainly due to high demand for server chips.

The S&P 500 Index declined Friday, after the government said U.S. GDP grew by 4.1 percent at an annualized rate in the three months through June -- the biggest gain since 2014 and close to the median forecast of 4.2 percent in a Bloomberg survey. Speaking at the White House, President Donald Trump called the result “amazing” and said the growth is “very sustainable.”
Still, traders remained focused on earnings after Amazon’s strong results Thursday countered Facebook’s disappointing quarter, which led to a historic plunge for the social media Goliath. Most U.S. equity gauges were down Friday. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) led decliners in the S&P 500.
“It’s a continued reaction to earnings,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “The big thing with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is not what happened to the stock itself but what that means for the market. For the second time in a row, we saw two of the big tech stocks falter and investors are thinking, maybe the future isn’t quite as bright as we could’ve assumed.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index headed for its best week in almost two months as banks and telecommunications firms gained. West Texas intermediate crude dropped, while gold climbed.
The GDP data underscored the Federal Reserve’s policy path at a time when investors’ focus is returning to central banks. In Japan, reports suggested BOJ officials are debating ways to reduce the side-effects of their yield-curve control policy. The European Central Bank said Thursday that it will stick to its plan to end bond purchases and pledged to keep interest rates unchanged “at least through the summer of 2019.”

327,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 12:49PM ET</span>","Exxon Mobil, Chevron earnings miss Wall Street expectations","By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), two of the world's largest oil producers, reported quarterly profit on Friday that fell far short of Wall Street's expectations.
The disappointing results come as much of the U.S. oil industry has been recovering from a three-year downturn in the energy sector, bolstered by higher production and crude prices.
Exxon's troubles highlight ongoing issues the company has been having to boost operations, whereas Chevron's miss was fueled by a slight rise in expenses that likely will not be repeated, analysts said. 
Exxon shares fell 2.5 percent to $82.09 shortly after midday, while Chevron's recovered from an early drop and were up about 2 percent at $126.34. Both stocks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The results were particularly weak at Exxon, which has been trying to boost operations in a bid to revive a stock price trading at about the same level it was a decade ago.
""Exxon's definitely sticking out like a sore thumb right now,"" said Edward Jones energy analyst Brian Youngberg. ""It's just hard to find anything good in the quarter.""
Despite rising oil prices, Exxon's production dropped 7 percent and it spent more than $600 million to upgrade refineries in France, Canada, Texas and Saudi Arabia.
Exxon called the quarter a ""challenging"" one for its operations and ""well below market expectations."" 
Neil Chapman, an Exxon executive and member of the company's management committee, said he is ""not happy"" about the ongoing refinery maintenance, adding there is ""nothing systemic"" about the repairs that would reveal weakness in the refining division. 
""We are absolutely all over these reliability incidents,"" Chapman said on a conference call with investors.
Exxon earned 92 cents per share, while analysts expected earnings of $1.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
At Chevron, oil production rose 2 percent and profit spiked, but higher corporate expenses surprised Wall Street. Still, the company announced a $3 billion stock buyback program, long awaited by Wall Street.
""We believe annual share repurchases of $3 billion can be sustained over most reasonable price scenarios,"" Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told investors on a conference call.
Chevron earned $1.78 per share, while analysts expected $2.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), a key rival, posted second-quarter profit on Thursday far below forecasts due in part to weakness in refining. 

British oil major  BP  (LON:BP) Plc is set to report quarterly results next week. On Thursday it agreed to buy U.S. shale oil and gas assets from global miner BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) for $10.5 billion.

StanChart entered the DPA with the U.S. Department of Justice and New York County District Attorney's Office in December 2012, accepting that it had broken laws by processing payments for sanctions targets in countries including Iran, Burma, Sudan and Libya.
The bank avoided prosecution in exchange for a cash settlement of $327 million and an agreement with the U.S. authorities to improve its sanctions compliance.
""The group has taken a number of steps and made significant progress toward compliance with the requirements of the DPA and enhancing its sanctions compliance program,"" StanChart said in a statement. ""But that the program has not yet reached the standard required by the DPA.""
The DPA was extended for three years in 2014 and a further nine months in November 2017 as StanChart sought to strengthen its controls under the scrutiny of an independent monitor.
The bank is also being investigated over whether it continued to violate Iran-related sanctions after 2007.
""The agreement also indicates that the group continues to co-operate with an ongoing U.S. sanctions-related investigation, but that additional time is needed,"" StanChart said.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 12:46PM ET</span>","Twitter warns fake account purge to keep erasing users, shares drop 19 percent","By Meredith Mazzilli
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) on Friday said it lost 1 million monthly active users from the previous quarter and warned the closely watched figure could keep falling as it deletes more phony accounts, causing the biggest one-day decline in its shares since 2016. 
The company said the work it was doing to clean up Twitter by purging automated and spam accounts had some impact on user metrics in the second quarter, and that it was deciding to prioritize tackling suspicious accounts and reducing hate speech and other abusive content over projects that could attract more users. 
Allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election by spreading misleading or divisive content over social media have made the issue of improving control over accounts and content critical for Twitter.
Twitter, like bigger rival Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been under pressure from regulators in several countries to weed out hate speech, abusive content and misinformation, better protect user data and boost transparency on political ad spending.
The user outlook came as Twitter reported higher-than-expected revenue thanks to the FIFA World Cup, video ads and booming international ad revenue. Twitter also earns revenue from licensing its data. 
The quarter marked the first time overseas revenue contributed the majority of Twitter's ad sales. 
The World Cup brought in $30 million of revenue in the quarter. But Chief Financial Office Ned Segal told analysts that the event, which carried into the third quarter, raked in less revenue in its second two weeks. 
Twitter raised its 2018 capital spending forecast and said adjusted EBITDA margins in the third quarter would be below the second quarter's. 
Twitter shares tumbled 19 percent to $34.75 in afternoon trading, marking their biggest one-day drop since Oct. 6, 2016. 
The drop echoed that of Facebook on Thursday, when its shares ended down nearly 19 percent after the company said spending to improve privacy and slower user growth in big markets would hit margins for years.
The reaction in Twitter shares to the user outlook may be overblown, some analysts said.
Twitter executives answered questions on the earnings call by saying the steps to improve daily user and advertiser experience would be a long-term boost for the company, and that there had been no revenue hit. 
Revenue of $711 million rose 24 percent from last year and exceeded the average estimate of $696 million. 
Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in a statement that daily users grew 11 percent compared to a year ago, showing that addressing ""problem behaviors"" was turning the service into a daily utility. The company does not disclose daily users.
Segal said the efforts to improve accounts along with other factors had a negative hit to monthly active users of 3 million in the quarter, which compares with the 1 million net decline, but added that efforts to improve quality of the accounts would take an even bigger bite out of third-quarter monthly users. 
Twitter said in a blog post in early July that weeding out accounts would not hurt metrics because the accounts would mostly be inactive.
FEWER MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS
Monthly active users fell by 1 million in the second quarter from the first to 335 million. Analysts expected a gain of 1 million users, and the results could harden concerns Twitter lacks a clear strategy to fix platform problems and grow usage and revenue together.
""We are making active decisions to prioritize health initiatives over near-term product improvements that may drive more usage of Twitter as a daily utility,"" the company said in a shareholder letter. Twitter refers to platform “health” when describing the spam and other issues. 
Twitter said the decline in the third quarter would be in the mid-single-digit millions, suggesting a sequential decline to around 330 million users. Analysts had expected 340 million monthly active users in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Twitter’s relations with advertisers have been strained by concerns about phony accounts bought by users to boost their following.
Profit was $100 million, with a $42 million boost due to a tax benefit. Non-GAAP earnings of 17 cents per share were in-line with estimates.
""Investors are overreacting to (monthly active user) trends,"" BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said about the share fall. ""This is an identical overreaction that we saw in Q2 last year. Last year's Q2 created an incredible buying opportunity in the stock.""
Twitter said it lost some users due to the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe in May but did not note any revenue impact.
Twitter also saw usage fall after saying it would not subsidize messaging fees for users who accessed its app through text messages.
The new capital expenditures forecast is for between $450 million and $500 million, up from $375 million to $450 million, as Twitter expands and upgrades the computer infrastructure underlying its service. The company again flagged its push to increase headcount this year. 
Costs related to licensing video and automated analysis of user data increased overall expenses 10 percent compared with a year ago. 

Twitter has said increased video programming, including news shows and live sports, and investing in technology that automatically surfaces interesting content with limited user intervention should make the service appealing to first-timers.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 12:27PM ET</span>",Fox and Disney shareholders approve deal for entertainment assets,"By Sheila Dang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) said on Friday their shareholders voted to approve Disney's $71 billion purchase of Fox's film and television assets.
Results were announced at both companies' special shareholders' meetings, held in New York.
Shares of Fox were down slightly, by 0.3 percent to $45.25 in afternoon trading, while Disney shares were down 0.7 percent to $112.70. 
Disney was forced to sweeten its offer last month after Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), the largest U.S. cable company, made a $66 billion bid for Fox's well-known TV shows and movie franchises, including the ""X-Men"" and ""The Simpsons."" 
The bidding between Comcast and Disney was part of a bigger battle in the entertainment industry as media companies spend tens of billions of dollars on deals to compete with Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Last week, Comcast dropped its pursuit of Fox's film and television studios, cable networks and international TV businesses.
Disney's cash and stock offer has already received approval from U.S. regulators. In an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Disney, which owns sports network ESPN, said it would divest 22 of Fox's regional sports networks.
Disney still needs deal approval from more than a dozen countries, including China, Russia and regulators from the European Union.
Rupert Murdoch, who owns 17 percent of Fox's voting shares along with his family, could have faced a large capital gains tax bill under Comcast's all-cash offer.
Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network and its sports channels FS1, FS2, and the Big Ten Network into a newly listed company that it will spin off to its shareholders.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",Qualcomm CEO in the ring alone after U.S.-China spat kills deals,"By Stephen Nellis and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) Chief Executive Officer Steven Mollenkopf sought government help to block an acquisition of the U.S. chip maker on fears of China's technological ascendance, only to see his biggest deal thwarted by China.
Now the 49-year-old former electrical engineer is under investor pressure to show that he can go it alone.
Several Qualcomm shareholders interviewed by Reuters said they were willing to give Mollenkopf, who has been CEO since March 2014, only one to two more years to show he can diversify the company's business beyond the fiercely competitive mobile phone sector that now accounts for the vast majority of its business, and settle disputes with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
""Mollenkopf is in the 'show me' phase of his tenure. I think he has about two years,"" said Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management, which has 2 percent of its equity portfolio allocated to Qualcomm.
Mollenkopf faces the consequences of a bold gambit. Earlier this year, Qualcomm asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks, to review a $121 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm by rival Broadcom Ltd (O:AVGO). 
It was an unusual move, because typically only agreed deals are submitted for CFIUS review. If CFIUS took this up, it would be the U.S. government, not Qualcomm shareholders, that would decide its fate.
Qualcomm's maneuver worked. President Donald Trump blocked the deal in March, citing CFIUS's concerns over a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G wireless technology, even though Broadcom, which at the time was based in Singapore, was not a Chinese company.
Amid growing tensions with the United States over trade disputes, China responded by stalling on its antitrust review of Qualcomm's $44 billion acquisition of  NXP Semiconductors  NV (O:NXPI), which the two companies had agreed in October 2016. 
On Thursday, frustrated with Chinese regulators' seemingly endless delays, Qualcomm let the merger agreement with NXP expire and paid it a $2 billion breakup fee. NXP's strength in the automotive market had been expected to help Qualcomm reduce its dependence on the smartphone market.
Qualcomm now faces an uphill struggle in carrying out a transformative acquisition such as NXP in the near term, given that all major semiconductor peers have a footprint in China that would subject any acquisition to a China review.
Mollenkopf has acknowledged this, but told analysts on Wednesday that he believed big acquisitions would be possible again after this ""unusual window"" of trade tensions between the United States and China passed.
Without NXP, Mollenkopf will have to find ways to expand Qualcomm's chip offerings on its own into sectors such as automobiles, internet connectivity and network processing on its own, investors say.
""Qualcomm has a lot to prove and the markets are not giving it the benefit of the doubt,"" said Neuberger Berman associate portfolio manager Shawn Trudeau. Neuberger Berman's equity income fund (O:NBHAX) owns $10 million in Qualcomm stock and has been an investor in the company for close to three years.
A Qualcomm spokeswoman said the company's earnings demonstrated ""that the execution of the company has been very strong in a period of great distraction"" and that it had received positive feedback from investors from its standalone plan.
Mollenkopf has already faced questions internally about his leadership. In March, his predecessor, Paul Jacobs, stepped down from Qualcomm's board of directors to pursue a long-shot acquisition bid for Qualcomm, which has a market capitalization of $93 billion. His exit followed disagreements with Mollenkopf over his strategy, sources said at the time. Jacobs has yet to secure the funds to put together that offer.
Later in March, investor frustration spilled over into Qualcomm's annual shareholder meeting, when Mollenkopf was re-elected to the company's board with only 45 percent of the shares outstanding. Shareholder advisory firms such as Egan-Jones Proxy Services said that anything less than 80 to 90 percent of the vote would undermine the authority of Mollenkopf and other board directors.
Mollenkopf got a partial reprieve on Thursday, when Qualcomm shares closed up 7 percent, at $63.58, as investors cheered the $30 billion share buyback Qualcomm announced to make up for the loss of the NXP deal and celebrated the end of uncertainty. 
However, Qualcomm's stock is still below the roughly $76.00 level it was hovering at when Mollenkopf became CEO about 4-1-2/ years ago, and way below the $82-per-share offer from Broadcom that it rejected in February. Hal Eddins, chief economist at Qualcomm shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said this puts Mollenkopf under new pressure to improve performance.
""We obviously got caught up in something that was above us, so I don't know if I would conclude anything about our own business, our ability to invest [in China] or partner with Chinese companies,"" Mollenkopf told Reuters on Wednesday. 
SETTLING WITH APPLE
Mollenkopf's immediate challenge is meeting Qualcomm's goal for up to $7.50 in adjusted earnings per share by fiscal 2019, compared with $4.28 in fiscal 2017. That hinges on resolving its licensing disputes with Huawei and Apple, as well as continuing to diversify revenue.
Parts of Qualcomm's global court battle with Apple are expected to come to a head in the fall and early next year, while Qualcomm and Huawei remain in talks to try to resolve their dispute.
Only 13.4 percent of Qualcomm's $22.3 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017 was not tied to mobile phones. This year, Mollenkopf expects Qualcomm's non-mobile revenue to hit $5 billion, or about 22 percent of the $22 billion in overall revenue at the low end of the company's guidance.
Mollenkopf ""is on the clock for sure, and I'm not certain that the NXP buy would have changed that,"" Eddins said.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday as bumper earnings from Amazon lifted consumer discretionary stocks and data showed that the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years.
A Commerce Department report showed that gross domestic product increased at a 4.1 percent annualized rate in the second quarter as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs.
Amazon.com (O:AMZN) jumped as much as 4 percent to hit a record high of $1,880, the biggest boost to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.
The rise in the online retailer's shares also led the consumer discretionary sector (SPLRCD) 0.79 percent higher.
""At the end of the day, it really is about what is truly going on in the market and what is truly going on is earnings,"" said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
""There just seems to be a lot of evidence the economy is really humming right along. The only part of the economy that seems to be struggling is wages. But everything else, it is really hard to argue with.""
Earnings of S&P 500 companies are now expected to rise 22.6 percent in the second quarter, compared with an estimate of 20.7 percent as of July 1, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Only four of the 11 main S&P sectors were lower, with technology's 0.5 percent drop the steepest.
Intel's (O:INTC) 7.9 percent drop was the biggest drag on Wall Street's main indexes after its fast-growing data center business missed estimates.
Advanced Micro Devices (O:AMD), which is expected to have eaten into Intel's market share, was up 5.2 percent.

351,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Chesapeake's $2 Billion Shale Sale Boosts Investor Fervor,"(Bloomberg) -- Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK).’s agreement to sell shale assets in Ohio for about $2 billion boosted the natural gas producer’s shares as it moves to whittle down debt.
The deal announced Thursday with closely held Encino Acquisition Partners is Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler’s biggest in 3 1/2 years. After Chesapeake said almost all of the proceeds will be used to pay debt, its shares surged as much as 13 percent, the most in intraday trading since May 21.
America’s third-largest gas producer has seen rough times as prices for the heating and power-plant fuel plummeted. The company, once valued at almost $40 billion and now worth just one-tenth of that, has been punished by investors for a debt load amassed by late founder Aubrey McClendon.
The company has ""under-performed because of legacy debt, legacy complexity and heavy gas-weighting,"" Lawler said in a telephone interview. Now, it has ""transformed and is emerging as a very competitive growth story that no one expected would power through these difficult commodity price environments.""
The Utica Shale assets in Ohio was the best asset to divest, Lawler said. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
Encino is a 2017 creation of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and a Houston-based management team led by Hardy Murchison. The pension board plans to invest $1 billion into the partnership and own 98 percent of it, according to a separate statement.
Chesapeake will no longer look to asset sales in the future to shrink its ratio of debt to profit, Lawler said. Instead, he’s aiming to achieve that target by raising production.
Jettisoning the gas-rich Utica assets also will aid Lawler’s efforts to transform Chesapeake into a company focused predominantly on crude oil production. As of the end of 2017, more than 80 percent of the Oklahoma City-based explorer’s output was gas. Next year, he’s targeting 10 percent growth in the company’s oil production, according to the statement.
Lawler plans to boost crude output by focusing on the company’s “oil-growth engine”: The Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Daily net production from the area will more than double in 2019, according to the statement.
The sale also frees Chesapeake from almost $3 billion in pipeline contracts and related expenses, according to the statement.

352,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Trade War Threatens to Take Legs From Caterpillar Resurgence,"(Bloomberg) -- For  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT)., a bellwether of American industrial might, Donald Trump’s trade war is threatening to halt what was shaping up as a record year for profits.
Analysts have been predicting net income could reach an all-time high of $6.24 billion as expanding economies fuel robust demand for the manufacturer’s signature yellow diggers, bulldozers and dump trucks. But the shares had their worst first half since the recession of 2009, and they’ve been slow to rebound.
That’s because Caterpillar gets more than half its sales outside the U.S., and an escalating trade war is menacing global economic-growth prospects. Tensions have been high as Trump warned he could expand import tariffs that have already led to retaliatory duties by China, Mexico, Canada and Europe. Rising metal prices that have dented industrial profits could ensnare Caterpillar’s recovery.
“That’s the biggest risk,” said Larry De Maria, an analyst at William Blair & Co. “The trade war absolutely could have an impact and spill over into the global economy, and could have an impact on the strong cycle Caterpillar has seen in their end-markets generally.”
Revenue at Deerfield, Illinois-based Caterpillar is forecast to rise to $14 billion in the second quarter from $11.3 billion the same period a year earlier, based on the average of 13 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income was expected to rise to $2.59 a share from $1.35. The company reports on Monday.
Caterpillar has given investors a series of better-than-expected results after a downturn in commodities pulled sales lower for four straight years through 2016. The company went from the second-worst performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2015 to the second-best last year.
That string of earnings and sale surprises may be in danger of being snapped with the trade war. The International Monetary Fund warned that the friction is threatening to derail a global upswing that’s already losing momentum amid weaker growth in Europe and Japan. On Wednesday, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). cut its forecast for profit this year, in part because of surging prices for steel and aluminum after the U.S. slapped tariffs on the metals.
High Watermark
Higher costs for the steel Caterpillar purchases to make equipment could show up three to six months after U.S. tariffs are imposed on imports of the metal, Amy Campbell, director of investor relations, said in March after the U.S. announced the tariffs.
In its first-quarter earnings statement in April, Caterpillar lifted its 2018 profit projection amid a broadening recovery in mining and construction as well as fatter margins after years of cost cutting. But on the call that followed, the company said first-quarter adjusted profit per share “will be the high watermark for the year.”
“There’s been a lot more tariff discussion and the issue is out there, so I think that they have to discuss that within the context the ‘high watermark’ comment that scared people,” William Blair’s De Maria said. They’ll also have to explain what they’re seeing “in regard to global growth and how much tariffs may eventually impact global growth and how they manage those tariffs.”
Caterpillar was little changed at 10:01 a.m. in New York. The stock fell 14 percent in the first half of 2018.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As trade tensions escalate between Washington and Beijing, the U.S. Senate quietly passed legislation on Thursday that would lower trade barriers on hundreds of items made in China.
With no debate, the Senate unanimously passed a bill that would cut or eliminate tariffs on toasters, chemicals and roughly 1,660 other items made outside the United States.
Nearly half of those items are produced in China, according to a Reuters analysis of government records.
The United States and China, the world's two largest economies, are increasingly at loggerheads over trade. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a series of punitive tariffs on Chinese imports in a bid to halt a Chinese surge in high-technology industries that threatens to displace U.S. dominance. China has retaliated with its own duties on imports from the United States.
The White House has not publicly taken a position on the so-called miscellaneous tariff bill, which has now passed both the Senate and the House of Representatives unanimously. The two chambers need to resolve minor differences before they can send the legislation to Trump to sign into law.
Supporters of the bill have said it would boost the economy by getting rid of tariffs set up to protect industries that no longer exist in the United States. The National Association of Manufacturers has said U.S. businesses pay $1 million a day on such import duties.
""It makes no sense because it is a direct and punishing tax on making things in America and for creating jobs in America,"" the trade group's president, Jay Timmons, said in a prepared statement celebrating the bill's passage. 
Among the beneficiaries are companies that have moved production offshore. 
Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Co (N:HBB), for example, would pay reduced tariffs on Chinese-made toaster ovens, steam irons and other household appliances it used to make domestically.
Some domestic manufacturers have complained the bill would undercut their business by making it easier for rivals to bring in cheap foreign goods. They said the bill punished smaller firms that lack the ability to defend their interests in Washington. 
The version of the bill that passed the House in January included 145 items that are made domestically, according to a Reuters analysis. [L2N1QN00P]
""There's no reason to block opportunity U.S. manufacturers might have for rebuilding our manufacturing base,"" Michael Korchmar, the head of a family-owned travel goods company in Florida, said in a phone interview earlier this month.
Korchmar earlier this year planned to hire up to 30 workers in his Naples, Florida, factory, but he put those plans on hold after being told by Reuters that the bill would lower tariffs on an insulated food bag that he planned to produce. 
Korchmar said he may yet decide to expand production, because Democratic Senator Bill Nelson removed that item from the bill after Reuters wrote about it in March.

""We've got a good shot - we've lost a good bit of time and we have to re-evaluate the market,"" Korchmar said.

Exxon said the second quarter featured multiple refinery renovation projects, known as turnarounds, in France, Canada, Texas and Saudi Arabia.

The company plans to hold a conference call to discuss quarterly results on Friday morning.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 09:21AM ET</span>","Special Report: Spiders, sewage and fees - the other side of renting from Wall Street","By Michelle Conlin
ESPARTO, California (Reuters) - The rental home seemed so beautiful when McKayla Ferreira first laid eyes on it. The roof had three gables, fruit trees grew in the backyard, and the front porch gleamed with a fresh coat of paint. 
Then Ferreira moved in. 
First, she noticed water leaking through the bathroom and kitchen ceilings. Then she found a furry black mold spreading across the walls and raw sewage sluicing through the crawl space. Worst, to her, were the black widow spiders swarming her kitchen cupboards and linen closets. “Those spiders were so big you could hear them,” Ferreira said. “They sounded like fingernails scraping a table.”
Ferreira called her landlord,  Invitation Homes Inc  (N:INVH), a creation of private equity giant Blackstone Group LP (N:BX). The spiders were a “housekeeping issue,” the company representative told her, and she should “clean the place up.” Invitation Homes wasn’t enthusiastic about fixing the leaks, either. Two months passed before it sent someone to cut through the ceiling and fix the pipes, Ferreira said. Then the company took seven more months to patch it all up.
By the time the next tenants, Jennifer and Mike White, settled into the house on Craig Street, the spiders had been joined by colonies of roaches and ants, the couple said.
After Whitney Hurst and her family moved into the property last year, Hurst said, she immediately called in a work order for a long list of complaints, including leaky pipes, vermin and a broken garage door that nearly fell on her children. She said the repairman who showed up to fix one of the leaks told her that he didn’t have the right wrench for the job and to “have your husband fix it.”
“I have given up calling them,” Hurst said, sitting in a lawn chair in her driveway, while her two boys, ages 3 and 9, played hide-and-seek inside. “I mean, there are spiders in my kids’ toys.”
An Invitation Homes spokeswoman acknowledged that the house had some problems when Ferreira rented it, including roof and plumbing leaks and “a spider issue.” The company said it compensated Ferreira $887.30 for maintenance and utility billing issues caused by the plumbing leak, plus two weeks’ rent. It said its records show that other issues with subsequent tenants have been “minimal” – termites and a problem with the heating and cooling system – and that they were addressed.
Invitation Homes pitches itself as a singular landlord providing unprecedented ease and comfort for renters of its tens of thousands of single-family homes. But in interviews with scores of the company’s tenants in neighborhoods across the United States, the picture that emerges isn’t as much one of exceptional service as it is one of leaky pipes, vermin, toxic mold, nonfunctioning appliances and months-long waits for repairs.
Tenants also complain about excessive rent increases and fees that can add up to hundreds of dollars a year. In a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in May in the U.S. District Court for Northern California, renters accuse the company of “fee-stacking.” They allege that Invitation Homes charges tenants $95 if their rent is one minute late – even if the late payment is due to the company’s own nonfunctioning online payment portal – and then files an eviction notice to add more fees, penalties and legal costs if the tenant wants to stay in the home.
Invitation Homes filed a motion on July 20 to dismiss the case, saying the suit did not substantiate that the company’s fees were “unfair” and that the plaintiff lacked standing to assert the claims on behalf of tenants nationwide.
This is far from the alluring vision of life in a rental home that Invitation Homes has promoted since Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, built the company on the wreckage of the foreclosure crisis.
As a Blackstone vehicle, Invitation Homes led Wall Street’s charge into the single-family-home rental business, snapping up houses at fire-sale prices. After its merger last November with Starwood Waypoint Homes, another private-equity-backed foray into the market, Invitation Homes became the largest landlord of single-family homes in the United States by number of rental units.
Today, Invitation Homes manages 82,000 properties, most of them entry-level three- and four-bedroom houses in 17 metropolitan areas concentrated in the Sun Belt. Its portfolio – though still less than one percent of the overall single-family rental market – is 58 percent larger than that of its nearest competitor, American Homes 4 Rent.
PROMOTING THE GOOD LIFE
With its vast resources, Dallas, Texas-based Invitation Homes boasts that it has revolutionized the business of managing single-family rental homes and the experience of living in them. In a traditionally fusty mom-and-pop business, it says in marketing materials, it has created a uniquely “worry free” living environment that promises “peace of mind” with “exceptional resident services,” including “24/7 emergency maintenance.”
Chief Operating Officer Charles Young disputed tenant allegations of slumlord-like behavior. He noted that Invitation Homes serves hundreds of thousands of customers a year and that in internal company surveys, those tenants give the company 4.32 out of 5 stars. “From time to time, things happen,” Young said in an interview. “But when there’s an issue, we work hard to resolve it as quickly as we can.”
Affordable-housing advocates, real estate professionals and other critics of Wall Street’s push into the rental market say the tenant complaints suggest that rapid growth has stretched Invitation Homes’ ability to manage its properties. They also assert that there’s a deeper problem: Invitation Homes, like some of its Wall Street-backed peers, adheres to a business model that pressures it to lean hard on tenants to satisfy investors.
These companies have financed their growth by selling billions of dollars in bonds – the rental-market equivalent of the mortgage-backed securities that led to the financial crisis – to pension funds and other big institutions. Industry critics say that to keep payments to bond investors rolling, companies like Invitation Homes must minimize maintenance costs and maximize rents and fees.
“We see securitization of rental income as highly problematic,” said Kevin Stein, deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. Among other things, he said, it “pits Wall Street investors against Invitation tenants.”
Among those tenants is Contrell Wethersby in Atlanta, who told Reuters she had to go for more than a year without heat or a functioning refrigerator, stove, microwave or garage door – not to mention having to endure a leaky ceiling and black mold.
Invitation Homes said it is committed to operating in accordance with all federal, state and local housing laws. It said its records showed that Wethersby’s issues did not persist for any significant length of time and that work crews had trouble scheduling with her. The company did not provide its records for Wethersby or any other tenants.
Some renters, like Willie Jean Brister in Los Angeles, have seen their rent increase by as much as 50 percent over three years. During that time, Brister has filed work orders for an exterminator and repairs on a bathtub, faucets, bathroom door, cabinet doors, fence, hot water and garbage disposal – all of them reviewed by Reuters on the company’s web portal. The grandmother with five children in the house said the portal keeps saying “ ‘work completed,’ but the work is never completed. You get worn out, like you are paying all this rent and not getting any services.”
Others, like Heather Tolaro, said they and their children became ill from toxic mold in their houses. Tolaro sued Invitation Homes in federal court in Illinois, alleging that the company refused to acknowledge or fix the problem. The case was settled for undisclosed terms.
Rosa D’Amico said that after one heavy rain, she watched as water poured into her Chicago rental home, destroying much of her personal property. The house, stinking of sewage, was uninhabitable. Invitation Homes eventually agreed for D’Amico and her family to move to a different house, but she said she had to pay the $1,800 bill for the move. Then that house flooded.
“It was poop water, sewer water, so I had to throw everything out,” D’Amico said. “And they never paid me a penny.” She now lives in a rental nearby.
The company said it was pleased to continue to serve the Bristers. It said its records show that all the repairs Brister had requested were made, to which Brister responded: “They patch things, they don’t fix things.”
It declined to comment on Tolaro’s case, citing the confidential settlement. As for D’Amico, Invitation Homes confirmed that the first house “suffered water damage.” It described the problem with the second house as an “odor” resulting from dry traps in the sink, floor and laundry drains, all of which were “serviced.”
Invitation Homes went public in February 2017. Blackstone still owns a 42 percent stake, valued at $5.1 billion. Blackstone is now in the process of buying a majority stake in the financial-services division of Thomson Reuters Corp, owner of Reuters News, in a deal valued at $20 billion. The transaction is expected to close in late summer. Blackstone and its chief executive officer, Stephen Schwarzman, declined to comment for this article.
NO OTHER CHOICE
In the interview, Invitation Homes COO Young said that rather than putting the squeeze on renters, the company’s business model gives families the “optionality and freedom” to live in the kinds of good homes in good school districts near good jobs that they may not be able to afford to buy. “We are providing a housing option that didn’t exist before,” he said.
He rejected assertions that the company skimps on repairs and maintenance to support payouts to investors. “In the consumer business, we know things are not always spot on,” he said. “We ultimately are trying to do the right thing by our communities and for our residents to provide the service we can live up to.”
Young also reiterated the company’s assertion that its investments in renovations and property upkeep have helped foreclosure-ravaged neighborhoods recover, and that 70 percent of its tenants renew their leases.
At Reuters’ request, the company provided the names of five satisfied renters. Two responded, saying they were pleased with the company. One of them, Melissa Grant of Atlanta, said Invitation Homes was an “awesome company” for, among other things, making homes “available to families like me who are in the military and need to move around a lot.” The other three tenants did not respond to repeated phone messages.
Some tenants told Reuters they renewed not because they loved their rentals, but because they felt they had to: The company owns so much of the available housing in their neighborhoods that they had no alternatives if they wanted to keep their kids in the same school, or remain close to jobs or relatives. And moving itself is a big expense.
“You can’t just jump up and move with children,” Brister said.
While Invitation Homes’ portfolio represents less than one percent of single-family rental homes nationwide, the figure can be much higher in markets where the company’s inventory is concentrated. In some neighborhoods in California, for example, Invitation Homes owns as much as 25 percent of single-family rentals, according to an analysis of Census and property data by Maya Abood, a former researcher with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Urban Planning Program who co-authored a recent study titled “Wall Street Landlords Turn American Dream into American Nightmare.”
Invitation Homes has been raising rents by as much as an average of 10 percent a year in places like Oakland, California – nearly double the norm in that market – according to the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), an advocacy group. At the same time, the company has been adding to the types of fees it charges tenants – not just for late payments, but for things like rent paid on debit cards, which incurs a $30 charge.
Fees have helped lift earnings by 20 to 30 percent a year. In a recent earnings call, the company attributed rising profits in part to its “system” to “track resident delinquency on a daily basis.” This system allows the company to start charging fees and penalties the minute a tenant fails to pay on time.
The company’s stock price has risen about 11 percent since last year’s initial public offering. Wall Street analysts have almost uniformly rated the stock a “buy.”
Analysts’ optimism reflects, in part, that while scores of federal, state and local rules protect homebuyers when taking out a mortgage and renters in multi-unit apartment buildings, few protections exist for tenants of single-family homes, housing lawyers and affordable-housing advocates said.
“Allowing hedge funds and private equity firms to speculate on housing with little-to-no public oversight or regulation puts families at greater risk of unfair rent increases and evictions, and threatens the right to housing itself,” Abood said.
A December 2016 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta analysis found that Wall Street landlords are far more likely to file eviction notices than mom-and-pop landlords. It said Colony Starwood – as Starwood Waypoint was known until shortly before the merger with Invitation Homes – filed eviction notices on more than 30 percent of tenants, while Invitation Homes filed notices on nearly 15 percent. The strongest predictor of whether a tenant would get an eviction notice was if the tenant was African-American, the Atlanta Fed said.
The analysis didn’t specify which companies were responsible for the eviction notices disproportionately filed on African-Americans. Invitation Homes said it treats all residents equally. The company spokesperson noted that an eviction notice is a “procedural step” in a landlord’s effort to collect rent, and that “the vast majority of those who received eviction notices ultimately were resolved without the resident being put out of their home.”
In California, groups of Invitation Homes tenants, organized by ACCE, have stormed the offices of Blackstone three times to demand an end to what they say are the business’s worst practices, such as forgoing repairs and hiking rents.
Last October, more than three dozen renters of homes across Los Angeles burst through the front door of Blackstone’s headquarters in Santa Monica, shaking noisemakers, honking sirens and chanting through megaphones: “Hey, Blackstone, shame on you,” “Slumlord,” and, “You being evicted, Blackstone!”
Blackstone executives rushed out of the building through the emergency exits and the back door.
On office desks, the tenants left letters addressed to Blackstone CEO Schwarzman, asking for a moratorium on rent increases, an end to “outrageous fees,” proper maintenance on homes and a meeting with Blackstone executives.
After 20 minutes, security personnel threw them out.
An Invitation Homes spokesperson said the company got back to all the renters about their complaints.
Lupita Gonzalez, the ACCE organizer, said: “We never heard anything. We never heard back.” Reuters was able to contact four of the renters who participated in the October protest, all of whom said they never heard from the company.
KEEPING INVESTORS HAPPY
The business of being landlord of a single-family home was for years a small, local affair. But after the 2008 financial crisis, Wall Street saw an opportunity: Buy houses in bulk in “strike zones,” industry parlance for high foreclosure neighborhoods with good schools, well-maintained transportation systems and healthy job growth.
Then the firms could rent the properties to the kinds of families that would normally buy – householders who are on average 39 years old with young children and an average income of $100,000 or more. Today, nine big Wall Street firms collectively own more than 200,000 single-family homes in 13 states.
Invitation Homes says it spent an average of $200,000 per house to build its portfolio, and $22,000 each on renovations and repairs. To pay for all of that, it pioneered a new asset class, so-called single-family rental securities, or SFRs. Since 2013, Wall Street landlords have sold more than $15 billion of the bonds. As supply has tightened and prices risen in real estate markets, Invitation Homes has slowed expansion of its portfolio. Now, it largely rolls over existing bonds, paying investors out of rent and fees from tenants.
In September, the government-sponsored entity Fannie Mae lent its blessing to this new market, guaranteeing the refinancing on a $1 billion Invitation Homes rental-backed bond.
That imprimatur prompted more than 25 groups – affordable-housing advocates like the Community Home Lenders Association and rival business groups such as the National Association of Realtors – to complain to Fannie Mae’s overseer, the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), that the deal strayed from Fannie Mae’s stated mission of supporting home ownership. Invitation Homes’ business model, they said, risked pushing up rents and reducing the inventory of affordable homes.
Corinne Russell, spokesperson for the FHFA, said the agency had authorized such transactions to help Fannie Mae and its sibling agency, Freddie Mac, “understand the challenges and opportunities in the single-family rental market … and help FHFA assess what role, if any, the Enterprises should play in this market going forward.”
A spokesman for Fannie Mae said: “This transaction is a great opportunity to continue to serve the growing single-family rental market. Invitation Homes is a strong partner with deep experience managing a large volume of single-family rental properties.”
Just as Fannie Mae was lending its federally backed support to one of Invitation Homes’ bonds, regulators began looking into the securities.
At issue are the home valuations Invitation Homes relied on for its bonds. The higher the valuation, the higher the expected rent, and thus the more investors are willing to pay for the bonds.
To get a mortgage, homebuyers typically must have a licensed inspector conduct an appraisal of the house. To price its bonds, however, Invitation Homes relied on so-called broker price opinions, or BPOs. These less-expensive alternatives were provided mostly by outside firms using independent contractors who were not licensed appraisers.
Many of these contractors relied only on exterior views of the houses – no interior inspections – according to regulatory filings. The filings also indicate that the contractors were told to assume that the interiors had been remodeled to the standards advertised on the Invitation Homes website. Congress outlawed BPOs after the foreclosure crisis, but the ban doesn’t apply to institutional investors buying homes in bulk.
In September, Invitation Homes disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting documents and communications related to its securitizations. In its accompanying letter to Invitation Homes, the SEC said it was looking at the valuations the company relied on to price its bonds.
The SEC would not comment on the investigation, nor would Invitation Homes. In its regulatory filing, the company said: “The SEC letter indicates that its investigation is a fact-finding inquiry and does not mean that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person or security. We are cooperating with the SEC.”
A look inside the bond that Fannie Mae backed shows how Invitation Homes’ model is working. From each of the 7,204 houses bundled into the bond, the Fannie Mae prospectus shows, the company earned in 2016 an average monthly rent of $1,538 and $985 in annual “other income,” defined as fees for, among other things, “pets or cleaning.”
At the same time, the company spent an average of $1,142 a year on repairs, maintenance and turnover costs, based on the bond data. That’s less than the $3,100 a year Americans tend to spend on maintenance, repairs and improvements on houses of the same age as Invitation Homes’ portfolio, according to an analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Housing Survey by BTIG equity analyst Ryan Gilbert.
The company said the $1,142 figure is “not representative” because it doesn’t include the $750 the company reserves per home for capital expenditures should the property need a “major system replacement.”
Five former employees said Invitation Homes routinely didn’t spend enough on repairs or hire enough contractors to get the job done. One former maintenance contractor said that he oversaw 2,000 homes scattered across one metropolis and that he couldn’t possibly keep up.
On a recent tour the company provided for Reuters in Atlanta, executives walked through a newly renovated four-bedroom house in a development called Legacy Court, where tenants have access to tennis courts, a pool, pocket parks and a community center.
The executives led Reuters on what they said was their standard walk-through prior to every rental, entailing inspection of 250 items.  A maintenance manager checked every knob, outlet, spout, latch, doorstop, lightbulb, blind and appliance. He ran the dishwasher, filled the tub and tested the garbage disposal. “We test, touch and feel everything, fixture by fixture, before renting out the house,” he said.
STILL RENTING
Income from the house with the black widow spiders on Craig Street in Esparto, California, is in the Fannie Mae-backed bond.
The house had been owned by the same couple for nearly 10 years before they lost it to foreclosure in 2012. For five months, the house sat empty. Then, in September 2012, property records show, Fannie Mae sold it to Blackstone for $173,000.
The following year, McKayla Ferreira moved in. Around the time she began noticing the spiders and the sewage, Blackstone was packaging the house’s rental income into one of its bonds.
Though the Fannie Mae bond does not break out address-level data, Reuters was able to identify the Craig Street house by cross-referencing the bond’s data with local property records, sales documents and other information.
The bond notes that Invitation Homes spent $370 in 2016 on maintenance and repairs for the Craig Street house. The company said costs associated with the house should also include lease turnover expenses – what a landlord spends to prepare a house for a new renter – which added $2,703 to 2016 expenses.
Ferreira said she paid her rent on time, but Invitation Homes often claimed it never received the money and staple-gunned eviction notices to her front door. It insisted she pay a 10 percent late fee, plus other penalties, on her $1,300-a-month rent – or lose her lease. Ferreira would send canceled checks to the company, only to watch the same scenario unfold the following month. 
Invitation Homes acknowledged that when Ferreira was a tenant, the company was “in its infancy” and that some billing and receivables systems had “yet to be refined.” The company also said it reversed the charges and had established additional processes “to help prevent this from occurring in the future.”
Two subsequent renters said some billing errors continued. Invitation Homes said its records show no such issues.
All three families had hoped to save money while living on Craig Street for a down payment to buy a home. All said that fees and unexpected expenses ate into those savings.

Whitney Hurst and her family are still renting the house on Craig Street. The two previous tenants are renting from other landlords.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 08:43AM ET</span>",China's ZTE revises down first-quarter profit after factoring in U.S. supplier ban,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063) revised its first-quarter results to a net loss on Friday, after China's second-biggest telecommunications equipment maker took into account the impact of a crippling U.S. supplier ban that has now been lifted.
ZTE said net loss for the three months through March was 5.4 billion yuan ($790.62 million), compared to a net profit of 1.2 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 6.9 percent on year to 27.5 billion yuan.
The company will set up an export compliance committee with company Chairman Li Zixue as one of the five members, ZTE said in a filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange.
In April, ZTE posted a 39 percent rise in first-quarter profit, but said at the time it was difficult to assess the impact of the supplier ban, imposed in mid-April in relation to its violation of U.S. export restrictions.
ZTE, which makes smartphones and networking gear, said in its latest statement it expected to record a net loss for the first six months of the year due to the $1.4 billion it paid in penalties to have the ban lifted.
Earlier in July, ZTE estimated a first-half loss of 7.0 billion yuan to 9.0 billion yuan, versus a profit of 2.3 billion yuan a year earlier.
The U.S. government lifted ZTE's supplier ban after the firm deposited $400 million in a U.S. bank escrow account and paid a $1 billion penalty, as part of a settlement agreement.
The ban was imposed for reneging on an earlier settlement reached after ZTE was caught shipping U.S. technology to Iran and North Korea in violation of U.S. sanctions on those countries.
The ban forced ZTE to cease major operations as it relies on U.S. components for both its smartphones and networking gear.
ZTE this week said major business had resumed.
The ban had been a source of friction between the United States and Chinese governments at a time of escalating trade tension involving tit-for-tat tariffs.
Last week, U.S. lawmakers cut measures from a defense bill that would have reinstated sanctions on ZTE.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares rose worldwide on Friday as strong company earnings reports and as transatlantic trade tensions eased after an agreement between the United States and Europe this week.
The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent in London and was set for a sixth straight session of gains, a run not seen since February, and its fourth straight weekly gain.
European shares rose, with consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser, construction groups Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) and Vinci and bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) gaining after results, lifting the STOXX 600 0.4 percent. (EU)
European auto stocks extended to Thursday's gains.
Futures indicated a positive open on Wall Street.
Trade tensions had not disappeared altogether from investors' radars however. Chinese shares lagged an uptick in Asian shares, with the main Shanghai index down 0.4 percent on the day. Traders attributed this to a still-unresolved standoff between the U.S. and China on trade.
""To see the way markets reacted early yesterday...it was almost as if the EU and the U.S. were best buddies again,"" CMC Markets chief markets analyst Michael Hewson said. 
""Nothing could be further from the truth, and while the prospect of tariffs on European cars has diminished, it hasn't gone away completely, which means inevitably the market shifts its attention elsewhere. That elsewhere concerns what could happen next with respect to China, and the prospect of an escalation there,"" he said.
So far this month, MSCI China A shares have fallen 2.6 percent, taking the biggest hit from U.S. President Donald Trump's threats on tariffs among other issues in major markets, compared with 3.3-percent gains in the MSCI ACWI.
The Chinese yuan eased, on course to mark its seventh week of losses, although those losses were cushioned by Chinese state banks' swapping of dollars for yuan in the forward market. Traders said they may also have been selling spot dollars.
Borrowing costs in the euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, held below six-week highs, a day after the European Central Bank's president backed market expectations for a rise in interest rates late next year. [GVD/EUR]
Most 10-year bond yields in the bloc were steady ahead of second quarter U.S. economic growth data due out at 1230 GMT that many economists expect to show a strong reading.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield edged up to 2.9880 percent, its highest level in 1-1/2 months, on receding worries about trade tensions.
""In fixed income markets, the main question today is whether the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield...will break the 3 percent mark in the wake of the U.S. GDP release,"" a UniCredit note said.
Japan's 10-year government bond yield slipped off a one-year high after the BOJ conducted special, unlimited buying for the second time this week.
Most market players expect central bankers meeting on Monday to stop short of making immediate policy changes and to say instead that they will study ways to reduce the side-effects of the prolonged easing, such as hits to banks' profits.
In currencies, the dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 111.17 yen as the yen got a lift from a rise in Japanese bond yields.
Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was up 0.1 percent at 94.863, hitting a five-day high. [FRX/]
The euro traded down 0.1 percent at $1.1630, having fallen 0.73 percent on Thursday after the ECB signaled no change in its timetable to move away from ultra low rates or end its bond purchase program.
In commodities, oil prices edged lower in quiet trading after three days of gains, but took support from Saudi Arabia halting crude transport through a major shipping lane, and falling U.S. inventories. [O/R]
Brent crude futures traded down 0.1 percent at $74.49 per barrel, but were set for their first weekly increase in four. 
Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,219.03 an ounce. [GOL/]

Copper edged up, again boosted by receding trade tensions. It is on course to gain 2.4 percent on the London Metal Exchange and 3.7 percent on the Shanghai Futures Exchange this week, which would mark its first weekly rise in seven on both bourses after fears of a global trade war dragged prices down.

363,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 08:33AM ET</span>",On-the-job training: A German export hit losing favor at home,"By Michelle Martin
WINSEN AN DER LUHE, Germany (Reuters) - Nina Lorea Kley urgently needs young people to train as vehicle builders at her company's factories in northern and eastern Germany. She has enough orders and money to hire 20 this summer but can only find 14.
Feldbinder makes 2,000 customized trailers, railway wagons and containers a year but won't be able to keep that up without new recruits, especially because many employees are due to retire in the next few years.
""If we don't manage to fill jobs that become free we'll have to think about which orders we can fulfill,"" said Kley, 41, a managing director at the firm her father co-founded four decades ago. ""We simply wouldn't be able to take on certain orders anymore due to a lack of staff.""
Feldbinder is not alone. More than a third of German companies could not fill all of their training places last year while almost one in ten received no applications for such roles, a survey by the DIHK Chambers of Commerce found.
Last year, the number of vacancies for training positions was at its highest for more than 20 years.
Germany's twin-track vocational training system, which involves up to 3-1/2 years of on-the-job learning in firms alongside theory lessons at vocational school, is credited with giving Germany the European Union's lowest youth jobless rate - 6.8 percent in 2017 against an EU average of 16.8 percent.
Widely admired abroad, the training system is being exported in various forms to Europe, Asia, Africa and the United States. But its popularity is waning at home as young people increasingly prefer the higher status of a university degree.
That could hurt growth in Europe's largest economy by exacerbating a skilled labor shortage, which is partly caused by hundreds of thousands of aging employees leaving the labor market every year.
""It's a dangerous trend - Germany is running out of skilled workers,"" said DIHK President Eric Schweitzer. ""At first, orders lie around for longer, then firms have to reject them outright - to the point where entire sectors run into problems.""
In response, the government has vowed to strengthen the training system and make it more attractive during this legislative period, which runs to 2021.
It plans to invest in equipment so vocational schools can adjust to the digital age, put a minimum trainee wage into law, boost career guidance at secondary schools, promote part-time training to help people reconcile their work and family life, and reduce the problem of regional imbalances in the jobs market by improving mobility.
EXPORT SUCCESS
The education ministry is working with 16 countries including Greece, China, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and the United States to reform their vocational training systems to make them more like the German system.
During her first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in March 2017, Chancellor Angela Merkel and company managers spent around an hour discussing vocational training with him, and Ivanka Trump met trainees on a vocational scheme at Siemens during her visit to Berlin the same year.
Foreign interest in the system has grown since the global financial crisis and its success lies partly in the heavy involvement of companies, which ensures it produces workers who can be deployed immediately.
Since 2013 the education ministry has been supporting a project called VETnet whereby German Chambers of Commerce Abroad in 11 countries develop pilot vocational training projects with local companies.
They now offer 45 different occupations, with mechatronics fitter (technology combining electronics and mechanical engineering), tool mechanic and industrial mechanic the most popular. More than 820 companies are involved, with 7,400 trainees in China, Greece, India, Italy, Latvia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Thailand and the United States.
""The German government supports the internationalization of vocational training because it guarantees competitiveness, social harmony and economic stability even during crises,"" Thomas Rachel, the deputy education minister, told Reuters.
But the DIHK's Schweitzer said the system is no longer as highly regarded in Germany as it used to be and it was vital to turn that around by showing young people how good their career and financial prospects are on the scheme.
""We need to ensure vocational training is as valued at home as it is as abroad,"" he said.
University studies are increasingly popular. There were 515,327 new students in 2017, or 41 percent more than in 2005, the education ministry said.
That compared with 490,267 young people who started a traineeship in the dual system last year. Since 2013 the number of young people starting university degrees has been higher than the number starting as trainees, the education ministry said.
A record high total of almost 2.85 million students were enrolled in university degree courses in the 2017/2018 winter semester, according to the statistics office.
Those with university degrees earn more on average over their lifetime than those who do vocational training, a 2017 study by the Ifo institute found. Many believe going to university will ensure better career prospects too.
A government push that started in 2008 to get more young people into university also contributed to the rise in student numbers.
People with relevant professional experience can now study for some degrees despite not having higher education entrance qualifications, thereby widening the pool of people who can attend university.
Companies and industry groups complain that schools focus too much on sending young people to university and should also stress the benefits of the dual system, which offers training for 327 occupations at more than 426,000 companies.
""Of course we need engineers and mathematicians but not only them - we also need very well-qualified skilled tradesmen,"" said Rainer Dulger, head of Gesamtmetall - a metal industry employers' association.
Many firms are also preparing for a mass exit of experienced employees from 2020 as the post-World War Two baby boomers retire. There are around 300,000 fewer school leavers each year than people going into retirement, the DIHK said. 
Kley said Feldbinder would have more people retiring in two to three years than it would be able to replace with its own trainees. Some 10 percent of her 950 employees are due to retire in the next five years.
""That means we'll get smaller, we'll shrink - it's a real problem. We can no longer find people on the market,"" she said.
MISMATCH
Last year nearly 49,000 training positions, especially in the manual trades, hotel and catering sectors, were vacant - the most since 1995. At the same time, the number of applicants without trainee contracts rose to almost 24,000, highlighting a mismatch between employers and candidates.
In southern Germany, for example, there were far more trainee places on offer than applicants but in Berlin the opposite was true and some sectors like administration and IT were oversubscribed.
Another problem for Feldbinder, Kley said, is that many children no longer grow up in homes with a workbench or repair their own bikes, so they do not get a feel for manual jobs.
Almost half of companies are wooing university dropouts to help cover the shortfall and 16 percent are offering benefits like smartphones, extra holidays, gym membership or better wages to lure new trainees, the DIHK found.
But even firms that do find trainees are not always happy, telling the DIHK that many lack motivation or German and maths skills. A quarter of trainees end their contracts early, according to the education ministry.
At Feldbinder, Kley is trying to prevent costly dropouts by offering internships to make sure young people like the work before getting hired. She hopes to find more trainees by inviting schools to visit her company, sponsoring a carnival club and attracting more females.
The company hires one or two female trainee vehicle builders a year and would like to employ more, but many girls do not think of the traditionally male-dominated job when considering their options, Kley said.

""If we could attract girls, we'd suddenly have 50 percent more potential applicants,"" she said.

364,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Bankers weigh giant Aramco-Sabic debt financing,"By Sandrine Bradley
LONDON (LPC) - Bankers are discussing a potential jumbo financing of up to US$70bn to back oil giant Saudi Aramco’s acquisition of a majority stake in Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corp (Sabic) (SE:2010).
Aramco is aiming to buy a controlling stake in petrochemical outfit Sabic, and could buy all of the 70% stake owned by the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia's top sovereign wealth fund.
Riyadh-listed Sabic, the world's fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, has a market capitalization of SR385.2bn (US$103bn) and a 70% stake would cost roughly US$70bn.
JP Morgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have been picked to advise on the deal, Reuters reported. 
Bankers are having internal discussions about Aramco’s potential need for external debt financing, which could be loans or bonds. Aramco has not yet sent a request for proposals to its lenders, sources said.
“Nothing has happened yet but all banks are looking at it,” one banker said. 
The possibility and size of a potential debt deal depends whether vendor PIF will require certainty of funds for the acquisition, which could mean that Aramco has to raise cash upfront, rather than paying over a longer period.
“Aramco may need to raise some upfront cash which might be paid in a number of agreed installments and might include a bridge loan,” the banker said.
Getting information on a potential deal could be difficult, however, as negotiations will be led from the top by Saudi Arabia’s reforming crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.
“We would like to get out and meet people to discuss this but I don’t think anyone will be knowledgeable enough. This is being led from the top by the crown prince, I don’t think people at the Aramco level even know what is going on,” he said.
Aramco declined to comment.
LENDERS KEEN
A large potential debt financing could boost Middle Eastern lending, which sank to only US$4.4bn in the second quarter - the lowest quarterly total since the second quarter of 2004 - and would attract appetite from local and international banks.
In early 2016, the crown prince said that he planned to sell shares in Aramco in an IPO planned for 2018, which was aiming to raise more than US$100bn for a new sovereign wealth fund.
The IPO has been delayed until at least 2019, which means that Aramco’s relationship banks will be expected to provide any financing for the Sabic purchase at very low rates to land a role in the potential IPO.
“The US investment banks, all three Japanese banks, all the French banks, some of the German banks and a lot of Middle East banks, including the Saudi banks, will be willing to lend as much as possible,” a second banker said.
Banks that are unlikely to be involved in the potential IPO would be less keen to lend at low rates, as banks' return on capital remains under pressure.
“If there is a deal it will be extremely cheap – double digit pricing. We wouldn’t get any ancillary business so why would we lend so cheaply?” a third banker said.
The acquisition of the Sabic stake could also impact the timing of Aramco's planned IPO, the state oil giant's chief executive, Amin Nasser, said earlier this month and could even remove the need to do the IPO. 
PIF could receive up to US$70bn from the Sabic sale, which would give sufficient funds to embark on ambitious infrastructure and development projects planned for the Kingdom. 
SABIC REFINANCING 
Sabic, which is rated A1/A-/A+, said in May that it expected to refinance nearly US$2bn of external debt by October. A potential change of ownership is unlikely to alter these plans, bankers said.
The company has a US$1bn bond which is due to mature on October 3 and has hired banks for an international bond offering. The timing and terms of the issue have yet to be decided.
Sabic also had a US$1bn term loan that matured on July 18, and expects to use drawings on its existing US$2bn revolving credit facility to repay that loan until the US$2bn refinancing is completed. Discussions are currently underway, bankers said.
“We are discussing various things with Sabic, something may come. It has not been really agreed what purpose the money will be used for,” a fourth banker said.

The term loan was originally agreed in 2013 via a club syndicate and paid 50bp over Libor. The five-year revolving credit was put in place in December 2015 and pays 25bp over Libor.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal's moves on Anglo,"By Barbara Lewis
LONDON (Reuters) - Billionaire Anil Agarwal in July said he planned to offer around $1 billion to take London-listed  Vedanta Resources  Plc (L:VED) private, a move that has rekindled speculation his ultimate aim is a deal with miner  Anglo American  (L:AAL).
Agarwal's Volcan family trust has until July 30 to make a firm offer or walk away from the deal, which would leave Vedanta listed only in India (NS:VDAN).
WHY THE SPECULATION?
In March 2017, Agarwal began amassing a stake in Anglo American through a three-year JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) mandatory convertible bond named ""POEMS"". He announced he was buying a second tranche in September 2017.
In total, Agarwal has 19.35 percent, making him Anglo American's largest shareholder, although only for three years unless he acts to buy the shares or seek to roll over the arrangement, which is effectively a loan.
Agarwal has always said the stake was an investment, based on his belief in Anglo as a company, for his family trust. He said it was unrelated to Vedanta and he was not planning a takeover.
However, he has made no secret of wanting to grow Vedanta into a major diversified player or of his commitment to South Africa, Anglo America's heartland.
Vedanta's international operations are copper mines in Zambia and Vedanta Zinc with operations in South Africa and Namibia.
Agarwal has said he wants to buy the Indian government's 30 percent stake in Hindustan Zinc, of which he has majority control. Anglo has declined to comment on reports it rebuffed previous approaches for a tie-up with Hindustan Zinc.
WHY THE DELISTING AND WHAT DOES IT CHANGE?
Vedanta was the first Indian company to list in London, in 2003. It raised around 500 million pounds ($657 million), giving it a market capitalization just over 1 billion pounds. 
Since then, the market capitalization has roughly doubled to 2 billion pounds.
But the bigger part of the company is Indian-listed Vedanta with a market capitalization of 803.84 billion rupees ($11.66 billion). It also has significant levels of debt and is dwarfed by Anglo, with market capitalization around 24 billion pounds.
The London delisting simplifies Vedanta's structure, potentially making it more attractive as a company, but the loss of the listing would reduce Agarwal's deal-making capacity as potential buyers would prefer London shares to Indian ones, analysts say.
A spokesman for Agarwal said he was not giving interviews.
In his announcement of the planned delisting, Agarwal cited ""the maturity of the Indian capital markets"", saying a London listing was no longer necessary.
Mark Cutifani, CEO of Anglo American, said Agarwal has been ""a very supportive shareholder"".
""Our conversation is consistent with the conversation with all of our other shareholders,"" he said when asked about Agarwal at the company's interim results on Thursday.
WHAT DO THE SHAREHOLDERS THINK?
At least one significant investor has said it is unhappy with the price Agarwal has offered to buy out other shareholders.
Anglo shareholders have benefited from Agarwal's interest, which has helped to drive up the stock, but some investors for whom ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) issues are a concern say Vedanta's track record would be worrying.
The most significant shareholder is South Africa's state-run Public Investment Corporation, which was the biggest shareholder in Anglo American until Agarwal's purchase.
Deon Botha, PIC's head of corporate affairs, said it could not comment as ""public statements to this effect will constitute market sensitive information"".
  Analysts and fund managers say PIC has a commitment to ESG issues that could set it at odds with Vedanta. Others say PIC's quest for a national champion based on separating out Anglo's South African assets might persuade it to work with him.
IS VEDANTA'S ESG RECORD WORSE THAN OTHERS?
While most miners, including Anglo, have had issues with leaks and fatalities, Vedanta's troubles have attracted particular criticism.
In India, the Tamil Nadu government has ordered the permanent closure of a Vedanta copper smelter and disconnected its power supply in May following protests that turned violent as police opened fire on protesters, killing 13.
Vedanta is seeking to overturn the decision.
It is also fighting a London high court judgment linked to alleged pollution from copper operations in Zambia.
IMPLICATIONS OF THE NEW CEO?
At the end of August, Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, known as Venkat, will take up the Vedanta helm after stepping down as CEO of AngloGold Ashanti (J:ANGJ).
Before becoming chief executive in 2013, he was AngloGold's chief financial officer, while Mark Cutifani, CEO of Anglo American since 2017, was AngloGold's CEO.
Analysts say the two have worked well together.
At the same time, the chairman of Anglo American Stuart Chambers has a strong record of securing buyers for the companies he leads.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung (KS:005930) Securities Co (KS:016360) Chief Executive Officer Koo Sung-hoon resigned after the company was punished by South Korea's financial regulator because an employee's error sparked a $105 billion ""ghost stock"" blunder, the company said in a regulatory filing on Friday.
Koo's departure came a day after South Korea's financial watchdog handed down a six month partial suspension of the brokerage's operations and suspended its chief from his duties for three months over the fat finger error.
The regulatory filing did not provide further details.
 Samsung Securities  in April accidentally issued 2.8 billion shares to employees - more than 30 times the number of its outstanding shares and theoretically worth some $100 billion - some of which were quickly sold off by workers.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors poured $600 million in to U.S. technology stocks in the week leading up to poor results from Facebook (O:FB), according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML) analysts, urging clients to sell the sector on signs inflows have reached bubble territory.
Facebook's shares plunged 19 percent on Thursday - leading to the biggest one-day wipeout in value terms in U.S. stock market history - after the company said it faced a multi-year squeeze on its business margins.
But flow data covering the week to 25 July showed little drop in demand as investors continued to hunt for returns after a decade of quantitative easing, BAML said.
Funds investing in technology have pulled in $36 billion this year, the data showed, by far the largest on record.
Facebook's shock results were a ""classic late-cycle event,"" analysts at the bank wrote, calling investors' preference for FAANG stocks - the quintet of Facebook, Amazon (O:AMZN), Apple (O:AAPL), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google (O:GOOGL) - ""the most crowded QE trade in the world"".
In contrast, the Chinese government's increasing wariness over a trade war with the U.S. provided an ideal entry point into emerging markets, particularly the BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China, BAML said. 
In the last three months China has cut its Reserve Requirement Ratios twice, devalued the yuan  by 7 percent, as well as widespread tax cuts and local bond issuance - all possible signs it is worried about global trade. 
""Markets stop panicking when policy makers panic,"" analysts at BAML said, saying long BRICs against short FAANGs was a good trade for the third quarter. 

The bank also recommended clients buy gold  and products hedging against a rise in volatility (VIX), in preparation for a potentially difficult end to the year for investors.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 06:06AM ET</span>",BP pays $10.5 billion for BHP shale assets to beef up U.S. business,"By Sonali Paul and Ron Bousso
MELBOURNE/LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  Plc (L:BP) has agreed to buy U.S. shale oil and gas assets from global miner BHP Billiton (L:BLT) (AX:BHP) for $10.5 billion, expanding the British oil major's footprint in oil-rich onshore basins in its biggest deal in nearly 20 years.
The acquisition marks a big turning point for BP since the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs.
""This is a transformational acquisition for our (onshore U.S.) business, a major step in delivering our upstream strategy and a world-class addition to BP's distinctive portfolio,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. 
In a further sign of the upturn in its fortunes, BP said it would increase its quarterly dividend for the first time in nearly four years and announced a $6 billion share buyback, to be partly funded by selling some upstream assets.
BP's London-listed shares were trading 0.4 percent higher at 1000 GMT, compared with a 0.6 percent gain in the broader European energy index (SXEP).
The sale ends a disastrous seven-year foray by BHP into shale on which the company effectively blew up $19 billion of shareholders' funds. Investors led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management have been pressing the company to jettison the onshore assets for the past 18 months. BHP put the business up for sale last August.
The sale price was better than the $8 billion to $10 billion that analysts had expected, and investors were pleased that BHP planned to return the proceeds to shareholders.
""It was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,"" said Craig Evans, co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund.
BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20 billion with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) at the peak of the oil boom. It spent a further $20 billion developing the assets, but suffered as gas and oil prices collapsed, triggering massive writedowns.
The world's biggest miner said it would record a further one-off shale charge of about $2.8 billion post-tax in its 2018 financial year results.

The deal, BP's biggest since it bought oil company Atlantic Richfield Co in 1999, will increase its U.S. onshore oil and gas resources by 57 percent.
BP will acquire BHP's unit which holds the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Permian assets for $10.5 billion, giving it ""some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S.,"" the company said.
It beat rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) for the assets, which have combined production of 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d)and 4.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources.
The deal would turn the onshore United States into ""a heartland business in the company,"" Bernard Looney, BP's head of upstream, said in a call with analysts.
It will bring BP into the oil-rich Permian basin in eastern Texas, where production has surged in recent years. With it, BP's onshore oil production will jump from 10,000 barrels per day to 200,000 bpd by the mid-2020s, Looney said. 
BP said the transaction would boost its earnings and cash flow per share and it would still be able to maintain its gearing within a 20-30 percent range.
The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 2.5 percent to 10.25 cents a share, the first rise in 15 quarters.
Meanwhile, a unit of Merit Energy Company will buy BHP Billiton Petroleum (Arkansas) Inc and the Fayetteville assets, for $0.3 billion.
Tribeca's Evans welcomed the clean exit for cash, rather than asset swaps which BHP had flagged as a possibility.
""It leaves the company good scope to focus on their far better offshore oil business,"" he said.
BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the company had delivered on its promise to get value for its shale assets, while the sale was consistent with a long-term plan to simplify and strengthen its portfolio.
BHP (AX:BHP) shares rose 2.3 percent after the announcement, outperforming the broader market (AXJO) and rival  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO).
BP said it would pay the $10.5 billion in installments over six months from the date of completion, with $5.25 billion of the consideration to be raised through the sale of new shares.
An Elliott spokesman declined to comment.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 05:42AM ET</span>","As Hyundai struggles, its labor union shows signs of softening","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - When workers at South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) went on strike last year, the stoppage lasted 24 days, triggered months of negotiations and netted them their smallest raise in nearly a decade.
This week, after just two days on strike, their powerful union agreed to a deal before the summer holidays, the first time in eight years that has happened.
The agreement gives workers a smaller raise than last year's $14,000 in bonuses and wage increases, union officials said, declining to provide details. It had sought a 5.3 percent increase in wages, a request it reduced to 2.1 percent; inflation in South Korea is about 1.9 percent.
Those relatively small gains, and the speed to which they were agreed, are signs that the union may be softening its stance amid growing criticism, falling profits, the near bankruptcy of GM Korea and potential U.S. tariffs. 
Union members endorsed the deal late Thursday, just before the automaker reported its second-worst quarterly net profit since 2012.
""We're fed up with strikes and feeling a crisis too,"" a Hyundai worker in its sprawling Ulsan factory complex, the world's biggest automaking facility, told Reuters, citing GM Korea's recent wage deal and trade disputes with Washington. 
This year, General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean unit shut down one of its four plants, cut jobs and agreed with its union to freeze wages, skip bonuses and trim benefits to stem mounting losses.
Hyundai chief executive Ha Eon-tae said during negotiations that a 25 percent tariff - a possibility as the U.S. escalates trade pressures globally - would be a “nuclear bomb.” He said it would lead vehicle prices to increase as much as $5,500 each and wipe out 70 percent of the company's revenue, according to union notes seen by Reuters. 
More than 70 percent of Hyundai's workers are unionized. By contrast, the union participation rate in South Korea is only about 10 percent, the second-lowest after Turkey among member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The union's 50,000 members helped drive Hyundai's rapid growth in the 2000s, when the company earned record profits and had an operating margin above 10 percent - the industry's highest.
The union, which has staged strikes in all but four of the 30 years since it was created, points to that performance in negotiating for generous wages and benefits. 
But the inflation-beating wage increases over the years have widened the pay gap with non-unionized workers and subcontractors. Union members' annual average wage was 92 million won ($82,000) in 2017, among the highest in the global auto industry.
When they launch strikes, the union's office is bombarded with calls from businesses, conservative groups and others criticizing them for taking for granted their high wages, benefits and job security, some union members say.
South Korean news media also often slam the country's auto unions for being ""aristocrat unions."" 
""We did our best to break through the social isolation the labor union faces and reach a deal before summer holidays,"" union leader Ha Bu-young said in a newsletter after the deal. 
At Hyundai's Ulsan factory, a leaflet distributed by management in March ahead of wage talks warned of a GM Korea-like crisis, citing Hyundai's high costs and low productivity. Hyundai claimed that the productivity of its South Korean factories is only 60 percent of those overseas.
""The crisis of the South Korea's auto industry… it is not just the problem of GM Korea. Are we assured about the future of Hyundai Motor?"" the leaflet said.
EXISTENTIAL THREAT
Another Hyundai employee, who works at the No.3 plant in Ulsan, said he will be forced to take a two-week summer holiday this month, instead of the company's standard one-week holiday, because of slow demand for the Elantra sedan in South Korea and the United States.
""We have no choice but to change. If we don't change, we will not able to survive,"" another Hyundai worker said.
A lack of SUV models in the United States, a diplomatic row between South Korea and China last year and U.S. threats to impose tariffs on auto imports pose other problems to Hyundai's high manufacturing costs in South Korea. 
In another memo, dated June 21, Hyundai CEO Ha wrote: ""When we look back enormous production and wage losses we have had, it may not be just me who has doubts about whether all those sacrifices were worth it. I am strongly committed to changing our consuming and routine negotiating culture.""
But workers say that even if their union softens its position, it needs to stay strong in fighting against the country's powerful chaebol, which imposed massive job cuts during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. 
""It has to be powerful to give protection to its workers. We are concerned that the company will not protect us (when things go wrong),"" the second worker said.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Fake news of Napoleon's death cited in guidance to help traders,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Fake news that Napoleon had died is cited in new analysis aimed at helping commodity, bond and forex traders to stop fraud, an industry body said on Friday.
The FICC Markets Standards Board (FMSB), created after banks were fined for trying to rig currency markets, reviewed behavior in 390 cases of market misconduct going back to a U.S. debt securities squeeze in 1792.
The cases were distilled into 25 patterns of misconduct that are consistently repeated over time. The FMSB wants its members to use the findings as a fount of institutional knowledge for new traders and compliance officers.
""Identifying the relevant behaviors underlying misconduct is an essential step to forestalling them,"" said Gerry Harvey, chief executive of the FMSB.
The research cited two cases of pumping up prices and squeezing markets to show underlying behaviors are rarely new.
In 1814 Charles de Berenger disguised himself as a Bourbon officer and appeared in Dover to announce that Napoleon had been killed by the Prussians.
He sent a semaphore telegraph to the Admiralty in London, knowing it would find its way into the press. The price of British government bonds rose on the news, prompting De Berenger and co-conspirators to sell gilts they had already bought.
Another case involved the U.S. soybean oil market in 1963 when there was an attempt to corner markets in what became known as the Great Salad Oil Swindle based on creating false warehouse receipts for non-existent inventory. 
The research is accompanied by good practice statements such as calling on firms to have a framework for spotting and assessing common conduct risks and the need to draw lessons from new misconduct cases.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said such research was fundamental to identifying the root causes of misconduct and to finding ways to reinforce the collective memory of the market.
""I hope that all wholesale market firms will incorporate its lessons in their work to improve standards of conduct in wholesale markets,"" Carney said in a foreword to the research.
Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said the analysis provided a very helpful basis for firms to draw out lessons on where supervision and lines of defense should focus their energies.

Kering shares were down 5.9 percent at 473.40 euros in early session trading. The stock hit a record high of 522.40 euros on June 15, and nevertheless remains up by around 30 percent since the start of 2018.
Kering reported late on Thursday higher first-half profits, helped by resilient sales in China.
Gucci's margins hit a record high of 38.2 percent at end-June. But its second quarter comparable sales growth of 40.1 percent was a touch below forecasts even as the label outperforms peers. Some traders said that was a trigger for investors to sell Kering shares and cash in on the stock's recent rally.
""Gucci touch light, profit taking inevitable,"" wrote one trader, who declined to be named, in an emailed comment.
That view was echoed by analysts at Berenberg, who nevertheless kept a ""buy"" rating on Kering shares.

388,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",BHP Shows Patience Pays in $10.5 Billion BP Deal,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Even the most sorry tale can have something like a happy ending.
That looks to be the case with BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd.’s misbegotten foray into onshore U.S. oil and gas. With the announcement Friday that the company will sell its assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian and Haynesville basins to  BP  (LON:BP) Plc for $10.5 billion, the company’s U.S. oil unit will be sticking to the deep seas.
The price looks better than many had been expecting. At the time Elliott Management Corp. started pushing for a divestment of the assets in April last year, brokers valued them at an average of $6.5 billion. First-round bids for the business from BP,  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc had come in between $7 billion and $9 billion, people familiar with the matter told Kiel Porter and Dinesh Nair of Bloomberg News last month.
By BHP’s own numbers, net operating assets in the three basins were worth about $9.5 billion at the end of December – although the gross value was pegged Friday at $10.9 billion, or $13.9 billion including goodwill.
Of course, things have changed over the past 15 months. The Permian is currently the hottest oil patch on the planet, with output up by almost half since last April to 3.5 million barrels a day – about a third of the total output from Saudi Arabia or Russia, and considerably more than the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait – and the number of rigs exploring for more rising by about 40 percent.
Even so, those numbers have yet to translate into more earnings, or even significantly higher valuations. The median Ebitda multiple of Permian-exposed U.S. oil producers fell to 7.1 last week from 7.9 six months ago, according to a Bloomberg-compiled market-weighted basket of 15 companies. That reflects pipeline constraints that have kept Permian production locked up onshore and trading at a sharp discount to benchmark West Texas Intermediate at Cushing, Oklahoma.
The cap on output is reflected in the financial numbers, too. The businesses BP is buying haven’t turned a profit in years, and still lost $356 million in underlying Ebit in the six months through December. Excluding depreciation and amortization those numbers look better – but depreciation is a real cost for fast-depleting shale plays, and can’t be wiped out by accounting trickery if you buy an asset close to book value.
The advantages to BP are longer-term. The company skulked away from the Permian by selling its assets to  Apache Corp  (NYSE:APA). in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. With pipeline capacity from the region set to improve next year and in 2020, there’s a decent chance too that the current mismatch between production strength and valuation weakness will close. In terms of acreage, that’s already happening: The price is a discount to the $12.5 billion that UBS AG estimates the assets are worth, based on the value of recent transactions.
BHP’s foray into the U.S. onshore shale market was a disaster that opened up a $20 billion hole of writedowns, losses and wasted capital spending. Remaining disgruntlement with that outcome will be considerably muted by the promise from Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie to return the proceeds of the sale rather than reinvest them. Whether that’s enough to placate Elliott remains to be seen.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 08:52PM ET</span>","Amazon earnings skyrocket on cloud computing, advertising","By Jeffrey Dastin and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) forecast strong fall sales and posted a profit that was double Wall Street targets on Thursday thanks to the retailer's younger, higher-earning businesses, including cloud computing and advertising.
Shares rose more than 3 percent in after-hours trade. The report was a relief to investors in the U.S. technology sector, still reeling from a profit warning by  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) Wednesday that plunged its stock 19 percent.
Amazon's report shows how the world's largest online retailer has increasingly learned to compensate for the high costs of fast package delivery and video streaming by controlling expenses and building up higher-profit businesses. It was the first mover in the business of selling data storage and computing power in the cloud, a bet that continues to reap rewards and give it the leeway to invest in grand projects.
For instance, the company is working to ship food from Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) stores across the United States, in an ambitious attempt to bring groceries into the age of online retail.
Amazon's spending typically climbs in the summer quarter, pressuring profits as the company prepares for Christmas and the winter holidays, its peak sales period each year. 
Yet the company said it expects an operating profit between $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion, up from $347 million a year earlier. The company also reported a second-quarter profit of $2.5 billion, its largest ever.
""A big contributor to the quarter and the last few quarters obviously has been strong growth in our highest profitability businesses and also advertising,"" Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, said on a call with media. ""We’ve seen a greater-than-expected efficiency in a lot of our spend in things like warehouses, data centers, marketing.""
The Seattle-based company cut hundreds of consumer jobs in its headquarters earlier this year, in a move that may have lowered costs and freed up resources for fast-growing areas like Amazon's voice aide Alexa.
Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter called the expansion in the company's gross profit margin ""remarkable,"" citing impressive results from cloud sales and services to third-party merchants on Amazon.
""That drove the bulk of the earnings beat,"" he said.
CFO Olsavsky noted that third-party sales were changing the profit equation for Amazon, too. The company for years was notorious for roller-coaster results.
More lucrative than sales of goods that Amazon owns, third-party transactions offer the company a commission that increases significantly when merchants choose to hand over fulfillment and advertising to Amazon, as many do. Half of all units sold through Amazon are from these sellers, and these sales keep growing.
ANGLING FOR ADVERTISERS
Highly profitable ad sales were a bright spot last quarter. The company said revenue from the category and some other items grew 132 percent to $2.2 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company is working to automate tasks for advertisers and to help media buyers measure the results, Olsavsky said.
Key to its allure has been that advertisers' placements result directly in sales, reaching customers on Amazon with an intent to shop. That contrasts with ads reaching users who are on industry leaders Facebook and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google for a range of purposes.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's must lucrative unit, saw its operating profit margin expand from a year earlier. Sales picked up speed from the year prior, too, rising 49 percent to $6.1 billion and beating the average estimate of $6 billion.
The unit's success has helped make Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the richest person in the world.
""It’s really becoming the crown jewel of Bezos' empire,"" said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives. ""They’ve invested significant dollars in building out the infrastructure, sales force and AWS partner ecosystem worldwide that I think now is starting to pay just massive dividends.""
While cloud rivals are gaining ground, AWS remains far in front with 31 percent of the fast-expanding market, versus 18 percent for  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and 8 percent for Google in the second quarter, research firm Canalys said Thursday. Amazon shares, up 55 percent this year versus 6 percent for the S&P 500 (SPX) as of Thursday's close, trade at a premium, too. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is more than 10 times that of Microsoft. Cloud and ad sales, along with a July event that Amazon created to drum up revenue during the summer shopping lulls, are helping the company overcome high costs in the third quarter.
During the event, called Prime Day, Amazon sold more than 100 million products and signed up more people to its Prime loyalty club than on any other previous day in its history.
Prime members spend above average on Amazon. The company said it now expects third-quarter sales of between $54 billion and $57.5 billion, up from $43.7 billion a year earlier.
Hiking the annual U.S. price of Prime 20 percent in the second quarter appeared to have few negative consequences: Amazon said subscription revenue increased 57 percent to $3.4 billion.
Total net sales for the second quarter rose 39 percent to $52.9 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $53.4 billion.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 07:36PM ET</span>",Starbucks reports cooling quarterly growth and pares outlook,"By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) forecast slower growth for the current fiscal year on Thursday as boutique coffee chains and fast-food retailers won business in the United States and other established markets and the bloom came off once-booming China.
Wall Street had been braced for a disappointing quarter from the ubiquitous coffee brand, and its shares were relatively unchanged in after-market trading. 
Seattle-based Starbucks last month warned of lower quarterly sales growth and announced plans to close about 150 U.S. cafes in the next fiscal year, triple the typical number of closures, as it seeks to enter under-served markets in the U.S. South and Midwest.
But investors saw bright spots in the results, as Starbucks, the world's biggest coffee retailer, reported revenue rose to a record high in its fiscal third quarter. The company also pledged a $10 billion increase in its share buyback and dividend commitment, to $25 billion through fiscal year 2020.
Starbucks said its same-store sales rose just 1 percent globally and in its U.S. cafes in its third quarter ended July 1. Same-store sales in China slipped 2 percent amid fierce competition and stricter regulations on delivery services. 
""While acknowledging a disappointing Q3, I want to be clear that we have 100 percent confidence in our growth strategy and the sustainability of the leadership position we have built in the market,"" Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said in the company's quarterly earnings call. 
Starbucks blamed a combination of cannibalization of its own stores and hiccups in its China delivery program for much of the slowdown in the country. 
In the year-ago quarter, Starbucks' same-store sales grew by 5 percent in the United States and Americas and 4 percent globally. The sales dip in China is an even steeper departure from the 7 percent growth rate reported in last year's quarter.
Revenue rose to $6.3 billion from $5.7 billion in the year prior. Starbucks' closely monitored digital membership program grew 14 percent year-over-year to 15.1 million active users. 
Starbucks' shares are down 10.4 percent year to date.
The company said it now expects full-year same-store sales growth to be ""just below"" its 3 percent to 5 percent targeted range, and sees fourth-quarter growth at the lower end of its 3 percent to 5 percent range.
Starbucks' report comes exactly one month after Howard Schultz, the brand's elder statesman and former chief executive, stepped down as executive chairman, in a move that stoked investor concerns on how the company would evolve after nearly four decades of Schultz's near-constant presence.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>",Japan's pachinko industry braces for anti-addiction regulation,"By Taiga Uranaka and Ritsuko Ando
(Reuters) - Like many Japanese pachinko parlors, Naomi Suzuki's shop on the outskirts of Fukushima City was once full of energy, with the din of bouncing steel balls and garish lights flashing to indicate winnings.
But business is quieter for her these days as her parlor's clientele ages and drifts away. And with new restrictions on the game this year, she and her industry are bracing for things to get much worse.
The rules, aimed at curbing gambling addiction, are part of a policy barter that helped legalize casinos in 2016 despite widespread opposition. Japan passed regulations on casino developments last week, including those on gambling addiction.
The new anti-addiction rules call for pachinko machines to reduce payouts. That means players win and lose money more slowly - and will perhaps find the game less exciting and addictive.
Pachinko halls are required to comply in the next three years. Owners like Suzuki worry not only about the cost of replacing machines, but that regulars will find the new games too dull.
""If you restrict the excitement so much, people will quit,"" she said. ""The point of allowing casinos was to bolster regional finances. But the pachinko industry will be taking the hit."" 
ALREADY SLOWING 
The industry, which gained nationwide popularity after World War Two, has already been in decline because of a shrinking population. Younger generations tend to favor online games and other sources of betting. 
The overall industry has shrunk to about 20 trillion yen ($179.82 billion) from around 30 trillion yen a decade ago, according to Japan Productivity Center, which compiles statistics on the leisure industry.
Pachinko halls have tried to keep players entertained by incorporating animation and high-tech features into the games.
But the basic rules remain the same: players try to bounce steel balls into parts of the board that reward them with a payout of more balls.
Balls can exchanged for prizes, which can be redeemed for cash at a nearby exchange point in a three-step process designed to skirt regulations. 
The number of pachinko halls has fallen to about 9,600 from over 17,000 two decades ago, according to data based on statistics collected by the National Police Agency, which regulates the industry. 
Pachinko hall operators are going bankrupt more often; 29 did so last year compared with 12 in 2016, according to credit data agency Tokyo Shoko Research. 
Daiwa Securities analyst Takao Suzuki predicts that more pachinko halls will shut down, and that operators nationwide will see sales fall up to 20 percent. 
Suzuki said pachinko hall operators are already spending about 1 trillion yen annually on new machines, a high expenditure considering all parlors combined earn 3 trillion yen a year. New machines usually cost 400,000 to 500,000 yen each. 
""It's a big problem for parlors that cannot afford it,"" he said. ""At the moment, there are estimated to be 4,000 to 5,000 parlors that are not buying new machines.""
BIG PLAYERS TO STAY
But few Japanese, aside from pachinko enthusiasts, have sympathy for the industry. 
Many pachinko businesses are owned by ethnic Korean minorities, who have traditionally faced discrimination in other, more mainstream industries. 
A government survey last year found that 3.6 percent of Japanese have been addicted to gambling at some point, higher than the 1-2 percent average in other developed countries, and that pachinko was the top destination for gamblers.
The industry has not lobbied hard against the new rules, partly because bigger and more influential companies are positioned to benefit from the changes. 
Companies that make pachinko games such as  Heiwa Corp  (T:6412) are likely to profit in the short term as parlors buy new machines. 
And some big pachinko companies, including game makers and hall operators like  Sega Sammy Holdings  (T:6460) and Dynam Japan Holdings Co (HK:6889), are planning to expand into casino entertainment in Japan. 
Industry insiders say that in recent years, operators have focused on high rollers as their customer base shrunk. 
Hiroyoshi Fukaya of the pachinko industry publication GreenBelt said pachinko enthusiasts these days were often ready to spend 100,000 yen ($899) in just one visit, compared with around 10,000 yen to 20,000 yen years ago. 
Some analysts said the regulations would help return pachinko to its origins as a form of popular entertainment.
""We see it as a chance to expand the player base, and to gain the participation of a younger generation,"" said Kimiharu Sato, a director at Dynam Co. 
Dynam has already shifted its emphasis toward low-stakes ""one-yen"" machines. But owners of smaller pachinko parlors say such games are only profitable for the biggest chains.
""At our scale, we cannot survive,"" owner Suzuki said in her office at the back of her pachinko hall. She reminisced about its heyday when the parking lot was regularly full and so many customers queued outside when new machines were installed that the shop provided portable toilets.
By contrast, on a recent weekday afternoon, the lot was mostly empty. 

""We have a lot of elderly customers,"" she said. ""If these neighborhood pachinko shops are gone, some elderly people who have enjoyed it as a pastime will have nowhere else to go.""

The company said it expected adjusted revenue of $1.16 billion for the current quarter, down slightly from a year earlier, when sales were driven by ""Battlefield 1"". 
The timing of the recognition of bookings in Asia as well as foreign exchange weighed on the company's forecast, EA added. 
Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
""Expectations may have been higher for second-quarter guidance and the Street may have expected an increase in annual guidance but we understand EA is conservative early in the year,"" Consumer Edge Research analyst Raymond Stochel said.  
The rise in popularity of games from the ""battle royale"" genre such as ""Fortnite"" is posing challenges to established game publishers, including EA, and rivals Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Take Two Interactive Software Inc.
EA said it expected the launch of new games, including ""Madden NFL"" and ""Battlefield V"", in the coming months to take on some of those challenges.
For the first quarter, the company said ""The Sims 4"" player base grew 35 percent and the ""FIFA World Cup"" update had over 15 million unique players. 
Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen told Reuters that though EA had only two weeks of the World Cup in its first quarter, user engagement with FIFA was ""extremely"" high and that should help ""FIFA 19"" when it is launched in September.
EA reported revenue of $749 million on an adjusted basis for the latest quarter ended June 30, beating analysts' average estimate of $742.42 million. 
Net income fell to $293 million, or 95 cents per share, from $644 million, or $2.06 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding items, the company earned 13 cents per share, according to Reuters' calculation, topping analysts' estimate of 6 cents per share.

Shares of the company have risen nearly 40 percent this year.

(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) on Thursday reported a better-than-expected second quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, and its chief executive pledged not to raise drug prices again this year.
Amgen joined several drugmakers that have vowed to limit or delay price increases under intensifying pressure from the Trump administration to cut health care costs for U.S. consumers.
The world's largest biotechnology company also announced replacements for its head of research and development and retiring global commercial operations chief.
The company said on a conference call that it decided in May to forego list price increases it had planned for July, although it did not say which drugs it had targeted for price hikes.
""We have no plans to change that for the balance of the year,"" CEO Robert Bradway said. 
Amgen posted adjusted earnings of $3.83 per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 29 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Growth of newer drugs like cholesterol fighter Repatha and osteoporosis drug Prolia offset weakness in older products, the company said.
The company increased its 2018 earnings forecast to $13.30 to $14 per share, up from its previous view of $12.80 to $13.70.
Amgen shares rose 1 percent in extended trading to $196. 
Overall revenue for the quarter revenue rose 4 percent to $6.06 billion.
Sales of rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel fell 11 percent to $1.3 billion. 
Sales of the potent but expensive cholesterol drug Repatha have begun to take off, increasing 78 percent to $148 million. They have been held back since the drug's 2015 approval by an unwillingness of insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to authorize its use for most patients. 
Prolia sales rose 21 percent to $610 million.
Amgen did not report early sales of Aimovig, the new migraine preventer that won U.S. approval in May. Amgen offered all new patients two free months of the medicine.
The company is trying to get around barriers large insurers are setting for patients prescribed the costly new headache treatment. Amgen said it had already negotiated contracts with payers covering around 30 percent of commercially-insured patients in the United States.
Amgen announced that longtime research chief Sean Harper is stepping down and will be replaced by David Reese, currently head of translational sciences and oncology at the company.
Murdo Gordon, who left his role as Bristol-Myers Squibb's (N:BMY) chief commercial officer earlier this week, will replace Tony Hooper as executive vice president of global commercial operations in September, the company said.

396,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>","Starbucks, others must pay California workers for tasks done after clocking out: court","By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - California's top state court said on Thursday that employers must pay their workers for small amounts of time they spend on work tasks after clocking out, in a ruling that will likely lead to the revival of a lawsuit against  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX).
The California Supreme Court said a rule under federal wage law that excuses companies from paying workers for small amounts of time that are difficult to record did not apply under California law.
The decision could be costly for many companies, particularly restaurants and retailers that have many hourly workers, since California, America's most populous state, is home to nearly 40 million people and about 10 percent of the U.S. workforce. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business group, warned the court in a brief backing Starbucks that such a ruling would encourage workers to file lawsuits seeking pay for ""trifling absurdities."" 
A Starbucks representative said the company was disappointed with the decision.
Shaun Setareh, who represents former Starbucks employee Douglas Troester in a 2012 lawsuit against the company, said the ruling would force many companies to change their employment practices.
Troester said that after Starbucks employees clock out of work, they are required to transmit sales data, set an alarm, and sometimes bring in patio furniture or walk coworkers to their cars. 
Those tasks could take up to 10 minutes each day, Troester said, and workers should have been paid for that time. In the 17 months he worked at Starbucks, he said he performed about 13 hours of unpaid work and was owed about $100. 
A federal judge in San Francisco in 2014 dismissed Troester's case, saying it would be impractical to require Starbucks to record the brief amount of time employees spent doing work tasks before leaving a store.
Troester appealed, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asked the California Supreme Court to decide whether the ""de minimis rule"" under federal law also applied under state law. 
The court said on Thursday that under California law, workers must generally be paid for any time they are required to be on their employers' premises. 
But the court said there could be cases involving tasks ""that are so irregular or brief in duration"" that companies are not required to pay for them. 
The 9th Circuit must now apply the court's decision in Troester's case, which will likely lead to the lawsuit against Starbucks being revived. 
The case is Troester v. Starbucks, California Supreme Court,  No. S234969.

(Reuters) - Intel Corp's (O:INTC) fast-growing data center business missed Wall Street targets on Thursday as the world's second-largest chipmaker faced stiff rivalry from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD), and it again delayed the release of its next-generation chips until the end of 2019.
The company's shares fell almost 5 percent in extended trading.
Sales to data centers that power mobile and web apps, which bring more profit than chips for personal computers, rose 26.9 percent to $5.55 billion in the second quarter ended June 30. Analysts had expected revenue of $5.63 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.
Intel has been increasingly catering to data centers as revenue from PCs has flattened since shipments peaked in 2011.
""We believe performance within Intel's data center business largely dictates the performance in the shares and view the slight miss versus consensus as a negative,"" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.
AMD, which has been gaining ground with its new server chips, beat estimates for quarterly profit and revenue on Wednesday, powered by its EPYC server processors.
On a conference call with investors, Intel Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said the firm expected PCs with its next-generation 10nm chips to be in stores during the 2019 holiday season. Murthy Renduchintala, Intel's chip architecture chief, said on the call that 10nm data center chips will be released ""shortly after"" the consumer PC chips.
Last quarter, the company said the 10nm chips were being pushed from 2018 to 2019 but did not specify when. Intel originally predicted the chips could be ready by 2015.
The compares to rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330) expecting 7nm chips to contribute more than 20 percent to its revenue next year.
But costs of the 10nm chips are also expected to put pressure on margins, company executives said. Another challenge to margin growth is an expected increase in sales of Intel's less-profitable modems that help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks. 
Earlier this week,  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) executives said they believed Apple Inc (O:AAPL) had selected Intel to be the sole supplier of modem chips in the next generation of iPhones. Apple and Intel did not comment on Qualcomm's claim.
Several analysts on Intel's earnings call expressed concern that its gross margin growth might slow in the fourth quarter, when Apple ships most of its iPhones. Intel executives did not mention Apple or the iPhone but acknowledged those chips are not as profitable as some of its others.
""We expect modem profitability to improve. We don't see it at the 60-plus percent gross margin level, but we do expect it to be a contributor to earnings performance as we go forward,"" Swan said.
Intel's net income rose to $5.01 billion, or $1.05 per share, from $2.81 billion, or 58 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. https:// Excluding items, the company earned $1.04 per share, beating expectations of 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company benefited from a stabilizing PC market, in which worldwide shipments grew for the first time in six years, according to research firm Gartner. Revenue in Intel's client computing business, which caters to PC makers and is still the biggest contributor to sales, rose 6.3 percent to $8.73 billion, beating FactSet estimates of $8.48 billion. Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $18.1 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and adjusted earnings of $1.15 per share, plus or minus 5 cents. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $17.60 billion on a profit of $1.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose 14.9 percent to $16.96 billion, above estimates of $16.77 billion. The company is searching for a new chief executive after Brian Krzanich was ousted last month following an investigation that found he had a consensual relationship with an employee in breach of company policy. Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan is acting as interim CEO. 
Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker which have gained 13 percent so far this year, fell 4.6 percent to $49.75 after the bell.

RABAT (Reuters) - China's Citic Dicastal will invest 350 million euros in building two aluminum car wheel factories in northern Morocco, Morocco's industry, trade and investments ministry said, joining a string of foreign car component-makers setting up in the country.
The first factory will be built in the Atlantic Free Zone in Kenitra and operate from 2019, while the second will be established later in Tangier Tech city, the two parties agreed. 
Citic Dicastal aims to produce 6 million units annually, most of which will be exported, the ministry said.
Investment incentives in industrial free zones and proximity to Europe as well as African markets are luring car component makers to invest in Morocco. French car makers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Peugeot  PSA (PA:PEUP) set up factories in Tangier and Kenitra respectively.
The government plans to bring the local sourcing rate of cars made in Morocco to 80 percent by 2020.
""Through this project, Dicastal expands its international investments and contributes to Morocco's industrial development and Moroccan-Chinese trade,"" Chairman of Citic Dicastal Xu Zuo said at the signing ceremony.
Last April, South Korea's Hands Corp (KS:143210) began building an aluminum wheel plant in Tangier at a total cost of 4.33 billion dirhams ($472 million), with an annual production capacity of 8 million units.
The automotive sector was the country's largest industrial exporting sector last year, with exports worth 70 billion dirhams. Up to June of this year, the sector led Morocco's exports with a rise of 19.1 percent to 35.973 billion dirhams compared to the same period a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States signaled on Thursday it is set to push ahead on trade talks with Canada and Mexico after agreeing to suspend hostilities over tariffs with Europe in a fragile deal that may clear the way for renewed pressure on China.
A surprise deal struck on Wednesday will see Washington suspend the imposition of any new tariffs on the European Union, including a proposed 25 percent levy on auto imports, and hold talks over tariffs on imports of European steel and aluminum.
The deal boosted share markets initially, and U.S. industrial shares were stronger on Thursday as fears of a trade war with Europe ebbed. 
Both sides claimed victory in the deal, reached by Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Washington. In return for the talks and a suspension of auto tariffs, the EU will import more soybeans and energy from the United States.
A White House official told Reuters that Juncker had shown greater flexibility than expected in the talks and that while there was no deadline for an overall deal, Trump retained the power to impose tariffs if progress was not made. 
One key aspect of the agreement, according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity, was that the two sides had agreed to work together to tackle China's market abuses. 
""They want to work together with us on China and they want to help us reform the WTO (World Trade Organization),"" said the official, adding that the Europeans came into the talks ""with a real positive spirit"".
Trump has announced a series of punitive tariffs on Chinese imports in a bid to halt a Chinese surge in high-technology industries that threatens to displace U.S. dominance. Both the U.S. and the EU charge that Chinese companies steal company secrets.
On the North American Free Trade Agreement talks with Canada and Mexico, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he was ""hopeful that we'll have an agreement in principal in the near future.""
""Whether it's one deal or two deals, so long as we get the right agreement, we're indifferent,"" Mnuchin told CNBC.
Trump and officials from his administration said the EU had given ground by agreeing to import more American goods and to hold talks on tariff reductions including on cars, an industry in which Trump has accused Europe of imposing heavy duties. 
EU officials said little had been given away by Juncker and that Europe had emerged as the winner by getting Trump to defer the threatened car tariffs which would have hit European carmakers hard.
The deal was hailed by commentators in the United States and Europe for drawing back from an escalation in a trade war that had threatened to take the world back to the kind of protectionism not seen since the 1930s, although some cautioned the relief may be only temporary.
French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to challenge the deal, saying on Thursday he would not discuss agriculture in talks with the United States.
If it holds, the US-EU pact could allow both to focus on China, whose economic rise threatens both. Lawmakers in Washington on Thursday passed legislation to slow Chinese investment in U.S. companies. In Europe, alarm bells have been sounded over China's growing economic influence there.
""U.S. and EU will be allied in the fight against China, which has broken the world trading system, in effect,"" Trump's economic adviser Larry Kudlow said. ""President Juncker made it very clear yesterday that he intended to help us, President Trump, on the China problem.""
CASUALTIES IN TRADE FIGHT
Since taking office last year, Trump has implemented policies to restrict what he sees as unfair competition from other countries. He tore up an agreement to join a Pacific trade pact, has threatened to pull out of NAFTA, and imposed steel and aluminum tariffs aimed at China.
In an effort to rein in China's high technology industries that he charges have stolen intellectual property from American companies, Trump has ramped up threats of tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports from China to $450 billion after China retaliated with its own duties on imports from the United States.
The impact has fallen mainly on U.S. farmers and Republican party lawmakers. A move by Trump to offset farmers' losses with a $12 billion aid package drew criticism with farmers saying they wanted access to markets rather than subsidies. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a veteran of trade negotiations from former President Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s who is Trump's top trade official, told lawmakers in Washington that the United States could not afford to capitulate to China economically.
""I don't think it's a stupid fight,"" Lighthizer said of the trade battle with China in heated exchanges in the Senate. ""I don't know a single person that has read this report that thinks it's a stupid fight to say China should not be able to come in and steal the future of American industry.""
A more conciliatory tone emerged from Mnuchin, who told CNBC the United States was willing to reopen trade talks with China if Beijing was willing to make ""serious changes,"" as he said the EU had indicated it was willing to do.
In May, the United States and China initially appeared willing to strike a deal that would see China reduce its $350 billion surplus in the trading of goods by buying more U.S. agriculture and energy products. 
That deal fell apart quickly and has been replaced with a rising tally of tariff retaliation that has led to Trump threatening tariffs on almost everything the United States imports from China.
China has threatened to retaliate dollar for dollar, and its refusal to sign off on regulatory approval caused a $44 billion deal from  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) to buy  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI) to fall apart, a move that showed U.S. companies were being targeted unfairly, Mnuchin said.

404,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 05:38PM ET</span>","Amazon beats estimates, Wall St. breathes sigh of relief","By Noel Randewich and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall St breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday after Amazon.com's quarterly results beat estimates, sending the online retailer's stock to a record high and alleviating fears of deepening troubles across the FANG group after Facebook's results sent its shares reeling.
A 19 percent plunge in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares rattled Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) investors earlier in the day, with traders in Amazon's options displaying heightened defensiveness ahead of its June-quarter report after the bell.
Facebook late on Wednesday warned about a margin hit as revenue growth slows and user privacy costs climb.
The social network's dismal forecast followed a disappointing report by fellow FANG company Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) on July 16. The so-called FANG stocks, which also include Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have been central to Wall Street's rally in recent years, and any serious weakness in their revenues and profit expansions could make future stock market gains more difficult.
""Even though we had a bump in the road with Facebook and Netflix, we're not derailing the tech story,"" said Synovus Trust portfolio manager Daniel Morgan after Amazon's report. ""It's a huge sigh of relief."" 
Following its upbeat report after the bell, Amazon's stock rose 3.2 percent to a record high $1,866, more than making up for a 3 percent loss during Thursday's trading session.
As Amazon expands into grocery retail through its acquisition of Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) last year, and as more businesses move their IT departments onto its cloud infrastructure, its stock price has been red hot. Amazon recently traded at 110 times expected earnings, compared to more-profitable but slower growing Apple's valuation of 15 times earnings.
Amazon's stock market value has surged more than 50 percent in 2018 and is now above $900 billion, closing in on Apple's $955 billion market capitalization.

In its report, Amazon forecast operating income of between $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion for the third quarter, beating analyst estimates of $843 million. The Seattle-based company's total net sales rose 39 percent to $52.89 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $53.40 billion.

""Since Amazon hit $1,000 a share, we've taken some money off the table, but we're not selling today,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""Of all the tech companies, Amazon to me is the most vital. It's the one with the brightest future.""

408,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Amazon Profits Jump; Sales Miss Forecasts
Following see-saw action this week in the tech sector, Amazon reported mixed numbers after the bell Thursday.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock gained about 2% in volatile after-hours trading following the release of earnings.
The company reported a big profit increase to $5.07 per share, but it was not clear if this was comparable to the $2.47 per share analysts predicted.
Sales came in at $52.9 billion, just shy of expectations. Third-quarter sales guidance of $54 billion to $57.5 billion was below forecasts for $58 billion.
Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell after hours. The company beat quarterly estimates on profit and revenue, but data center revenue was light.
2. Twitter Reports Friday; Costs, Shadow Banning in Focus
Amazon won’t be the only tech name moving the market Friday morning, as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is also set to release its quarterly numbers.
Analysts, on average, are expecting Twitter to report a profit of 16 cents per share, up from 5 cents per share in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue is forecast to come in a little less than $698 million.
It’s an important quarter for a company whose stock has more than doubled in the past year.
“One area of concern is about the company’s ability to keep its costs down at a time when it’s aggressively pushing the video strategy. In 2017, Twitter did a great job containing its spending and operating expenses fell 21%,” Haris Anwar wrote on Investing.com. “We might see some pressure on margins due to rising costs at a time when social media giants are trying to appease regulators by purging their networks of fake accounts, political bots and hate speech.”
Investors will also be looking to see if the company addresses President Donald Trump’s accusation that the company is shadow banning Republicans. The company has fixed the problem that was causing some prominent conservative accounts to not show up in search results, Vice reported.






3. 2Q GDP Expected to Rise More Than 4%
The first measure of second-quarter U.S. economic activity should give the market a good sense of what to expect in terms of interest rate hikes.
The U.S. GDP report will be released Friday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) and the consensus predicts growth of 4.1%. That would be more than twice
the 2.0% expansion seen in the first three months of the year and its strongest since the 5.2% reading in the third quarter of 2014.
Fox Business reported this week that U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic advisers are privately telling associates that GDP growth should rise to 4.3% to 4.4%.
Stronger-than-expected economic growth would support the Fed’s plans to continue with gradual rate hikes. Fed fund futures currently price in a quarter-point hike for September, with the probability for a second increase in December hovering just below 70%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool."
409,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Zuckerberg loses $16 billion in record Facebook fall,"By Vibhuti Sharma and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg's fortune took an almost $16 billion hit on Thursday, as the social media giant headed for the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history, a day after executives forecast years of lower profit margins.
At least 16 brokerages cut their price targets on Facebook after Chief Financial Officer David Wehner startled an otherwise routine call with analysts by saying the company faced a multi-year squeeze on its business margins.
That ""bombshell"", as one analyst termed it, played into concerns on Wall Street that Facebook's model could be under threat after a year that has been dominated by efforts to head off concerns over privacy and its role in global news flow.
Shares fell as much as 19.6 percent to $174.78, a decline that if sustained would wipe about $124 billion off the company's value - or nearly four times the entire market capitalization of  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR).
Dismal revenue, which initially pulled the stock down nearly 9 percent on Wednesday, clearly was not the end for wounded investors. 
""Over the next several years, we would anticipate that our operating margins will trend towards the mid-30s on a percentage basis,"" Wehner told the results conference call with analysts.
Facebook's margin fell to 44 percent in the second quarter from 47 percent a year ago as it spent heavily on security and initiatives to convince users the company was protecting their privacy.
The company also said that revenue growth from emerging markets and the company's Instagram app, which has been less affected by privacy concerns, would not be enough to repair the damage.
The impact on the rest of the FAANG group of high-flying tech stocks was marginal.
Shares in Alphabet (O:GOOGL) were unchanged while those in Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) dipped just a third of a percent. Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) fell 2.8 percent ahead of its own results report later on Thursday.
Of 47 analysts covering Facebook, 43 still rate the stock as ""buy"", two rate it ""hold"" and only two rate it ""sell"". Their median target price is $219.30.
MoffettNathanson analysts called the company's forecast ""either the new economic reality of their business model or a very public act of self-immolation to stave off further regulatory pressure"".
The $15.8 billion in net worth that Zuckerberg stands to lose in the move is equal to the wealth of the world's 81st-richest person, currently Japanese businessman Takemitsu Takizaki, according to Forbes real time data.
Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in recent years has trimmed, but not eliminated, the amount of Facebook shares in his clients’ accounts, and he said he sees the company as a three-year investment.
""We own it for its leadership in the tech industry,"" he said. ""It’s the F in FAANG, but what's to say that, 10 years from now, Facebook isn't the next Myspace and something else has taken its place?""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.44%. The S&P 500 fell 0.30%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 1.01%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock posted its biggest-ever one-day drop falling nearly 19% after it reported disappointing earnings and guidance on Wednesday, prompting investors to abandon one of their most popular holdings.
More than 70% of Facebook is owned by large institutional investors, according to the company's most recent filings at the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fallout from Facebook's selloff rattled other tech stocks, dragging the broader tech sector lower as both Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap NYSE:SNAP) stocks came under pressure.
Rising energy and industrial stocks, meanwhile, helped steady the broader market as the latter was supported by easing U.S.-Europe trade tensions.
President Donald Trump and the European Commission chief agreed to work together to resolve U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and Europe's retaliatory duties.
Energy stocks rallied as U.S. oil prices remained on track to snap a two-week losing streak after settling higher Thursday as disruptions in Saudi oil shipments supported sentiment.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery gained 31 cents to settle at $69.61 a barrel.
On the corporate earnings front, Comcast reported mixed quarterly results, as earnings beat but revenues missed consensus. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stock closed about 4% higher, however, as investors were impressed by the company's growth in its broadband business.
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) closed nearly 2% lower as easing U.S. sales growth for the second quarter overshadowed higher earnings and revenue that beat estimates. McDonald's reported that sales at U.S. locations that have been open at least a year grew by 2.6%. That missed analysts' expectations for 3%.
After the bell, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose as the company reported a profit of $5.07 per share. It was not immediately clear if that was comparable to the $2.47 per share analysts expected. Sales for the quarter missed expectations and third-quarter sales guidance was also below forecast.
In economic news, a trio of economic reports showing rising initial jobless claims, a widening trade deficit and slower durable goods orders did little to sway investor optimism on the U.S. economy ahead of GDP data due Friday.
Ahead of the GDP data, President Trump’s chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said GDP will likely be a ""very good"" number, according to Fox Business Network.

Chipotle shares, which have soared over 56 percent this year, mainly buoyed by optimism around its new CEO, rose 5.2 percent in extended trading.
The company has benefited from an increase in menu prices, a move that is seen as out of sync as most big restaurant chains, especially fast-food joints, rely on low-price value menus to boost sales and market share.
However, the burrito chain, considered more premium than other fast food rivals, has largely escaped the intense competition in the value space that took a toll on McDonald's Corp's (N:MCD) quarterly U.S. same-store sales earlier on Thursday.
Sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.3 percent in the second quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected a rise of 2.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net income fell to $46.9 million, or $1.68 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $66.73 million, or $2.32 per share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 8.3 percent to $1.27 billion, hurt by a charge related to the closure of some underperforming restaurants.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 04:27PM ET</span>",U.S. House passes defense bill targeting Chinese investments,"By Ginger Gibson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed a $716 billion defense authorization bill that aims to rein in China's investments in the United States and prohibits the U.S. government from using technology from major Chinese telecommunications firms.
The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, which must also be approved by the Senate, passed the House by a vote of 359-54. While the measure puts controls on U.S. government contracts with ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] because of national security concerns, the restrictions are far weaker than initially drafted.
Additionally, in an action largely targeted at China, it also strengthens the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews proposed foreign investments to weigh whether they present national security concerns.
The White House praised House passage of the legislation, noting that it includes a pay raise for military troops. 
""It also takes positive steps that are consistent with the Administration’s commitment to maintaining a strong and resilient manufacturing and defense industrial base,"" Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement.
The sprawling piece of legislation - which is necessary to approve ongoing military operations - has historically enjoyed strong bipartisan support.
Earlier in July, U.S. lawmakers cut measures from a defense bill that would have reinstated sanctions on ZTE Corp, abandoning an attempt to punish the company for illegally shipping U.S. products to Iran and North Korea.
Lawmakers from both parties have been at odds with Republican President Donald Trump over his decision last week to lift his earlier ban on U.S. companies selling to ZTE, allowing China's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker to resume business.
An amendment backed by two Republicans and two Democrats would have reinstated the sanctions but was stripped out of the must-pass defense policy bill, lawmakers said on Friday.
Lawmakers were also using the military authorization bill as a vehicle to pass new rules governing investment by foreign-owned entities in the United States.
""This agreement ensures the reforms to CFIUS are narrowly focused on national security while keeping America’s doors open to investment,"" said Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
The remit of CFIUS, an interagency group led by the Treasury Department that assesses mergers and stock buys by foreign investors and companies to ensure that purchases do not harm national security, was broadened.
    Nothing in the bill will change CFIUS' basis decision-making process - the deals that were ordered scrapped by CFIUS previously will still be scrapped and the deals that were allowed will still be allowed, according to several CFIUS experts.
    That said, the legislation will expand the number of minority investments reviewed by CFIUS and allows for abbreviated reviews of less controversial deals. It also provides for more funding for the agency.
""It expands CFIUS' jurisdiction,"" Stephen Heifetz, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, said in a telephone interview. 
Separately, the legislation would authorize spending $7.6 billion for 77 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets, made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT).

It would prohibit delivery of the advanced aircraft to fellow NATO member Turkey. U.S. officials have warned Ankara that a Russian missile defense system that Turkey plans to buy cannot be integrated into the NATO air and missile defense system.

Shares of the company, which issues private-label cards as well as co-branded cards, fell 10 percent to $30.15 in late-afternoon trading.
Synchrony's strategic options for its Walmart cards program, including a possible sale, is expected to fully offset the impact to its earnings per share, according to a regulatory filing from Synchrony.
Earlier on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart had chosen  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF) as the new issuer of its store credit card, citing people familiar with the matter.
Under the deal, Capital One will issue credit cards that can only be used on Walmart's website and stores, as well as co-branded cards that can be used almost anywhere else, the Journal reported. 
Synchrony said it expects to use the majority of $2.5 billion that could come from the sales of its Walmart portfolio to buy back shares by the end of 2019. 

Walmart and Capital One did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Northrop CEO grilled by U.S. lawmakers over space telescope,"By Joey Roulette
(Reuters) -  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) CEO Wes Bush faced tough questions from U.S. lawmakers about the delays and growing price tag for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and rebuffed the idea that the company, rather than taxpayers, should pay an $800 million cost overrun.
Northrop is the primary contractor for the project, NASA's long-planned successor to the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, but the Webb telescope's overall mission price tag has skyrocketed over the years and is now pegged at $9.66 billion.
Bush acknowledged in testimony in Washington to the House of Representatives science committee that Northrop ""human errors"" contributed to the telescope's rising costs and delays. But Bush said Northrop is ""fully committed"" to the project's success.
The telescope's development costs of $8.8 billion have exceeded an $8 billion funding cap set by Congress. NASA is asking lawmakers to approve funding to cover the $800 million difference.
Asked by the committee's Republican chairman, Lamar Smith, whether he would agree to pay the extra $800 million instead of the taxpayers, Bush said ""that would be the wrong approach"" and would ""significantly impede and impair the relationship between NASA and Northrop Grumman.""
Having the company pay ""would be justified given the poor record and given the poor management,"" Smith responded.
""I only wish that Northrop Grumman was willing to take responsibility and show a little bit more good faith, both to the taxpayer and for the cost overruns,"" Smith added.
A June 27 report by an independent review board set up by NASA described ""human-induced errors"" and other problems that forced a postponement of the planned launch by 29 months from October 2018 to March 2021 - at a cost of an extra $1 billion. The problems included loose nuts and bolts, the wrong solvent being used to clean propulsion vales and improper test wiring that caused excess voltage to be applied to devices called transducers.
""Having been delayed 14 years, and now costing 19 times the original cost, is just probably the worst example of bad management any of us have ever seen or heard about,"" Smith told Reuters in an interview.
During the hearing, Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher noted that other deserving NASA missions may have lost out on funding because of this project's ballooning costs.
""Your group that was handling this, and your company, failed. They failed us, and they failed the American people. ... The question is, is it worth all those other projects that we've been unable to fund in this committee because you have failed your job?"" Rohrabacher asked Bush.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - John Schnatter, the founder and ousted former chairman of Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA), on Thursday sued the pizzeria chain, complaining that the company had not provided adequate response to an earlier request for internal documents. 
The complaint, Schnatter v.  Papa Johns International  Inc filed in Delaware Chancery Court, comes after a request by Schnatter and his attorneys access to company documents to inspect accusations of inappropriate behavior. 
""Mr. Schnatter's attorneys are seeking to inspect Company documents because of the unexplained and heavy-handed way in which the Company has treated him since the publication of a story that falsely accused him of using a racial slur,"" Schnatter's attorneys said in a statement.  
The lawsuit is the latest installation in a weeks-long drama surrounding the pizza chain following a report by Forbes this month that Schnatter had used the ""n-word"" during a media training call. 
""Colonel Sanders called blacks n-----s,"" Schnatter reportedly said during an exchange on how he could separate himself from online hate groups. 

Schnatter resigned as chairman of the company's board amid the controversy, though he would later say he regretted his decision to step down.

421,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",Japan's Benchmark Bond Yield Touches One-Year High on BOJ Bets,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s 10-year yield climbed to 0.1 percent, the highest in more than a year, as speculation that the central bank may discuss adjusting its ultra-loose monetary policy next week continued to rattle the bond market.
The benchmark yield has more than doubled from last Friday as media reports suggested that Bank of Japan officials are debating ways to mitigate the side effects of its policy on lenders. The yield continued to rise even after the BOJ signaled its intention to cap the advance by offering to buy an unlimited amount of bonds on Monday. It didn’t make such an offer on Thursday.
The speculation around BOJ’s policy has roiled global markets this week, causing yield curves in Japan and other countries including the U.S. and Australia to steepen as traders hedged against the possibility of the Asian nation’s bond funds pivoting home. Any change to BOJ’s policy would be the first since September 2016, when it began the yield curve control.
""The BOJ probably refrained from stepping in to conduct a fixed-rate operation as the 10-year yield didn’t go over 0.1 percent decisively,” said Hidenori Suezawa, chief bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “Volatility was lower today compared with Monday. The BOJ acted then as the yield had jumped sharply and abruptly.”
The 10-year yield was up two basis points at 0.085 percent as of 4:05 p.m. in Tokyo. It rose as much as 3.5 basis points earlier to 0.1 percent, the first time since July last year, according to data from the Japan Bond Trading Co. The yen was 0.2 percent higher to 110.71 against the dollar.
Testing BOJ
The yield pared its advance even as the BOJ refrained from conducting another fixed-rate operation to try and tame markets. Monday was only the fifth time the central bank offered to buy an unlimited amount of bonds since the introduction of the YCC. Only one operation in February 2017 led to purchases.
Traders may be testing if the BOJ is indeed leaning toward allowing the 10-year yield to be more flexible, said Makoto Suzuki, senior bond strategist of Okasan Securities Group in Tokyo.
The driver for the yield gain on Thursday may have been a new Jiji report. The BOJ may raise the threshold for its fixed-rate operations, while retaining its zero percent target, Jiji had said overnight, according to a Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities Co. report.
At BOJ’s July 30-31 review, officials will discuss ways to keep their stimulus program sustainable while reducing the harm it causes in markets and to the profitability of commercial banks, earlier reports from Reuters, Asahi and Bloomberg have indicated.
Stealth Tapering
“We think they might do something, but nothing that’s going to upset the JGB market to any great extent,” said Craig Vardy, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s head of fixed income, Australia.
The BOJ could allow the 10-year bond yield more scope to move from the zero percent that it has targeted, while another option would be to change the wording on a target of increasing holdings of sovereign bonds by 80 trillion yen ($723 billion) a year, he said.
The BOJ has already been conducting “stealth tapering” by slowly cutting bond purchases over time. It added slightly less than 50 trillion yen worth of securities to its balance sheet in the year through March.
The dilemma for Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is that even as calls to adjust policy grow louder, persistently weak inflation dictates the need to maintain stimulus. Winding it back would strengthen the yen, further undermining efforts to spur price-gains, while also hitting Japanese exporters.
While Kuroda and his board have said they would consider discussing an exit from the stimulus policy from fiscal 2019, they have also consistently reiterated that there would be no change until the BOJ’s inflation target of 2 percent has been reached.
“If the BOJ wants to lighten the side effects of its own stimulus, then it will most likely move to a direction to push longer-dated JGB yields higher,” said Tsuyoshi Ueno, a Tokyo-based senior economist at NLI Research Institute, a unit of Nippon Life Insurance. U.S. Treasuries will become the biggest casualty if long-dated bond JGB yields actually start climbing, given the already-high cost of hedging dollar investments, he said."

""Due to medical privacy, the company had no knowledge of the facts relating to Mr. Marchionne's health,"" a Fiat Chrysler spokesman said. 
Questions have been raised about how long Marchionne, who died on Wednesday, was ill and how much the company knew before it made the situation public.
Marchionne rescued Fiat and Chrysler from bankruptcy after taking the wheel of the Italian carmaker in 2004 and he multiplied Fiat's value 11 times through 14 years of canny dealmaking. He was due to step down at FCA in April next year.
""The company was made aware that Mr. Marchionne had undergone shoulder surgery and released a statement about this,"" the spokesperson said.
""On Friday July 20, the Company was made aware with no detail by Mr. Marchionne's family of the serious deterioration in Mr. Marchionne's condition and that as a result he would be unable to return to work. The Company promptly took and announced the appropriate action the following day.""
The announcement of the death of Marchionne, 66, one of the
auto industry's most tenacious and respected CEOs, drew tributes
from rivals and tears from his closest colleagues on Wednesday.
University Hospital Zurich said earlier on Thursday Marchionne had been having treatment for a serious illness for more than a year before his death.
Marchionne had fallen gravely ill after what the company had
described as shoulder surgery at a Zurich hospital. He was replaced as chief executive last weekend after Fiat Chrysler (FCA) said his condition had worsened.
""Mr. Sergio Marchionne was a patient at USZ. Due to serious illness, he had been the recipient of recurring treatment for more than a year,"" the hospital said in a statement.
""Although all the options offered by cutting-edge medicine were utilized, Mr. Marchionne unfortunately passed away.""

University Hospital Zurich declined to comment on Marchionne's illness, but said it deeply regretted his death and expressed its condolences to his family.

423,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 01:29PM ET</span>",Europe gives U.S.-EU trade reprieve a measured welcome,"By Madeline Chambers and Leigh Thomas
BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Europe expressed relief on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump and the European Commission chief agreed to tackle their transatlantic trade row, although France cautioned that any deal must be limited and benefit both sides.
Reaction on financial markets ranged from enthusiasm on stock exchanges to scepticism among currency investors, while commodities experts said Trump's proclamation that Europe would buy ""lots of"" soybeans from U.S. farmers hit by his trade row with China was not all that it seemed.
After meeting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House on Wednesday, Trump agreed to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the European Union and the United States start talks on cutting other trade barriers.
Talks would seek to ""resolve"" U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and Europe's retaliatory duties, a step back from Trump's import protections for U.S. metal producers.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a conservative, hailed the talks as a ""breakthrough"" that could avoid a trade war and save millions of jobs. ""Great for global economy,"" he tweeted late on Wednesday.
Business lobbies were relieved. ""Reason has prevailed,"" BusinessEurope President Pierre Gattaz said. 
However, Germany's DIHK chambers of Commerce noted that U.S. auto tariffs were not totally off the table. ""The proposed solutions move in the right direction but a significant proportion of scepticism remains,"" the DIHK said.
European stocks rose on Thursday, with shares in carmakers  Fiat  (MI:FCHA),  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG) all up by between 2 and 5 percent.
Reaction from Social Democrat members of the German coalition government was more measured. ""This is not yet the result we are aiming for but it has made a positive result in the whole discussion ... on free trade or protectionism more likely than before,"" Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in Seoul.
Referring to Trump's description of the European Union earlier this month as a ""foe"" on trade, he told a news conference: ""America and Europe are not opponents ... We are partners and allies with common values and interests.
""The answer to America First can only be: Europe United,"" he added.
LARGELY SYMBOLIC
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi called the Washington meeting a good sign. ""It shows that there is a willingness to discuss trade issues in a multilateral framework again,"" he said, but added: ""It would be difficult for us to go beyond that because we really don't know the substance of it.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected a trade deal to come out in stages. He told CNBC that U.S. and European officials had ""concluded an outline of an agreement"" and planned to move forward to ""turn it into a real agreement"", but gave few details.
The response from France was also cautious. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the discussions with Washington but said he does not want to enter into a wide-ranging negotiation.
""Each side, the Europeans and the Americans, must find something in these discussions. Any trade deal must be based on reciprocity,"" he said in remarks distributed by his office.
With French framers forming a strong lobby, Le Maire added that agriculture must remain outside of any negotiation as Europe could not ease its food safety and environmental norms.
After the talks, Trump highlighted benefits for U.S. farmers. ""The European Union is going to start, almost immediately, to buy a lot of soybeans,"" he told reporters.
However, market watchers said that Europe has already been a heavy buyer of U.S. soybeans since prices plunged in June as China has largely stopped buying them in retaliation for trade measures that Trump has targeted at Beijing. 
Stefan Vogel, head of agricultural commodity markets research at Rabobank, described the statements from Washington as largely symbolic. ""More purchases by the EU of U.S. soybeans will certainly take place in coming months but this would be for business reasons rather than the Trump/Juncker agreement,"" he said.
Currency markets were circumspect about the outcome of the Washington meeting as investors waited for the fine print.

""The one thing we have learned from the last 18 months of Trump’s gyrating trade policies is that whatever looks certain today is likely to be undermined tomorrow,"" Gavekal strategists said in a note.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) missed quarterly U.S. same-store sales estimates for the first time in at least two years amid fierce competition in a slack restaurant market, sending its shares down as much as 2.3 percent in midday trading. 
The burger giant has committed to a discount-value menu program and other specials -- notably its $1, $2 and $3 menus -- as it competes with long-time rivals and fast-growing chains like privately held Chick-fil-A, Yum Brands Inc's (N:YUM) Taco Bell and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN). 
""We don't strive to win on value, but we won't lose either,"" said Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan, on the restaurant chain's second-quarter earnings call. 
The company's stock, a component of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial index, fell to $155.31 in midday trading. Shares have dropped nearly 10 percent since the start of the year, underperforming the S&P 500 Restaurants sub index <.SPLRCREST>, which is down about 6.4 percent in the year to date. 
The company, which had said in the previous quarter it saw weakness in the highly competitive U.S breakfast category, said on Thursday that segment remained weak.
McDonald's quarterly sales at its U.S. restaurants open for at least 13 months grew at its slowest pace in over a year, at just 2.6 percent. That missed the average analyst estimate of a 2.96 percent rise.
Outside of the United States, business was healthier, with same-store sales for the company's international markets, including France and Britain, jumping 4.9 percent. Analysts had forecast a more modest growth of 3.94 percent. 
This helped McDonald's worldwide sales at stores open for at least 13 months to grow 4 percent, exceeding analyst estimates for 3.60 percent growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net income rose to about $1.50 billion, or $1.90 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.40 billion, or $1.70 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.99 per share, beating the estimate of $1.92.

Revenue fell 12 percent to $5.35 billion, but edged past expectations for $5.32 billion.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Prudential Financial to take over $923 million in Raytheon pension benefits,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - U.S. insurer  Prudential  Financial Inc (N:PRU) will take over $923 million in pension obligations from Tomahawk missile maker  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN) in a deal that will cover about 13,000 U.S. Raytheon retirees, the companies said on Thursday.
Prudential (LON:PRU) has entered an agreement to pay pension benefits to the Raytheon retirees and their beneficiaries through an annuity, the companies said.
The deal, known as a pension risk transfer, is the most recent example of a growing trend among U.S. companies buying group annuities from insurers in order to unload their corporate pension plans. 
Prudential Financial Inc, the biggest player in pension transfers, has been in the business since 1928. But rising interest rates and stock market gains are now helping to fuel more deals. That is because companies can more easily meet the requirement of fully funding their plans before selling them.
In May, U.S. insurer MetLife (NYSE:MET) entered into an agreement to provide pension benefits for about 41,000 FedEx Corp (N:FDX) retirees and beneficiaries. The deal included about $6 billion in pension obligations, the companies said.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Several banks dismissed from U.S. metals price-fixing lawsuits,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has dismissed five large banks from two antitrust lawsuits by investors alleging multi-year conspiracies to rig prices for hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions in the global silver and gold markets.
U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni threw out all claims over alleged silver price-fixing against Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP),  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG).
The Manhattan judge also dismissed UBS from the gold-fixing case. Her decisions issued on Wednesday night totaled 87 pages.
Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the silver investors, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Daniel Brockett, a lawyer for the gold investors, declined to comment.
The cases are among several in Manhattan accusing big banks of manipulating financial markets at investors' expense.
Silver investors had accused Bank of Nova Scotia (""ScotiaBank"") (TO:BNS),  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) of fixing prices from 2007 to 2013.
After settling with Deutsche Bank for $38 million in 2016, the investors obtained 350,000 pages of documents and 75 audio tapes, including chat messages, that they said offered ""smoking gun"" evidence that the five other banks broke the law despite not being part of the fix.
One chat message came from a Paribas trader who wrote: ""CANT WAIT FOR ANOTHER DAY WHEN WE GET THE BULLDOZER OUT THE GARAGE ON GOLD OR SIL, THEY ARE MY FIRST PORT OF CALL HAHAHAHAHAH.""
But the judge found no overarching conspiracy among fixing and non-fixing banks.
""Though the [complaint] plausibly alleges that the fixing banks conspired to depress the Fix Price, it does not explain why the non-fixing banks, which are competitors and counterparties, would be in on the agreement,"" she wrote.
Caproni also said that while the chat messages suggested a limited conspiracy to ""episodically"" manipulate silver prices, the investors lacked antitrust standing to pursue that claim.
The gold investors' claims covered 2004 to 2013, including alleged manipulation through twice-daily meetings among ScotiaBank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Barclays and  Societe Generale  SA (PA:SOGN) to set the London Gold Market Fixing.
Though UBS was not at those meetings, gold investors said it used its large trading position to move prices in tandem with those banks. Caproni disagreed, finding no ""plausible link.""
Deutsche Bank settled with gold investors for $60 million in 2016.
Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank, said Caproni's reasoning ""should help the market because it gives investors more confidence in the pricing mechanism.""
Caproni scheduled an Aug. 24 status conference for both lawsuits.The cases are In re London Silver Fixing Ltd Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-md-02573; and In re Commodity Exchange Inc Gold Futures and Options Trading Litigation in the same court, No. 14-md-02548.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 11:57AM ET</span>","Comcast shares rise on internet customer, profit growth","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) on Thursday reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates as it added more high-speed internet customers, part of a push to diversify away from the shrinking U.S. pay-TV market. 
Comcast, which dropped its pursuit of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) entertainment assets last week after a bidding war with Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), is still in the hunt to acquire a controlling stake in European pay-TV company Sky PLC (L:SKYB) to expand internationally.
Shares of Comcast were up 3.7 percent to $34.66 in morning trading after the results.
Chief Executive Brian Roberts told investors on a conference call that Comcast walked away from its bid for the Fox assets because it could not justify the escalating price.
Sky posted double-digit earnings growth earlier on Thursday as it added another 500,000 customers, underscoring why Comcast is battling Fox to acquire a majority stake in the company.
Comcast's revenue from high-speed internet customers rose 9.3 percent to $4.26 billion during the second quarter as it added 260,000 internet subscribers, above the average estimate of 200,000 from analysts at MoffettNathanson and Macquarie.
Comcast said it has increased its marketing for internet-only subscribers, since internet has higher profit margins than cable, which are diminished by TV programming costs.
The growth in internet connections is ""more than offsetting the pressure on video and the outlook for the second half of the year is strong,"" said Kevin Roe, an analyst at Roe Equity Research.
Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable provider, shed 140,000 video customers during the quarter, up from 34,000 customers in the prior-year quarter, as TV viewers opt for cheaper streaming options, such as AT&T Inc's (N:T) newly launched WatchTV at $15.
While streaming platforms will continue to pressure Comcast's cable TV business, it will increase demand for high-speed broadband, said Roberts. 
Net income attributable to Comcast rose 27.6 percent to $3.2 billion, or 69 cents per share, from $2.5 billion, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding adjustments, Comcast earned 65 cents per share, up from 52 cents per share last year, beating analyst estimates of 60 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Comcast's revenue rose 2.1 percent from the previous year to $21.7 billion but fell short of analyst estimates of $21.86 billion.
Revenue from NBCUniversal was flat year on year, because of a revenue decline for its movie studios, as hit movie ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" opened late in the quarter.

451,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Trump's plan for U.S. LNG in Europe to face reality check,"By Vera Eckert, Oleg Vukmanovic and Sabina Zawadzki
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's plan for ""vast amounts"" of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to be sold to the European Union after trade talks with its top representative faces a reality test.
After a meeting at the White House with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday, Trump said the EU would also buy more U.S. soybeans and work with Washington to cut other trade barriers to zero.
""European Union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately. Also, they will be buying vast amounts of LNG!,"" Trump wrote in a Tweet.
Juncker said the EU would build more terminals to handle America's LNG.
It appeared that a major LNG deal between the trading partners had been struck. 
In reality, three-quarters of Europe's existing import facilities lie empty while demand for U.S. LNG on the continent remains limited. 
The most lucrative markets for U.S. LNG are in South and Central America, India and the Far East, with Europe near the bottom of the pile given its relatively low prices and ample supplies of gas via pipelines from Russia and Norway.
(For a graphic on 'The most profitable export destinations for U.S. LNG' click https://reut.rs/2mNaXql)
Global gas price signals determine LNG trade flows, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said on Thursday. 
""Will U.S. LNG reach Europe? Yes, but only if there is an arbitrage opportunity that makes sense,"" he said.
Politicians have little sway over this. The EU applies zero tariffs on U.S. LNG imports, so cutting them is not an option to boost trade in any future U.S.-EU talks.
Europe's declining domestic production of gas from the North Sea, Netherlands, Germany and Norway leaves a growing gap for Russia and potential LNG suppliers in the United States to exploit. 
EU gas production will halve by 2040, the International Energy Agency says. 
By then, 84 percent of gas will be imported against 71 percent 2016, it says, although it could be less if green energy expands faster and energy efficiency gains reduce the need for gas.
Trump told reporters on Wednesday that Europe would be a massive buyer of LNG to diversify its energy supply - ""And we have plenty of it."" 
A number of European companies have already announced plans to buy LNG from a new wave of planned U.S. projects.
Portugal's Galp, Italy's Edison, Britain's  BP  (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell are all lining up to lift LNG from Venture Global's planned Calcasieu Pass project in Louisiana. 
But supply from these and other projects will not be ready for years and even then there is no guarantee it will come to Europe in meaningful quantities if more lucrative markets, such as China, emerge. 
The benefit of lifting supplies from the U.S. is that a buyer can divert shipments to the highest bidder anywhere in the world without needing the approval of the seller. 
Thomas Kusterer, chief financial officer for German utility EnBW (DE:EBKG), said on Thursday that he would consider purchasing U.S. LNG if it became cheaper than other sources.
Having more LNG options will help Europe avoid being overcharged by Russia, analysts say.
""LNG is a valuable option for Europe, it can create negotiating power,"" said Hanns Koenig of Berlin-based Aurora Energy Research.

The United States in April imposed sanctions against billionaire Oleg Deripaska and the eight companies in which he is a large shareholder, including Rusal, in response to what it called ""malign activities"" by Russia.
But the sanctions, the toughest since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea, roiled aluminum markets and were later watered down. The Treasury Department has since warmed to the idea of removing Rusal from the list altogether.
Mnuchin, speaking to reporters at the White House, declined to say how soon Rusal's sanctions could be lifted. 
""The intent was to change the behavior of the oligarch,"" he said. ""We weren't looking to put sanctions on aluminum companies and I think we're in productive discussions with the company to resolve those issues.""

A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics says prices will rise regardless of whether the vehicle is imported or made in the U.S. because all cars contain some foreign content.Here's a look at some of 2017's top-selling compact vehicles and their estimated price increase, if manufacturers pass along 100% of the tariff.The Honda Civic, with sales of almost 378,000 last year, will cost $1,700 more because 40% of its content is foreign based.The Toyota RAV 4 crossover SUV has 65% foreign content.

Since July, the Mercedes-Benz GLE sports utility vehicle which is built in Tuscaloosa, Alabama is being hit by tariffs when it is exported to China, hurting Daimler profits. 
Asked whether Daimler would consider manufacturing the Mercedes GLE at its factory in Beijing, Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said, ""Of course we look at when parameters change, and how one could react to this, and whether we can set ourselves up in a better way."" 
""We are thinking about such matters, but so far we have not come to a decision.""

Zetsche added that recalibrating the production footprint was costly and time consuming since it also required reconfiguring the supplier network.

459,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 09:56AM ET</span>","Zuckerberg warned everyone 3 months ago bad news was coming, and no one listened"," Facebook has not had a worse quarter than  last night's earning's since going public in 2012, according to Wall Street and City analysts' notes this morning. Their headlines are almost comically brutal:
Facebook stock plunged nearly 24% last night after CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned of slowing revenue growth. In after-hours trading, the stock was down 20.2% at $217.50.
But here is the thing: Zuckerberg, COO Sheryl Sandberg, and CFO David Wehner warned everyone three months ago that bad news was coming, and no one listened. (No one?  Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) might have been an exception.)
To understand what happened last night, and to comprehend why one of the most successful stocks in tech history is now being utterly battered by the market, you need to go back to  the Q1 2018 earnings call and read what Zuck et al actually said. Then compare that to last night's call. Once you've done that, you'll know that the worst might be yet to come.
Zuckerberg warned everyone what he was about to do:
1. Focus on safety, security, and privacy.
2. Prevent harm, hate speech.
3. Restrict developers.
4. Force transparency on advertisers.
5. Focus on ""meaningful"" engagement, and tolerate declines of non-meaningful engagement.
6. Cut passive interaction.
7. ""2018 is a year of important investment.""
8. Caution on GDPR: ""There's certainly potential for some impact. Any change of the ability for us and our advertisers to use data can impact our optimization potential at the margin, which could impact our ability to drive price improvements in the long run. So we'll just have to watch how that plays out over time.""
Crucially, none of those priorities were about audience or revenue growth. Most of them are clearly negative for both those issues.
Sandberg added:
1. Users will get option to cut ads.
2. Users get more control over ads.
That's the same thing. More hurdles for advertisers.
CFO David Wehner said:
1. ""We're seeing a decrease in certain types of time spent such as passive video consumption as a result of that and an increase in areas like sharing. So, we're not really optimizing the business on time spent, but rather the kind of quality of conversations and connections.""
2. ""On the GDPR trend, ... [we] expect there would be a flat to down impact on MAU and DAU.""
3. ""I don't know that we really see a doomsday scenario here. I think what we think is that depending on how people react to the controls and the ad settings, there could be some limitations to data usage. We believe that those will be relatively minor. ... there is a potential to impact targeting for our advertisers. Obviously, if they are less able to target effectively, they'll get a lower ROI on their advertising campaigns.""
Same again.
They're not talking about growth. They're talking about cutting bad activity. Tolerating reductions in engagement and revenue. That's all negative for revenue and audience growth.
 Zuckerberg said:
1. More security around elections.
2. More AI vs bad content.
3. GDPR was bad.
4. Security and privacy.
5. News feed restricted to friends and family - more of that coming.
6. ""We're going to keep on moving in this direction.""
Zuck is very, very concerned that when people use social they feel miserable. He is focused on only positive interactions, not total interactions or growth. And that is not about revenue or audience growth.
Sandberg said:
1. We're working on safety.
2. ""GDPR has not had a revenue impact, but we also recognize it wasn't fully rolled out this quarter. It was very encouraging for us to see that the vast majority of people affirmed that they want us to use information, including from the websites they visit, to make their ads more relevant. But, as we look further out, we recognize that there's still risk, and we're going to watch closely.""
Translation: IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE. Only one-third of the GDPR impact has actually reached Facebook's accounts. And Europe is Facebook's biggest market — bigger than the US (a fact which probably does not get the profile it deserves on The Street).
Wehner said:
1. We suffer from currency headwinds (take that with a pinch of salt — they have currency issues every quarter).
2. Awful guidance: ""Our total revenue growth rates will continue to decelerate in the second half of 2018, and we expect our revenue growth rates to decline by high-single digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both Q3 and Q4.""
3. ""We plan to grow and promote certain engaging experiences like Stories that currently have lower levels of monetization, and we are also giving people who use our services more choices around data privacy, which may have an impact on our revenue growth.""
4. ""We would expect decel in the high-single digits for the next couple quarters. In terms of what is driving the deceleration, it's a combination of factors ... we're going to be focusing on growing engaging new experiences like Stories and promoting those. And that's going to have a negative impact on revenue growth. And then, finally, we're giving people who use the services more choice around privacy, and that's coming both in terms of impacts that could be ongoing from things like GDPR as well as other product options that we're providing that could have an impact on revenue growth. So it's a combination of all those factors that is leading to the deceleration of revenue growth in the second half.""
5. ""We had indicated in the first quarter that we would expect to see a decline. We're not providing any guidance on MAU and DAU in Europe on this call.""
6. ""When you look at the deceleration, the one that I called out was really Europe where you saw the currency impact as well as, to a lesser extent, GDPR causing sort of faster deceleration than in the other regions.""
7. ""So GDPR didn't have a significant impact in Q2, partially because of its implementation date. So you're just seeing effectively one month of it in terms of revenue. ""
8. ""Obviously, on the safety and security side, those are costs that are layering in that we think are the right thing to do for the business but don't necessarily have a revenue impact.""
The translation of what Wehner said is: Facebook is doing a bunch of stuff that doesn't drive revenue. Everything Facebook told us in Q1 turned out to be true — it hurt engagement and therefore revenue. And it could get worse! Or at least he cannot say it will get better, because the biggest hit from GDPR is yet to come. Facebook has only booked one month of GDPR impact in Q2. That means Q3 will be the first full quarter of GDPR impact.
Hold onto your hats."
460,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 09:51AM ET</span>",Sky expands against backdrop of takeover battle finale,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (L:SKYB) posted double-digit earnings growth after it added another 500,000 customers in its latest financial year, showing why Comcast and Rupert Murdoch's Fox are slugging it out to buy the European pay-TV leader.
""It's been an exceptional year of progress, delivering against our plans but also laying the groundwork for the future,"" Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch told reporters.
""[We are] excited about the opportunities ahead no matter what our future ownership structure is, we're certainly not slowing down.""
U.S. cable company Comcast (O:CMCSA) is leading the race to buy Sky after it offered 14.75 pounds a share this month, valuing the group at $34 billion. The bid came just hours after Fox (O:FOXA) had upped its own bid to 14 pounds.
Sky, which is already 39 percent owned by Fox, reported a 11 percent rise in core earnings for its established business to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) for the year to June 30. 
Revenue was up 5 percent to 13.59 billion pounds, beating a forecast by UBS, as the company said more than 23 million European households were subscribing to 63 million pay-TV, broadband and mobile services.
Darroch said Sky's content in sport, drama and entertainment would be bolstered by new partnerships with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), BT Sport, Mediaset Premium and Spotify.
Shares in Sky are trading at record levels, and above Comcast's latest offer, as investors bet that Fox will return with a higher bid. They were up marginally at 1,511 pence at 1240 GMT.
Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, said Sky had shown just why Fox and Comcast were fighting tooth and nail for control of the satellite broadcaster.
""These numbers and a bullish plan for further aggressive growth in the current financial year are clearly presented to squeeze the maximum from potential buyers,"" he said. ""It could work.""
(For a graphic on 'Sky share price as percentage of competing cash offers' https://reut.rs/2JU0WRn)
ORIGINAL CONTENT
The fight for Sky had been played out in the shadow of a bigger battle in the United States between Comcast and  Disney  (N:DIS) to buy most of Fox's assets, including its stake in Sky. 
Comcast conceded that contest to Disney a week ago, in part because the bidding war was inflating the value of Sky, given Fox's partial ownership, according to sources. 
Fox - and by proxy Disney - has until August 9 to increase its bid for Sky, a move which could cause British regulators to trigger an auction procedure.
The takeover battle, which started in December 2016, has not knocked Darroch off course in his strategy for Sky, centred around content, such as its own production ""Patrick Melrose"", partnerships with potential rivals and better technology.
Reports have said Comcast wants Darroch, in the top job since 2007, to stay if it buys Sky. The executive, however, said on Thursday it was too early to say whether he would remain after a sale. 
Analysts expect profit growth to accelerate in the coming years, helped by a reduction in the price the broadcaster will pay for English Premier League soccer rights from 2019. 
UBS said Sky had put in place the building blocks for future growth. ""Financials for Sky are inflecting after a period of investment and growth should accelerate going forward,"" it said.

Sky added 20,000 customers in Britain in its final quarter, which UBS said was below its forecast, but churn, a measure of the number of people leaving, fell to a decade low of 10.3 percent.

The U.S. dollar strengthened 5 percent against other major currencies in the three months ended June 30, its biggest advance since 2016. That helped limit Mastercard’s cross-border volume to 14 percent growth during the second quarter, compared with 21 percent in the first quarter. At Visa, growth also slowed to 15 percent in the period.
“We see the U.S. dollar as the key near-term risk for the networks,” Donald Fandetti, an analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., said in a note to clients.
Both companies’ stocks dropped in early trading in New York. Visa’s shares declined 1.2 percent at 9:03 a.m. in New York trading, while Mastercard’s stock dropped 2.5 percent.
Still, both companies topped analysts’ estimates for revenue and earnings in the quarter. Visa’s overall purchase volume also surpassed forecasts, while Mastercard’s total volume fell short of estimates.
Visa said Wednesday it now expects adjusted profit to rise by a percentage in the “low 30s” compared with its previous forecast in the “high 20s.” Mastercard left its forecast for full-year adjusted revenue and operating expenses unchanged.

Investors were spooked following commentary from the company late Wednesday that its revenue growth rates could slow by “high-single digits” in the third and fourth quarter. It also cautioned that expense growth was likely to outpace revenue growth next year.
Facebook shares, which closed at a record high on Wednesday ahead of the results, plunged roughly 18% to around $177.00, wiping out almost $120 billion in market value.
If the share drop holds, it would be Facebook's largest single-day decline ever, topping a 12% drop in July 2012.



Facebook's 'FANG' brethren were also lower as investors fled the sector.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which reports after the bell Thursday, lost 1.5%.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which disappointed FANG investors with its own set of weak results earlier this earnings season, shed about 1.1%.
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 1%.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Missile maker Raytheon slashes 2018 cash flow forecast,"(Reuters) - Tomahawk missile maker  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN) on Thursday lowered its forecast for annual cash flow due to a $1.25 billion pension contribution in the current quarter.
The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company expects 2018 operating cash flow from continuing operations of between $2.6 billion and $3 billion, down from an earlier expectation of $3.6 billion to $4 billion.
Besides the contribution, Raytheon will take a non-cash pension settlement charge of $288 million in the third quarter of 2018, resulting in earnings per share reduction of 79 cents.
Still, the maker of Paveway laser-guided bombs and SM-3 anti-ballistic missiles slightly raised its yearly earnings forecast thanks to a lower tax rate, derived from pension contribution benefits.
Raytheon expects 2018 earnings from continuing operations of between $9.77 and $9.97 per share, up from a previously expected range of $9.70 to $9.90 per share. The company said its 2018 effective tax rate will be about 10.5 percent, down from the prior 18 percent.
Raytheon expects annual sales of between $26.7 billion and $27.2 billion, the company said, some $200 million higher than its prior forecast.
Its revenue rose 5.5 percent to $6.63 billion in the second quarter ended July 1, driven by higher sales in its missile systems business, its biggest.
The results comes as Raytheon, like other U.S. defense contractors  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA), benefits from stronger global demand for weapons, fighter jets and tanks. Raytheon is also expected to gain from higher U.S. defense spending under the Donald Trump administration.
The company's income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders rose to $799 million or $2.78 per share in the second quarter, from $553 million or $1.89 per share a year earlier, helped chiefly by lower taxes.

Bookings, a measure of firm orders won by Raytheon, rose 33 percent to about $8.69 billion.

500,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 06:36AM ET</span>","Yuan volatility, interest costs cast a cloud over Chinese developers' earnings","By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's major property developers will report their first-half earnings next month, with some facing a sharp spike in interest costs and big foreign currency losses on overseas borrowing, and the hit could be harder in the second half.
The yuan weakened to a 13-month low this week as expectations of further policy easing piled pressure on the fragile currency, which has fallen steadily since April and suffered its worst month on record in June. 
The currency is expected to come under more pressure in the second half if the trade disputes intensify.
That could spell bad news for the likes of Shimao Property (HK:0813) and China  Evergrande  (HK:3333) as a weaker yuan makes interest payments for U.S. and Hong Kong dollar debt more expensive. According to JP Morgan estimates, Shimao's average interest rate for its offshore debt of 39.6 billion yuan ($5.84 billion) is 5.3 percent, the interest it was expected to pay in foreign currency for 2018 was 2.1 billion yuan, so for every 5 percent yuan depreciation it will have to pay an extra 105 million yuan. 
Evergrande has offshore debt of 134 billion yuan and its average interest rate is 7.5 percent, so a 5 percent fall in the yuan would increase its finance cost by 502.8 million yuan.
Overseas borrowing also creates foreign exchange liabilities when the dollar bonds are translated into yuan. 
In 2015, when the yuan fell 5.7 percent, some Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers posted foreign exchange losses of more than 1 billion yuan, in some cases wiping more than 6 percent off earnings. 
""2015 and 2016 were totally different environments, onshore rates were only 3.5 to 4.5 percent on average, much cheaper than dollar bond rates. There was no forex risk and it was much cheaper so a no-brainer for developers to raise more debt onshore,"" said JP Morgan analyst Ryan Li.
""But now onshore corporate bond issuance is not only tight but more expensive; the rates are 100-200 basis points higher than offshore."" 
According to his estimates, the direct impact from incremental interest costs and foreign exchange losses on Shimao's estimated profit this year would be around 25 percent for every 5 percent drop in the yuan. 
In 2015, 48 percent of Shimao's debt was denominated in foreign currency. The company's net profit fell 24.5 percent that year, primarily because of foreign exchange losses.
Shimao lowered its proportion of U.S. and Hong Kong dollar borrowing from 2016 by increasing onshore financing and redeeming offshore bonds, taking its foreign borrowing to 34 percent of all debt. 
But after China made it more difficult last year to get approval for onshore bonds and onshore rates outpaced offshore, Shimao's foreign debt exposure level rose back to around 43 percent of all debt in the first six months of this year.
""We have no plans to borrow less offshore as we still try to balance lower offshore funding costs versus foreign exchange risk,"" said investor relations manager Eva Lau.
The company now hedges less than 10 percent of its foreign currency-denominated debt due to high hedging costs. 
The profit impact on state-owned companies China Jinmao (HK:0817) and Sino-Ocean (HK:3377) would also be around 25 percent and 24 percent respectively for every of 5 percent drop in the yuan, according to JP Morgan estimates.
China Evergrande, which has an offshore debt exposure totaling 134 billion yuan, would see profit decline by 21 percent per 5 percent drop in the yuan. Evergrande, Jinmao, Sino-Ocean declined to comment. 
The yuan has fallen 1.9 percent in the first six months of this year. 
These drastic-sounding losses, however, will not necessarily hit dividends because forex losses arise from mark-to-market value and are not calculated in the companies' core profit, which excludes non-recurring items as such currency losses.
The impact on core profit, for example, would be 1.3 percent for Shimao and 1.5 percent for Evergrande. 
""FX loss is non-cash...hence not affecting dividend,"" Shimao's Lau said.
Chinese developers are due to post their first-half financial reports in August. Shares in Chinese property companies have already fallen around 20 percent since the second half of June, due in part to the yuan's decline. 
Some developers have chosen to not hedge forex risks, however, believing that expensive hedging tools are a double-edged sword. 
""Renminbi fluctuation is a national direction...it's difficult and expensive for companies to use swaps to hedge,"" said Simon Fung, chief financial officer of Hangzhou-based developer Greentown China (HK:3900).
Hedging would cost developers an extra 100 basis points, JP Morgan's Li said. Not only is hedging expensive, the limited instruments available in China also cast doubt over its effectiveness. Currently, most developers use basic forward contracts.

Developer Jinmao, which had no hedges in place at the time, said in its 2016 annual report it may hedge in future, but ""the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited, and the group may not be able to hedge the group's exposure successfully, or at all"".

510,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 05:01AM ET</span>",World stocks hit four-month high on EU-U.S. trade breakthrough hopes,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks opened much higher on Thursday, pushing world stocks to new four-month highs after the European Union and the United States agreed to negotiate on trade, easing some of the fears of a transatlantic trade war.
Concerns over the slowing pace of world economic growth and some lackluster company earnings reports capped some of equity gains, however, as did lingering fears that Washington's trade tensions with China could escalate further.
In what the EU chief called a ""major concession,"" U.S. President Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the two sides launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers.
There were gains across the board for European stocks on Thursday morning, led by the continent's auto sector, which was up 2 percent at one point German's export-reliant and auto-heavy index rose 1.4 percent
A pan-European stock index rose half a percent while the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, hit its highest since March 16 on the news.
""The lifting of the threat of tariffs on the auto sector in particular is a major development. We've not seen a lot of actual measures implemented but it should lift the confidence of manufacturers,"" said RBC European economist Cathal Kennedy.
""The feedthrough should come through in the manufacturing sector and confidence indicators in the coming months.""
The equity gains pushed up government bond yields in the U.S. and Europe, with Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, coming close to a one-month high at 0.42 percent. 
There were clouds on the horizon, however.
Asian stocks were held back by weakness in China, where the Shanghai Composite index fell 0.7 percent and blue-chip shares lost 1.1 percent. This capped gains for MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan to just 0.1 percent.
While the transatlantic mood was improving, ""this deal, along with the breakdown of a large M&A deal, leave investors fearing that the trade war has just turned even more so on China,"" Citi analysts told clients. 
They were referring to the likelihood that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc would drop its $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O after a deadline for securing Chinese regulatory approval passed.
Economic growth worries are also mounting -- economists polled by Reuters said global activity had peaked, with trade protectionism seen having a significant downward impact. Thursday's South Korean data showing slowing growth and exports reinforced that picture.
Another poll indicated U.S. second quarter growth -- with data due on Friday -- also would mark the peak. 
Trade and growth worries were already taking a toll on some companies' bottom lines.
U.S. automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles have cut profit forecasts, while Germany's Daimler blamed U.S.-China tariffs for a 30 percent drop in second-quarter profit.
A warning of slowing growth from  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which saw the company's stock fall as much as 24 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, highlighted risks for investors and businesses in the current earnings season.
That is likely to weigh on Wall Street at open, with S&P500 futures down 0.2 percent 
Focus will now turn back to central bank policy and the softer U.S.-EU tone should help the European Central Bank stick with its plan to gradually withdraw stimulus when it meets later on Thursday. 
The euro, having strengthened on Wednesday on the news, held on to its gains against the dollar and was at $1.1731 while the dollar was down 0.20 percent against a basket of currencies. 
The yen fell 0.3 percent against the dollar but investors will carefully watch the Bank of Japan's two-day policy review on July 30-31 after this week's brief jump in yields and the Japanese currency on reports authorities were debating paring back some stimulus.
The bank is said to be considering changing the composition of exchange-traded funds it buys as part of its stimulus program.
Brent crude meanwhile was up over a percent to hit a 10-day high of $74.68 per barrel Brent crude led oil prices higher, extending gains into a third day after Saudi Arabia suspended crude shipments through a strategic Red Sea shipping lane.

TOYOTA CITY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) is doubling down on its investment in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, designing lower-cost, mass-market passenger cars and SUVs and pushing the technology into buses and trucks to build economies of scale.
As Toyota cranks up improvements for the next generation of its Mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV), expected in the early 2020s, it is hoping it can prove wrong rival automakers and industry experts who have mostly dismissed such plans as commercially unviable.
The maker of the Prius, the world's first mass-produced ""eco-friendly"" gasoline-hybrid car in the 1990s, says it can popularize FCVs in part by making them cheaper.
""We're going to shift from limited production to mass production, reduce the amount of expensive materials like platinum used in FCV components, and make the system more compact and powerful,"" Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the Mirai, said in an interview with Reuters.
It is planning a phased introduction of other FCV models, including a range of SUVs, pick-up trucks, and commercial trucks beginning around 2025, a source with knowledge of the automaker's plans said.
The automaker declined to comment on specific future product plans. But it has developed FCV prototypes of small delivery vehicles and large transport trucks based on models already on the road, as Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) develops a battery-operated commercial semi-truck from the ground up.
""We're going to use as many parts from existing passenger cars and other models as possible in fuel cell trucks,"" said Ikuo Ota, manager of new business planning for fuel cell projects at Toyota. ""Otherwise, we won't see the benefits of mass production.""
The company is also betting on improved performance. Toyota wants to push the driving range of the next Mirai to 700-750 kilometers from around 500 kilometers, and to hit 1,000 kilometers by 2025, a separate source said.
Driven by the belief that hydrogen will become a key source of clean energy in the next 100 years, Toyota has been developing FCVs since the early 1990s.
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and stores more energy than a battery of equivalent weight.
The Mirai was the world's first production FCV when it was launched in 2014. But its high cost, around $60,000 before government incentives, and lack of refueling infrastructure have limited its appeal. Fewer than 6,000 have been sold globally.
LMC Automotive forecasts FCVs to make up only 0.2 percent of global passenger car sales in 2027, compared with 11.7 percent for battery EVs. The International Energy Agency predicts fewer FCVs than battery-powered and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles through 2040.
Many automakers, including Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Tesla, see battery-powered cars as a better, zero-emission solution to gasoline engines. Only a handful, including Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), produce FCVs.
But people familiar with Toyota's plans said the automaker thinks demand will perk up as more countries, including China, warm to fuel cell technology. The company also sees FCVs as a hedge against a scarcity of key EV battery materials such as cobalt.
HAND BUILT
For now, Mirais are assembled by hand at a plant in Toyota City, where 13 technicians push partially constructed units into assembly bays for detailed inspections. This process yields just 6.5 cars a day, a sliver of Toyota's average domestic daily production of about 13,400 vehicles.
Strategic Analysis Inc, which has analyzed costs of FCVs including the Mirai, estimates that it costs Toyota about $11,000 to produce each of its fuel cell stacks, by far the vehicles' most expensive part.
Toyota has been building up production capacity to change that, as it expects global FCV sales climb to 30,000 units annually after 2020 from about 3,000. Strategic Analysis estimates that would allow Toyota to reduce costs to about $8,000 per stack.
It has already begun to use parts developed for the Mirai in other models, such as the fuel cell stack, which is used in Kenworth freight trucks being tested in California, the Sora FC bus it released in Japan in March and the delivery trucks it will test with Seven-Eleven stores in Japan next year.
""It will be difficult for Toyota to lower FCV production costs if it only produces the Mirai,"" the first source told Reuters on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.
""By using the FCV system in larger models, it is looking to lower costs by mass-producing and using common parts across vehicle classes,"" he added.
The Mirai's high production costs are largely due to expensive materials including platinum, titanium and carbon fiber used in the fuel cell and hydrogen storage systems.
Engineers have been reducing that by improving the platinum catalyst, a key component in the 370 layered cells in the fuel cell stack, which facilitates the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that produces electricity.
""We've been able to decrease the platinum loading by 10 percent to 20 percent and deliver the same performance,"" said Eri Ichikawa, a fuel cell engineer at Cataler Corp, a Toyota subsidiary that specializes in catalytic converters.
Strategic Analysis says using that much less of the precious metal would save up to $300 per fuel cell stack, based on an estimate that Toyota now uses about 30 grams of platinum per unit.

""By consistently focusing on these issues, we will be able to progressively lower the cost of FCVs in the future,"" Tanaka said.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 04:15AM ET</span>",What bubble? China's record-breaking venture capitalists charge ahead,"By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's venture capital scene has been on fire this year and a record-breaking run to unicorn status by a Chinese coffee startup suggests it is not cooling yet.
Luckin Coffee took just six months to reach a $1 billion ""unicorn"" valuation, a performance that is helping boost investor appetite for Chinese startups, even as they estimate that valuations are far outstripping U.S. ones.
This month at Hong Kong's RISE technology conference, a key stop on the Asian venture capital circuit, investors told Reuters that startups in China were 30 to 40 percent more expensive than their U.S. counterparts and in some cases, were even valued at twice the price. 
""If I put my U.S. lenses on, this is insane,"" said Edith Yeung, partner at 500 Startups, a California-based venture capital firm. But, she said, the calculus for investors was the sheer size of the Chinese market, noting that the WeChat social media platform had three times more daily users than the population of the United States.
""Everything is sort of relative,"" Yeung said.
BREWING COFFEE, NOT BUBBLES
Luckin Coffee typifies the optimism evident in China's start-up scene. The Beijing-based coffee delivery firm only began operating in January and has plans to expand its 660-strong network to challenge Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), with 3,400 stores.
Detractors point out that Luckin's fast growth has relied heavily on cut-price promotions and warn it also faces heavy competition from other chains such as Canada's Tim Horton's.
Its backers still see value however. 
""Luckin's valuation is not cheap or lofty - it's reasonable,"" said David Li, head of Centurium Capital. The former head of Warburg Pincus Asia Pacific led Luckin's recent $200 million financing round and maintains it is not a conventional start-up, pointing to a management of experienced, serial entrepreneurs.
At the other end of the scale from Luckin sits Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL], the Chinese payments giant that became the world's largest unicorn in June when it secured $14 billion in fresh funds that valued the firm at $150 billion.
In search of the next Ant, Sequoia Capital China, the local arm of the Silicon Valley-based venture capital giant, is close to raising 15 billion yuan ($2.3 billion) in its fifth yuan-denominated China-focused fund, the largest of its kind. 
""Lots of China's rising sizable tech companies are promising and still fast-growing, and rely on fundraising for further growth. We are increasing our fund size to capture those opportunities,"" said Zhou Kui, a partner at Sequoia China.
The firm's recent investments include Bitmain Technologies, a Chinese bitcoin mining equipment maker,  Pinduoduo  Inc (O:PDD), a fast-growing e-commerce firm, and the self-driving start-up Pony.ai.
On average, a startup in China reaches unicorn status about 18 months quicker than its U.S. equivalent, according to Pitchbook, an industry data provider. 
""There is a lot of aggression and hunger,"" said Jixun Foo, managing partner at GGV Capital. ""It's important to recognize the amount of talent and capital that's pouring into this market. That's capitalizing on a lot of change.""
NO RUSH FOR THE EXITS - YET 
Beijing's deleveraging campaign, which has driven up borrowing costs, slowed the economy and aggravated already tight market liquidity, could potentially affect fundraising for funds and companies, some investors warned.
For now, however, venture capitalists are confident they can exit via either an IPO or a sale. 
Hong Kong is readying for a series of blockbuster tech deals, led by smartphone maker Xiaomi's (HK:1810) $5.4 billion float in July, the world's biggest tech IPO in four years. 
Despite a relatively weak debut by  Xiaomi , the earliest investors in the company still made 866 times their initial investments at the IPO price, said Hans Tung, San Francisco-based managing partner with GGV, which invested in Xiaomi from day one.
""The next two to three IPOs will determine whether people will come in big numbers,"" he said.
The trump card for those shrugging off bubble fears in China is the presence of other deep-pocketed buyers including  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA), Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) and SoftBank Group (T:9984), with its $100 billion Vision Fund.
The three have shelled out some $45 billion since 2015 across 71 investments in Chinese tech companies, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Chinese venture capital funds have so far performed better than their global peers, delivering a multiple of money - the total return on investment - of 1.72 times, compared to their U.S. peers' 1.59 times, according to May data from eFront, which analyses around 4,000 funds. 
Tay Choon Chong, China managing partner at Vertex Ventures, an arm of the Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, shrugged off concerns that any nascent bubbles posed a real danger to the wider venture capital scene. 

""It's like beer. You need the right amount of bubbles for it to taste good,"" said Tay, who has been investing in China since 2009.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico's Banorte lays off more than half of acquisition's staff - sources,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher and Christine Murray
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's second-largest bank Grupo  Financiero Banorte  has laid off some 500 employees from recently acquired Grupo Financiero Interacciones, or about half of the specialist government lender's workforce, with more job cuts to come, two people with knowledge of the matter said. 
Banorte (MX:GFNORTEO) recently closed the $1.4 billion half-cash, half-stock deal to buy Interacciones, whose loan portfolio was overwhelmingly comprised of loans backed by Mexico's government. 
The company plans to lay off around another 300 people, one of the people added.
Banorte said in a presentation about the deal that it would cut 65 percent of Interacciones' costs, saving between 1.5 and 1.6 billion pesos a year. Earlier this month, the former CEO of Interacciones said there could be layoffs, but did not specify how many jobs would be lost. 
Gerardo Salazar, who ran the group's bank, Ignacio Zubiria, head of the institutional business, and Adolfo Herrera, head of the brokerage, are among the highest-profile who have left, the people said. 
Salazar, Zubiria and Herrera did not respond to requests for comment. Banorte declined to comment, referring to the quiet period ahead of its quarterly results.
Yiming Qian, Associate Professor of Finance at the University of Iowa, said layoffs after acquisitions were commonplace, but usually were contained to 5 percent to 15 percent. Banorte's reductions of Interacciones staff would reach about 80 percent if it eventually lays off 800 people, as one of the sources said was planned.
""Eighty percent is very unusual,"" Qian said. 
Mexican banks that focus on lending to states and municipalities have had to reconsider their business models in recent years as several states have become highly indebted and high-profile graft scandals involving their leaders surfaced.
Many businesses in Mexico are owned or controlled by families, however, the country's banking sector is mostly owned by foreigners, including BBVA (MC:BBVA), Citi and Santander (MC:SAN). Banorte and Carlos Slim's Grupo Financiero Inbursa are notable exceptions. 
Mexican regulators approved the deal, the largest in the sector in 17 years, three days before the July 1 election.
Banorte was already the largest Mexican-owned bank and its chairman Carlos Hank Gonzalez was also Interacciones' chief executive until 2014, while his father was Interacciones' chairman. 
Banorte's largest foreign institutional investors, including BlackRock and Aberdeen Standard Investments, opposed the deal, arguing that the acquisition was unnecessary and posed conflicts of interest because of family ties.
The bank said the family trust, which owns around 10 percent of the company, and others affiliated to the family, voted in line with the majority of shareholders, meaning that it did not sway the outcome.

Banorte said the deal was expected to gradually increase Banorte's earnings per share while preserving capital strength and return on equity goals.

Adjusted earnings before interest and tax increased to 1.15 billion euros ($1.35 billion) from a restated 572 million euros a year earlier, Toulouse, France-based Airbus said in a statement Thursday. Analysts had estimated a figure of 1.05 billion euros, based on six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Customer payments for the re-engined A320neo family of planes had been held up by a three-month halt in handovers of Pratt & Whitney-powered jets, which have been dogged by a series of glitches, and manufacturing issues concerning aircraft with turbines from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.-led CFM. Airbus has since made headway in reducing the number of planes parked outside its plants from a May peak, with 110 Neos delivered in the first half out of 239 in total.
Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders, who plans to stand down next year, said that while Neo deliveries surpassed those for the original A320 model in the second quarter, meeting a target of 800 handovers across Airbus’s full aircraft lineup for 2018 as a whole remains challenging.
Cost-Split
“Our operational focus in commercial aircraft remains squarely on securing the production ramp-up,” he said. Airbus is also assessing how to split additional costs from parked narrow-bodies with both engine suppliers.
The A350 wide-body program has shown strong progress, according to the CEO, with the “cost curve” improving as output is increased to 10 planes a month by the year’s end. Combined with higher asking prices as the jet exits its launch phase, when more bargains are on offer, that helped account for the bulk of earnings improvements in the first half, though Enders said it’s still too early to decide on further production ramp-ups.
Airbus confirmed plans to lift adjusted Ebit by about 20 percent to 5.2 billion euros this year before the integration of the new A220 plane acquired from Bombardier Inc. It also still expects free cash flow before disposals and acquisitions of approximately 3 billion euros.
Demand for Airbus’s planes remains strong, the company said, with more than 430 orders and commitments worth in excess of $62 billion booked last week at the Farnborough air show in England, the year’s biggest industry expo.
The company booked a 98 million-euro provision against price escalation on the delayed A400M military transport program, together with costs of 21 million euros from its H160 helicopter and 40 million euros in compliance and merger expenses. At the same time it had a 157 million-euro gain from the sale of assets in its defense and space division.
The CEO clarified comments published at the weekend on a possible combination of Airbus’s military aircraft assets with those of BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc, saying he “was not suggesting” an outright merger of the businesses but that their parallel next-generation fighter programs should “converge.”

BERLIN/CHICAGO (Reuters) - People with hay fever hate dust. That was the premise of a marketing drive launched by British vacuum cleaner maker Dyson with U.S. retailer  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT)
Using data about its customers' shopping habits, Target homed in on shoppers who likely had allergies and showed them ads for Dyson's cordless V6 vacuum on social media and Target's website. The result: sales for the vacuums doubled among shoppers who regularly purchase anti-allergy treatments and products such as Claritin or humidifiers on Target.com and in stores.
Data about real people and real behaviors “actually get a much stronger result because the fidelity of that data is so much richer,"" said Kristi Argyilan, Target's senior vice president of media and guest engagement.
Retailers ranging from Target and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc to grocers such as  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) Plc are working aggressively to attract big advertisers to their websites in a bid to drive sales, according to interviews with retailers, packaged goods makers, consumer data firms and marketing consultants. 
Specifically, they are selling more ad space, pop-up banners and search-bar keywords to consumer goods companies such as Kraft Heinz Co and Procter & Gamble Co. These makers of everything from soup to shampoo are investing more to advertise on retailers’ websites where people who already have an intent to buy are guided to specific products using their individual shopping habits.
This online ad revenue offers significantly higher margins for retailers than selling goods in stores.
By carving out a space for themselves in the booming digital ad market, they are taking on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and the $114 billion they received last year in global online ad revenue. According to research company eMarketer, Google and Facebook’s revenue accounted for nearly half of the global market in 2017.

Supermarkets have long charged brands to place products in the busiest parts of their stores, such as near the checkout counter. 
As more shopping shifts online, e-commerce giants Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd pioneered replicating that strategy on their websites by mining data to target advertising at selected customers or groups. Amazon ad revenue alone could jump to $6.6 billion by 2019 from $2.8 billion last year, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
While retailers have a long way to go before they come close to Google and Facebook digital advertising prowess, their instant access to data on what is selling puts stores in a strong position, said Joe Zawadzki, chief executive of MediaMath, which helps brands manage ad campaigns.
""To the extent that the retailer can help the manufacturer, it becomes a new revenue opportunity and a way forward for them,"" he said. ""We’re very much at the start of this.""
Alphabet and Facebook declined to comment. To be sure, retailers and brands for the foreseeable future will still be drawn to advertise with Facebook and Google given the internet giants’ massive customer base in order to drive traffic to their websites. And the Silicon Valley companies likely will make overtures to long-time clients of theirs to avoid losing business.
BANNERS, POP-UPS AND MONEY BACK
Retailers are offering a range of marketing options online, including banner ads, pop-ups and money-off deals. As with Google, suppliers can pay for keywords to get their products listed at the top of any search. 
Some industry observers expect voice aides like Amazon’s Alexa may one day let brands pay to be the first product recommended when a shopper asks to purchase an item such as ketchup, a feature known as “Amazon’s Choice.” Amazon told Reuters it has no plans to let companies pay for the distinction, “nor do we have plans to advertise on Alexa broadly.”  
""We're making sure that when consumers are typing in 'ketchup', our product is really above, that it comes up into that first screen,"" Nina Barton, Kraft Heinz president of global online and digital growth, told Reuters in an interview. 
Barton said Kraft Heinz, the owner of the Philadelphia cream cheese and Planters peanuts brands, was on track to spend four times more on e-commerce marketing in 2018 than it did last year, including advertising on social media, search engines and retailer’s websites.
Consumer companies bid against one another for thousands of keywords such as “ketchup” or “chocolate,” often even snatching up keywords that are important to rival brands to undercut them, said Nii Ahene, co-founder CPC Strategy, a digital marketing agency that advises several major consumer packaged goods companies, including  Unilever  (LON:ULVR). 
Retailers are paid anything from 25 cents to $2 each time a shopper clicks on a sponsored search item, depending on the product being sold,  he said. Ads for supplements, for instance, cost a premium as people are more likely to buy the same vitamins repeatedly and that means more sales for the consumer company, according to Ahene. 
“Companies like Kraft Heinz and Nestle have always paid for a premium placement, whether it's at the front of the store, in an end-cap or premium placement on a shelf. This is simply the evolution of existing processes to a digital storefront,” he said.
SALES IMPACT
The push by retailers comes as some major brands question the value of some online ads. 
Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, pressured Facebook and Alphabet’s YouTube and other media companies to reveal how many people see their ads and how ad agencies spend advertising dollars.
The average view time for an ad on a mobile news feed is just 1.7 seconds, Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief brand officer, told the Association of National Advertisers’ media conference in March.
""Even Facebook and Google can't tell P&G properly whether their ads have worked, whereas if you're buying retail media we can measure whether there has been a statistically significant uplift from running that media campaign,"" said Guillaume Bacuvier, a former Google advertising executive who is now chief executive of customer data company Dunnhumby, which is owned by British supermarket Tesco.
The average time that an ad is viewable on retailer sites is about 16 seconds, according to Dunnhumby, which defines ""viewable"" as when at least half of the ad is on the screen.
In one case, Tesco ran banner adverts on its website for a leading brand of dishwasher tablets. Dunnhumby said almost 100,000 pounds ($132,000) of sales came from customers exposed to the ad, with 6 percent of the sales happening in a store.
That translated into a return on advertising spending of $11.34 for every $1 invested, according to Dunnhumby, noting that more than 2,200 new customers had added the brand to their online favorites list as a result of the campaign. That is far more than an average return on ad spend of $2.62 for every $1 invested across all media types, according to a 2016 Nielsen report.
It is those kinds of numbers that are helping win over marketing experts including Andrew Clarke at Mars Inc, another major advertiser and the maker of M&M's candy and Wrigley's gum.

""The advantage potentially of these players is they can help really demonstrate the impact of our marketing dollars on a transaction, both online and potentially offline as well,"" Clarke told Reuters. ($1 = 0.7577 pounds)

522,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 11:18PM ET</span>","China's Pinduoduo prices U.S. IPO at top of range, raises $1.6 billion: sources","By Fiona Lau and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters/IFR) - Chinese online group discounter  Pinduoduo  Inc (O:PDD) priced its U.S. initial public offering (IPO) at $19 per American depositary share (ADS), raising $1.63 billion in the second-biggest U.S. float by a Chinese firm this year, according to three people familiar with the situation.
The pricing values money-losing Pinduoduo - which counts Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) as a main backer - at $23.8 billion including all outstanding share options, compared with a valuation of $15 billion following a funding round in April.
The fast-growing company allows consumers to group together to get better discounts from merchants selling goods as varied as clothes, kitchenware and gadgets. It offered about 85.6 million ADS or about 6.8 percent of its enlarged share capital, at $16 to $19 each.
Pinduoduo declined to comment on the pricing. The people declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Pinduoduo is the latest Chinese tech firm tapping international capital markets to bolster coffers amid ever-intensifying competition with domestic rivals, notably e-commerce heavyweights  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and JD.com Inc (O:JD).
It is also joining several sizable Chinese listings in New York this year even as Sino-U.S. trade tensions involving tit-for-tat tariffs rattle global markets.
Chinese video streaming service provider iQiyi Inc (O:IQ) raised $2.42 billion from a Nasdaq IPO in March, and Tencent Music Entertainment, China's largest music-streaming firm, aims to raise up to 4 billion in a U.S. IPO planned for October.
Set up by former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) engineer Colin Huang in 2015, Pinduoduo will begin trading on Nasdaq under the symbol PDD on Thursday.
It said in U.S. regulatory filings that it had attracted over 300 million active buyers and more than 1 million merchants to its platform.
Due to low-priced products and a large user base in China's smaller cities, the firm's gross merchandise volume exceeded 100 billion yuan ($14.98 billion) last year. Alibaba's Taobao marketplace took five years to reach that milestone, while JD.com took 10 years.
Investors and analysts also attribute its rapid growth to the online traffic derived from Tencent's messaging-to-shopping app WeChat, which helps direct many of its more than 1 billion users to Pinduoduo.
""We believe WeChat accounts for the majority of buyer traffic, and Pinduoduo could not have built up its large user base cost-effectively and rapidly without WeChat,"" wrote Arun George, a technology analyst who publishes on independent research platform Smartkarma.
Pinduoduo's revenue has grown sharply, reaching 1.38 billion yuan in January-March from 37 million yuan in the same period a year prior. Its net loss, however, remained broadly steady at 201 million yuan.

China Renaissance, CICC,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are advising Pinduoduo.

Now the social-media giant is poised to add one it would doubtless rather avoid: the biggest stock-market wipeout in American history.
That could happen Thursday if the 24 percent tumble in Facebook’s stock in after-hours trading is replicated in the regular New York session. Its market capitalization plummeted late Wednesday, at one point by about $151 billion, as sales and user growth disappointed investors. A move of that magnitude on Thursday would likely be the largest ever loss of value in one day for a U.S.-traded company.

Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., already reeling from the financial crisis and recession in October 2008, lost $53 billion one wretched Wednesday that month. And the slowest profit growth at Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). in 10 years triggered a loss of almost $60 billion on January 24, 2013.
Facebook ended the after-hours session down 20 percent at $173.50, a loss of about $126 billion in market cap, having declined as much as 24 percent earlier.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Facebook's grim forecast: privacy push will erode profits for years,"By Munsif Vengattil and Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's shares lost as much as a quarter of their value on Wednesday after executives said that profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in the biggest advertising markets.
The second-quarter results were the first sign that a new European privacy law and a succession of privacy scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and other app developers have bit into Facebook's business. The company further warned that the toll would not be offset by revenue growth from emerging markets and Facebook's Instagram app, which has been more immune from privacy concerns.
Facebook's fortunes shifted in under two hours as the company first reported revenue and user growth that missed expectations and then issued warnings about future growth and expenses. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JV9APu)
Operating profit margin, which fell to 44 percent in the second quarter from 47 percent a year ago, will sink to the ""mid-30s"" for more than two years, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in investor guidance.
The plummeting stock price wiped out as much as $150 billion in market capitalization and erased the stock's gains since April when Facebook announced a surprisingly strong 63 percent rise in profit and an increase in users. 
If the share drop holds on Thursday, it would be Facebook's largest single-day decline, topping a 12 percent decrease in July 2012. 
Nasdaq futures dropped 0.85 percent late on Wednesday, suggesting the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index would fall when trading opens on Thursday morning. Facebook's results prompted selling in other Nasdaq listings, including media and advertising rivals Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
'ENTERING A NEW PERIOD'
Facebook had cautioned investors to expect a big jump in second-quarter costs because of efforts to address concerns about poor handling of users' privacy and to better monitor what users post. Total expenses in the second quarter surged to $7.4 billion, up 50 percent compared with a year ago.
Facebook forecast similar increases for the second half of the year, also citing spending on video content and marketing. 
Its gloomy forecast for revenue growth surprised investors, though, and prompted many questions from financial analysts on a conference call with company executives on Wednesday. 
Sales in the second quarter grew 42 percent, its slowest pace in nearly three years, to $13.2 billion compared with $9.3 billion a year ago.
Wehner said quarterly revenue growth would be closer to 30 percent the rest of the year.
He cited currency fluctuations and a shift in usage to features where Facebook shows less advertising or charges less due to lower demand. 
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union also will cause a revenue drop. The new privacy law forced several changes to Facebook's privacy terms and sign-up process, leading a minority of users to opt for non-personalized ads, which tend to generate less revenue. 
""They’re talking about currency headwinds, but more we think it’s due to slower user growth given GDPR and more focus on privacy,"" Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said.
Facebook's daily active users in Europe declined by 3 million amid the new regulation. Worldwide daily user growth for Facebook's namesake service slid for its sixth straight quarter, bringing it to nearly 1.5 billion users in the second quarter.
The company said for the first time that more than 2.5 billion users interact with at least one of its apps each month, but analysts have said many of them are spending more time with Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. Commercialization of those apps is nascent.
Revenue from emerging markets has not picked up the slack either. Sales from United States, Canada and Europe fell $75 million in the second quarter compared with a year ago, while revenue from other markets rose $51 million.
Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures, said in an email that Facebook is ""entering a new period"" where declining user growth will translate to slower revenue growth.
He added that Facebook has ""a track record of resetting revenue growth and expense expectations only to turn around and exceed those expectations the following quarter.""
Facebook reported $5.1 billion in profit, or $1.74 per share, compared with the average estimates of $5.1 billion and $1.72 per share among research gathered by Thomson Reuters.
The threat of additional privacy regulatory setbacks remains a concern, according to analysts. 
Facebook suffered a blow in China on Wednesday when regulators there withdrew their approval of a company innovation hub to support local startups, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Misinformation on WhatsApp contributing to mob killings in India have added to the pressure on Facebook to re-evaluate how its services maintain security and decorum.

Nearly all social media services have received greater scrutiny since U.S. intelligence agencies in January 2017 revealed that organizations tied to the Russian government had seeded content on the platform to shake up the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

529,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 07:59PM ET</span>",Qualcomm investors cheer end of NXP deal doomed by China-U.S. tensions,"By Sonam Rai and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), the world's biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, said on Wednesday it would drop its $44 billion bid for  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI) after failing to secure regulatory approval from China against a backdrop of widening trade tensions.
Investors expressed relief at the end of the project that has dragged on since 2016, all while Qualcomm fended off a $117 billion takeover bid from Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO), fought in court with Apple Inc (O:AAPL), and faced billions of dollars in fines from antitrust regulators around the world over its licensing practices.
The San Diego chipmaker also delivered surprisingly strong third-quarter results and a rosy outlook for so-called 5G technology, the next generation of wireless data networks. Those numbers, combined with a $30 billion share buyback plan that Qualcomm had promised to implement if the NXP deal fell through, sent its shares up almost 6 percent to $62.95 after the bell.
Qualcomm still faces challenges, including expectations that its chips will not be in the next round of Apple's iPhones and the need to find new markets beyond mobile phones without NXP's help. But it cited progress on one of two major patent royalty conflicts, thought to be with Chinese phonemaker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], in the form of a $700 million interim agreement, $500 million of which was paid this quarter.
The collapse of what would have been the largest-ever merger of two chip companies may discourage other U.S. firms hoping to buy into China's huge developing markets and companies, although technology deals seemed the main concern.
""We obviously got caught up in something that was above us,"" Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said in an interview after the announcement. 
""We think moving on, reducing the amount of uncertainty in the business and increasing the focus is the right thing to do with the company."" 
Qualcomm needed approval from China, the last of nine global regulators to be consulted, because the country accounted for nearly two-thirds of its revenue last year.
Barring a last-minute reprieve, the chipmaker said in its results release it would make good on a pledge with NXP to call off the merger if it had not won Chinese regulatory approval by 23:59 Eastern U.S. time on Wednesday. 
Qualcomm forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $5.1 billion to $5.9 billion, and adjusted earnings of 75 to 85 cents per share. Analysts were expecting forecasts of $5.45 billion and 76 cents respectively, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
NXP Semiconductors shares fell almost 4 percent to $94.50. 
TRUMP'S ROLE
Moves by the Trump administration have played an outsized role in Qualcomm's fate, and there had been expectations that the lifting of a ban on U.S. chipmakers doing business with China's ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) would clear the way for the NXP deal.
Dealmakers advising on mergers and acquisitions hoped the fallout would be limited to the technology sector in which China is racing for primacy against the United States. 
United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) chief Gregory Hayes said earlier this week that the industrial conglomerate was on track with regulatory approvals to close its $23 billion acquisition of U.S. airplane-parts maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N:COL), seeking to quell fears that China could delay its review.
No other major semiconductor deal is pending. Broadcom, whose $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm was blocked by the United States in March on national security grounds, says its $19 billion purchase of U.S. software company CA Technologies (O:CA) does not require China's blessing.
For Qualcomm, the deal's demise means it will have to focus on expanding beyond making mobile chips.
Qualcomm predicted on Wednesday that Apple would drop the company's chips from its next-generation iPhones in favor of modems from  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), the latest sign of fallout from their acrimonious battle over pricing and licensing costs. Qualcomm's revenue projections had already assumed it would gain no new revenue from Apple.
Intel and Apple both declined to comment. 
Qualcomm sold $3 billion of chips last year for non-phone use, up 75 percent from two years ago. It has a $5 billion ""backlog"" of chip sales to the automotive industry, in which NXP is also a dominant player, it said.

(Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) on Wednesday reported a second-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates, but its forecast for third-quarter revenue came up short.
Net income rose to $526 million, or 44 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $411 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $3.86 billion from $3.13 billion. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 58 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
For the third quarter, PayPal said it expects revenue between $3.62 billion and $3.67 billion, below analysts' $3.71 billion estimate. 
Shares of PayPal fell 5.7 percent to $86.10 after the bell.
Since separating from online marketplace eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015, San Jose, California-based PayPal has been striving to become more than just a checkout button on e-commerce platforms. 
It has been expanding the breadth of its services through an aggressive strategy of partnerships and acquisitions, as it looks to stay ahead of rivals in the increasingly competitive digital payments landscape.
""PayPal is committed to being a comprehensive digital payments platform, offering complete solutions to our customers as the world rapidly digitizes across both retail and financial services,"" PayPal Chief Executive Dan Schulman said on a call with analysts. 
In May it said it had agreed to acquire Swedish payments company iZettle for $2.2 billion, in its largest ever acquisition. [nL3N1SO5IE.]
The following month it agreed to acquire prediction platform Jetlore, fraud prevention startup Simility and HyperWallet Systems Inc, a company that helps online individual and small business sellers accept payments.
Earlier this week, PayPal won the support of Third Point LLC, Daniel Loeb's activist hedge fund, which revealed in an investor letter that it had taken a stake in the online payments company.
""We see parallels between PayPal and other best-in-class internet platforms like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN): high and rising market share, untapped pricing power, and significant margin expansion potential,"" Third Point's letter said.
PayPal processed $139 billion in payments in the second quarter of 2018, up 29 percent from a year earlier. 
Venmo, its peer-to-peer payment app popular with younger consumers, processed $14 billion in payments in the second quarter, up 78 percent from the same period last year. 
PayPal also said its board had approved $10 billion in share buybacks.

The company raised its revenue forecast for the full year to $15.3 billion to $15.5 billion from $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Wednesday lowered its full-year earnings forecast due to slumping sales and trade tariffs in China and its struggling business in Europe, and said ongoing plans to revamp its business could lead to pre-tax charges of up to $11 billion over the next three to five years. 
Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, also postponed a meeting with investors that was scheduled for September. The company said it would be rescheduled when ""more specifics can be shared on global redesign and restructuring.""
""It's clear that the redesign is going to be fundamental and it's going to be deep and it's going to really address these underperforming parts of the business,"" the company's chief financial officer, Bob Shanks, told analysts on a conference call.
Shanks said Ford would improve the performance of underperforming units or dispose of them.
Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett, asked directly by an analyst whether he would still be leading Ford when the company reschedules its investor day, responded, ""Hell yes, I expect to be.""
Ford reported its second-quarter net profit fell by almost half, missing analyst expectations, due to a fire at a parts supplier that disrupted production of its popular pickup trucks, while falling sales and tariffs hurt the automaker's business in China.
Ford's shares fell 3.7 percent in after-hours trade.
Tariffs, particularly those imposed on U.S. aluminum and steel imports by President Donald Trump's administration, should cost Ford $1.6 billion in North America in 2018, Shanks said.
The automaker's struggles to boost sales in China have showed no sign of ending despite its taking steps to bring new products to market. Through the first five months of 2018, Ford's Chinese sales were down 22 percent.
Ford said earlier this month that for now it will not hike prices of imported Ford and higher-margin luxury Lincoln models in China, thus absorbing the additional cost of tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles.
Ford reported a second-quarter pre-tax loss of $483 million for its China operations.
Ford's declining sales, lower pricing and lower sales in the hot crossover and SUV market have created ""a whole snowballing effect"" in China, Shanks said. ""It's going to take us a while to get out of that issue."" 
Shanks said he sees improvement in China next year, but he did not provide a financial outlook for the region. 
Ford's president of global markets, Jim Farley, said the company will not see a ""real boost"" in China until it begins rolling out new sport utility vehicles in 2019 and 2020.
Ford said it was working to cut costs in its European unit, while trying to focus on profitable models. Shanks said the region required a major redesign that was already under way, though Farley said the company will report a loss there this year.
Shanks also said Ford's South American operations have not earned an appropriate return on investment since 2004, and said the company was focused on a ""significant redesign.""
Virtually all of Ford's quarterly profit came from sales of high-margin pickup trucks like the F-150 and SUVs in North America. The automaker has become increasingly reliant on the F-150 to drive results.
In May, Ford said its quarterly profits would be hurt by shutdowns at three U.S. truck plants caused by a fire at a key parts supplier.
On Wednesday Ford lowered its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $1.30 to $1.50 per share, from a previous forecast of $1.45 to $1.70 a share. Analysts have predicted full-year earnings per share of $1.52.

Ford reported a second-quarter net profit of $1.07 billion, or 27 cents a share, compared with $2.05 billion, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 31 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Wednesday as U.S. President Donald Trump secured concessions from the European Union on trade, while a disappointing quarterly report from Facebook (O:FB) after the bell slammed its stock and threatened to put the brakes on a tech rally.
The benchmark S&P 500 jumped more than half a percent in the last half-hour of trading on news of the concessions and closed at its highest level since Jan. 29. Trump said that the United States and the European Union had agreed to work toward eliminating tariffs on industrial goods and increasing U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas and soybeans to Europe.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had already been boosted earlier in the trading session by gains in the technology sector, and the Nasdaq closed at a record high. 
In after-hours trading, however, Facebook shares sank as much as 23 percent after it warned about slowing growth and climbing expenses. Facebook's massive drop also hurt shares of Amazon (O:AMZN), Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and other high-growth companies, and Nasdaq futures fell as much as 0.85 percent, suggesting the market could open lower on Thursday. 
The sanguine news regarding trade helped the Dow reverse earlier losses in Wednesday's session. It had been weighed by Boeing's (N:BA) report of higher costs for its aerial refueling tanker program. Boeing shares closed down 0.7 percent.
""Once you got a hint of good news about avoiding a trade war, the market was primed to go higher based on the fact that earnings has been quite strong and economic data has been strong,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
Indeed, investors noted that strong corporate earnings have helped prop up U.S. stocks despite ongoing concerns about tariffs raising companies' costs and cutting into their profits.
Of the 148 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 85.8 percent have topped analyst expectations. If the beat rate holds, it will be the highest on record, dating back to the first quarter of 1994, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""We've all been looking for the beginning of the bear market, but so far the commentary from companies has been pretty strong,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 172.16 points, or 0.68 percent, to 25,414.1, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 25.67 points, or 0.91 percent, to 2,846.07 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 91.47 points, or 1.17 percent, to 7,932.24.
 Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) shares rose 1.8 percent after the beverage company's quarterly sales and profit beat estimates.

535,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 06:44PM ET</span>","AMD second-quarter revenue, profit boosted by EPYC, Ryzen sales","By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) beat estimates for quarterly profit and revenue on Wednesday, as a rare surge in demand for personal computers boosted sales of its processors, graphic chips, sending its shares up 5 percent in extended trading.
The company's shares have more than doubled in the past two years on continued demand for graphic chips used in computers, videogame consoles and a variety of other applications.
AMD said sales in its graphics and computing business, which makes processors for servers and gaming consoles, rose 64 percent to $1.09 billion, primarily driven by its Ryzen desktop processors and Radeon graphic cards.
However, it declined 3 percent quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to lower revenue from graphic processing units (GPU) in the blockchain market. 
AMD's gross margins also grew 3 basis points to 37 percent. The company said its GPU average selling price increased due to Radeon and sales to data centers.
""We think investors are focused on AMD's gross margin expanding as a measure of success of its new products,"" Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. 
The increase in average selling price of GPUs also helped offset fears of weak cryptocurrency-related demand, Cassidy added.
In recent years, AMD like rival  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA), has been riding the bitcoin wave despite a downward spiral in cryptocurrency prices on fears of regulatory scrutiny. GPUs provide the high computing abilities required for cryptocurrency mining.
Graphics cards used by cryptocurrency miners accounted for about 6 percent AMD's overall sales from 10 percent last quarter, the company's CFO Devinder Kumar said on a post-earnings call.
The company also profited from its EPYC server processors gaining market share amid a largely stabilizing PC market. During the quarter, worldwide PC shipments grew for the first time in six years, according to research firm Gartner.
AMD reported a net income of $116 million, or 11 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, compared to a loss of $42 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier.
This was the company's highest quarterly net income in seven years, AMD said.
Excluding items, the company earned 14 cents per share, beating the analysts' average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose 53 percent to $1.76 billion, marginally topping estimates of $1.72 billion.

For the third quarter, AMD forecast revenue of about $1.7 billion, plus or minus $50 million. Analysts had expected revenue of $1.76 billion.

537,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 05:08PM ET</span>","Sinclair, Tribune shares jump after Trump knocks FCC in tweet","By David Shepardson and Kara Carlson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (O:SBGI) and  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO) shares rose on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized regulators for deferring a decision on their proposed $3.9 billion tie-up and a federal appeals court upheld a change in broadcast ownership rules.
""So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn’t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Sinclair shares closed up 3.8 percent at $27.05, while Tribune rose 3.3 percent to $33.92. Sinclair is down about 19 percent since Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said on July 18 he had ""serious concerns"" about the deal announced in May 2017.
Pai said on Wednesday he was not backing down from the decision to refer the deal for review by an administrative law judge despite Trump's comments.
""I stand by our decision,"" Pai told a U.S. House panel.
Pai, who has come under heavy criticism from Democrats previously for taking actions that could benefit Sinclair, said he did not make decisions based on the ideology of applicants but looked at the facts. ""Nothing more, nothing less,"" he said.
The FCC voted last week 4-0 to refer the proposed merger to an administrative law judge to review questions about the company's candor, a move that analysts say will likely lead to the deal's collapse.
The FCC said Sinclair ""did not fully disclose"" facts about the merger, raising questions about whether the company ""attempted to skirt the commission’s broadcast ownership rules.”
Sinclair, the largest U.S. television station owner, did not immediately comment on Trump's tweet and has denied it misled the FCC about station divestitures.
Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said on Twitter it was ""outrageous that Trump is chastising the FCC for actually doing its job. Chairman Pai didn’t think Sinclair was being honest with the FCC, but all Trump cares about is media outlets that spread his lies.""
Also on Wednesday, a federal appeals court in Washington rejected a challenge to reverse the FCC's decision to reinstate rules that allow broadcasters to partially count some stations against national broadcast limits. The FCC has acknowledged that the rule ""no longer has a sound technical basis"" but reinstated it pending a broader review of the national ownership cap.
Sinclair had said without the rule it would not have been able to acquire as many Tribune stations as it sought.
Sinclair has said if the deal is approved, it would reach nearly 59 percent of the nation’s television households and come amid growing consolidation. Either Tribune or Sinclair can terminate the deal if it is not completed by Aug. 8.

On Tuesday, Cox Enterprises Inc [COXET.UL] said it was exploring strategic options for its 14 television properties, including stations in Atlanta, Seattle, Boston, Charlotte, North Carolina, Orlando, Florida, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Cox cited statements by Pai ""that he intends to loosen rules around ownership of local TV stations.""

1. Facebook Misses on Revenue
The tech sector faces tough going Thursday morning after Facebook reported second-quarter revenue that was shy of what Wall Street was expecting.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell nearly 10% in after-hours trading immediately after the numbers hit the tape postmarket Wednesday.
Facebook said total sales for the three months ended June 30 were $13.23 billion. Advertising sales were $13.038 billion. That was below the $13.35 billion analysts, on average, forecast.
Earnings came in at $1.74 per share for the quarter, topping estimates of $1.72 per share.
Monthly active users were 2.23 billion as of June 30, up 11% year over year. Daily active users were 1.47 billion.
The results will likely put the brakes (for a moment) on the exuberance in the tech sector seen after Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) parent Alphabet’s strong quarter.
2. Big Energy (Including Coffee) Names to Report
Among the big names reporting earnings before the bell Thursday are energy behemoths ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa).
Drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) also reports, as does Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and low-cost airline Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).
But don’t be surprised if a chronically sleep-deprived Wall Street takes a keen interest in Dunkin Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN), not just for the coffee stats, but the state of U.S. consumer.
Analysts expect that Dunkin’s second-quarter earnings rose to 74 cents a share on revenue of more than $344 million. Apart from the headline numbers, investors will concentrate on comparable-store sales. The company reported a surprise drop in that metric in the first quarter. Also in focus will be plans for Dunkin to expand its footprint with more store opening.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) reports earnings after the bell Thursday. The company already disappointed the market in June with tepid yearly comparable sales guidance and a plan to close 100 more stores than originally planned.
3. Durables Goods, Jobless Claims Highlight Economic Indicators
On Thursday’s economic calendar, durable goods numbers stand out.
June durable goods orders are expected to post a 3% rise for June, while economists forecast core orders, which exclude transportation, posted a 0.5% rise. Core orders have been volatile of late and posted a surprised decline in May.
A day after the meeting on trade between the U.S. and EU in Washington, the latest numbers on the goods trade balance arrive, with economists expecting a widening of that deficit for June.
And initial jobless claims for the week ended July 20 are forecast to have increased to 215,000."

The company also said that it will cut 2,200 jobs, or 22 percent of its global non-manufacturing workforce, and plans to sell factories in Mexico, as part of a $650 million cost-saving program.
Mattel had a total of about 28,000 employees as of Dec. 31, 2017.
The company's net sales fell 13.7 percent to $840.7 million in the second quarter ended June 30, short of the $851.8 million analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Revenue from the company's partner brands, which includes sales from toys based on movie franchisees fell 23 percent in the reported quarter.
""We had a one-off very big quarter last year because of Cars 3 which also skewed the results,"" Mattel's newly minted Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz told Reuters.
The company, like the rest of the U.S. toy industry, has been hit hard by the liquidation of retailer Toys 'R' Us and said the closure of its biggest customer dented its gross sales by 10 percent in the second quarter.
""We ... had a challenging second quarter driven primarily by the Toys ""R"" Us liquidation,"" Kreiz said in a statement.
Kreiz, however, was optimistic that the company could recover lost sales from the defunct retailer, saying that he was in ""deep conversations"" with other retailers to fill the gap left by Toys 'R' Us.
Earlier in the week, rival  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit as sales of toys based on big movie successes, Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther helped it pare losses from Toys 'R' Us' liquidation. 
Mattel's net loss in the reported quarter widened to $240.9 million, or 70 cents per share, from $56.1 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding certain items, the company recorded a loss of 56 cents per share, bigger than the 30 cents analysts had expected.

Total payments volume rose 11 percent to $2.10 trillion, on a constant dollar basis, with the United States - its largest market - comprising about 44 percent of the total.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose in the most recent quarter in an economy that is expected to have grown at its fastest annualized rate in three years.
Cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made outside the United States - saw a 11 percent growth in the quarter also on a constant currency basis.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.68%. The S&P 500 rose 0.91%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 1.17%.
Stocks staged a late-session rally on a report that EU had agreed to a host of measures aimed at easing U.S.-EU trade restrictions, averting the prospect of a trade war, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an EU official.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to work with the White House to lower industrial tariffs on both sides, increase natural gas exports and soy beans to Europe and harmonize regulatory standards to allow for medical devices to have better market access in Europe, the official said, according to WSJ.
Easing trade-war tensions sent stocks into rally mode, offsetting concerns about mixed earnings from a raft of well-known U.S. corporates.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock fell about 4.6% as it cut its 2018 profit forecast, citing higher steel and aluminium costs in the wake of tariffs imposed by Trump. Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 0.63% after it guided full-year core earnings below consensus.
AT&T (NYSE:T) stock lost about 4.5% after reporting mixed second-quarter results as earnings beat consensus, but revenue fell short. That weighed on the broader telecom sector as it posted a 2% loss, limiting gains in the broader market.
A rally in tech and energy stocks also supported sentiment on equities as the latter benefited from a continued rise in oil prices after U.S. crude inventories fell sharply as imports shrunk.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock tumbled in after-hours trading immediately after reporting that second-quarter revenue and daily active users fell short of estimates.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery gained 1% to settle at $69.30 a barrel.
In economic news, sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to an eight-month low in June, but that had muted impact on direction as analysts said the underlying trend of new homes sales remained robust.
The Commerce Department said Wednesday new home sales fell 5.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 631,000 units last month, the lowest level since October 2017.

Surging demand and a 25 percent U.S. tariff have combined to send the benchmark domestic steel price surging more than 40 percent this year. Premiums added to the price of aluminum for delivery in the U.S. Midwest have more than doubled this year. In March, the U.S. announced a 10 percent tariff on imports of the metal.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 02:25PM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler's Marchionne dies, shares dive on profit slide","By Agnieszka Flak 
MILAN (Reuters) - Former Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne, who rescued the Italian and U.S. companies and built them into the world's seventh-largest carmaker, has died, the news breaking moments before the group reported a heavy fall in profit on Wednesday.
The announcement of the death of Marchionne, 66, one of the auto industry's most tenacious and respected CEOs, drew tributes from rivals and tears from his closest colleagues, a collective grief that overshadowed a big sell-off in Fiat Chrysler shares.
Marchionne had fallen gravely ill after what the company had described as shoulder surgery at a Zurich hospital. He was replaced as chief executive last weekend after Fiat Chrysler (FCA) said his condition had worsened.
FCA's scheduled second-quarter earnings presentation, led by Marchionne's successor and former lieutenant Mike Manley, began on Wednesday afternoon with a minute's silence. At FCA's Italian base in Turin, ""executives are all in tears. I spoke to a few of them,"" said a source close to the company. 
As eulogies flooded in, FCA shares fell more than 16 percent as investors digested an unexpected 11 percent fall in adjusted operating profit, well below market forecasts.
""Unfortunately, what we feared has come to pass. Sergio Marchionne, man and friend, is gone,"" FCA Chairman John Elkann, scion of the controlling Agnelli family, said in a statement.
Marchionne rescued Fiat and Chrysler from bankruptcy after taking the wheel of the Italian carmaker in 2004 and he multiplied Fiat's value 11 times through 14 years of canny dealmaking. He was due to step down at FCA in April next year.
""The best way to honor his memory is to build on the legacy he left us, continuing to develop the human values of responsibility and openness of which he was the most ardent champion,"" Elkann added.
NEW BOSS, SAME STRATEGY
On Saturday, FCA named Jeep division head Manley, 54, as head of the world's seventh-largest carmaker, saying the Briton would execute a strategy that Marchionne had outlined in June.
Marchionne was also replaced on Saturday as chairman and CEO of Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and chairman of tractor maker CNH Industrial, both spun off from FCA.
Underlining the task facing Manley, FCA cut its full-year profit outlook after the weaker-than-expected quarter. It blamed the result on a weaker performance in China, a market that represents one of the new CEO's immediate headaches.
""The biggest challenges we face and frankly we're going to continue to face ... are all focused in China,"" Manley said.
FCA has yet to make any significant inroads in China.
In Marchionne's June plan, FCA pledged to boost production of sport utility vehicles and invest in electric and hybrid cars as part of a plan to double operating profit by 2022. It also unveiled fresh bold targets for Jeep, FCA's profit engine.
The auto industry has lost one of its strongest protagonists for mergers and acquisitions at a time when strategic alliances with technology companies are increasingly supplanting transformational mergers between traditional carmakers.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook described Marchionne as ""an auto industry visionary"".
Marchionne had advocated industry mergers to share the cost of building electric and self-driving cars.
He gave up the quest when his preferred target, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), rejected his advances and focused on fixing FCA's finances first, notably erasing all net debt, which he achieved in the quarter to June.
Manley said on Wednesday that his mandate was to deliver the 2022 strategy as ""a strong and independent FCA"" but added the group would remain ""flexible"" about any deal opportunities. 
In the absence of a partner, Manley needs to show FCA can keep churning out profits on its own, even as emissions rules tighten, SUV competition intensifies and worries over potential U.S. emissions fines abound. FCA is also heavily reliant on North America just as that market is expected to come off its peaks.
The future appears less clear at Ferrari, which Marchionne had been due to lead until 2021 and where a new mid-term strategy was supposed to be unveiled in September.
TRIBUTES PAID
Tributes arrived from industry figures and politicians worldwide, praising his perseverance, hard negotiating skills and candor.
Marchionne resurrected one of Italy's biggest corporate names and revitalized Chrysler, succeeding where the U.S. company's two previous owners - Mercedes parent Daimler and private equity group Carberus - failed. 
""Sergio Marchionne was one of the most respected leaders in the industry whose creativity and bold determination helped to restore Chrysler to financial health and grow Fiat Chrysler into a profitable global automaker,"" said Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr.
Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said in a post on Linkedin: ""The auto industry has lost a real giant. And many of us have lost a very dear friend: Sergio Marchionne.""
At FCA, Marchionne flattened an inflexible hierarchy, replacing layers of middle management with a meritocratic leadership style. He slashed costs by reducing the number of vehicle architectures and creating joint ventures to pool development and plant costs.
""Marchionne’s leadership will remain our benchmark in the automotive industry,"" said Carlos Tavares, CEO of PSA Group.
A tough negotiator known for getting his way, in 2005 Marchionne forced GM to pay Fiat $2 billion not to exercise an option to sell its auto division to the U.S. carmaker - a move that may not have helped his later merger overtures.
Marchionne's track record with operational turnarounds was a little more patchy than his dealmaking. Profitability in Europe is only now gradually recovering, and Alfa Romeo has yet to turn a profit despite multi-billion-euro investments. 
In North America, however, Marchionne was quick to end production of unprofitable sedans and retool plants to build pricier SUVs and trucks, a move since emulated by Ford and GM.

Marchionne had ""created a remarkable legacy"", said Mary Barra, the GM boss that rejected Marchionne's tie-up advances.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 02:25PM ET</span>","Boeing's refueling tanker woes obscure profit beat, shares fall","By Ankit Ajmera and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Wednesday posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue but shares dropped as much as 3.6 percent after it reported $426 million in higher costs on its long-delayed KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program. 
Analysts worry that the world's largest planemaker's exposure to an escalating trade fight between Washington and Beijing as well as mounting costs on the tanker program will slow Boeing shares, up more than 21 percent year to date.
""The KC-46 has returned to again haunt Boeing's results,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a research note.
""Management has previously expressed confidence that there would be no more tanker charges, and yet they keep coming,"" Stallard said, adding that the higher tanker costs came with unchanged earnings and cash flow forecasts.
Chicago-based Boeing said the KC-46 program cost an additional $426 million before taxes in the quarter as the company worked through test delays and production changes to eight aircraft in various stages of production. 
Boeing has amassed roughly $3 billion in costs on the program, a derivative of its 767 commercial aircraft, as it works to deliver tankers to the Air Force in October - more than two years behind schedule. 
Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told analysts on a post-earnings conference call that plans to complete manufacturing on the tankers was ""clear, and firmed up.""
Muilenburg also said he was not surprised by the unusually high number of plane orders announced during last week's Farnborough Airshow with unnamed buyers. Rival Airbus (PA:AIR) said the firms did not want to be identified due to jitters about appearing to side with the United States or other economic powers amid heated trade rhetoric.
""I don't find it (the anonymity) surprising one way or the other,"" Muilenburg said, adding that Chinese demand for Boeing aircraft extends far beyond a single air show.
""As we think about the China-U.S trade relationships, aerospace is something that is good for both countries,"" Muilenburg said. ""It creates growth capacity in China. It's helping to grow their economy. It's growing jobs in China. And as China grows, it's growing jobs in the U.S.""
Despite the KC-46 problems, Boeing beat expectations on quarterly profit. Core earnings, which exclude some pension costs, were $3.33 per share, while the average analyst estimate was $3.26, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Overall revenue rose 5 percent to $24.26 billion, also topping estimates, while commercial aircraft deliveries increased by 6 percent to 194 aircraft. Boeing booked 239 net orders during the quarter, including 91 wide-body jets.
For the full year, the company expects total revenue of $97 billion to $99 billion, compared with its previous estimate of $96 billion to $98 billion.
Boeing also forecast a 2018 operating margin of 10 percent to 10.5 percent in its defense business, down from its previous outlook of roughly 11 percent, and did not change its 2018 core earnings outlook of $14.30 to $14.50 per share.
Wall Street has estimated $14.56 per share.

The stock was down 2.6 percent to $349.11 in afternoon trading.

553,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 01:58PM ET</span>","For Russian business, Putin's summit win over Trump turns sour","By Polina Devitt and Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's political and business leaders were quick to chalk up last week's summit with U.S. President Donald Trump as a victory for Vladimir Putin. Now some fear Putin may have overplayed a winning hand and are bracing for a U.S. sanctions backlash.
The rouble fell 1.2 percent on Tuesday after two U.S. senators said in a statement they had begun working on new sanctions that would, among other things, take aim at Russian sovereign debt. It later recovered most of its losses.
While the sanctions proposed by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Bob Menendez were seen by most political risk analysts as unlikely in the near term, new curbs contemplated by other U.S. lawmakers targeting the energy and metals sectors are more realistic, they say.
""There was hope that dialogue would start after the talks between Putin and Trump. But the reaction inside the United States is blocking any dialogue,"" said one billionaire included in January on a U.S. Treasury list of people deemed too close to the Kremlin, some of whom were later hit with sanctions.
""The threat of wider sanctions has grown,"" the businessman told Reuters, declining to be named because of the subject's sensitivity. 
Russian business people had hoped the Helsinki meeting, the first between the two presidents, would pave the way for a possible thaw in relations and delay, if not stop, the preparation of more sanctions which have followed thick and fast since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea. 
Instead, anger about what some U.S. lawmakers saw as a too-deferential performance by Trump in Helsinki and his failure to publicly confront Putin over Moscow's alleged meddling in U.S. politics may have made things worse. 
In a country where state media portrays Putin as a seemingly infallible leader, even some of his supporters were fretting that he may have made an error by appearing to demonstrably take Trump's side.
In Helsinki, Putin said for the first time that he had wanted Trump to win the 2016 U.S. presidential election and after the summit complained about political forces in the United States trying to undermine the meeting's outcome.
Sergei Markov, a longtime Putin supporter and former lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party, wrote on social media after the summit that the Russian president had outplayed Trump in Helsinki ""by a big margin"", but added:
""... In doing so he created a problem because he exposed his partner to fierce criticism in the United States.""
Putin should have given Trump the chance to tell U.S. media that he had extracted concessions from him in a ""giveaway game"", staying focused on the longer-term goal of stabilizing ties between Moscow and Washington, Markov said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
'SELLING RUSSIA'
Instead, Putin appeared dominant while Trump was deemed by U.S. critics as overly friendly to Russia and possibly even treasonous when he gave credence to Putin's denials of meddling in the 2016 election despite U.S. intelligence findings to the contrary. Many Republicans joined Democrats in criticizing Trump's performance.
With an eye on U.S. mid-term elections in November, a bipartisan group of senators is pushing the ""DETER Act"" legislation putting Putin on notice that his country would be hit with more U.S. sanctions if Russia interferes in future polls. 
It was unclear how quickly that and other proposals could advance with U.S. Congress' summer recess looming. 
But the business and financial community in Russia is still worried.
""The only outcome of this so far is that people are selling Russia,"" said one state banker. ""All liquid (Russian) securities are now hostage to geopolitics, which strongly depend on what goes on in the United States.""
Mitigating that risk would be tricky, business people said.
""You can't keep your assets in roubles because the rouble is linked to the dollar and if there will be more sanctions the rouble will suffer,"" said one businessman, asking not to be named because he didn't want to be linked with sanctions risk. 
""You can't hold them in dollars because of sanctions. That leaves holding euros in private banks which is frightening (because Russian private banks can be unstable), U.S. Treasuries if you can get them, and other low risk assets,"" he said.
""In short, nobody is expecting anything good to happen."" 
Dmitri Trenin, a former colonel in the Russian army and director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, agreed it might have been better for Putin to have adopted an approach of ""strategic patience"" with the United States, but said it was not too late.
""The first détente in the hybrid war between Russia and the West was ... nipped in the bud by Trump's behavior and the vehemence of his domestic critics. So be it,"" Trenin wrote in an article published on the center's website after the summit.

""Moscow’s strategy should now be one of patience, leaving America and Europe to their own devices and focusing on relations with countries far more relevant to its future: Asia and the Middle East.""

555,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 01:13PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank cites progress on overhaul despite profit slide,"By Tom Sims and Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) new boss hailed significant progress in his efforts to reshape the bank, having cut a quarter of the staff at its global equities business, as the lender posted a decline in quarterly profit.
Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who took the top job in April, had made the equities cull a pillar of his plan to restore profitability. It is part of a wider effort to cut more than 7,000 jobs by end of next year.
The details of restructuring progress at Germany's largest bank came on Wednesday as it announced a 14 percent drop in net profit in the second quarter from a year earlier. The quarter was marked by weakness in its key trading business.
""The last three months have given me confidence,"" Sewing wrote in a memo to employees. ""We've made a start and we're already seeing the first signs of change in our results.""
The company had more than 95,000 staff at the end of the second quarter. 
 Deutsche Bank  is trying to bounce back from three consecutive years of losses and has had a run of negative headlines, including an abrupt management reshuffle, a downgrade by Standard & Poor's and failing the U.S. Federal Reserve's stress test.
The bank's shares closed down 1.4 percent at 10.31 euros and are down 35 percent so far this year.
Shortly after becoming chief executive officer, Sewing announced plans to cut its global equities business, as well as U.S. bond trading and its business that serves hedge funds. He said the moves would be swift.
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note to investors praised Deutsche's efforts under Sewing to cut costs but said the bank ""needs to deliver"" on material restructuring given a ""limited track record of delivery in the past"". 
The ratings agency Fitch, which in June downgraded Deutsche's outlook to negative, said it saw challenges ahead. 
""The bank will also have to prove its ability to compete with peers, most of which have fewer constraints as they have completed their own restructuring projects,"" Fitch wrote.
""RIGHT DIRECTION""
Deutsche had last week flagged that the quarter's net profit would be more than double analysts' forecasts in a rare piece of good news for the bank. 
Net profit in the second quarter was 401 million euros ($468 million), down from 466 million euros last year. Revenues were flat at 6.6 billion euros, halting a steep decline from previous years.
""We're making important changes to our core businesses as promised, we're headed in the right direction on costs, and our balance sheet quality is strong,"" Sewing said on Wednesday.
Deutsche Bank is still struggling to repair its reputation.
Its DWS asset management unit saw clients pull 4.9 billion euros in assets in the second quarter. ""The noise around the bank"" had ""some impact there"", said Nicolas Moreau, CEO of the unit. 
At the investment bank, revenue was partly helped by a one-time gain of 57 million euros from a disposal in the quarter. 
Revenue at its cash-cow bond-trading division dropped by 17 percent despite more volatile markets, though the bank said it plans to funnel more money into the division.
By contrast, some big U.S. banks posted sharp increases in profit as volatility caused by escalating trade tensions and central bank policy changes stirred a rise in trading volumes across Wall Street. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) reported a 44 percent rise in second-quarter profit on Tuesday, driven by strength in its investment banking and fixed income trading businesses.

""Our hope is that over time we will begin to perform and close the gap against the peers,"" said finance chief James von Moltke on a conference call. ""But we are focused on running our own race.""

557,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","Here Comes Chinese Stimulus, Back to Save Market Bulls","(Bloomberg) -- The Beijing “put” is back.
China’s bid to boost policy stimulus to barricade its domestic economy from the brewing trade war is breathing life into risk assets battered by liquidity and geopolitical angst.
Among the winners: Asian junk bonds, the besieged industrial-metals complex and emerging-market stocks.
Bulls can thank the State Council meeting this week that outlined a package of measures to ease the nation’s slowdown, ranging from targeted tax cuts to special bonds for infrastructure investment.
""The largest surprise is that the meeting did not mention deleveraging and financial risk control, a centerpiece in China’s economy policy since late 2017,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG strategists led by Vincent Chan wrote in a note. ""They will be favorable to sectors sensitive to investment demand, like industrials and materials.""
Aggressive and broad-based fiscal and monetary easing, for now, isn’t on the horizon. But the pro-growth tone signaling a softening of the deleveraging campaign is giving investors the green light to snap up assets sensitive to Chinese liquidity and investment, across equity, debt and commodity markets.
Here’s a rundown of markets dancing to the Sino beat.
EM Embraced
Emerging-market equities bested U.S. small caps by the most in 29 months on Tuesday in what could be a burgeoning reversal of the “America First” equities trade. That outperformance has a distinctly Made-In-China component, as these companies -- especially the BAT (LON:BATS) trio of Baidu,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), and Tencent -- account for a hefty share of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by market capitalization.
What’s more, greed is back. Bloomberg’s indicator of buying strength versus selling for the Shanghai Composite Index is in the green again after dropping to a four-month low earlier in the month.
A broader recovery for the asset class could also be in the works, given the dollar’s sideways trend over the past month and the tendency for developing-market equities to move in tandem.
Old Is New
Some of the ""old economy"" segments of the Chinese equity market have also rebounded strongly in recent sessions. That includes industrials, which carried out the country’s credit-fueled growth binge, as well as the banks that facilitated it.
The MSCI China Banks Index has advanced by 7 percent since June 19, while the Global X China Industrials ETF (CHII) has gained 3.2 percent over the same period.
Industrial metals are also rebounding, as sentiment about the investment cycle picks up. Copper, typically viewed as an economic bellwether, continues to flirt with the $6,300 mark after plunging close to a one-year low earlier in the month.
Beijing’s signal that that fiscal policy tweaks would have the economy “leaning more on credit expansion is the overarching factor helping to turn around copper,” said Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management, which manages over $800 billion overall.
Another raw material seen as a front-line casualty in China’s growth shift and the brewing trade war -- iron ore -- is also finally catching a break.
After jumping to a two-year high, risk premiums for speculative-grade bonds in Asia have fallen by about 70 basis points over the past two weeks. The rally has a distinctly Beijing feel, with over half of the issuers in the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Asia High Yield Bond Index hailing from China. Overall, industrial issuers account for 66 percent.
""The deleveraging process needs to be softened and slowed, and the latest development suggests that such adjustments have begun,"" Wei Yao, China economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA in Paris, wrote in a note.
One indicator to watch: gaming revenue in Macau, a bellwether for animal spirits and Chinese liquidity. Share prices for casino operators like MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd. have tended to loosely track the annual change in the sector’s financial fortunes. Signs that the Chinese economy is on a firmer footing will likely be accompanied by more high-rollers rolling into Macau.
A stimulative policy stance, with deleveraging ostensibly moved to the back-burner, is a movie investors have seen recently. In 2016, policy makers employed this to avert the risk of a hard landing in the world’s second-largest economy following the shock yuan devaluation in August 2015. On the surface, it worked, with the ensuing market response now serving as a playbook of sorts for bulls.
Still, with a trade war and elevated domestic leverage, the fear is that a Made-in-China premium will confront risk markets soon enough.
""The danger is that the authorities will pour money into the economy because they either overdo/mishandle the financial sector clean-up or the trade war does much more serious damage to consumer and business sentiment,"" Diana Choyleva at Endo Economics wrote in a note."

568,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 12:22PM ET</span>","Tariffs cause GM, FCA to trim 2018 profit forecasts, stocks hit","By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Tariffs were partly to blame for lowered full-year forecasts by General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), pummeling the stocks of both automakers on Wednesday as investors feared escalating trade disputes would hurt margins and sales.
GM cited higher steel and aluminum costs for its 2018 profit forecast reduction as a result of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, sending its shares down 7 percent.
Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said GM put in a ""solid performance"" in the second quarter ""despite some fairly significant headwinds that have built throughout the year.""
Stevens told analysts GM would partially offset the commodity hit by negotiating price reductions with suppliers, raising prices on more popular models, and cost cutting. 
In FCA's case, Chinese demand slumped in the quarter ahead of a July cut in import duties, resulting in higher incentive spending and an increase in unsold vehicle stocks that ""particularly affected Maserati,"" new Chief Executive Mike Manley told analysts on a conference call.
Manley said ""very, very cost conscious"" Chinese consumers sat on the sidelines during the second quarter waiting for prices to come down. A rise in the group's inventory will continue to impact results as stocks are cleared ahead of new emissions regulations, he added. 
FCA shares were down 15 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.
The automakers' results were overshadowed by news former CEO Sergio Marchionne died after suffering complications from surgery.
FCA said it has fixed-price contracts for most raw steel through 2018, but would see increases in 2019 at current prices. 
The warnings from both automakers come amid growing fears over a trade war. Economists polled by Reuters said a now-robust U.S. economy will soon lose momentum on rising interest rates and escalating trade disputes.
GM said commodity costs and unfavorable currency in Brazil and Argentina would have a net impact of around $1 billion on its 2018 results. Previously, GM had expected those costs would total around $500 million.
Most of the costs affect North America, GM's main profit driver. GM's 2018 pre-tax adjusted margin should now be between 9 percent and 10 percent, down from its earlier forecast of 10 percent.
GM buys most of its steel from U.S. producers, who have raised prices in reaction to tariffs on imported steel imposed by the Donald Trump administration.
GM's U.S. sales performed well in the second quarter and the automaker said its full-size pickup truck plants are still running at more than 100 percent capacity to keep up with demand. GM will start selling its new full-size pickup trucks to customers next month.
Both GM and FCA are betting on redesigned pickup trucks to lift U.S. sales. Around 80 percent of FCA's second-quarter profit came from the U.S. market and the automaker said its new trucks should help lift its North American pre-tax adjusted margin to 10 percent in the second half of 2018.
Despite the tariffs, GM CFO Stevens said the recent U.S. tax overhaul and low unemployment should help keep industry-wide U.S. new vehicle sales at a robust level either slightly below or on par with sales in 2017.
""What happens beyond 2018, there’s a lot of uncertainty in this space at this point in time,"" he said. 
GM also said higher costs would reduce adjusted automotive free cash flow by around $1 billion to $4 billion. 
FCA said its net industrial cash flow in 2018 would fall to 3 billion euros ($3.50 billion) from a previous forecast of 4 billion euros.
GM said it now expects to earn around $6 per share, down from its previous forecast of $6.30 to $6.60. 
""The magnitude is greater than expected and the headwinds could’ve probably been better communicated in advance,"" Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said in a research note, who described GM's outlook as ""disappointing.""
In May, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) said it would invest $2.25 billion in GM's autonomous vehicle unit Cruise, sending the automaker's shares up nearly 13 percent.
With the profit warning on Wednesday, all of those share price gains have now been lost.
FCA said it expected 2018 net revenues between 115 billion and 118 billion euros, down from a previous forecast of around 125 billion euros, while adjusted EBIT is expected at between 7.5-8.0 billion euros from at least 8.7 billion.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) will report results after the close of trading on Wednesday.

572,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 12:11PM ET</span>",Pharma's middlemen see shares suffer as challenges grow,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uncertainty over potential actions to reduce prescription drug costs and competitive threats have taken a toll this year on shares of companies in the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain. They get their chance to change investor sentiment with quarterly earnings reports in the coming days.
Prescription drug wholesalers, drug store chains and pharmacy benefit managers generally have seen their stock prices tumble this year, even as the overall S&P 500 healthcare sector (SPXHC) has gained 6 percent.
Six S&P 500 stocks - CVS Health Corp (N:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA), AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC), McKesson Corp (N:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX) - collectively recently traded a third below their average valuation of the past five years, based on price-to-earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. 
""It’s the uncertainty related to the business model itself that is causing the steep discount in valuations,"" said Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut. 
Fears the U.S. government will take actions to rein in prescription drug prices, an issue trumpeted by U.S. President Donald Trump, have cast a cloud over the stocks.
Just last week, the shares were rattled as the Trump administration proposed a rule to scale back protections that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers, among the industry's so-called middlemen.
Amazon's (O:AMZN) designs on health care, in particular its planned acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack, also are pressuring the stocks, as are moves by drugmakers such as  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and Merck & Co (N:MRK) to cut some drug prices or roll back increases.
""This space is incredibly difficult to analyze and we can’t in good conscience recommend fresh investment, despite low valuations,"" Eric Coldwell, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, said in a research note last week. Coldwell downgraded his ratings to ""neutral"" on shares of McKesson, Amerisource and Express Scripts.

McKesson, which reports results on Thursday with other companies following in next two weeks, has had its shares fall about 15 percent this year. Shares of rival drug wholesalers, Amerisource and Cardinal, have fallen nearly 9 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Drug store chains CVS and Walgreens have dropped about 9.5 percent each. CVS is also a large pharmacy benefit manager (PBM).
Express Scripts shares have climbed more than 6 percent this year. The PBM's stock price has benefited from the company's March agreement to be bought by insurer  Cigna Corp  (N:CI). Even so, the stock recently traded at only 8.3 times earnings estimates for next 12 months, a discount to its five-year average of 12 times.
The cheaper valuations are drawing the attention of some investors who believe the selling appears overdone. 
Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager who focuses on healthcare for Gabelli & Co, has been buying shares of Amerisource. ""The wholesalers in particular are always going to have a role to play,"" he said.
""We have just had too many issues of counterfeit or tampered drugs over the years,"" Jonas said. ""So I think having these well-monitored, well-controlled supply chains is still pretty important.”

After an IPO, a merger with another company and a takeover by yet another one, Hastings moved on. In 1997, he co-founded Netflix with Marc Rudolph. The idea was to offer DVD rentals and sales via a website and deliver them through the mail. The company's service launched in 1998 and grew quickly with the popularity of DVDs. The company was headed for a quick IPO, but the dot.com crash of 2000 and the September 11 attacks of 2001 delayed that until 2002. The turning point came in 2007, when Netflix added video streaming to its DVD rental service. In 2012, the company started creating its own content and has since become a major producer of programming. Netflix now has 130 million subscribers in more than 190 countries.Netflix stock is up more than 30,000% since its IPO, when stock splits are factored in. Off the job, Hastings is an active education philanthropist with a special interest in charter schools. He served on the California State Board of Education, and is currently on the boards of DreamBox, KIPP and Pahara. Hastings is worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes. In 2012, however, he signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign that encourages wealthy people to donate half of their money to philanthropy. That's quite a math lesson for a one-time teacher. "

The ruling by the European Court of Justice means the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must review a 2012 decision to uphold Swiss-based Nestle's (S:NESN) trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit over objections raised by Mondelez (O:MDLZ) of the United States.
The Luxembourg court found that Nestle had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive but also dismissed an appeal by Mondelez against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016 that had found the EUIPO was wrong to reject the U.S. firm's complaint.
The outcome leaves open that the trademark agency could, while respecting the judges' ruling, take account of other evidence -- such as new proof the shape is distinctive to people in more countries -- and might preserve protection for KitKat's shape. The brand name ""KitKat"" is not at issue in the case.
Proceedings have been followed closely by trademark lawyers, who see implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets.
It has also at times featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat first marketed by Rowntree's, which was bought by the Swiss in 1988.
In 2015, the Brexit-supporting Daily Express newspaper headlined a story on an earlier ruling: ""End of the KitKat?"". It said an EU ""diktat"" might ""spell the end of"" the wafer bars as the ""market could now be flooded with copycat confectionery"".

The case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestle objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury, bought by the Americans in 2010, to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 08:11AM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler CEO's health crisis forced succession scramble,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Joseph White
LONDON/DETROIT (Reuters) - Former  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne for more than a year assured investors that he and the automaker's board were working on an orderly succession plan ahead of his expected departure in 2019.
But a health crisis that left 66-year-old Marchionne incapacitated in a Swiss hospital set off a transition last week that was sudden and rushed, banking and industry sources said. The company announced on Wednesday that Marchionne had died, succumbing to complications from surgery.
It emerged that Marchionne's successor was far from settled. Indeed before last week's crisis, many company executives remained in the dark, four banking sources who spoke to Fiat Chrysler executives told Reuters.
The scramble to replace Marchionne led to the resignation of a senior executive who was passed over for the top job, the sources said, and exposed fissures between the Italian and North American sides of the world's seventh-largest automaker.
Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann named Michael Manley, head of the company's Jeep and Ram truck divisions, to replace Marchionne at an emergency meeting in Turin, Italy on Saturday. In doing so, Elkann followed Marchionne's wishes to appoint Manley his successor, two sources said.
The company has portrayed Manley's appointment as the product of lengthy deliberation.
""Sergio and John have always been totally aligned on the choice of Mike Manley,"" Fiat Chrysler's main spokesman Mike Keegan said on Tuesday, when asked whether there were differences over the succession.
Elkann's office declined to comment. Manley could not immediately be reached for comment.
This description diverges from what Marchionne himself told investors on June 1 during a day-long strategy presentation in Balocco, Italy.
Marchionne said that he and Elkann ""from time to time have these chats"" about succession, but the issue would not be decided until next year.
""It's a 2019 issue,"" Marchionne said. ""So it's not going to happen until we close '18. It just won't happen."" He went on to say that the company's board would not engage in a ""rubber stamp process.""
Some analysts have also expressed skepticism that a final decision had been made.
""My view is Marchionne and Elkann were still arguing about succession and had different views on the right candidate,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said in a note on Monday, referring to the June 1 presentation.
Sources close to the company said they believed two other candidates - Fiat Chrysler chief financial officer Richard Palmer and Europe chief Alfredo Altavilla - had been in the running to replace Marchionne and that Elkann was also exploring an ""Italian solution"" by naming an Italian-born CEO.
Altavilla, 54, quit after being told of Manley's appointment on July 21, one of the sources said.
A company veteran who joined Fiat in 1990, Altavilla took charge of the group's struggling European operations in 2012 and returned them to profit three years later.
Altavilla pressed Elkann to give him the top job on July 20 when it became clear that Marchionne would not come back to work, three sources familiar with the situation said.
""For Altavilla it was too important - he wants to be CEO atleast once in his career,"" one of the sources said.
Altavilla declined to comment.
MAJOR VOID
Marchionne underwent shoulder surgery in late June. The company said on July 21 that Manley would take over after Marchionne's condition took a sudden turn for the worse. The company has not provided details on Marchionne's illness.
Under the best of circumstances, Marchionne's pending departure presented Fiat Chrysler with a major void to fill. Regarded as a savior of Fiat, Italy's automotive champion, the Italian-born Marchionne set in motion the marriage between Fiat and bankrupt U.S. rival Chrysler just over a decade ago.
For the past several years, Marchionne had tried to engineer a merger or alliance between Fiat Chrysler and another automaker, driven by the view that car companies were developing too much duplicate technology in the chase for cleaner engines and electric cars. That ultimate deal eluded him.
Jetting between the company's offices and design studios in Europe and the United States, Marchionne dominated Fiat Chrysler, eclipsing the executives under him.
A native of Italy who grew up in Canada, Marchionne acted as a bridge between the company's Italian and American sides. He could parry questions from the Italian press in one press conference, and deliver sly put-downs of his rivals in English during the next.
Marchionne was a powerful advocate for the automaker's Italian cars and brands, and said he would not restructure the company to leave a ""stump"" company in Italy that could not survive.
Fiat Chrysler reported second quarter financial results on Wednesday, and the scheduled call with analysts will be Manley's first official step onto a public stage as CEO.
Manley runs the two brands, Jeep and Ram, that generate most of the group's profit. Born in Britain and based at the former Chrysler headquarters in suburban Detroit, Manley is expected by bankers and analysts at least initially to follow a five-year plan laid out by Marchionne and other executives in June.
As Fiat Chrysler heads into what most industry executives and analysts predict will be a difficult 2019, the automaker’s Italian brands have lost a powerful champion with Marchionne's departure.

Walmart shoppers in Phoenix metropolitan area can order groceries on Walmart.com and as their order is being prepared at the store, self-driving cars will transport them to the store and bring them back, Waymo said.
Waymo has also teamed up with U.S. shopping center owner DDR Corp to offer shoppers and diners rides in its self-driving vehicles to and from the Ahwatukee Foothills Towne Center in Chandler, Arizona.
Additionally, Waymo has expanded its existing partnerships with AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) and Avis Budget Group Inc in Phoenix. AutoNation will offer customers a Waymo, rather than a loaner car, to get around while their personal vehicles get serviced.
Avis Budget Group, which keeps Waymo vehicles charged and refueled for an upcoming ride, will provide its customers these self-driving vehicles as a last-mile solution to help them pick up or drop off their rental cars.
Having worked on self-driving cars since 2009 and with 5 million miles (8 million km) driven on public roads under its belt, Waymo is generally considered to be ahead of rivals in the development of autonomous vehicle technology.
Global automakers, suppliers and tech companies like Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc are pouring resources into the development of autonomous driving systems and launching networks of test fleets aimed at pushing the technology forward.
The complex challenges of self-driving and the high costs of research and development has led to a host of partnerships between automakers, suppliers and others.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>","Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler boss who liked to fix things","By Agnieszka Flak and Pamela Barbaglia
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Sergio Marchionne was one of the auto industry's most demanding and tenacious chief executives and he rescued Fiat and Chrysler, two of its most storied brands.
The gruff 66-year-old, who has died after succumbing to complications from recent surgery, spent 14 years at the wheel of Fiat Chrysler, the group he built. He was replaced as boss last weekend after his condition worsened.
In Italy, where his turnaround of Fiat earned him legendary status, he was treated like a rock star. The former philosophy student and accountant almost never wore a tie and preferred casual sweaters, half-joking that it saved him time on dressing.
A heavy smoker until giving up the habit a year ago, he was known for working extraordinarily long hours before falling ill. He demanded others keep a similarly grueling schedule, earning him a reputation from friends and foes alike for being stubborn and arrogant.
""I feel like I live in a tunnel. He is not just demanding; he wants all your life devoted to him,"" said one banker who worked with Marchionne on various deals in recent years.
Some could not keep up with his round-the-clock approach. 
Another banker who worked with Marchionne said he would receive emails from him at all hours, even in the middle of the night.
In his last public appearance on June 26, wearing his signature sweater, Marchionne appeared fatigued and out of breath as he presented a Jeep Wrangler to Italy's paramilitary police, the Carabinieri, at a ceremony in Rome.
Days later, he went to Switzerland to undergo what Fiat Chrysler (FCA) described as a shoulder operation. FCA has not said what happened after he left the operating theater, except that he suffered complications that suddenly worsened on Saturday.
In an emergency board meeting at the weekend, FCA chose the head of its Jeep division, Mike Manley, as his successor. On Wednesday, FCA Chairman John Elkann announced that the longtime CEO had passed away, saying: ""Sergio Marchionne, man and friend, is gone.""
Marchionne has done what many thought impossible, most notably his huge gamble just over a decade ago when he set in motion the marriage between the then-ailing Fiat with bankrupt U.S. rival Chrysler. It is now the world's seventh-largest carmaker and is debt-free.
""Sergio was a unique blend of a visionary and an executor. He combined a grand vision and the ability of getting things done. This is a real tragedy,"" said Domenico Siniscalco, a former Italian finance minister, now country head at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Italy.
In the clubbish world of Italian business, where change often happens slowly and chief executives bend to the prevailing political wind, Marchionne stood out as an exception, taking on trade unions and rowing publicly with politicians.
He pulled Fiat out of Confindustria, Italy's top business group, determined to negotiate directly with unions rather than pursue national wage bargaining via Confindustria. 
""Those of us watching have received an education in management, finance, politics, oratory and what's possible via sheer force of will,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said. 
'I LIKE TO FIX THINGS'
However, his shrewd dealmaking kept investors on board and earned him accolades, even from competitors.
Fiat's value grew more than tenfold, helped by the spin-off of trucks and tractor maker  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) and sportscar group  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), fuelling expectations of other transformational deals to come.
""You cannot ever question his leadership as a manager,"" said another a person who worked with him. ""He has done miracles at Fiat.""
The son of a carabiniere, Marchionne was born and raised in the poor central Italian region of Abruzzo. His family moved to Toronto when he was 14 to escape what his father viewed as the confines of an Italian society obsessed with status over talent.
His background was in finance, not autos, but Marchionne earned kudos for his turnaround skills in 2004-5 when he saved Fiat, Italy's biggest industrial group with a century of history and a 200,000-strong global workforce, from near bankruptcy.
""I like to fix things and, to be blunt, Fiat needs a fix right now,"" he said after his appointment as CEO in 2004.
He relentlessly pursued those goals, sleeping on the couch of his private plane while jetting between offices in Detroit, Turin and London.
A tough negotiator known for getting his way, in 2005 Marchionne forced General Motors (N:GM) to pay Fiat $2 billion not to exercise an option to sell its auto division to the U.S. carmaker. He flattened an inflexible hierarchy, replacing layers of middle management with meritocracy.
He took a knife to costs, drastically reducing the number of car platforms, and formed joint ventures to share development and manufacturing.
He clinched a partnership with Chrysler before eventually buying out the rest of it in a deal he orchestrated over his Christmas break in 2013, at a Florida beach, in a one-on-one meeting even those close to him were unaware of.
He revived Chrysler, betting that its Jeep brand should be taken global. Jeep is now Fiat Chrysler's growth engine.
He took the bold step to end production of unprofitable sedans in the United States and retool plants to boost output of lucrative SUVs and trucks, a move since emulated by rivals.
Known by direct reports in Italy as ""il Dottore"" - the Doctor - and by his U.S. lieutenants as ""The Boss"", Marchionne ran the executive team with an iron fist, according people who worked closely with him say. 
RECENT CHALLENGES
Marchionne had an impressive track record of creating shareholder value, but he was less successful at delivering a string of recent, ambitious turnarounds.
Profitability in Europe is only gradually recovering and FCA has yet to make any significant inroads in China. It has also yet to turn a profit with Alfa Romeo which, along with Jeep and Maserati, was the focus of a strategy launched in 2014.
Marchionne refused to follow rivals and invest in electrification, before finally making a U-turn as part of a strategy unveiled in June.
He also leaves FCA overly reliant on North America, a region expected to come off its peaks soon.
Even though his bid to merge with bigger U.S. rival GM (N:GM) to share the costs of making electric and autonomous vehicles was repeatedly rebuffed, Marchionne admitted a merger for FCA was ""ultimately inevitable"" to be able to compete.

""Being small, cute is going to do nothing,"" he said last year. ""Go home, go to a beauty parlor and do something else.""

593,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 07:32AM ET</span>",Former Fiat Chrysler CEO Marchionne dies,"MILAN (Reuters) - Former  Fiat  Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchionne, one of the auto industry's most tenacious and respected auto chiefs, has died, succumbing to complications from recent surgery.
The carmaker's controlling family shareholder confirmed news reports of his death on Wednesday, without giving the cause of death or saying when he had died.
Marchionne, 66, fell gravely ill after what the company had described as shoulder surgery in a Zurich hospital. He was replaced as chief executive last weekend after Fiat Chrysler (FCA) (MI:FCHA) said his condition had worsened.
""Unfortunately, what we feared has come to pass. Sergio Marchionne, man and friend, is gone,"" FCA Chairman John Elkann, scion of the controlling Agnelli family, said in a statement.
Marchionne rescued Fiat and Chrysler from bankruptcy after taking the wheel of the Italian carmaker in 2004 and he multiplied Fiat's value 11 times through 14 years of canny dealmaking. He was due to step down at FCA in April next year.
""The best way to honor his memory is to build on the legacy he left us, continuing to develop the human values of responsibility and openness of which he was the most ardent champion,"" Elkann added.
On Saturday, FCA named Jeep division head Mike Manley as chief executive at the world's seventh-largest carmaker, saying the 54-year-old Briton would execute a new mid-term strategy that Marchionne had outlined in June.
FCA has said Manley will work to ensure a ""strong and independent"" future for the group.

On Saturday, Marchionne was also replaced as chairman and CEO of  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) and chairman of tractor maker  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) -- both spun off from FCA in recent years.

Carmakers across the globe are readying themselves for a new geopolitical order after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened China and the European Union with tariffs in a bid to protect American jobs.
""If this escalates into a trade war, and everybody hikes tariffs, then this would hit trade, production and employment,"" Zitzelsberger, who is head of trade union IG Metall in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, told Reuters.
Trump has threatened to extend tariffs to cars and car parts imported from Europe in a step that could hurt the profits of German carmakers that export vehicles from both Europe and the United States.
""Some carmakers are very flexible and can produce several models in one factory, they have an advantage when it comes to making adjustments,"" Zitzelsberger, also a member of Daimler's board of directors, told Reuters.
BMW recently stopped exporting its x3 sports utility vehicle from Spartanburg, South Carolina, to China. The German carmaker plans instead to make the model in China and raise output there to a level exceeding Spartanburg's capacity. 
Labour representatives will watch any efforts to shift production away from Germany, to ensure that local jobs are not threatened.
""If this question is raised, we will not stand by and applaud, but will always try to defend employment and the manufacturing of certain models in Germany,"" Zitzelsberger said.
German labour representatives command half of the seats on the board of directors and have the power to veto significant strategic decisions. 
In the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg alone, which is home to carmakers Porsche (PSCH.UL), Mercedes-Benz, and suppliers Bosch [ROBG.UL] and Mahle [BEHR.UL], 440,000 jobs depend on the auto industry.

Tariffs between the U.S. and China have already hit  Daimler , parent of the Mercedes-Benz brand, forcing it to issue a profit warning in June, since it makes sports utility vehicles in Alabama and exports them around the globe.

PARIS (Reuters) - Problems with weldings have forced French utility EDF (PA:EDF) to delay the start-up date for its troubled Flamanville 3 nuclear reactor to the second quarter of 2020 and pushed its cost estimate up to three times the original budget.
When construction started in 2007, the target launch date was 2012, but the project has suffered a string of serious technical problems - including the discovery of weak spots in its reactor vessel cover - and has been delayed several times.
The cost estimate is now up by another 400 million euros to 10.9 billion euros ($12.75 billion), EDF said in a statement.
It said that loading of the nuclear fuel, last set for the fourth quarter of 2018, was now scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2019.
On a call with reporters, Flamanville project director Laurent Thieffry said that repairs to the weldings would start at the end of this month and continue till summer 2019.
He added that the reactor would be connected to the grid in the first quarter of 2020 and its commercial start at full power was now scheduled for the second quarter of 2020.
""The new planning for the EPR reactor in Flamanville is totally realistic,"" EDF head of new nuclear projects Xavier Ursat said. But he added that the startup schedule would depend on the go-ahead of nuclear regulator ASN.
EDF said the 400 million euro extra cost consisted of 60 to 70 million euros in cost directly related to the welding repairs, with the rest due to the impact of the delay on the entire project.
EDF shares were down 0.9 percent in early trading on a virtually flat French bourse.
WELDINGS
The utility said a total of 53 weldings on the reactor's secondary circuit would have to be redone, while for another 10 it is confident that it can convince regulator ASN that they are fit for service. Another 85 weldings were in line with specifications and needed no repairs, it said.
The secondary circuit consists of 360 meters of 50-95 cm diameter piping that conducts steam from the reactor’s four steam generators to the plant’s turbine, and pumps condensed water back to the steam generators.
Four to five centimeters thick, the pipes require high-tech welding that needs to go around each pipe 100 times and takes eight weeks per welding.
EDF said the 400 million euro extra cost consisted of 60 to 70 million euros directly related to the welding repairs, with the rest due to the impact of the delay on the entire project.
EDF said it would closely supervise and control the welding work on the reactor itself. A parliament report about nuclear security released this month said that excessive reliance on outsourcing was causing safety issues in EDF's reactors.
France relies on nuclear energy for 75 percent of its electricity. The EPR reactor is the first new reactor to be built on its soil in decades.
The French government wants to reduce the country's reliance on nuclear to 50 percent and will decide later this year by when this target should be reached.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Bill Browder, once the biggest foreign money manager in Russia, has filed a new criminal complaint in Estonia concerning Denmark's largest lender  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE). 
The new complaint comes two weeks after Browder filed a complaint with the Danish authorities over alleged money laundering at the bank's Estonian branch in the past.
The bank said last week it would forgo profits made from transactions in Estonia that are subject to a money laundering investigation.
Estonia's prosecutor's office confirmed it had received the criminal complaint from Bill Browder concerning Danske Bank but said it was not at liberty to disclose the details.
The prosecutor's office is analyzing the complaint now and after that it has ten days to decide whether it will begin a criminal investigation, spokesman Kaarel Kallas told Reuters.
""The office of the Prosecutor General takes money laundering cases extremely seriously and if the complaint has information that is sufficient enough in order to open a criminal investigation, then we most definitely will do it,"" he said.
He said, however, that under Estonian law, in order to press charges in money laundering cases, the prosecutor also has to prove the crime that was the source of the money.
""That makes things a little bit more difficult,"" he said.
Bloomberg reported that the new complaint targets 26 bankers who worked for Danske Bank in Estonia.
Danske Bank has admitted to flaws in its anti-money laundering controls in Estonia in the past and has launched its own investigation, the results of which are expected in September.
""We will – as we always do – have a constructive dialogue with the authorities if they want to discuss the matter with us,"" Danske Bank's spokesman said in response to the new criminal complaint.
Shares in Danske Bank have fallen 22 percent this year. 

Bill Browder did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - A three-day worldwide stocks rally was threatening to stall on Wednesday, as investors waited for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and the President of the European Commission to see where the global trade war was heading next.
Asian stocks had inched up overnight after Wall Street had hit a five-month high, extending a month-long advance, but tech and commodity stocks Europe <0#.INDEXE> eased early on (EU) as the market's focus returned to what may happen with tariffs.
EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a Swedish newspaper on Wednesday that the bloc was preparing to introduce tariffs on $20 billion of U.S. goods if Washington imposes levies on imported cars.
A monthly survey of German business confidence also showed some impact from the row, although there was no major plunge and traders in most markets seemed content to hold positions steady.
China's yuan had eased off a 13-month low (SS) which also soothed some nerves, while most major currencies [FRX/], bond benchmarks [GVD/EUR] and oil [O/R] were tucked in tight ranges. 
""We have seen a lot of complacency over this entire trade war so the question is, unless we see a very negative outcome (from the EU-U.S. meeting), are we going to see a marked reaction?"" Rabobank strategist Bas Van Geffen said. 
""It is an odd one where two key trade partners, but also two key allies, are now fighting each other.""
With another blizzard of multinational corporate earnings, a European Central Bank meeting and U.S. GDP figures still to come this week, there was plenty of scope for volatility.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies (DXY), was just off a two-week low at 94.506 and barely budged at $1.1692 against the euro (EUR=EBS) and 111.24 yen.  [FRX/]
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which tends to act as the benchmark for global borrowing costs (US10YT=RR), eased to 2.937 percent, after climbing to a six-week peak of 2.973 percent overnight.
Bond yields have been pushed up this week on speculation the Bank of Japan is edging closer to unwinding its aggressive stimulus programme.
But with the Thursday's ECB meeting looming, most bond yields in the euro area also edged down on Wednesday. [GVD/EUR] 
TALKING TURKEY
Britain's pound nudged up to $1.3150  after UK Prime Minister Theresa May had said on Tuesday that she would now lead negotiations on the country's departure from the European Union.
Turkey's lira  also clawed higher having sunk more than 3 percent on Tuesday, after its central bank shied away from raising rates in what was seen as another hit to its shredded credibility.
State Street Global Advisors currency portfolio manager Aaron Hurd said the worry is that President Tayyip Erdogan's government will put pressure on the central bank to keep rates down, fuelling what it already double-digit inflation. 
""The new (finance) minister and the new cabinet in total is an unknown quantity and we have to wait and see and learn how to interpret their behaviors,"" Hurd said. ""That means an even higher risk premium priced into the currency."" 
The decline in China's yuan paused for the time being also. The currency was a shade firmer at 6.797 per dollar  having hit a 13-month low of 6.829 this week on signs that Beijing is grabbing for the stimulus levers again.
The Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) closed fractionally lower after brushing a one-month high and enjoying a roughly 3-percent surge this week. (SS)
Tokyo's Nikkei (N225) ended 0.5 percent higher, Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) climbed 0.9 percent and, though South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) lost 0.4 percent, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares (MIAPJ0000PUS) gained 0.4 percent.
Those moves came after Wall Street's S&P 500 (SPX) closed at its highest level since the start of February as Google's (O:GOOGL) blowout results bolstered what has already been a bumper U.S. earnings season. (N)
In commodities, Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up 0.6 percent at $73.89 a barrel, adding to the previous day's gains as market focus shifted away from oversupply concerns to the possibility of increasing Chinese demand. [O/R] 
Copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) traded down at $6,264 per tonne  after soaring 2.7 percent overnight to a two-week peak of $6,328.00 on Chinese stimulus hopes.

Iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange  touched a two-month peak of 479.5 yuan a tonne, while precious metal gold was a touch higher at 1,228 an ounce.  [GOL/]

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Telecom network equipment maker Nokia (HE:NOKIA) is expected to post another plunge in quarterly profits on Thursday ahead of an anticipated boost later this year from next-generation 5G networks.
The industry has struggled since demand for the current generation of 4G mobile equipment peaked in 2015, but the Finnish company has forecast 5G roll-outs will start later this year in the United States, followed in 2019 by renewed buying cycles in Japan and South Korea.
""This should be the last weak quarter of this network market cycle,"" said Mikael Rautanen, an analyst at research firm Inderes, who has a ""buy"" rating on the stock. 
Chief Executive Rajeev Suri is upbeat on the outlook for the second half: ""Almost all profit expectations for their network business are based on his words at the moment,"" Rautanen said.
Shares in the company were boosted last week as Swedish rival Ericsson (ST:ERICb) posted an unexpected swing to a modest operating profit, citing growing 5G sales in North America. Nokia stock is up 30 percent year-to-date.
""Until now, Ericsson was more cautious than Nokia about the outlook, so this is encouraging,"" Rautanen said.
The average forecast for Nokia's second quarter operating profit is 373 million euros ($436 million), down 35 percent from a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.
Profits will suffer from investments it is making to prepare for upcoming 5G business, analysts said.
Sales in the network business, which makes around 90 percent of Nokia's revenue, are seen falling 8.6 percent to 4.5 billion euros.
Rautanen said that the U.S. trade ban on Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE (SZ:000063) may offer further help. Due to the ban, ZTE has lost a deal to upgrade radio equipment for Italy's Wind Tre, which will use gear from Ericsson instead, sources said.
""Although the ban has been lifted, operators are cautious... it is quite a risk for them if the vendor can't deliver what is needed, so this should be positive (for Nokia) in the short-term,"" he said, referring to possible additional contract wins.
The majority of Nokia's bottom line in the second quarter is expected to come from its highly-profitable patent licensing business, which stems from the times Nokia was the world's largest handset maker.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish airline Ryanair (I:RYA) has told over 300 pilots and cabin crew that they may lose their jobs as it cuts its Dublin-based fleet by 20 percent for the winter season after recent strikes hurt bookings and airfares in its home market.
The low cost carrier, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, is in the middle of its worst week of stoppages in more than three decades of flying as it struggles in talks with trade unions whom it has decided to recognize for the first time.
Around a quarter of its Dublin-based pilots staged their third 24-hour stoppage in two weeks on Tuesday while cabin crew in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium began a two-day strike on Wednesday, prompting Ryanair to cancel more than 12 percent of its flights. 
Warning investors on Monday of more strikes this summer, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he would consider moving aircraft from Ireland, Belgium and Portugal and acted swiftly within 48 hours.
""If our reputation for reliability or forward bookings is affected, then base and potential job cuts such as these at Dublin are a deeply regretted consequence,"" Ryanair Chief Operating Officer Peter Bellew said in a statement.
Ryanair said it expected few route closures from Dublin as a result of reducing the fleet to 24 from 30, but that some routes may suffer frequency reductions as it moves the aircraft to its Polish airline, Ryanair Sun, which it said was enjoying rapid growth.
It will begin redundancy consultations with over 100 Dublin pilots and more than 200 cabin crew who were issued with 90-day protective notice. Transfers to Poland will be offered in order to minimize any redundancies, Ryanair added.
Ryanair, which operates from 86 bases in 37 countries and carried 130 million passengers last year, averted widespread strikes before last Christmas with a last-minute U-turn to recognize unions for the first time in its 32-year history.
However it has since struggled to reach agreement on terms with several of them.
Pilots are demanding more transparent systems for promotions and transfers to reduce what they say is excessive management discretion over their careers, while cabin crew want local contracts and better conditions.
O'Leary, who says his staff have some of the best conditions in the low-cost sector, said on Monday that he would be ""far happier take a hit to our earnings this year, but convey the message that we will face down strikes.""
Shares in the airline, which earlier this week matched a 12-month intraday low hit in December when it shocked markets by recognizing unions, were 2.7 percent higher at 0830 GMT.

LONDON (Reuters) - British wealth managers Rathbone Brothers and Brewin Dolphin reported rises in their respective total assets on Wednesday, driven by net inflows of new client money.
Both firms have looked to grow the amount of money they directly invest on behalf of their affluent clients in recent years, bolstered in part by regulatory change that has given people greater control over their retirement savings.
Rathbones, which recently announced plans to buy Scottish rival Speirs & Jeffrey, said its total assets in the six months through June were 39.9 billion pounds ($53 billion), up 2 percent from the end of December.
Pretax profit in the period jumped 64.3 percent to 43.7 million pounds, in part thanks to a write-back of costs linked to the recent relocation of the company's headquarters to cheaper premises in London, it said in a statement.
That, in turn, helped underpin an interim dividend of 24 pence a share, up from 22 pence in the year-earlier period.
""During the second half of the year, we will continue to prioritize the investment of time and financial resources in our investment management business, seeking to improve our services and the efficiency of our infrastructure,"" Rathbones said.
Peel Hunt analyst Stuart Duncan said the results were ""comfortably ahead of our expectations"", although analysts at KBW said inflows, while ""a decent showing"", were below target and at 0737 GMT Rathbones' shares were down 1 percent at 2,468 pence each.
Sector peer Brewin Dolphin also recorded a strong third-quarter, as total funds rose 6.5 percent to 42.3 billion pounds, helped by inflows and market gains.

S&P Dow Jones will add major Saudi stocks to its global indexes with a 50 percent weighting in March 2019 and raise their weightings to 100 percent in September, the company said in a statement late on Tuesday.
The company had been considering a Saudi upgrade for several years but decided against one last year because of limited market access for foreign investors.
It said on Tuesday that it was acting in response to reforms of Riyadh's market structure supporting foreign investment as well as a strong, positive consensus among members of the investment community.
FTSE Russell decided in March this year to upgrade Saudi Arabia to an emerging market in 2019, which fund managers expect will attract about $5 billion of ""passive"", index-linked money to the bourse. MSCI made a similar decision in June; an MSCI upgrade could attract around $10 billion of passive funds.
S&P Dow Jones previously estimated Saudi Arabia could have a 2.57 percent weighting in its emerging benchmark index. It did not say how much money was linked to that index, but fund managers say it is considerably less than the amounts benchmarked to the FTSE Russell and MSCI indexes.

It is the third acquisition announced this month by Warsaw-listed AmRest, which runs Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), Pizza Hut and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) franchises in Europe and Russia, and has its own brands in Spain and France.
As well as France, Paris-based Sushi Shop runs restaurants in 11 other countries including Spain, Great Britain and Italy.
AmRest, which recently moved its headquarters to Spain from Poland, said earlier this month that it would invest 25 million euros in a Spanish delivery startup, Glovo, to strengthen its position in all the markets where it operates in both dining in and food delivery.
""Over the past three years combined, acquisitions have contributed to approximately half of the increase in (AmRest's) stores,"" Berenberg analysts wrote in a note last month.
AmRest also in July signed a binding agreement to buy a Spain-based burger chain, Bacoa, for about 3.7 million euros to increase its presence in Western Europe.
AmRest has expanded its network of restaurants and franchised stores by 25 percent to 1,705 within the last 12 months and its portfolio of brands includes KFC, Pizza Hut, Burger King and Starbucks.
It aims to open more than 300 stores this year and plans to list on the Spanish Stock Exchange after securing shareholder approval for the plan on June 6.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2018 03:55AM ET</span>",Chinese chipmaker Tsinghua Unigroup to buy France's Linxens for $2.6 billion: sources,"By Kane Wu and Prakash Chakravarti
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's top state chip manufacturer Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd has signed a deal to acquire French smart chip components maker Linxens for about 2.2 billion euros ($2.6 billion), five people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The deal, which the sources said was signed over a month ago but has not yet been announced publicly, will be a key test of European regulators' stance on Chinese investment in the region that has been on the rise amid the country's worsening trade relations with the United States. 
Tsinghua's acquisition of Linxens from private-equity group CVC is still pending regulatory clearance, three of the sources told Reuters, adding regulators in France, Germany and the company's union need to approve the deal.
The authorities are not expected to object, the sources said on condition of anonymity as the information is confidential.
Tsinghua and Linxens did not respond to requests for comment.
According to three sources, Tsinghua has already locked in a deal with four banks for a 1.5 billion euro ($1.75 billion) bridge loan to fund the transaction.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), a main lender in the loan, also advised the seller, the people said.
Credit Suisse declined to comment.
Before the Linxens deal, Tsinghua Unigroup accumulated a stake in Germany's Dialog Semiconductor Plc, buying into share price weakness as the Anglo-German chipmaker faced uncertainty over its business relationship with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), its largest customer, towards the end of last year.
The stake, held via two wholly owned subsidiaries, reached 9 percent in December, according to company filings, making the Chinese investor the single largest shareholder in Dialog. Tsinghua did not respond to requests for comment at the time.
Failure to get local regulatory approval has previously scuttled Tsinghua's offshore investment plans, such as share purchases totaling $2.6 billion from three Taiwanese chip makers - Powertech Technology Inc, ChipMOS Technologies Inc and Siliconware Precision Industries Co - that fell through in 2016 and 2017.
That followed a 2015 debacle when an informal $23 billion approach for U.S. giant Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) was rejected by the Idaho-based chipmaker amid national security concerns - a rationale that has increasingly been used to block Chinese deals in sensitive U.S. industries.
So far this year, China has spent $45.5 billion on European assets, more than double year-ago levels, while its investments in the United States has dropped 75 percent to $1.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Linxens, headquartered close to Paris, has 535 million euros in annual sales and employs 3,500 staff at nine production sites globally. It also has offices in China, Singapore and Thailand.
Linxens, which does not have a U.S. presence according to its website, makes connectors crucial for communication between smart cards and electronic readers.

It also makes antennas and inlays for applications such as contactless payment, transport and access.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday criticized the Federal Communications Commission for not approving Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc's $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media, calling it ""disgraceful"" compared with the FCC's approval several years ago of a deal involving the NBC television network.
""So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn’t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People,"" Trump said in a post on Twitter.
Trump's broadside was an unusual attack on a decision of an independent federal agency that makes merger decisions based on whether they in the public interest.
""Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved, much bigger, but not Sinclair. Disgraceful!"" Trump said in his tweet, referring to the 2011 approval of Comcast Corp's acquisition of NBC Universal.
Comcast at the time was a provider of video and residential internet service. NBC Universal included the Universal movie studio as well as NBC and other assets.
Sinclair, the largest U.S. local broadcast station owner, won the backing of Trump in a tweet in April but has come under scrutiny by others. 
Advocacy group Free Press has said that Sinclair forces stations to ""air pro-Trump propaganda"" - a charge it denies.
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said on Twitter on Tuesday that she did not agree with Trump's tweet.
Last week, the Republican-led FCC said it would not approve the acquisition by Sinclair and sent the matter to a hearing before an administrative law, saying that Sinclair would maintain control in practice of some stations it had agreed to divest, even if not in name.
The FCC's order dealt a serious and potentially fatal blow to Sinclair’s bid to acquire Tribune. Tribune did not immediately comment on Tuesday.
Democrats have attacked FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, whom Trump named to head the agency, for what they claim are a string of decisions benefiting Sinclair and a news media report that Trump’s election campaign struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage.
Pai has repeatedly denied he has taken actions aimed at benefiting Sinclair and said last week he had ""serious concerns"" about the merger. Sinclair has also denied improper conduct.
Trump last year had suggested that NBC's licenses could be challenged over its news reporting, something that Pai had rejected.
Pai and an FCC spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump's tweet. Sinclair and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) also did not respond.
The FCC said the administrative judge will review whether Sinclair engaged in misrepresentation or a lack of candor and whether the deal would violate the FCC’s broadcast ownership rules.

Sinclair has denied withholding any information or misleading the FCC.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), the new owner of cable channels HBO and TNT, on Tuesday reported quarterly revenue that fell shy of Wall Street estimates but added more wireless subscribers than expected.
Shares of the Dallas-based company fell 1 percent in after-hours trading following the mixed results for the second quarter, which included about two weeks of results from  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX). 
AT&T bought the entertainment conglomerate to attract consumers and advertisers to its mobile products and compete with internet firms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google. 
Total operating revenue fell about 2 percent to $38.99 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $39.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The second-quarter revenue included the impact of an accounting change, said AT&T, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers.
AT&T's service revenue, which includes all operating revenue except equipment and media revenue, declined 7.6 percent from the prior-year quarter.
""None of their businesses are performing well,"" said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research. ""Apart from the one that they only owned for 16 days, the only one that isn’t shrinking is wireless. And wireless isn't growing, it just isn't shrinking anymore. Less bad isn’t the same as good.""
After a six-week trial, AT&T won court approval last month to close its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner and began bundling the content it gained from the deal with new wireless plans to drive subscriber growth.
A federal appeals court last week approved the U.S. Justice Department's request for an expedited schedule to appeal the ruling on antitrust concerns.
John Donovan, chief executive of AT&T Communications, told investors on a conference call that the company has introduced video options with a wide variety of price points, such as streaming service WatchTV at $15, which was launched after AT&T closed the Time Warner acquisition.
AT&T said it will introduce new advertising formats through next year, such as letting viewers pause a TV show and watch related sponsored content on their phones, instead of a traditional commercial break. 
Time Warner and other merger costs were $321 million in the second quarter when the trial took place. 
    Net income attributable to the company rose to $5.1 billion, or 81 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30 from $3.92 billion, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier.
    On an adjusted basis, the company earned 91 cents per share. Analysts had expected adjusted earnings per share of 85 cents.
AT&T added a net 46,000 postpaid mobile phone subscribers in the second quarter. Analysts on average were expecting net adds of 14,000, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.
It also lost 286,000 satellite television subscribers, as viewers continue to ""cut the cord"" in favor of streaming video platforms. 
Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, characterized the quarter as weak, pointing out that service and organic revenues are shrinking. 

""Those are terrifying numbers for a company leveraged at four times (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization),"" he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Asian memory chipmakers' production plans and outlook will be closely watched as they start reporting earnings this week, following sharp falls in their stock prices due to concerns that a 2-year industry super-cycle may be skidding to a halt.
The $121 billion global memory chip industry has enjoyed an unprecedented boom since late 2016, with profits surging to record highs and margins rising above 70 percent thanks to disciplined production after years of consolidation.
But the industry's shift to a newer technology of 3D NAND flash stacks - which are cheaper to assemble than outgoing two-dimensional chips - has seen output grow faster than demand this year and forced smaller players to aggressively cut prices to keep market share. 
Average NAND flash memory chip prices have nearly halved from a peak in 2017, and concerns of further declines sent shares of the major producers such as South Korea's SK Hynix (KS:000660) down 7 percent on Monday. 
NAND flash memory chips, used for longer-term data storage, are found in mobile devices as well as memory cards, USB flash drives and solid-state drives.
""The margins are getting worse mainly because the average selling price decrease turns out to be much faster than cost reductions,"" said Alan Chen, director at market research firm DRAMeXchange.
He forecast the price decline would continue for the rest of this year.
Nomura estimates supply of NAND flash chips will grow about 40 percent to 50 percent this year, just as demand eases off due to slowing global smartphone sales, causing prices to decline by nearly 20 percent.
DRAM BUSTERS
Prices of DRAM memory chips - which help servers, gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining devices process large amounts of streaming data - are up more than 20 percent this year.
But they are losing momentum amid a Chinese price-fixing probe against industry heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, and Beijing's drive to build home-grown chip champions to cut its reliance on foreign supplies.
Beijing has made the semiconductor sector a priority under its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, and three firms - Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd, Innotron Memory and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit - are getting ready to mass-produce memory chips, according to analysts.
""Until the first half of next year, Chinese firms' production scale will be small but as their yield rate gets better and leads to increased output, that will influence the semiconductor market from the second half of next year,"" said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities.
    Andrew Norwood, lead analyst at Gartner, said China's entry into the market could be one of the factors behind a move by Samsung to aggressively expand capacity. He said 2020 and 2021 would see ""significant revenue reductions"".
Others are more optimistic, pointing to demand from data centers and new technologies such as 5G mobile network and autonomous driving.
""Although profit growth momentum is likely to disappear, we believe an operating profit level of $90 billion can be sustained in 2019, instead of crumbling down badly,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Peter Yu said in a recent report.
""The fat and steady profit is the new norm for the memory industry.""
Samsung, the world's top chipmaker, is expected to post a record profit of 12.5 trillion won ($11 billion) from chip sales in the quarter ended in June, up 50 percent from a year ago. Its hometown rival SK Hynix is also likely to report a 74 percent jump to a record 5.4 trillion won.
Hynix reports earnings on July 26, Samsung on July 31, and Japan's Toshiba Corp (T:6502) on Aug 8.
($1 = 1,133.9000 won)

636,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>",Threading the needle: Boeing's cost challenge for new mid-sized jet,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) played for time on its proposed new mid-sized jet at the Farnborough Airshow last week, announcing it would decide next year whether to launch its first all-new plane in a decade and giving itself 9-12 months to hone its business case.
With 225-265 seats, Boeing's proposed new mid-sized airplane, or NMA, could fill an opening in the middle of the airplane market between the bread-and-butter single-aisle planes that dominate most fleets and the bigger long-range, twin-aisle jets.
That niche has already been partially filled by rival Airbus' largest narrowbody, the bestselling A321neo. But Boeing insists the NMA would be able to open new routes due to longer range and superior economics, just as its 787 revamped long-haul travel by connecting secondary cities.
Capacity and range are not the only factors Boeing is considering as it makes one of its most significant decisions in years. 
To make business sense, the price must be low enough to lure airlines and high enough to leave a return for Boeing, while squeezing through a narrow economic gap in prices between single-aisle and twin-aisle planes. A key question is whether the gap is wide enough to take the plunge.
""That is the challenge of the NMA,"" John Plueger, chief executive of Air Lease Corp, told Reuters. 
""Building a business case in 2018 for an airplane that won't start in service until 2025 is not such an easy slam dunk.""
Planemakers do not publish the real prices at which they sell their jets, which include significant discounts, but most analysts say the net price of the new jet would come in at $60-$70 million – about $15-20 million more than a discounted single-aisle jet.
While Boeing's focus is on cutting costs, company officials have poured cold water on speculation that it could revert to a cheaper metal fuselage rather than weight-saving modern composites.
""They have got to get it right. It is a tough needle to thread,"" Plueger said. 
Boeing does have a potential wild card. 
While the business case is being studied on its own merits, the time frame for a decision – 2019 – coincides with the expected closing of a deal for Boeing to take over Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) commercial operations.
Embraer would give Boeing access to extra engineering resources and R&D capacity at a lower cost. 
""It gives us additional opportunities to consider,"" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters, when asked whether the Embraer acquisition might inject extra clarity into the NMA decision.
Embraer has some ""very effective, streamlined"" development processes, Muilenburg added.
""When we're able to complete this deal it would give us another option, another set of resources, additional ideas and that could be helpful to the (NMA) business case,"" he said. ""It's another factor that can be considered in the overall business case.""
Boeing officials said the business case was already improving on a standalone basis.
Still, a significant hurdle remains: the capacity and willingness of engine makers to produce the right engine in the correct time frame. This has become the main ""pacing factor"" in the NMA decision, a person familiar with the plans said.
Boeing, which has conducted wind tunnel trials as it studies the NMA, has done more pre-development work than usual to avoid a repeat of industrial problems both in-house and at suppliers which delayed the 787, people close to the matter said. 
Recent industrial problems among engine makers could tip Boeing toward offering airlines a choice of two engines, but this would force each supplier to make do with a smaller slice of the new business.

""There is a strategic rationale for dual sources: it mitigates technology risks. But the business case for the engine guy becomes very thin,"" said Domhnal Slattery, CEO of leasing company Avolon.

Left initially tweeted the $60-a-share call last Thursday. The shares fell as much as 7 percent that day before closing 4.7 percent lower. AbbVie shares closed up 2.4 percent at $91.54 on Tuesday.
In a research note published on Tuesday afternoon, Left detailed his skepticism about AbbVie's prospects. ""There finally seems to be changes coming to the system,"" he wrote.
AbbVie declined to comment on the report. 
Other analysts have said that deals AbbVie has signed with rivals such as  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN), Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) and Mylan NV (O:MYL) to prevent them from launching biosimilar competitors to Humira until 2023 will likely protect the company from any of the moves regulators make in the near-term.
Last week, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb laid out a plan to increase biosimilar competition for biologic drugs. The Trump administration has proposed a rule that would scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers.
Humira, for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, is the world's top selling prescription medicine with sales expected to exceed $20 billion this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.

1. AT&T Disappoints, but Boeing, Coca-Cola on Tap
AT&T (NYSE:T) took some of the shine off the day's telecom sector performance, missing expectations when it reported numbers after the bell Tuesday. AT&T stock slipped shortly after earnings were released.
The highlight of Wednesday’s before-the-bell schedule will likely be Dow component Boeing (NYSE:BA), which may give the market some more insight on how companies with overseas business will be affected by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Agriculture Department announced a $12 billion short-term aid package to help farmers that will be impacted by tariffs.
Trump meets with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the White House in Washington on Wednesday.
Also on the calendar for earnings are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
2. Oil Getting Back Closer to $70
The market will continue to pay attention as oil prices climb closer to $70 per barrel. The energy sector was among the strongest in the market on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT), the Energy Information Administration releases the latest weekly oil inventories numbers. Crude oil inventories are expected to have dropped by more than 2.3 million barrels for the week ended Friday, compared with a rise the week before.
Inventories are already near 3-year lows.
Tight oil inventories both in the US and abroad have stoked investor expectations for a global supply shortage, as oil market participants continue to warn that even small disruption in output could result in ""dangerous"" oil price volatility.
Global spare oil output capacity is ""very tight if not completely absent,"" Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, told a US Senate panel Tuesday. This creates the potential for ""dangerous"" price volatility amid disruptions from Iran, Venezuela and Libya, he added.
3. New Home Sales Arrive With Housing Closely Watched
Housing numbers are gaining attention in the market after some indications of shakiness in an otherwise strong and growing economy.
At 9:00 AM ET (13:00 GMT) Wednesday, the market will get the latest figures on new home sales. Economists expect, on average, that new home sales fell 2.8% to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 670,000 homes.
On Tuesday, the house price index for May posted a lower-than-expected rise.
The housing market can often be the initial signal of economic weakness, Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk tweeted on Monday.

Lululemon has been looking for a new CEO since February after Potdevin abruptly resigned for falling short of the company's ""standards of conduct"".

McDonald joins Lululemon as the company, which turned women's yoga wear into mainstream fashion, looks to expand its online presence and offer more men's wear to better compete with the likes of  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA) and  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) in a cut-throat sportswear market.

The Dallas Texas-based chipmaker, which also develops analog semiconductors for personal electronics and communication equipments, has benefited in recent years as many automakers pivot toward self-driving vehicle technology.
The automotive market contributed 19 percent of the company's revenue in 2017 while the industrial sector added 35 percent to its sales.
The company expects revenue of between $4.11 billion and $4.45 billion, and earnings of $1.41 to $1.63 per share for the third quarter.
Analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $4.27 billion and earnings of $1.48 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The earnings report comes a week after Crutcher stepped down just six weeks into the role, following a report that he had violated the chipmaker's code on personal behavior.
The company's net income rose to $1.41 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.06 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. 

The company had pre-announced second-quarter revenue of $4.02 billion last Tuesday, beating estimates of $3.97 billion.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The trade war between the United States and China is good for Brazil, chief executive of meatpacker Minerva SA (SA:BEEF3) said on Tuesday, as the rift opens up opportunities for net food exporters based in South America. 
A shift in U.S. foreign trade policy will bring farm product suppliers in South America, where production costs are low, closer to prospective buyers, CEO Fernando Galletti de Queiroz said on the sidelines of the Global Agribusiness Forum in São Paulo.
""With the U.S. taking a harder stance on trade, there are opportunities for importers and producers of agricultural commodities in South America to have a more solid bridge,"" he said. ""The trade war is favorable for Brazil."" 
During a presentation earlier in the conference, Queiroz had said China will import an estimated 1.2 million tonnes of beef this year, 23 percent more than in 2017, as demand for animal protein remains strong in Asia. Demand is also heating up in the Middle East, where meat consumption growth is estimated at 47 percent in 2018, he said.
Regarding trade embargoes, Queiroz said it is possible that Russia will lift its import ban on Brazil's beef that it imposed last December, when Russia claimed traces of forbidden food additive ractopamine were found in shipments.
""Probably this year we will have good news in relation to Russia,"" Queiroz said.

(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Tuesday it was creating a separate $4 billion unit to house its self-driving vehicle operations and is seeking outside investors, following a similar move in late May by Detroit rival General Motors Co (N:GM) with its Cruise Automation unit.
GM's spinoff of Cruise drew a $2.25-billion investment from SoftBank Group (T:9984), boosting GM's share price that day by 13 percent. SoftBank's 19.6-percent stake valued Cruise at $11.5 billion. GM paid an estimated $1 billion in 2016 to acquire the San Francisco-based self-driving startup.
""Ford has seemingly taken a step out of GM’s playbook to try to unlock value"" from its self-driving business, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak.
In afternoon trade, Ford shares were up 0.9 percent to $10.56.
Despite the current flurry of development activity globally by dozens of established and startup companies, Ford senior management believes that market for self-driving vehicles eventually will consolidate around three or four major players, ""and they want to be in the mix,"" according to a source familiar with Ford's thinking.
Ford has had previous discussions with potential investors, the source said, but the nature and depth of those discussions is unclear.
A Ford spokesperson declined to confirm whether the automaker has had discussions with SoftBank regarding a potential investment in Ford's self-driving operations.
On Tuesday, Ford said it would invest $4 billion through 2023 in its newly formed Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, including the $1 billion it previously had earmarked for Argo AI, the Pittsburgh-based self-driving startup that Ford acquired in 2017.
The new unit, to be headed by Vice President Sherif Marakby and based at Ford's new Corktown campus in Detroit, will house self-driving vehicle research, engineering and systems integration, as well as business strategy and development for the automaker's future self-driving vehicle fleet.
Ford said it hoped to accelerate business opportunities with the creation of the new unit, which it said is ""structured to take on third-party investment.""
GM Cruise and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo are often described as leading the pack of technology and auto companies competing to create self-driving cars and integrate them into ride services fleets.

Alphabet plans to launch a self-driving ride service later this year, while GM Cruise has targeted the introduction of a similar service in 2019. Ford has said it expects to put self-driving vehicles into commercial service by 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Industrials rose on Tuesday as Alphabet's blowout results bolstered expectations of a robust earnings season, though a decline in the Nasdaq pointed to lingering concerns over trade tensions.
Earlier in the session, the benchmark S&P 500 index touched its highest level since Feb. 1.
Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) shares jumped to a record high of $1,275.00 after the online search company's quarterly results surpassed Wall Street estimates. The shares were last up 3.7 percent at $1,256.25.
Google's parent company was the biggest boost to the S&P 500. Others in the so-called FANG group of momentum stocks rose as well. Shares of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Amazon Inc (O:AMZN) were up 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. Both companies report earnings later this week.
""Today, it's an earnings story, pure and simple,"" said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Hartland & Co in New York. ""It's been a very good second quarter.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 162.36 points, or 0.65 percent, to 25,206.65, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 9.65 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,816.63.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 6.70 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,835.17. It reversed course after having hit a record high earlier in the session.
So far in 2018, the Nasdaq has climbed more than 13 percent, more than twice the year-to-date percentage gain of the S&P 500. Some investors said the Nasdaq's reversal indicated some profit-taking driven by lingering concerns over trade issues. Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump extolled tariffs in a post on Twitter.
""It leads me to believe that underneath it all, investors are worried about the tariff situation and what the implications are going to be for corporate profits in the third quarter,"" Awad said. ""If you're looking to raise cash because you're uncertain, you take it where you have the biggest profits.""
Agriculture-related stocks gained on news that the Trump administration plans to announce aid for U.S. farmers to help protect them from potential impacts related to trade spats between the United States and its trade partners.
Deere & Co (N:DE) shares rose 2.8 percent, while shares of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) advanced 1.2 percent. AGCO Corp (N:AGCO) shares edged up 0.6 percent.
Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) climbed 6.1 percent after its profit beat estimates and the company forecast a lower-than-expected hit to margins from tariffs.
Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR) tumbled 13.8 percent to a more than two-year low after reporting weak quarterly results and cutting its full-year forecasts.
Shares of Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) rose 3.6 percent and Eli Lilly and Co shares (N:LLY) rose 4.6 percent after the companies reported strong results. Biogen shares touched their highest level in three years, while Lilly shares jumped to their highest level since 2000.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.01-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 115 new highs and 58 new lows.

(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) is exploring a sale of its pipeline assets, hoping to fetch more than $5 billion and free up capital to invest in exploration and production as oil prices rebound, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Occidental's decision to shed the assets is the latest example of an oil company balking at the capital expenditure required to maintain U.S. pipelines, which have been plagued by bottlenecks and require construction of new networks. 
 Hess Corp  (N:HES) and  Oasis Petroleum  Inc (N:OAS) are among the companies that have sold or spun off pipelines in the past year, looking to take advantage of high valuations for these assets, which have been buoyed by the capacity constrains. 
Inability to transport enough oil out of the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield, combined with increasing appetite for U.S. oil exports, could help Occidental sell its pipelines for top dollar, according to the sources.
Occidental is working with investment bankers on an auction for the pipeline assets, added the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Occidental representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Occidental's midstream assets include a major U.S. crude pipeline, a stake in a gas pipeline in the Middle East, a crude export terminal in Texas, and the Centurion Pipeline, a 2,900 mile line carrying crude from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to Cushing, Oklahoma.

A year ago, Occidental tried to find a buyer for its 50 percent stake in its Ingleside Energy Center, a crude oil storage and export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas. That sale process was not completed, and Occidental is including the facility in its package of midstream assets, one of the sources said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitwise Asset Management Inc took steps to bring a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund to market on Tuesday, reviving a race to list a bitcoin-linked investment in the United States.
The San Francisco-based company said it has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a first-of-its-kind U.S.-listed ETF that would track an index including bitcoin and nine other digital currencies.
Cryptocurrencies have grown to a market capitalization near $300 billion as a rival system for payment and exchange to currencies minted by governments.
An ETF would open investment to anyone with a brokerage account, including a range of retail and institutional investors who would not trade the currencies directly or even futures contracts based on it.
""The crypto market is significant,"" said Matt Hougan, global head of research for Bitwise. ""It's too big for people to ignore.""
Prospects for a bitcoin ETF seemed to dim in January when a top SEC staffer told the fund industry in a public letter that the regulatory agency wants answers to a slate of investor protection concerns before endorsing what were then more than a dozen proposed products based on cryptocurrencies.
Some of the bitcoin ETF proposals were withdrawn around that time, but at least four still await an up-or-down decision from the SEC, including a recent application that drew more than 100 comment letters from the public.

Bitcoin had already risen above $8,300 on Tuesday to its highest level in two months, with markets citing hope for a cryptocurrency ETF. The asset has declined sharply from above $17,000 earlier this year.

BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday said they will narrow a case against several former  Insys Therapeutics Inc  executives accused of bribing doctors to prescribe a potent opioid after a federal judge questioned the scope of the indictment charging them.
Federal prosecutors in Boston, in a court filing, said they plan to seek a revised indictment against billionaire Insys (O:INSY) founder John Kapoor and six former executives and managers that will ""streamline"" the case by including fewer charges.
Prosecutors did not say what charges the new indictment would include against the former pharmaceutical executives, who currently face counts including racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy.
But they said they were ""mindful of concerns"" raised during a July 17 hearing in which U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs questioned whether prosecutors could prove the racketeering conspiracy count as charged.
The indictment charged Kapoor, former Insys Chief Executive Michael Babich and others with conspiring since 2012 to pay bribes to doctors to prescribe the drugmaker's fentanyl-based cancer pain medication Subsys and to defraud insurers.
Burroughs said she believed the indictment lacked sufficient allegations to establish a relationship between the Insys executives and the various doctors accused of taking bribes that would legally support the racketeering charge.
The judge also said she had a difficult time understanding the indictment and said prosecutors should look at whether the case could be ""streamlined and clarified.""
""The indictment has a core of conduct that's problematic and may be criminal,"" Burroughs said. ""I don't know, that's what a trial is for. But I'm have having difficultly with the way it's laid out.""
A lawyer for Kapoor had no immediate comment.
Subsys is an under-the-tongue spray containing fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine. It won U.S. regulatory approval in 2012 for use in managing pain in cancer patients.
The U.S. Justice Department has accused Insys of paying kickbacks to doctors to prescribe Subsys, often via fees to participate in sham speaker programs ostensibly meant to educate medical professionals about the drug.
Kapoor was indicted in October and added as a defendant in a case against six other people, including Babich, who were first charged in December 2016.

Other defendants include former Insys vice presidents Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry, former National Sales Director Richard Simon, and Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan, former regional sales directors. They also have pleaded not guilty.

654,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Brazil Workers Party would use currency reserves for infrastructure,"By Iuri Dantas and Christian Plumb
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's leftist Workers Party would use part of the country's $380 billion in currency reserves to finance an infrastructure development fund if victorious in October presidential elections, a party official said in an interview. 
Marcio Pochmann, an adviser to former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and a coordinator of his planned run for a third term, said roughly 10 percent of the reserves would be destined for the fund and supplemented by other sources such as loans from state banks Banco do Brasil (SA:BBAS3) and Caixa Economica Federal as well as borrowing in the form of debentures.
The funds would be used to re-start various unfinished projects throughout the country in areas ranging from sewage to highways and help stimulate the country's still weak economic growth rate, Pochmann told Reuters late on Monday.
Though there is little question that Brazil is an infrastructure laggard - business group CNI estimated earlier this month that there were 517 projects paralyzed throughout the country for lack of funds - the idea of raiding currency reserves in a year when the Brazilian currency slid 12 percent against the U.S. dollar could prove controversial.
""Other countries - Bolivia and Ecuador - previously used their reserves and it looks like there are no technical issues in terms of using them to finance medium to long-term infrastructure investments,"" Pochmann said. ""This would be a mechanism to create a large fund to relaunch investment in Brazil.""
The party intends to name Lula, jailed on bribery charges since April but still Brazil's most popular politician, as its candidate in the October election. If an electoral court due to rule on his eligibility as soon as next month bars his candidacy, he is expected to anoint a successor from within party ranks. 
Pochmann also reiterated plans, outlined by potential Lula heir and former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, to raise taxes on banks to force them to cut their lending margins as a way of stimulating credit.
Turning to another hot-button issue in Brazil's presidential campaign, Pochmann said the Workers Party would bar Boeing Co's (N:BA) proposed acquisition of most of domestic planemaker Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) commercial jetliner business.
""The Boeing deal would mean the end of Embraer,"" he said. ""There is no guarantee that it would remain in Brazil. On the contrary, all its military technology would tend to disappear.""
Pochmann also said the Workers Party would revise state oil company Petrobras' (SA:PETR4) ambitious asset sale and debt reduction targets if elected and also cancel President Michel Temer's plan to privatize state utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (SA:ELET6).
""These companies, in truth, given their role, can't just be seen through the corporate lense,"" he said. ""Because these are strategic sectors for Brazil.""

655,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Fosun Considers Takeover of $10 Billion-Insurer Ageas,"(Bloomberg) -- Fosun International Ltd. is considering an offer for all or parts of Belgian insurer Ageas in what could be the Chinese conglomerate’s boldest move to expand its international footprint, according to people familiar with the matter.
Fosun is talking to advisers about alternatives including teaming up with a partner to split the Belgian company or increasing its current stake, the people said, asking not to be named because the deliberations are private. No final decisions have been made and Fosun may decide against pursuing a deal, they said. Brussels-based Ageas has a market value of 8.9 billion euros ($10.4 billion), after shares rose 7.2 percent this year.
A representative for Ageas declined to comment. Fosun didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The deliberations for Ageas may be yet another sign of China’s renewed appetite for expanding globally after a slowdown last year amid tighter curbs on capital outflows and increased scrutiny of foreign acquisitions. In May, China Three Gorges Corp., the country’s largest clean energy company, offered 9.1 billion euros to raise its stake in electricity giant EDP-Energias de Portugal SA.
Fosun already holds about 3 percent of Ageas, though Ping Ang Insurance (Group) Co. is the largest shareholder with a 5 percent stake, according to filings.
A potential deal could draw close scrutiny from regulators because Ageas is the biggest life insurance provider in Belgium and No. 2 non-life insurer, according to its website. In addition to operations across Europe, Ageas sells products in China, Malaysia, India, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia, Singapore and Vietnam. The Belgian company is a minority partner in a life insurance joint venture with China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co.
Fosun has managed to continue its expansion amid a government crackdown on large, overseas deals, with Chinese companies such as HNA Group Co. and Anbang Insurance Group Co. shedding assets.
Fosun meanwhile has reached agreements to take over companies ranging from French fashion house Lanvin to Brazilian brokerage Guide Investimentos. One of the Chinese conglomerate’s best-known investments is Club Med SAS, which is part of a tourism and hotels portfolio that’s being spun off."

(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) on Tuesday reported quarterly profit and revenue that topped estimates but added fewer-than-expected monthly subscribers amid a dearth of special promotions.
Verizon Chief Technology Officer Hans Vestberg will take over as chief executive officer on Aug. 1 as the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers races to launch its next-generation 5G network amid increasing competition in the industry.
Outgoing CEO Lowell McAdam said Verizon will have more opportunities for market growth as 5G brings new technologies that will let self-driving cars communicate with each other over a wireless network.
""There are so many things where we have zero [market] penetration that are going to be huge five years from now,"" he said during an earnings conference call. Verizon said Houston will be the third of four cities where it plans to launch home internet 5G this year.
The company added a net 199,000 wireless customers who pay a regular monthly bill during the quarter, missing an average estimate of 210,000 net adds from analysts at Cowen and UBS. 
On an adjusted basis, Verizon earned $1.20 per share, topping estimates of $1.14 per share.
Shares of Verizon rose 0.7 percent at $51.09.
Net income attributable to the company fell to $4.12 billion, or $1 per share, in the second quarter, from $4.36 billion, or $1.07 a share, a year earlier.
Total operating revenue rose to $32.20 billion from $30.55 billion a year ago, exceeding estimates of $31.78 billion.
McAdam said during an earnings conference call that the company had no intention of spinning off Oath, its digital media umbrella that owns websites like AOL and Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA), in response to media reports.
The company said it added 369,000 connected devices during the quarter, including wearables like the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch, compared with 359,000 added in the first quarter. Customers who add tablets and wearables to their plans tend to stay with Verizon longer, Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said in an interview.
Customers have indicated they value Verizon's network, which should allow the company to continue to add subscribers as it moves to 5G, said Ted O'Connor, an analyst with Cooke & Bieler. The firm owns 2.4 million Verizon shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Verizon said 2018 capital spending is expected to be at the lower end of its forecast range of $17 billion to $17.8 billion, despite a heavy investment in 5G.
Verizon returned to growth in revenue from wireless plans, up 2.5 percent on an adjusted basis in the quarter, signaling a ""business that is steadily getting healthier,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a research note. 
Verizon lost 37,000 Fios video subscribers during the quarter, more than the 15,000 in losses a year earlier, as cord-cutting increased and viewers moved to cheaper streaming video options. 
The company added 43,000 Fios internet customers, versus 49,000 added in the prior-year quarter.

Verizon updated its outlook for full-year revenue growth to the low- to mid-single digits in percentage terms, versus the low-single digits, due to higher equipment revenue trends.

(Reuters) - Synovus Financial Corp (N:SNV) said on Tuesday it would buy a Florida-based bank for $2.9 billion to boost its deposits and become one of the leading lenders in the U.S. Southeast region.
The deal will help Georgia-based Synovus add $9.9 billion in deposits and 50 full-service banking centers, with significant market share in Florida's 10 largest markets including Miami-Dade, the largest by population in the Southeast.
Synovus offered $58.15 per share for Florida Community Bank owner FCB Financial Holdings Inc (N:FCB), representing a discount of 1.8 percent to the stock's Monday close. FCB's shares fell 10.8 percent to $52.80 shortly after midday.
Synovus' shares dropped 8.6 percent to $50.34 as the deal is expected to dilute the bank's tangible book value per share by 3.3 percent. Tangible book value is a measure of a company's core value excluding intangibles such as goodwill.
FCB, formed in 2009 to buy out banks that failed in the wake of the financial crisis, put itself on the block in April, according to a Reuters report. Since then the stock rose 14 percent.
The deal comes after U.S. lawmakers eased regulatory restrictions on small and mid-sized banks by simplifying lending, capital requirements, trading rules and regulation around M&As.
The move has prompted U.S. regional banks to use money freed up from lower taxes to bulk up on deposits through acquisitions at a time when interest rates are still low.
Another U.S. community bank  Veritex Holdings Inc  (O:VBTX) said on Tuesday it would buy Green Bancorp Inc (O:GNBC) for a deal valued at about $1 billion to gain market share in Texas.
Synovus said it expects the deal to add about 6.5 percent to adjusted earnings per share and about $40 million in pretax savings by 2020.

Just eight days ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin stood beside Trump in Helsinki and said he favored a Trump victory in 2016 as a way to improve relations between their two countries.
Trump provoked an uproar at the Helsinki summit by casting doubt on U.S. intelligence findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. During a press conference in Helsinki, Trump said he didn’t see any reason why Russia would interfere in the presidential election and called Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling a “disaster.”
Trump said in a tweet Tuesday that he is “very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election.” But he said, without offering evidence, “they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don’t want Trump!”
July 24, 2018
U.S. intelligence agencies have found that Russia in 2016 launched an effort to hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and ultimately to help Trump win. This month, Mueller obtained indictments of 12 Russian officials in the GRU military intelligence agency for allegedly orchestrating the hacks of Democratic party organizations and Democratic officials. Trump has called the probe a “witch hunt.”
Controversy over Trump’s messages on Russian election interference has renewed calls for additional sanctions on the Putin government.
Two leading U.S. senators said Tuesday they’ll introduce a bipartisan bill to increase U.S. sanctions against Russia that would target Russian debt, as well as the country’s energy and financial sectors.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democrat Bob Menendez said in a joint statement that just as Putin has sought to challenge U.S. power and influence, ""the United States must make it abundantly clear that we will defend our nation and not waver in our rejection of his effort to erode Western democracy.""
Senators Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, are pushing for a vote on a separate bill which would impose new sanctions, including sanctions on debt transactions, for countries interfering in the midterm elections.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 12:42PM ET</span>",China’s caffeine war: Fast-growing Luckin brews up a threat to Starbucks,"By Pei Li and Adam Jourdan
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Qian Zhiya may be Starbucks’ worst nightmare.
The 42-year-old Chinese entrepreneur says she is betting that her fledgling Luckin Coffee brand will eventually have more cafes in China than Starbucks (O:SBUX), and she has Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund and other investors bankrolling her plan.
Luckin, which only officially launched in January, has opened more than 660 outlets in 13 Chinese cities thanks to a supercharged growth plan based on cheap delivery, online ordering, big discounts and premium pay for its staff.
Its assault comes at a crucial time for Starbucks, which has 3,400 stores in China – its second biggest market after the U.S. - and plans to almost double that number by 2022.
And the speed of the attack is a warning to other established consumer brands in China that they too could be vulnerable to a start-up’s attempt to reinvent a market, brand consultants say.
Starbucks’ shares were pummelled in June after it warned same store sales growth in China had plunged to zero or worse last quarter, against 7 percent growth a year earlier. Its fiscal third-quarter results are due out on Thursday.
Starbucks said some new café openings were cannibalising customer visits at nearby stores and it also blamed a drop-off in orders through delivery firms.
While it did not mention increased competition, investors and analysts said it is clear that Luckin does represent a threat. 
However, they also point out that Starbucks’ brand has been very resilient to challenges from rivals around the world over the years, largely because of the ambience of its stores, its service and the consistent quality of the coffee served.
There is also no sign that Chinese consumers have turned against such a very American brand as a protest over U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of punitive tariffs on Chinese exports.
BIG PROMOTIONS
Reuters spoke to 30 consumers in Beijing Yintai Center, a shopping mall that has a Starbucks, Costa Coffee and Luckin outlet, among others. Half of those polled said they had tried Luckin; most said they liked it, though more than two-thirds said their top choice remained Starbucks.
The majority drank coffee in-store or bought to take away, with only a small number saying they had coffee delivered, a potential challenge for Luckin's delivery-focused strategy. Taste, convenience and environment were their top three priorities, more than price.
Luckin’s customers can order coffee via an app, watch a livestream of their coffee being made, and have it delivered to their door in an average of 18 minutes, the company says. A regular latte, roughly the size of a Starbucks grande, costs 24 yuan plus 6 yuan for delivery (free delivery for orders of more than 35 yuan), but can be half price after promotions. A grande latte at Starbucks costs 31 yuan.
More than half of Luckin’s stores are larger ""relax"" outlets or pick-up stores with some seating. The rest are delivery kitchens.
The speed of Luckin’s growth is extraordinary – it took Starbucks about 12 years to open as many stores. In many ways it echoes the way in which some major Chinese technology firms, such as ride hailing platform Didi Chuxing, have burned through cash to grab market share and been valued highly as a result.
Qian, who was previously chief operating officer at Chinese ride hailing firm Ucar, says Luckin’s focus now is all about increasing customers.
""I don't have a timeline for profit,"" Qian told Reuters at the firm's Beijing headquarters as she sipped her third Luckin coffee of the day. ""For us, what we care about now is the number of users and if they are coming back to us, whether they recognise us, whether we can take market share.""
The firm raised $200 million this month to help fund its expansion, including an undisclosed sum from Singapore government fund GIC, a funding round which Luckin said valued the firm at $1 billion.
“In the future we will have more cafes than Starbucks,” she declared.
One of the investors in the latest fundraising said it is the logical time for there to be a shake-up of the coffee world in China.
“This model will appeal to young customers amid the country's consumption upgrade,” said David Li, former head of Warburg Pincus Asia Pacific. He led the financing round for Luckin via his new investment firm Centurium Capital.
The use of online ordering and delivery should be enough to unnerve many established brands, said Bruno Lannes, Shanghai-based partner with consultancy Bain & Co.
""It's a big threat, that's why western brands need to pay attention,"" he said.
""FLASH MOB""
Still, not everyone agrees the internet model translates easily to the coffee business, given the need for costly stores and quality control.
""It remains to be seen if they can really hook consumers in and create a monopoly in the market, like those we see in sectors like cab-hailing,"" said Liu Xingliang, president of tech consultancy China Internet Data Center.
And some of the consumers Reuters spoke to in the Beijing mall saw hurdles ahead for Luckin.
Liu Xu, 23, an advertising professional, who compares Luckin to a “flash mob” that came out of nowhere, said he tried the firm’s coffee out of curiosity but prefers hand-drip single-origin coffee.
And Lian Yiheng, 22, a student, said she was attracted by Luckin's promotions and the convenience of delivery, but felt it needed to improve its selection of coffees and store decoration to lure people in the longer run.
Qian said the plan was to have more sit-in stores and reduce the proportion of delivery-only outlets, which would require higher spending on setting up in better locations and on décor. On the question of quality, she says that it uses select arabica beans from Ethiopia.
Luckin's expansion comes as Starbucks’ global rivals, like Canadian chain Tim Hortons, are also pushing hard in China. Tim Hortons plans to open 1,500 outlets in China over the next 10 years, while smaller local chains are also popping up fast.
As China’s middle class continues to increase in size and the coffee chains move into many smaller towns and cities, the market is growing at 5-7 percent a year, according to research firm Mintel.
Li Yibei, owner of Double Win Café, which has a chain of eight coffee shops in Shanghai, said Luckin would have an impact on the market, but there was plenty of space left.
""Maybe they will hit Starbucks to some extent, but remember Starbucks has many die-hard fans. Maybe they can grab some followers from them, but I don't think that many,"" she said.
Starbucks may also soon be moving more formally into online delivery in China. Howard Schultz, Starbucks' departing executive chairman, said in Shanghai this month that he was close friends with Jack Ma, the head of  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), which controls food delivery platform Ele.me., and suggested the two could work together on Starbuck’s online delivery in China.
Schultz also said he isn’t wasn't worried about the China slowdown.

""The more good coffee and competition that comes into the market, the more the Chinese people will be exposed to good coffee,"" he said. ""Emerging new players that are coming into the market will actually benefit Starbucks.""($1 = 6.8142 Chinese yuan renminbi)

671,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",The Lowballed Retirement: Why Americans underestimate what they need,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Time for a little thought experiment: Take a moment and think of the savings you will need in retirement.
Got it? Good. Now here is the hard truth: That number is likely low.
That is not a personal judgment of your standard of living, your income, your savings or your ability in math. It is just probability.
The Employee Benefit Research Institute recently put out its annual Retirement Confidence survey, a kind of national state-of-the-union about where our savings stand. What it found: 37 percent of retirees say that their overall cost estimates turned out to be low. When you separate out healthcare costs, 44 percent said they faced higher-than-expected bills.
In contrast, only 8 percent of people said they encountered lower-than-expected retirement costs.
“A lot of people assume they will spend far less in retirement than when they were working,” says Craig Copeland, senior research associate with EBRI. “But in many cases, that is just not true.”
This is not just a minor math error. It is a potentially catastrophic one.
If your entire retirement plan is based on one particular assumption – how much you will be spending every month – and that figure turns out to be way off, then you have just lit some TNT under the last quarter of your life. And by that point, it is largely too late to do anything about it.
However, if you are still in your prime working years like Gen X and younger Baby Boomers, or entering the workforce like Millennials and Gen Z, then there is still time for a course correction. 
Here is what the experts advise:
DO THE MATH
If you have not actually sat down and calculated what you will need every month – granular stuff like mortgage, utilities, food and so on – then you really have no idea what you are talking about.
In fact only 38 percent of people have even tried to do the math, according to the EBRI survey.
So put together a retirement budget. Even if those numbers have to be adjusted later, at least you are getting closer to a real picture of what daily expenses are going to look like.
“I had a client who envisioned a $30,000 annual living expense at retirement,"" says Rose Swanger, a planner in Knoxville, Tennessee. ""But their current annual expense is over $300,000. Don't fool yourself like that.”
FACTOR IN INFLATION
In recent years we have been relatively spoiled, as beneficiaries of historically low inflation rates. The current estimated rate for 2018 is a modest 2.54 percent.
But anyone who remembers that late 1970s knows why inflation is called retirement’s “silent killer.” Beginning in 1979, the annual inflation rate hit 11.3 percent, 13.5 percent, and 10.3 percent - a triple whammy enough to blow up anyone’s retirement expectations.
So factor inflation into your projections because if you save a buck now, that buck will not have nearly as much purchasing power in 2040, or whatever your projected retirement date happens to be.
BE REALISTIC ABOUT DAILY EXPENSES 
Many retirement plans employ the assumption that you will spend 60 percent or 70 percent of what you do during your working years. But is that realistic?
“I ask clients, ‘Do you typically spend more money on a Tuesday or a Saturday?’” says financial planner Andrew Houte of Brookfield, Wisconsin. “They usually answer Saturday. Well, every day in retirement is a Saturday.”
The costs people almost never account for are the ones they cannot necessarily predict beforehand: a car repair, a home remodel, financial help for a child, a big family trip.
Throw in some major one-time expenses – particularly in the early years of retirement when people tend to be more active – and suddenly your retirement outlook looks very different.
RETHINK MEDICAL COSTS 
If you are a healthy 30-year-old, are you going to accurately estimate future healthcare costs? Almost certainly not – after all, you do not even know what future health conditions you are going to develop.
That is why healthcare is the single most underestimated cost category, according to the EBRI study. Things like premiums, co-pays and deductibles can add up very quickly.
For the record, a healthy 65-year-old couple retiring this year will encounter $280,000 in medical costs through their retirement, according to Fidelity Investments – over and above anything covered by Medicare.

“There is a pervasive myth that healthcare in retirement is totally free,” says David Rae, a planner in West Hollywood, California. “This is 100 percent not the case.”

680,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>","Harley-Davidson's profit beats estimates, shares rally","By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Arunima Banerjee
(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc's (N:HOG) shares rallied on Tuesday after the motorcycle maker forecast a lower-than-expected hit to profit margins from President Donald Trump's trade tariffs and its quarterly earnings topped Wall Street estimates.
Its forecast and results raised hopes 2018 profits will hold up better than expected, despite obstacles such as rising raw materials costs, higher tariffs on bikes shipped to Europe and an aging customer base. 
Harley's shares were last up 9 percent at $45.22, recovering almost of their losses since late June, when Trump attacked the company for planning to move production for European customers overseas. 
The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company now expects its motorcycles segment operating margin as a percent of revenue to be about 9 percent to 10 percent in 2018, compared with 9.5 percent to 10.5 percent it projected earlier.
The drop was on account of higher steel and aluminum costs and a 25-percent retaliatory duty imposed by the European Union on the shipments from the United States. Those two factors together are estimated to cost Harley $45 million to $55 million this year.
The company expects to absorb half of the increased costs through disciplined business management.
""We are making every effort to mitigate the costs of those tariffs,"" Chief Financial Officer John Olin told analysts on a conference call. 
David Beckel, an analyst at Bernstein, reckons the 50 basis points fall would translate into about $25 million in added operating costs, below Harley's previous estimate of an up to $65 million hit from higher raw materials costs and the European tariffs. This will likely result in upward revisions to the company's 2018 earnings, Beckel said.
Harley's second-quarter net income fell to $248.3 million, or $1.45 per share in the second quarter ended June 30, from $258.9 million, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier. That exceeded analyst estimates of $1.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
The company retained its 2018 shipment forecast and said it would reveal plans on Monday about its strategy to train new riders, revive U.S. sales and grow its international business.
U.S. President Donald Trump's restrictive trade policies have inflated Harley's raw material costs and put it in crosshairs of a trade skirmish with the European Union. Last month, Harley unveiled a plan to shift production for European customers overseas to avoid EU's retaliatory tariffs, a move that Trump slammed.
On Tuesday, Chief Executive Matt Levatich stood by the company's move, calling it ""the best decision, given the circumstances.""
Trade tariffs have compounded the troubles of a company that has been grappling with an aging customer base, weak demand from younger buyers and discounts offered by its rivals.
Europe is Harley's second biggest market after the United States. While U.S. retail sales fell 6.4 percent in the last quarter from a year ago, European sales were up about 4.3 percent year-on-year and accounted for half of international revenue.

The company did not say where it would shift the production for European markets. Harley has assembly facilities in India and Brazil, and is expected to launch an assembly plant in Thailand in September.

LONDON (Reuters) - British regional newspaper publisher  Johnston Press 's (L:JPR) biggest investor said on Tuesday that it is willing to help to refinance the company and called on the board to consult shareholders on its options.
Johnston Press has struggled with declining revenue as advertisers increasingly use online platforms, drawing the attention of activist investor Custos, which has previously sought to oust the company's chairman.
On Friday Custos wrote to the board to seek clarification by the close of business on Monday on whether it had, or planned to, instruct administrators, a letter seen by Reuters showed.
Custos CEO Christen Ager-Hanssen told Reuters on Tuesday that he had yet to receive a response and would welcome a chance to take part in any refinancing of Johnston Press.
""We would be happy to contribute in their refinancing and I think it's strange that Johnston Press hasn't talked to its shareholders,"" Ager-Hanssen said.
A spokesman for Johnston Press confirmed that the company had received a letter from Ager-Hanssen and said it planned to respond this week.
""If Mr Ager-Hanssen does have a workable proposal to refinance the business, we look forward to receiving this and we will invite him to provide more detail,"" the spokesman said.
Johnston Press said in April that it had core profit of 40.1 million pounds in 2017. The spokesman said it had 24.6 million pounds in cash at the end of May and reiterated June 5 comments that the business was trading in line with expectations.
The company announced in March 2017 that it would conduct a strategic review of its financing options for a 220 million pound ($288.66 million) bond due for repayment in June 2019.
""If we are going to refinance the bond, we need to look into the books, we need to sign a (non-disclosure agreement), we need to have a dialogue,"" Ager-Hanssen told Reuters on Tuesday.
""I will not send a proposal to a public company that is distressed.""
Custos holds a 20.2 percent stake in Johnston Press.
Ager-Hanssen said he planned to send another letter this week to ask for a meeting with the board.

684,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Whirlpool Sinks With Raw Material Costs Climbing Around the World,"(Bloomberg) -- As the Trump administration’s global trade war heats up, Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR). is feeling the burn.
The maker of home appliances said rising raw material costs hurt results in three out of four of its regional markets in the second quarter, including North America, Asia and its struggling Europe, Middle East and Africa division. The only region where it didn’t cite input-cost inflation was in Latin America, which faced its own problems in the second quarter, including a Brazilian trucker strike.
“Our annual steel contracts and hedging contracts with our base metals give us some protection but do not insulate us from these more material trends,” Chief Executive Officer Marc Robert Bitzer said on a Tuesday morning conference call.
Whirlpool shares fell as much as 14 percent Tuesday to $128.91, the biggest intraday drop in almost 10 years. They had already lost 11 percent this year through Monday’s close.
The higher raw material costs, paired with lower sales volumes and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, contributed to Whirlpool’s weaker-than-expected quarterly results. Net sales and ongoing earnings per share both missed analysts’ estimates in the three months ended June 30. The company’s ongoing full-year profit forecast missed the lowest estimate.
Rising Risk
The cost of protecting Whirlpool’s debt against default for five years jumped to the highest since November 2016, climbing 15 basis points to 98 basis points since the results were announced, according to data provider CMA.
Whirlpool disclosed in its second-quarter presentation that raw-material inflation will cost the company about $350 million in 2018. That’s up from the $250 million to $300 million it predicted in April, and even that was $50 million higher than what it was forecasting back in January.
The company cited steel and resin costs as particular concerns in the second quarter. President Donald Trump in March placed a 25 percent tariff on imports of steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from most countries. The U.S. allowed some exemptions for South Korea, Brazil, Australia and Argentina. After initially exempting Canada, Mexico and the E.U., Trump extended the Section 232 tariffs in June to include those key trade allies.
Whirlpool implemented price increases in several markets over the past year as input costs rise.
“We are standing firm in our price increases and because we are committed it’s the right thing to do with the cost inflation environment,” Bitzer said. “Now our job is to hold firm on these price increases and rebound some of the volume and some of the volume losses in the second half.”

690,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",UBS reports 9% profit jump — but warns of the 'threat' of Trump's trade war," LONDON — Swiss banking giant UBS on Tuesday  reported a strong set of results for the second quarter of the year, but warned that rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions pose a threat to the financial sector as a whole going forward.
Profits at the lender — which is in the midst of an adjustment of its business which will see it focus more on its wealth management operations — rose by 9% in the second quarter of 2018, compared to the same period last year.
That meant a net profit of 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.31 billion), above analysts expectations. A Reuters poll of analysts before the release expected profits of 1.044 billion Swiss francs ($1.05 billion).
Pre-tax profits at the bank also outperformed expectations, climbing 12% to 1.7 billion Swiss francs ($1.71 billion), compared to analyst forecasts of 1.418 billion ($1.43 billion).
The solid results were largely down to the performance of its key wealth management business, the bank said. Profits before tax in that area rose 18% to 1.037 billion Swiss francs ($1.04 billion).
That performance, the bank said, was ""driven by double-digit PBT growth in the Americas and the ultra-high net worth segment, and ten-year records in recurring net fee, net interest income, lending and mandate penetration.""
""I'm pleased with the second quarter, which contributed to a strong first half, with particularly good capital generation,"" Sergio Ermotti, the bank's chief executive said in a statement.
""We'll keep our focus on growth and efficiency, and continue to build on the strengths of our global franchise.""
However, while things look strong for UBS, the bank did warn about two looming global threats that could derail its progress.
""Global economic growth prospects continue to provide a supportive backdrop to markets, although ongoing geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism have dampened investor confidence and remain a threat,"" the bank said in a statement.
Although not explicitly stated, it is likely that the ""rising protectionism"" mentioned by the bank references the escalating trade war kicked off by US President Donald Trump. Analysts at the bank earlier this month  argued that investors are underestimating the potential impact of the trade war.
Regardless of that warning, investors in UBS were buoyed by the results on Tuesday morning, with the bank's stock jumping almost 4% in early morning trading. By 8.20 a.m. BST (3.20 a.m. ET) shares were up 3.14% to trade at €15.77 ($15.86) each."
691,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 09:15AM ET</span>",Rosneft suing Exxon-led oil project over dispute between neighbours,"By Vladimir Soldatkin and Oksana Kobzeva
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil major Rosneft's (MM:ROSN) $1.4 billion lawsuit against the ExxonMobil-led (N:XOM) Sakhalin-1 consortium relates to a row over how oil should be shared between the Sakhalin-1 concession and an adjacent Rosneft field, court papers show.
By bringing the legal action, Rosneft is taking on one of its closest foreign partners: Rosneft and ExxonMobil have multiple joint projects. But Rosneft and its powerful boss Igor Sechin have a track record of assertively fighting their corner in commercial disputes. 
Rosneft filed the suit in the Sakhalin district arbitration court in Russia's far east, accusing the consortium of unjust enrichment, an allegation the consortium denied. Rosneft did not disclose the exact nature of the dispute.
According to court documents reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday, the court asked Rosneft to present documents related to an agreement over the ""cross-flows"" of oil from the Northern Chayvo oilfield, controlled by Rosneft.
The Northern Chayvo field is adjacent to the concession area controlled by the Sakhalin-1 consortium.
It is commonplace in the oil industry for extraction activities on one concession to influence oil flows on a neighbouring permit, because the oil lies in rock formations that straddle two or more permits.
""Since oil cross-flows can be determined by an examination, most disagreements between companies of this nature are resolved out of court by negotiation,"" Aton, a Russian brokerage, said in a research note.
Asked whether the suit concerned a dispute over ""cross-flows"" between the Sakhalin and Rosneft permits, a Rosneft spokeswoman said the company had no comment.
Sakhalin-1 is operated by Exxon Neftegaz Ltd, through which ExxonMobil owns 30 percent in the project. Rosneft and India's ONGC (NS:ONGC) control 20 percent each. Japanese consortium Sodeco owns 30 percent.
Production at Sakhalin-1 stands at around 200,000 barrels per day (bpd).
Northern Chayvo was forecast by Rosneft to produce 30,000 bpd at its peak when it was launched in September 2014. Rosneft has said the field's production fell by 42 percent in the first quarter of 2018 to around 21,000 bpd.
Rosneft's suit against the Sakhalin-1 project seeks to recover funds gained by parties between July 10, 2015, and May 31, 2018, through ""unjust enrichment and interest gained by using other people's money"", according to court documents.
It was not clear from the court documents whether the dispute over ""cross-flows"" was central to Rosneft's suit against the Sakhalin consortium, or just part of it. 
There is other evidence that the issue has been on Rosneft's radar. 
According to the Russian state procurement database, Rosneft in November 2017 commissioned energy auditing firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton to conduct an audit of ""cross-flows"" of oil and gas condensate between Northern Chayvo and the oilfield developed by the Sakhalin-1 consortium.
INTER-CORPORATE CONFLICTS
Rosneft, presided over by Sechin, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is no stranger to inter-corporate conflicts. 
In a recent case, it won 100 billion roubles in a legal settlement with industrial conglomerate AFK Sistema (MM:AFKS) over a mid-sized oil company which Rosneft acquired from the firm.
Sergei Saveliev, a partner at law firm Saveliev, Batanov & Partners, which specialises in corporate conflicts, said disputes over ""cross-flows"" happened quite often in the oil and gas industry.
""Oil flows from one block to another, one side is taking the other's oil. Usually this is regulated through certain agreements, using some metrics,"" he said.
""In this case, either there has been no agreement, or they couldn't agree on the metrics.""
An industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Rosneft may be using the case as a bargaining chip to extract a concession from Exxon on one of their joint projects.
""Maybe they need some concessions. Rosneft has always perceived Exxon as a partner. They had joint projects in the United States and Canada, they want to enter Mozambique ... they have plans for a liquefied natural gas plant in the far east (of Russia),"" the source said.
Exxon Neftegaz, the Sakhalin-1 operator, said it was ""aware of the court action, rejects the claims and will take action to defend the rights of the Sakhalin-1 consortium"".

A Sodeco spokesman declined to comment. ONGC Videsh Ltd's managing director N.K. Verma declined to comment.

694,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Great Earnings Meet Trade Threat and It's Splitting Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Battle-lines are being drawn across markets as bears fret the brewing trade war and higher borrowing costs -- while bulls relish the banner corporate earnings season.
As a result, the winners and losers across asset classes and geographies are becoming ever-more pronounced.
“The tension between healthy current conditions and a future trade shock continues to reinforce two-tier market performance,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists, headed by John Normand, wrote in a recent note.
Here’s a rundown of some of the largest market schisms right now.
America vs. the World
With over 90 percent of developed-market companies beating earnings expectations so far, according to JPMorgan, the bull market in stocks has firm foundations. Trade tensions, however, are forcing investors to separate the wheat from the chaff. One clear consequence is the outperformance of businesses tied to the U.S. economy.
S&P 500 Index stocks with the highest domestic-revenue exposure are firmly beating those with the most international sales, according to baskets compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Since the start of June, domestically focused companies have gained 5.8 percent compared to their internationally oriented brethren, which are little changed. That’s a volte-face from last year when international companies outperformed by nearly 8 percentage points.
China Complex
JPMorgan points to another broad divergence on the back of trade tensions of late: resilient developed-market equities versus a beleaguered China complex. Asian equities and currencies have been plumbing new lows for the year alongside industrial metals.
Equity vs. Debt
Credit and equity investors, meanwhile, are busy placing opposite bets on the business cycle.
Stock buyers are bidding up companies with low debt loads and healthy financial metrics, and shunning those with the weakest financial ratios. The 50 S&P companies with the strongest balance sheets have outperformed their weaker equivalents for the past five quarters, the longest winning streak in at least 12 years, according to baskets compiled by Goldman Sachs.
Bonds issued by U.S. companies with stronger balance sheets, by contrast, are posting losses this year, while junk obligations are in the green.
The divide was confirmed in a Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). fund-manager survey this month, which showed a net 37 percent of equity investors covet an improvement in balance sheets. That’s a post-crisis record.
Fixed-income peers, meanwhile, are sanguine, with the proportion fretting “releveraging event risks” such as merger and acquisition activity declining to 23 percent in July from 32 percent the previous month.
Their bullish posture recalls the early stages of an economic recovery, according to BofA, while equity sentiment appears more late-cycle. One reason: rising borrowing costs are making debt-financed buybacks more expensive, capping stock gains going forward, according to Jared Woodard, a strategist at the U.S. bank.
Fiscal Funk
U.S. tax policy, meanwhile, has spurred splits within the S&P 500. American companies with the highest rates -- and therefore the most to gain from the fiscal agenda -- advanced 9 percentage points more than the low-tax basket in the second quarter, according to Goldman Sachs indexes. That’s the biggest quarterly spread in a decade.
All told, even as cross-asset volatility snoozes, the market landscape is looking more complex as macro headwinds gather pace.
“2018 has been a year of strong growth at the macro/economic and micro/earnings levels,” Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a Monday note. “Our concerns this year were never about growth, but about Fed policy that was tightening more than appreciated and the sustainability of the strong growth.”

695,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 08:18AM ET</span>",Cost to insure Tesla's debt rises on growing default fears,"(This version of the July 23 story corrects unit of upfront price in the final paragraph to ""points"" rather than ""basis points"".)
By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The amount investors must pay to insure their debt holdings in Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) against declining credit quality rose on Monday to its second-highest price ever, implying the company is at a greater risk of default following a report that sparked concern that Tesla may need to raise funds.
Insurance on Tesla's debt, which is sold as a credit default swap contract, increased from Friday by 13 cents to $5.96 per $100 of Tesla debt. That followed a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday that Tesla had turned to some suppliers for a refund of previously made payments in a bid to make a profit, citing a memo sent by a Tesla global supply manager.
A Tesla spokesperson said on Monday that the company had no comment on the credit default swaps, but said in a statement in response to the WSJ story that Tesla had asked fewer than 10 suppliers to reduce capital expenditure project spending. Tesla said that any changes with these suppliers would improve future cash flows but not affect its ability to achieve profitability in the third quarter. 
Company founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk may be obligated to tap debt or equity markets again this year, according to analysts, though he has said he would do neither.
The market's faith in Musk's ability to raise cash if needed has kept Tesla's implied risk of default lower than similarly rated junk bonds and has propped up the price of its debt, according to analysts. 
Tesla's junk bond coming due in 2025 <88160RAE1=> fell 1.75 cents to trade as low as 88.875 cents on the dollar, its biggest drop since Moody's downgraded the company's senior notes to Caa1 following production delays.
It cost $5.96 to insure $100 of Tesla's debt, plus an upfront cost of around 18 percent, representing a total of 24.1 percent of the face value of the 2025 bond on Monday. 
""The CDS is saying that there are a lot of people betting this company is going out of business,"" said Thomas Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory. 
Tesla has burned cash ramping up production of its Model 3 sedan, which prior to July, had fallen short of a series of targets.
Profitability has been elusive for Tesla. There is over $11.5 billion of short interest on Tesla's shares, the largest of such positions in the U.S. market by dollar value, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. 
A short position is a bet that a company's shares will fall in price. Investors borrow shares in the hopes of selling them and then buying back shares at a lower price to repay the loan, allowing them to pocket the difference.
As a percentage of outstanding shares, Tesla's short interest is 20.4 percent, which places it in the top 50 most shorted stocks on the Nasdaq.
The implied market probability of a default on Monday rose to 38.9 percent from 38.3 percent on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon. The probability of a default was 34.19 percent when the credit-default swap contract , the first and only referencing a Tesla bond, launched on June 27.
Compared to Monday's swoon in the bond price, the increased default probability seems low. That is explained, however, by the illiquid state of Tesla's CDS, which have had only one trader, Edward Koo at JPMorgan (N:JPM), regularly offering quotes on the swap, according to Reuters trading sources who requested anonymity because the quotes are not public.
Because it has become harder to find third parties who are willing to take on credit risk via CDS since the financial crisis, market makers sometimes have to absorb that risk themselves. That raises CDS prices. 
But the opportunity offered by Monday's falling bond price saw a market maker added to the mix, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) quoting an upfront price of 18 basis points to buy debt protection, and 16 to sell, according to Reuters trading sources with access to the quotes. JPMorgan's quote was 23 points for buyers, versus 18 for sellers, up a point for both parties from last Wednesday's quote.

Stocks and the USD/TRY plunged.
The bank held its one-week repo rate at 17.75 percent, a full percentage point less than the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The lira fell as much as 4.2 percent to 4.9384 to the dollar.
""This is a shocking decision given that inflation accelerated sharply and the lira weakened to a new record low earlier this month,” said Piotr Matys, a currency strategist at Rabobank in London.
Tuesday’s decision was under close scrutiny by investors who’ve been seeking an indication of where monetary and fiscal policies might be headed after Berat Albayrak, 40, was named treasury and finance minister earlier this month. Albayrak has in the past written extensively in support of unorthodox economic views held by Erdogan, who’s adamant that inflation will only slow if borrowing costs for companies and households are lowered.
Without directly disputing those views, Albayrak used his first interview in his new role to voice generally mainstream policies on the importance of maintaining the central bank’s independence, saying that policy actions will be in line with economic realities and the requirements of the markets.

LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is seeking to resurrect its high-profile prosecution of  Barclays  (L:BARC) over undisclosed payments to Qatari investors during the credit crisis with a rare legal procedure after a London court dismissed its case.
The agency had been praised as ""fearless"" for taking on one of the world's largest banks when it first charged Barclays and four former senior executives - including one-time chief executive John Varley - with criminal offences in June 2017.
But the prosecution fell at the first hurdle after a London court in May threw out its charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and unlawful financial assistance against Barclays Plc - and a charge of unlawful financial assistance against Barclays Bank.
The SFO said it has applied to the High Court for ""permission to serve a draft indictment"", an avenue for prosecutors to challenge a decision made in the Crown Court.
Barclays had been charged alongside four former top executives over payments to Qatari investors as part of a two-part, 12 billion pound ($16 billion) emergency fundraising that included a $3 billion loan to Qatar at the height of the credit crisis in 2008.
The SFO said it had applied to the High Court to re-instate the charges on Monday.
""The SFO confirms that on 23 July 2018 it made an application to the High Court to re-instate against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC all of the charges dismissed by the Crown Court in May 2018.""

Barclays said it intended to oppose the application. Its shares were trading 1.4 percent higher at 0948 GMT, outperforming a 0.9 percent rise in the FTSE 100.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>","Eisai-Biogen to advance Alzheimer's drug, provide fresh hope","By Julie Steenhuysen and Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Eisai Co Ltd and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Inc will move forward with late-stage clinical trials of their Alzheimer’s disease drug, BAN2401, and are working with regulators to design the next studies and gain expedited review as a breakthrough therapy.
The companies announced this month that despite failing at an earlier stage, the drug slowed Alzheimer's progression at its highest dose, providing renewed hope in a field littered with failures.
In interviews with Reuters, Japanese drugmaker Eisai said the treatment also worked at lower doses. Full results will be presented on Wednesday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Chicago.
""Our plan would be to start more trials,"" Dr. Lynn Kramer, chief medical officer of Eisai's neurology unit, told Reuters. ""Whether it be Phase III in the same patient population, or other populations. We are thinking about a number of things.""
Kramer said the company had already contacted various regulators and plans to pursue accelerated approvals. ""We are certainly considering 'prime' status in Europe, 'breakthrough' in the United States and 'sakigake' in Japan,"" he said of various paths to potentially swifter approvals.
The companies said after 18 months of treatment, patients who received the highest dose of BAN2401 saw a statistically significant improvement in cognitive and biological measures of Alzheimer's versus placebo. That was a welcome surprise as the drug did not appear to be working at the 12-month mark.
The news marked a rare success for Alzheimer's research following failure after failure of candidates from companies including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co. It also raised hope for aducanumab, another Biogen/Eisai drug in final stage testing. Both treatments are antibodies aimed at removing toxic clumps of amyloid from the brain.
Any successful Alzheimer's treatment is virtually guaranteed to become a multibillion-dollar seller. Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, affects nearly 50 million people worldwide and is expected to rise to more than 131 million by 2050, according to Alzheimer’s Disease International.
""All the chips are on the table with these two trials,"" said Dr. Ronald Petersen, an Alzheimer's expert from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
ALL HAD BRAIN AMYLOID
One difference, experts say, is that the Eisai/Biogen drugs are among the first to use PET scans to ensure study participants all have amyloid in their brains. Many dementia patients in previous trials later proved not to have the amyloid plaques the experimental drugs targeted, greatly increasing the likelihood of failure.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it is open to trials that measure effects on biomarkers, such as beta amyloid, rather than symptoms like memory loss, to allow companies to test treatments much earlier in the disease.
The trial of 856 patients with early Alzheimer's tested BAN2401 at five doses against placebo.
Participants were evaluated using an Eisai-devised tool that drew from three established Alzheimer's assessment scales. Kramer said the custom endpoint was important as prior cognitive scales were developed for people with later-stage disease.
The trial also used an ""adaptive"" design that allowed Eisai to place new enrollees into groups receiving what appeared to be the most effective doses. Kramer would not reveal how many patients received the highest dose.
""We believe that there are plenty of patients at the higher doses. When people see the results, they will think so too,"" he said.
While the news release only mentioned the highest dose, Kramer said other doses were also effective. ""There is a clear dose response,"" he said.
The companies will likely face some skepticism. The 12-month results used a predictive ""Bayesian"" statistical method, while the 18-month results used traditional statistical methods to assess the drug.
Kramer said the goal at 12 months was to show an 80 percent probability that patients would be 25 percent better off at the end of the trial than those who got a placebo.
""This was a very complicated trial design. I'm not surprised that it didn't work,"" said Dr. Paul Aisen of the University of Southern California's Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute.
Aisen said he wished they had used a more traditional design from the start. ""Now we're left having to worry about changing the analysis after seeing some of the results and what kind of bias they may have introduced.""
Any positive data out of these clinical trials ""has to be a good thing, even if it's small,"" said Gareth Howell, an Alzheimer's expert from The Jackson Laboratory in Maine.
Dr. Stephen Salloway, a Brown University neurologist and an investigator on the aducanumab trials, said the BAN2401 results provide ""consistent evidence that this strategy could be effective.""

Kramer said there is no doubt the BAN2401 results are positive for aducanumab's prospects. ""It has a bigger positive implication for BAN2401,"" he said.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 05:25AM ET</span>","China bond yields, stocks rise as Beijing signals policy shift","By Andrew Galbraith and Winni Zhou
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese government bond yields and stocks rose on Tuesday after Beijing vowed to pursue a more 'vigorous' fiscal policy, as authorities stepped up efforts to support growth amid rising economic headwinds.
Expectations of further loosening in monetary conditions drove the offshore yuan down to a 13-month low, and underscored a broad change in China's policy direction as fears grow that an increasingly heated Sino-U.S. trade war could deal a harsh blow to the economy.
""The government is sending a clear signal that it is preparing to defend growth, ... Premier Li may be concerned about the negative impact of deleveraging on growth,"" ANZ economists Raymond Yeung and Betty Wang said in a note.
The yield on 10-year Chinese government bonds (CN10YT=RR) ended 2.9 basis points higher at 3.562 percent.
The rise follows a steady decline in the yield on 10-year treasury bonds, fueled by robust demand. The yield has fallen more than 50 basis points since late January, according to Thomson Reuters data.
As the U.S. Federal Reserve looks set to raise rates twice more this year, investors have pulled out of the yuan and other global currencies. The spread between 10-year Chinese and U.S. Treasuries has narrowed sharply, touching 19-month lows on Thursday. 
Borrowing costs globally jumped on Tuesday after speculation that the Bank of Japan is close to announcing measures to dial back monetary stimulus. 
On Monday, the State Council, China's cabinet, said the country would adopt a more 'vigorous' fiscal policy, while in an unexpected move, China's central bank lent 502 billion yuan ($74.36 billion) to financial institutions via its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF), stepping up efforts to support lending as growth slowed.
The State Council's statement also indicated plans to accelerate the issuance of 1.4 trillion yuan in special bonds by local governments to underwrite investment in infrastructure, meaning the supply boost is likely to weigh on bond prices. 
The shift in focus toward easing also comes after the central bank in July released 700 billion yuan in liquidity by cutting some banks' reserve requirements, prompted by concerns over tighter cash conditions and a potential economic drag from the U.S. trade dispute. It was the third such cut this year.
Economists have not ruled out further reserve requirement reductions this year.
While China has for now ruled out broad monetary loosening amid a multi-year effort to combat excessive financial risks, the country's economic data showed signs of weakness even before the latest ratcheting up of trade war tensions.
The world's second-largest economy grew more slowly in the second quarter and June factory output growth weakened to a two-year low, pointing to weaker exports and investment.
On Tuesday, a trader at an Asian bank in Shanghai said bond market sentiment was weak, and that market players remained divided over the outlook for rates.
As investors sold bonds, the country's stock markets moved higher on the prospect of policy easing. The Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) and the blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) both closed up 1.6 percent. 
Shanghai's benchmark index and the CSI300 remain the world's worst-performing major stock indexes this year, but some investors say that fears of a rout in Chinese markets are overdone.
On top of the policy easing, analysts also cited new rules governing financial institutions' wealth management and asset management businesses for the jump in shares, noting they were less stringent than expected and would help to reduce systemic risks.
The long-awaited wealth management rules, released on Friday, aim to push banks to standardize their wealth management businesses and to invest wealth-management product funds into the capital markets in a compliant way. 
YUAN WEAKNESS
In the currency market, expectations of further policy easing piled pressure on a fragile yuan, which suffered its worst month on record in June. The spot market  opened at 6.8145 per dollar and eased to a low of 6.8295. It ended at 6.8100 by the domestic close, its weakest since June 27, 2017.
If the onshore yuan finishes the late night session at the same level, it would have lost 0.36 percent against the dollar for the day. The offshore yuan  fell nearly 0.6 percent to a low of 6.8448 per dollar, its weakest since June 2017. It was trading at 6.8350 as of 0830 GMT.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) had set the midpoint rate  at 6.7891 per dollar ahead of the market open, its weakest since July 11, 2017. The fixing was 298 pips or 0.44 percent weaker than Monday's midpoint of 6.7593. The fixing matched market forecasts and dragged the spot rate lower.
On Monday, China said it has no intention of devaluing the yuan to help exports, after Washington said it was monitoring the currency's weakness amid the escalating bilateral trade brawl.
""The market now believes that chances for the yuan to rebound are getting low, unless there would be a strong official guidance from the authorities. Tolerance is higher. Investors thought that the 6.7 per dollar was the floor, then 6.8, now both are gone,"" said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. 
She said current trade suggested the authorities remained comfortable with the losses in the currency.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares climbed for a third day running on Tuesday, as China promised fiscal action to support the world's second-largest economy and stellar results from internet giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) underpinned the tech stocks.
Global bonds remained under pressure on speculation the Bank of Japan may soon trim its massive stimulus. The euro was choppy as a dip in French business confidence was offset by signs of strength in German manufacturing.
European stocks were also up, partly thanks to some upbeat results from UBS, autos firm PSA and chipmaker AMS (EU), but also just riding in the slipstream of Asia's and Wall Street's overnight gains. (EU)
China's government bond yields jumped and the offshore yuan hit a one-year low after Beijing's cabinet said it would pursue a more vigorous fiscal policy and as traders bet on further easing in monetary conditions.
Shanghai blue chips closed up 1.5 percent at a one-month high (SS) and Japan's Nikkei had added 0.5 percent, even though a disappointing reading on factory activity suggested the threat of a trade war was starting to bite.
""The big story is that the Chinese currency continues to slide,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) FX strategist Alvin Tan.
""It is clear the government is moving towards policies that are supporting growth,"" he adding, saying the trend was likely to bring a reaction from the United States in time.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.2 percent, as European bourses shuffled higher. 
Tech stocks got a boost from Alphabet, the parent of Google, which jumped 3.6 percent after hours to a record high, valuing the group at $870 billion.
That made up for an otherwise dull Monday on Wall Street where the Dow ended down 0.06 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.28 percent.
WHO WILL BUY THESE BONDS? 
Bond bulls were still smarting from speculation that the Bank of Japan is close to scaling back its monetary stimulus, a risk that lifted long-term borrowing costs globally. 
Markets were worried that Japanese investors would have less incentive to hunt offshore for yield, said ANZ economist Felicity Emmett.
""The 10-basis-point steepening in the Japanese yield curve is massive in the context of a market that rarely moves more than 1 basis point,"" she said. ""It reflects a broader fear that central banks are reducing their purchases while U.S. bond supply is set to rise significantly.""
As a result, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields reached their highest in five weeks, around 2.96 percent, and were again nearing the 3 percent mark.
Germany's government bond yields rose to a five-week high of 0.416 percent. Most other euro zone yields were higher by 1-3 basis points [GVD/EUR].
""Global stocks, Asian stocks in particular have seen a boost from (potential) policy-easing measures in China and this helps the general risk sentiment and adds to some of the headwinds to bond markets,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Rainer Guntermann. 
GDP GUESSING GAMES
Part of the shift in yields was caused by talk that data on second-quarter U.S. economic growth, due on Friday, would top current forecasts of 4.1 percent.
Dealers noted some media reports that President Donald Trump was predicting an outcome of 4.8 percent. That would not be out of bounds, given the much-watched Atlanta Fed GDP tracker puts growth at an annualized 4.5 percent.
Such a strong outcome would only add to the risk of faster rate increases from the Federal Reserve and underpin the dollar.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was hovering at 94.616 compared with a low of 94.207 on Monday. It bought 111.19 yen, against Monday's trough of 110.75.
The euro slipped to $1.1690, having run into profit-taking at a peak of $1.1750 overnight. Turkey's lira was down 0.5 percent and looking jumpy before what is expected to be another sharp rate increase later.
In commodity markets, oil prices were flat as the focus turned to oversupply worries and away from escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. [O/R]

Duesmann is the second high-profile defection from BMW to Volkswagen group following the departure of Herbert Diess in July 2015 as head of the VW brand. Diess took over as chief executive of VW Group in April.
Volkswagen is still trying to recover from a 2015 emissions scandal, while BMW's vehicles have faced fewer regulatory problems tied to excessive pollution when compared with rivals Mercedes, VW, Porsche and Audi.
""Mr. Duesmann, currently Board of Management Member for Purchasing and Supplier Network at BMW AG, will take up his new position as soon as he is able to do so,"" Volkswagen said in a statement.
BMW said Duesmann had informed its chairman that he would not make himself available for an extension of his contract because of personal reasons.
""As a consequence, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Mr. Duesmann agreed that Mr. Duesmann will be relieved of his contractual responsibilities as Management Board Member for Purchasing and Supplier Network with immediate effect,"" BMW said.
German newspaper Handelsblatt reported that Volkswagen wanted Duesmann to fill the post of Audi chief executive following the arrest of former boss Rupert Stadler.
Duesmann cannot take over as Audi CEO full time until Stadler permanently steps down as head of the Audi brand. Stadler has been temporarily replaced while he remains in custody on suspicion of interfering with a probe into the carmaker's excessive emissions.

VW and Audi have said that Stadler is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Small banks in Chinese provinces affected by Beijing's efforts to slash excess industrial capacity and reduce pollution are being hit by a spate of non-performing loans, according to reports from Chinese credit rating agencies.
Some small lenders in provinces such as Henan and Guizhou have seen their capital adequacy ratios fall to near zero or even negative due to the increase in bad loans, the reports say.
The troubles facing the regional lenders have been masked by slow overall bad-loan growth in China this year as big state-backed banks register faster profit growth.
At least 13 lenders, including 10 rural commercial banks, have had their credit ratings cut or outlooks downgraded to negative since the start of 2017, according to a Reuters analysis of 271 reports issued by several domestic ratings agencies.
The reports attribute the rise in bad loans to small business failures as the local economy stalls, as well as the closure of factories and mines as part of Beijing's campaign to slash excess capacity and curb pollution, hurting the ability of companies to repay debts.
Many small banks are racing to replenish their capital to raise additional funds as provisions against non-performing loans. The spate of ratings downgrades is making it harder for some of them to raise funds in capital markets.
""Small banks are the main forces for small business financing,"" said Xu Chengyuan, chief analyst at Golden Credit Rating International Co. ""Under capital constraints, they have to reduce lending.""
A shrinking of credit could have serious implications for regional economies, said Xu.
For now, the provinces of Guizhou, Henan, Liaoning, Shandong and Jilin have the highest non-performing loan ratios in China, according to Citic Securities.
But risks could spread to more regions if companies are increasingly hit by Beijing's financial deleveraging campaign, which has pushed up borrowing costs and reduced credit availability, analysts say.
TROUBLED INDUSTRIES
In Shandong, where industries like coal, steel and aluminum account for 70 percent of industrial output, the ratings of four regional banks have been downgraded or had their outlook cut since December due to surging bad loans, the Reuters analysis shows.
The non-performing loan ratio of one of the lenders, Shandong Guangrao Rural Commercial Bank, jumped to 13.9 percent at the end of 2017 from 2.47 percent in 2016, while annual profit plummeted 99 percent to 1 million yuan ($146,618.97) from 197 million yuan over the period.
The bank declined to comment.
The soaring rate of bad and overdue loans at the bank resulted from the bankruptcies of local tyre companies hit by the excess capacity and pollution clampdowns, according to a report from Golden Credit Rating.
In the southwestern province of Guizhou, Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank was downgraded by China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co to A+ from AA- in June after its bad loan ratio soared 15.41 percentage points last year to 19.54 percent.
The rise was also triggered by stricter rules on classifying bad loans imposed by the banking regulator, the ratings agency said.
The surge in bad loans has almost wiped out its regulatory capital, its financial figures show.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio dropped to 0.91 percent last year from 11.77 percent a year earlier, while its tier-one core capital adequacy ratio swung to negative 1.41 percent from 8.01 percent.
In central China, Henan Xiuwu Rural Commercial Bank had a non-performing loan ratio of 20.74 percent at the end of 2017, compared with 4.5 percent a year earlier, according to disclosures made by the lender.
With the jump in the bad loan ratio, the bank's capital adequacy ratio swung to a negative 0.75 percent from 12.92 percent.
Calls to Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank and Henan Xiuwu Rural Commercial Bank went unanswered.
Analysts say stricter classification rules will lead to a further jump in bad loans at small banks that have been hiding them under the ""special mention"" category.
The rules, which require banks to classify all loans overdue by over 90 days as non-performing loans, is likely to lead to a 14-percent increase in such loans from 2017, and 95 percent of the impact will fall on mid-sized and small banks, according to a June report by UBS.
That will lead to a provisioning shortfall of 250 billion yuan, UBS estimated.
POOR RISK MANAGEMENT
Small banks, most of which are unlisted, will have to rely on funding support from local governments and existing shareholders to boost capital, bankers and analysts say. But simple capital injections cannot resolve the fundamental problem of poor risk management.
Risks are more significant at rural commercial banks as they lack sufficient capability to diversify in terms of geography, industry or clients, analysts say. Many of the banks are involved in unregulated shadow financing, allowing them to circumvent rules capping a lender's credit exposure.
Jilin Jiaohe Rural Commercial Bank was downgraded to A from A+ in February by Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating & Investors Service Co partly because it had lent 601 million yuan in shadow loans via trust products to Cosun Group, which defaulted in a high-profile shadow banking scandal involving 14 financial institutions.
Small banks' close ties to local governments also puts pressure on them to support often murky local government financing vehicles, said a source who deals with the products.
Guosen Securities Co estimates that Chinese banks are exposed to 28 trillion yuan of debt implicitly guaranteed by local governments, including 17.2 trillion yuan in on-balance sheet loans and 10.5 trillion yuan categorized as so-called non-standard investment, which typically refers to shadow loans.
Some local government funding vehicles have missed payments due to refinancing difficulties and weak local economic growth, dragging regional banks into a tough fight against rising bad loans and bureaucratic protectionism.
""Local governments had asked banks to give them money so we had to,"" said one banker who requested anonymity. ""But now they are saying 'why did you lend it to me in the first place'"".

KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysia Airlines Bhd is tapping banks to fund about nine Boeing 737 MAX planes in what will be the carrier's first jet financing with lenders since it was restructured more than three years ago, sources familiar with the situation said.
The financing represents a key test for the airline, which was taken over by Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional [KHAZA.UL] in December 2014, months after MH370 disappeared and MH17 was shot down over Ukraine.
Finance industry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Malaysian, European and Chinese banks are expected to compete for financing of the planes, for which Malaysia Airlines sent out a request for proposal a few weeks ago. 
The jets have a list price of around $1 billion, but airlines typically receive large discounts from manufacturers.
Malaysia Airlines said on Tuesday it was considering ""various funding and leasing options"" for its 737 MAX order, which is meant to replace older 737s coming off lease, but declined to provide more specific details.
Khazanah had no immediate response to a request for comment.
Though the aviation financing environment remains strong, the sources said Malaysia Airlines' poor operating performance and a forced haircut taken by banks and lessors on finance and operating leases during the airline's restructuring could make some banks wary of a financing deal with the carrier.
They could also be discouraged by the airline's struggle to show a meaningful recovery after job cuts, fleet changes and route adjustments undertaken as part of a five-year turnaround plan.
""The way they managed their restructuring and put pressure on banks, that's something banks haven't forgotten. There are also no concrete signs of a turnaround,"" said one source.
Sources said the request for proposal is for planes that Malaysia Airlines will take delivery over the next few years under finance leases. Airlines routinely tap banks to fund their aircraft in sale and leaseback arrangements.
HEADWINDS
The airline has taken out operating leases for widebodies since the restructuring but this is the first time it is seeking a financing arrangement with lenders, sources said. Malaysia Airlines has 25 737 MAX jets on order with Boeing (N:BA).
Sources said Japanese financial institutions, once strong backers of the airline, were not likely to participate due to curbs related to the carrier having been loss-making for years.
Malaysia Airlines last month said it had underperformed against its 2017 budget and was preparing for a ""tough year ahead"" due to competition, exchange rate volatility and rising fuel prices. It expects an improved performance later in the year and is targeting sustained profitability in 2019.
The airline has also been struggling on the management front, with CEO Peter Bellew quitting in 2017 after a little more than a year in the job. His predecessor, Christoph Mueller, also quit before the end of his contract. Veteran company executive Izham Ismail is now the CEO.
Overcapacity in its key markets and aggressive competition from the likes of AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA) and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) along with high oil prices has hampered Malaysia Airlines' turnaround plans, the sources said.
""Things are clearly not working out the way they should,"" said a second source. ""There's lack of continuity at senior management positions, they have formidable low-cost competitors on short- and medium-haul routes and the long-haul market has still not recovered.""
But others said government backing combined with a liquid market for narrowbody jets would provide support to financiers. 
""Your insolvency risk on Malaysia Airlines is pretty much zero. Malaysia would never let it happen,"" a third source said.

""I don't think having been through such a recent restructuring that anyone would imagine something like that happening again in the near future.""

722,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",MSCI wrong to include China in key index: investor survey,"By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global index provider MSCI was wrong in its landmark decision to include mainland China-listed ""A"" shares in its emerging markets index in June, according to nearly half of the international investors surveyed for a new report into Chinese corporate governance.
MSCI's (N:MSCI) decision to add domestic Chinese stocks for the first time to its benchmark global emerging market indices, tracked by an estimated $1.9 trillion, was seen as a milestone in the opening up of China's markets to international capital.
Yet 48 per cent of foreign investors surveyed by the Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA) said that MSCI was wrong to include China's A-shares in its indices, compared to just 27 percent who felt that inclusion was correct.
The survey results were contained in an ACGA report, which examines what it called ""China's unique system of corporate governance"".
When MSCI announced that it would add A-shares to the index MSCI said it had tried “to obtain feedback from the entire investment ecosystem” which included asset owners, asset managers, brokers consultants and custodians worldwide.
Governance has long been a hot topic for investors looking at China, but the MSCI decision put it under an even brighter spotlight because fund managers who benchmark to its indices must now invest onshore.
Chinese authorities are working to improve corporate governance in domestic firms, but their goals can differ from those of international institutional investors.
The survey reported that 59 percent of investors felt they did not understand corporate governance in China, including practices around the roles and responsibilities of non-executive directors, supervisory boards and Communist Party committees.
In June, China's securities regulator published new corporate governance rules, which required listed companies to do more for ""Communist Party building"", including studying the party’s theories and conducting social activities in line with party doctrine.
Last year state-owned enterprises amended their company laws to include the role of Communist Party committees for the first time. Some companies stated that boards must first consult the party committee before making decisions.
The ACGA survey suggests that Chinese authorities, who hope to see more A-shares added to the MSCI benchmark over time, need to do more to assuage overseas investors' fears, particularly when it comes to listed Chinese companies' governance structures.
""Corporate governance concerns [were] one of the major reasons why foreign investors felt that A-shares should not be added to the MSCI EM index,"" said Nana Li, senior research analyst at ACGA.
Of the investors surveyed by ACGA, whose members have a combined $30 trillion of assets under management, 68 per cent described dealing with domestically-listed Chinese companies as ""very difficult"". Only 2 per cent said there was no problem.
Chinese companies - mainly U.S and Hong Kong-listed ones - currently make up just over 31 percent of MSCI's Emerging Markets Index, with A-shares accounting for only 0.8 percent of the total. If China's domestic A-shares were to be given their full weight, China would account for more than 42 percent of the index.

Li said the two countries should take advantage of the multilateral mechanisms, such as the World Trade Organization to strengthen trade ties. ""Sino-Brazil relations began with agriculture some 200 years ago when tea farmers from China visited Rio de Janeiro,"" he said.

China would ease restriction on banks’ issuance of financial bonds for small local firms, and would give tax cut on R&D expenditures among other measures, according to a government statement, adding that fiscal policy should be more proactive, although policy makers would refrain from using stimulus to flood the economy.
Separately, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China is not looking to boost its exports through devaluing the yuan.
“The exchange rate of China’s RMB is determined by the market. There are ups and downs. It’s a two-way float,”Geng said at a regular briefing in Beijing when asked to comment on U.S. President Donald Trump’s remarks on the yuan.
Trump accused China over the weekend that it was manipulating its currency which caused U.S. to lose its competitive advantage.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 08:44PM ET</span>",Alphabet trounces profit estimates as Google reins in costs,"By Paresh Dave and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc on Monday reported that expenses from its Google search business grew more slowly in the second quarter while revenue rose more steeply than analysts had anticipated, boosting profit above Wall Street targets and pushing shares up 3.6 percent after hours.
Google's dominance in online advertising has been challenged this year by the antitrust battle over its Android mobile software, which led to a $5 billion fine for the quarter, and other regulatory actions, including new European privacy rules. 
Government pressure to improve moderation of user-created content has forced Google to hire more analysts. YouTube, a Google-owned streaming service, has increased spending on video content to keep consumers from shifting to offerings from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and expanding media conglomerates such as AT&T Inc (NYSE:T).
But those issues have yet to halt Alphabet, which has grown quarterly revenue at least 20 percent year-over-year for two straight years. 
""There was never a question about Google’s dominance of a buoyant digital ads market,"" said analyst Richard Kramer of Arete Research. 
The quarterly growth rate of what the company pays ad partners, called traffic acquisition costs, fell for the first time in three years, which Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell described as the ""most impressive"" piece of the results.
Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts that investments in artificial intelligence software meant to better predict where to place ads are making its services more attractive to advertisers. The company is selling more ads as its YouTube video service and Google search grow globally, he said. 
Profit margins have dipped as more ads get shown on mobile devices, where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other firms charge fees to distribute Google search on their devices and apps. 
But Google in the second quarter entered the second year of its latest multi-year deal with Apple, which analysts said helped even out costs.
Operating margin rose to 24 percent from 22 percent last quarter, excluding the $5 billion antitrust fine issued last week by the European Commission over Google's anticompetitive licensing of Android software. The margin was down from 26 percent a year ago. 
Net profit dropped to $3.2 billion from $3.5 billion, due to the fine, but analysts focused on operating results. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $10.58, excluding the fine and the effects of other investments. Analysts estimated $9.52 per share, according to research aggregated by Thomson Reuters. Some analysts excluded other items as well, and Alphabet also beat that consensus of $9.59. 
Alphabet's $32.66 billion in second-quarter revenue, 86 percent of which came from Google's advertising business, beat an average estimate of $32.17 billion. 
The rest of the revenue came from Google's non-advertising businesses, which include selling apps, gadgets and cloud computing services, and ventures such as offering internet service.
The newer businesses are sucking up investments as Google adds data centers and employees to support them. But Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts on Monday that the advertising unit is also getting new capital. 
Alphabet,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and other leading application makers have become big forces in advertising as consumers globally, and in turn, advertisers devote increasing attention to smartphone and TV apps instead of newspapers and traditional TV broadcasts. 
Pichai said the company had opportunity to show ads on Google Home smart speakers and Google Maps and was slowly determining the best way to do so. 
Company shares have benefited from easing regulatory concerns. A new privacy law enacted by the EU in May has had a minimal effect on Google's advertising business, and smartphone industry executives have described the EU antitrust case over Android as too late to matter. The company has cautioned that it is too early to measure the impact on both fronts. 
But Alphabet's outlook is tempered by cost concerns, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's encroachment into advertising has threatened Google's lucrative deals with media companies and advertisers.

Alphabet trails Facebook, Amazon and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) in valuation as measured by the ratio of enterprise value to expected earnings.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>","Fears of rout in China stocks overdone, some say","By Samuel Shen and Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
SHANGHAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Concerns that a sharp fall in Chinese stocks this year will turn into a rout as China and the United States exchange barbs on trade are overdone, some investors say.
By some estimates, the stock market is pricing in sharper downgrades in corporate earnings for 2019 than analysts are forecasting, suggesting that investors are overly pessimistic.
Instead, these fund managers, investors and equity analysts, see limited downside potential for Chinese stocks, pointing to relatively low valuations historically and signs that some buyers are starting to put money back into the market.
Shanghai's benchmark equity index (SSEC) fell as much as 18.6 percent to 2,691 points by early July, making it the worst performing major global index. It has since edged back up to 2,859.
""Why is the market so weak? Because investors are pessimistic, or more precisely, over-pessimistic,"" said Zhou Liang, founder of Shanghai Minority Investment Management, a private fund house largely invested in banks, insurers and developers.
Indeed, the forward price/earnings ratio of the Shanghai index, based on earnings expectations for 2018, is around 10, the lowest level since panic selling in early 2016 when the market was still dealing with the hangover from the 2015 financial crisis. They are also 40 percent lower than forward PE ratios in U.S. stocks.
The drop in Chinese shares this year has been driven by concerns about a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy and that China would be worse off in a trade war with the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade with several countries around the world, has applied tariffs to some goods imported from China and threatened taxes on the remaining imports.
These factors have prompted an overly pessimistic view on the corporate earnings outlook for 2019, says  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""The market is discounting a 5 percent decline in next year's earnings,"" the bank said in a research note, when analysts' consensus forecast is for a rise of 13 percent.
""Further downside would only be consistent with a hard landing scenario, whereby profit momentum turns negative and earnings do not grow in the next two years"".
BARGAIN HUNTERS
Gao Ting, head of China strategy at UBS Securities, says Chinese stock values are signalling that China's economic growth will slow sharply.
""Interestingly, the overall situation we see is not that terrible, both in terms of economic fundamentals, or corporate profit.""
China reported last week that economic growth slowed in the second quarter to 6.7 percent from 6.8 percent in the first quarter, although most economists agree the country is on course to meet its 2018 growth target of around 6.5 percent.
In a sign that the low valuations are attracting bargain hunters, the China Southern CSI500 ETF (SS:510500) - used by many institutions to increase exposure to a range of blue-chips - saw its assets under management (AUM) rise to a record high of 26 billion yuan in the week ended July 13.
The Huatai-PB CSI300 ETF (SS:510300), which tracks China's blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300), saw its assets under management rise to 23 billion yuan as of mid July from 22.1 billion yuan at the end of the first quarter even though the market fell 12 percent during that period.
Some money is also flowing in from foreign investors as investment in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets from Hong Kong, under the stock connect scheme linking the markets, swung to a net inflow in the first half of July from a net outflow in the second half of June.
""Barring a major economic or financial crisis, we're at a new, historic bottom,"" brokerage BOC International said.
NO TIME TO RUSH
Still, other investors remain cautious, in part because the potential for a trade war between China and the United States and how that might be played out means the outlook is too unpredictable.
The low valuations mask unprecedented political uncertainty, said Xie Donghai, chairman of hedge fund manager Shanghai Entropy Asset Management.
""The biggest uncertainty this year is political,"" he said.
""The risks of investing in an individual stock becomes tremendous, and such risks are beyond imagination,"" Xie said.
Even if Chinese stocks are forming a cyclical bottom right, there is no rush to invest, said Hong Hao, chief strategist at BOCOM International. That is because historically, China's stock market cycles show sharp and rapid rises, but troughs tend to be long and shallow.
""Don't use valuations if they're not at extreme levels,"" he said at a conference recently.

""We should know how to cope with risks in trading. It's like playing Texas Hold'em Poker: you don't go all-in and risk losing your shirt.""

About 10 percent of its employees across all levels and geographies will receive pay adjustments, a Nike spokeswoman told Reuters.
The company had about 74,400 employees worldwide, according to a regulatory filing. Its Mid-level managers at Portland headquarters are paid about $40,000 to $120,000 a year, according to job search and review website Glassdoor.
Nike has been under scrutiny for its workplace behavior, forcing Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker to apologize in May to employees in a company-wide town hall for its past work culture.
With mounting complaints, a number of high-profile executives, including Nike brand President Trevor Edwards who was tipped to take over from Parker, left the company. 

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the day that the pay adjustment would begin in August and will be annualized over the balance of the company's fiscal year.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) will give investors on Tuesday a fresh look at the impact of trade conflicts and a strong dollar on its profits, and analysts are bracing for bad news and more cost-cutting.
Analysts polled by Reuters, on average, expect the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company to report a profit of $1.34 per share, below the $1.48 per share reported in the corresponding period a year ago.
The earnings report comes a few weeks after Harley announced a plan to move production of motorcycles for the European Union from the United States to its overseas facilities to avoid the tariffs imposed by the trading bloc in retaliation for Trump's duties on steel and aluminum imports.
To offset falling demand at home, Harley has been aiming to boost overseas motorcycle sales to 50 percent of annual volume from about 43 percent. With revenues from EU countries second only to the United States, the region is a key part of its growth strategy.
However, the decision to shift production overseas sparked an angry reaction from President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose higher taxes on the company and warned of a public backlash if Harley went ahead with the plan. Trump, however, did not specify how he could target Harley-Davidson with higher taxes, and no action has been taken since he made the threat in late June.
Harley has assembly facilities in India and Brazil, and is expected to launch an assembly plant in Thailand in September. 
The fallout from Washington's restrictive trade policies has exacerbated the travails of a company that has been grappling with an ageing customer base, weak demand from younger buyers and discounts offered by its rivals.
Late last month, Harley forecast that the EU tariffs would cost the company about $30 million to $45 million for the remainder of 2018 and $90 million to $100 million on a full-year basis.
That will be on top of an additional $15 million to $20 million the company is estimated to pay for raw materials this year because of rising steel and aluminum costs due to Trump's tariffs on imports.
Harley is still the dominant player in the heavyweight motorcycle market in the United States, but its market share has steadily fallen, to 50.4 percent from 58 percent in 2013.
In January, it announced the closure of a plant in Kansas City, Missouri, after its motorcycle shipments fell to their lowest level in six years. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bernstein expect the company's U.S. retail sales to be down 7 percent in the June quarter after a 12 percent annual decline in the first quarter. Goldman analysts said, ""Harley may continue to rationalize its U.S. business throughout the year."" 

Harley-Davidson shares have lost about 8 percent since early March when the trade skirmish between the United States and the EU started, and are down over 22 percent since end-December 2017.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 04:46PM ET</span>",U.S. to propose revoking California authority to set auto emissions rules: source,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is expected as early as Thursday to propose revoking California's power to set state vehicle emissions rules and mandate the purchase of electric vehicles, a government official briefed on the matter said.
The U.S. Transportation Department and Environmental Protection Agency are expected to unveil a proposed regulation that recommends freezing national emissions requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, the official said on condition of anonymity because it has not yet been made public.
The administration plans to propose a rule that would revoke a waiver California was granted by the EPA under the Clean Air Act to set state emissions rules and require zero emission vehicles. EPA and the Transportation Department will take comment and hold public hearings before finalizing a decision. 
Regulators forecast freezing national emissions standards after 2020 would increase U.S. fuel consumption by about 500,000 barrels of oil per day, the source said. Government regulators also estimate the regulation, which they name the Safer and Affordable Fuel Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles rule, will cut traffic deaths and reduce the cost of new vehicles. 
The proposal is sure to spark a massive fight with California and a dozen other states that have adopted California's emissions rules, which would require average vehicle fuel efficiency to reach around 50 miles per gallon by 2025. Eliminating California's electric vehicle mandate would hurt automakers like Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and General Motors Co (N:GM) that are investing billions in EVs.
The Trump administration proposal will seek to reverse planned hikes in fuel efficiency standards adopted by the Obama administration. A freeze would reduce the average fleet fuel economy standard from a current projected level of 46.8 miles per gallon in 2026 to 37 miles per gallon, according to an earlier draft obtained by Democratic Senator Tom Carper.
The administration contends the new could lead to a total of 1 million additional new vehicle sales through 2029 versus if the Obama rules remained in place, the official said. Major automakers have repeatedly said they do not back freezing the requirements but have called for changes to take into account fuel prices and shifting consumer demand.
The proposal will also ask for comments on whether U.S. regulators should revoke or expand emissions credits for air conditioning improvements or offer new credits for autonomous vehicles.
The EPA and Transportation Department did not immediately provide comments on Monday.
In May, California and a group of 16 other states challenged the Trump administration's decision to reopen strict U.S. vehicle emissions rules for review. Reuters reported previously that the Transportation Department plans to assert in the proposal that California is also barred from setting emissions rules under a 1975 law.
The administration draft says the proposal would save up to 1,000 highway deaths annually by reducing the cost of new vehicles and prodding people to buy new safer cars sooner, the source said. California and environmentalists have previously criticized that analysis.
STAY OUT OF OUR WAY, CALIFORNIA OFFICIAL SAYS
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Monday that he is ""ready to use every legal tool at our disposal to protect the current vehicle emission standards.""
The draft proposal forecasts the average cost of a new vehicle would fall by $1,850 by 2030 and would only have a ""negligible impact"" on the global climate of ""3/1000th of one degree Celsius by 2100.""
The administration projects the new rule would reduce ""societal costs"" by about $500 billion over the life of the vehicles, but the administration's overall forecast net benefits are unclear, once higher fuel consumption is taken into account.
The rules could thwart efforts to boost EVs in California.
In January, California Governor Jerry Brown set a new target of 5 million zero-emission vehicles in California by 2030, up from a prior goal of 1.5 million by 2025. Automakers have announced plans to spend tens of billions of dollars to add dozens of new EV models.
Representative Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat, wrote on Twitter that the state's ""vehicle emissions standards are a big part of our environmental identity.... We actually care about our future. Stay out of CA’s way!""

734,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 04:35PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Google Easily Beats the Street
Tech shares should get a boost in Tuesday trading following impressive results from Google parent Alphabet.
The stock jumped in postmarket trading Monday shortly after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that handily topped Wall Street’s forecasts.
Shares of Alphabet rose more than 4% at 4:25 PM ET (20:25 GMT).
The company said it earned $11.75 per share for the three months ended June 30, excluding the $5 billion fine from the EU. Revenue came in at $32.66 billion.
On average, analysts were looking for a profit of $9.66 per share on revenue of a little more than $25 billion.
2. Harley Could Hog the Morning Headlines
Earnings will continue to dominate most of the before-the-bell headlines Tuesday.
In the telecom sector, Dow component Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will issue numbers, as will rival AT&T (NYSE:T) after the bell, with investors keen to get updates on its acquisition of Time Warner, which still may face regulatory challenges.
The Department of Justice said earlier this month it would appeal the decision to approve the merger.
Dow component 3M (NYSE:MMM) is scheduled to report, as is drugmaker Eli Lilly.
But Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) could steal the spotlight if it mentions more about the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs or about moving production abroad to avoid retaliatory tariffs on U.S. motorcycles.
3. Manufacturing, Home Sales Data Arrive
Investors will get the latest read on U.S. manufacturing and services activity when the purchasing managers index (PMI) is released at 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the manufacturing index edged down to 55.1 for the preliminary July reading. The non-manufacturing, or services, PMI is forecast to remain the same as the month before at 56.5.
Both manufacturing and services have been strong this year, along with the broader economy.
Also on the calendar is the government’s house price index for May, with economists looking for a 0.4% rise. The housing sector has seen some weak numbers lately. On Monday, existing home sales for June fell unexpectedly."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq index rose on Monday as a jump in 10-year bond yields boosted financial sector stocks and investors anticipated continued strength in corporate earnings and U.S. economic growth.
The financial sector stock index (SPSY) rose 1.3 percent after 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed to their highest level in five weeks. The Federal Reserve was seen as likely to continue raising interest rates despite criticism from President Donald Trump.
""Yields are climbing across the board, which is a sign of a strengthening economy,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. ""And earnings have been very strong.""
Analysts now forecast profit growth of about 22 percent for the second-quarter earnings season, up from 20.7 percent at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
News of ongoing trade talks helped U.S. stocks edge upward. Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador sent Trump a letter urging a quick wrap-up of NAFTA trade negotiations, and trade officials from Mexico and the United States will meet later this week.
Also, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is scheduled to meet with Trump on Wednesday over the imposition of import tariffs, though he will not arrive in Washington with a specific trade offer. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 13.83 points, or 0.06 percent, to 25,044.29, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 5.15 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,806.98 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 21.68 points, or 0.28 percent, to 7,841.87.
But some investors worried about the effects of international trade tensions on the U.S. dollar, which has climbed in recent months. Several U.S. multinationals are reevaluating their currency hedging strategies.
Shares of Illinois Tool Works Inc (N:ITW) fell 7.2 percent, contributing to the S&P 500 industrial sector's (SPLRCI) 0.6 percent decline. The machinery parts maker cut its full-year earnings forecast, joining Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) in blaming the strong dollar for the cut.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) slipped 0.6 percent and was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 after Trump renewed his attacks on the retailer.
Shares of Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) rose more than 4.0 percent in after-hours trading after the internet giant reported quarterly results.
 Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) shares jumped 12.9 percent, the most in the S&P 500, after posting upbeat results. Rival  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) gained 3.9 percent.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares fell 3.3 percent after a report that the company has asked some suppliers to refund previous payments by the company in a bid to turn a profit.
Shares of oilfield services provider  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) sank 8.1 percent as investors focused on growing pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin.
LifePoint Health Inc (O:LPNT) shares soared 35.5 percent and lifted shares of hospital operators after the company agreed to be bought by Apollo Global Management (N:APO) in a deal valued at about $5.6 billion.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 53 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.50 billion shares, compared to the 6.16 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The rise in Japan's 10-year Treasury yield emerged as Reuters reported that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) was discussing changes to its monetary policy measures in a bid to combat stubbornly low inflation.
Rising Treasury yields are seen as boon for banks, boosting their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) added two senior investment bankers to its media and telecommunications team as it continues to bolster coverage of the sector, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters. 
The bank has hired Sam Powers, who was previously head of technology, media and telecom for the Americas at UBS Group AG, and Randy Russell, who was previously head of Americas media and telecom at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), the memo said.

742,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Tesla says supplier discount request was for ongoing projects,"By Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said on Monday that it had asked a small number of suppliers to cut prices on ongoing, long-term projects to improve its future cash flow, after a media report about a discount request sent shares of Tesla down as much as 6.6 percent.
The Wall Street Journal had reported on Sunday that Tesla had turned to some suppliers for a refund of previously made payments in a bid to turn a profit, citing a memo sent by a Tesla global supply manager.
Concern that the memo signaled that money-losing Tesla was scrambling to find cash to fund its current operations and multiple long-term projects had sent shares down. 
A Tesla spokesperson said the electric vehicle maker had asked fewer than 10 of its suppliers for a reduction in ""total capex project spend for long-term projects that began in 2016 but are still not complete.""
Any pricing adjustments would improve Tesla's ""future cash flows, but not impact our ability to achieve profitability in Q3,"" the spokesperson added.
Tesla shares pared losses and were down 2.7 percent at $305.01.
Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne told Reuters that Tesla's supplier explanation appeared ""rational"", but that there remained lingering concerns. 
""We still have the same concerns, though, about general cash flow needs for the company, production quality issues, automation or lack thereof, as well as concerns on profitability..."" Osborne said.
Tesla has been burning through cash as it ramps up production of its Model 3 sedan. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the company does not need to raise cash this year, but several analysts have predicted that the electric car maker would need to raise capital soon. 
Tesla had about $3.2 billion in cash as of March 31, after spending about $1 billion in the quarter. 
Tesla said Monday, ""Negotiation is a standard part of the procurement process, and now that we're in a stronger position with Model 3 production ramping, it is a good time to improve our competitive advantage in this area."" 
""We're focused on reaching a more sustainable long-term cost basis, not just finding one-time reductions for this quarter,"" the spokesperson said. 
Musk tweeted: ""Only costs that actually apply to Q3 & beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.""
Tesla has said the company will be profitable in the third and fourth quarters of the year. It posted a loss of $709.6 million in its first quarter.

In June, Tesla said it was cutting several thousand jobs to become sustainably profitable without endangering the ramp-up of Model 3 production.

743,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Ukraine central banker plays down Paritetbank Sberbank bid chances,"By Emma Rumney and Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Ukraine's deputy central bank governor said on Monday she struggled to see how a second bid from Belarus's state-owned Paritetbank for the Ukrainian unit of Russia's Sberbank (MM:SBER) could be approved, after the first was turned down.
The Russian lender put its Ukrainian unit up for sale in March 2017 after Kiev imposed sanctions on Sberbank and other Russian state banks operating in Ukraine following tensions over pro-Russian secessionists in the country's east.
Belarus's Paritetbank submitted its first bid for the business in late 2017 but it was turned down by the central bank which said the applicant was incompatible with Ukrainian legislation. It then put forward a second bid in June.
Kateryna Rozhkova said the outcome was yet to be determined, but she did not see how it could be different this time around.
""We have refused this bank before,"" Rozhkova said in an interview with Reuters. ""I cannot imagine what new argument they can provide.""
Staff at the central bank are still reviewing the application, however, she said, and have three months from its submission to decide.
Paritetbank is the 15th largest of Belarus's 25 banks in terms of assets, while as of 2017 Sberbank Ukraine was one of Ukraine's largest ten banks by assets.
Russian state development bank VEB and its second largest lender VTB (MM:VTBR) also have subsidiaries in Ukraine.
On Ukraine's largest bank PrivatBank's legal case with former shareholder Ihor Kolomoisky, which is due to resume, she said as the regulator the central bank had made ""the right decision"" to order its nationalization over funding concerns.
On monetary policy in Ukraine, Rozhkova said that she expected it to ""stay tight"" and that ""in general we are a buyer"" of Ukraine's Hryvnia in currency markets.
The central bank (NBU) unexpectedly raised its main interest rate to 17.5 percent this month and warned that delays with its troubled $17.5 billion IMF loan program were a cause of concern.
Ukraine's IMF program it well off track. It has received only $8.7 billion of an earmarked $17.5 billion and hasn't received any new cash since April last year due to slow progress implementing reforms including gas tariff increases.
It still hopes to receive $2 billion later this year, but uncertainty is rising about $15 billion of foreign currency debt that needs to be repaid or refinanced by the end of 2020, starting with $2.3 billion in August to October and $8 billion next year.

744,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 01:48PM ET</span>",Papa John's shares fall as board adopts 'poison pill',"(Reuters) - Shares of Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA) fell 8 percent on Monday after the pizza chain said it would implement a ""poison pill"" stock dilution that would act against any move by founder John Schnatter to take a bigger stake.
The implementation of the stockholder rights plan, which aims to stop investors from amassing more than a 15 percent stake in the company, follows Schnatter's resignation as chairman in a row over his use of a racial slur in an internal conference call.
Shares of the pizza chain fell as much as 6 percent on the reports of Schnatter's comments and his subsequent resignation. They rose at the end of last week on a report that Schnatter had held merger talks with the Wendy's burger chain. 
One highly-rated Wall Street analyst on Papa John's, Stifel's Chris O'Cull, cut his rating on the stock to ""sell"", from ""hold"", saying that the company was in a precarious position — ""needing a strategic savior but struggling to find one willing to underwrite a transaction given the brand damage.""
""The rights plan is intended ... to protect the interests of the company and its stockholders by reducing the likelihood that any person or group gains control of Papa John's through open market accumulation or other tactics without paying an appropriate control premium,"" the company said on Sunday.
The company said Schnatter and affiliates already held 30 percent of shares and were grandfathered in under the plan. They would be regarded as an acquiring party on acquisition of 31 percent or more of stock. 
Analysts have said that the Schnatter incident is likely to hurt Papa John's share in a U.S. restaurant market where it is competing with Domino's Pizza (N:DPZ) and Yum Brands' (N:YUM) Pizza Hut.
Thomson Reuters' Eikon Social Media Monitor shows sentiment towards Papa John's turned negative in July, having been firmly in positive territory in previous months.
The New York Yankees cut its ties with Papa John's earlier this month, citing the remarks by Schnatter and the company has removed him from its advertising.
Schnatter resigned as chief executive in December last year, after drawing criticism for comments he made at the National Football League (NFL) leadership. Pizza Hut then replaced Papa John's as an NFL sponsor in February.

""The outlook for Papa John's is growing dimmer ... (the reports on Schnatter) reinforce consumer perception that Papa John's is not a trusted brand,"" O'Cull said.

Daily News slashes half its news staff,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Daily News, the city's scrappy, 99-year-old tabloid, is laying off half of its editorial staff, as U.S. newspapers continue to struggle with sharply declining advertising revenue and readership, it said on Monday.
The cuts at the Pulitzer Prize-winning daily paper, known for eye-catching front-page headlines and taking on the city's power players, including real estate developer Donald Trump long before he was elected president, drew criticism from both average readers and politicians who bristled at how the paper covered them.
Owner Tronc Inc said the cuts are intended to make the paper a stronger competitor online.
""We are reducing today the size of the editorial team by approximately 50 percent and refocusing much of our talent on breaking news - especially in the areas of crime, civil justice and public responsibility,"" Tronc said in a memo to staff.
The Daily News employed about 85 journalists prior to the announcement, according to rival New York Post, owned by News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA).
Sobbing staffers were seen leaving the building at midday.
Outrage over the cuts filled social media.
""It's no secret that I've disagreed with the Daily News from time to time,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter. ""But Tronc's greedy decision to gut the newsroom is bad for government and a disaster for NYC. Tronc should sell the paper to someone committed to local journalism.""
The Daily News has won 11 Pulitzer Prizes over its history, for work ranging from a 2017 investigative series with ProPublica on misuse of eviction laws in the city to the commentaries of Jimmy Breslin.
Its peak weekday circulation was 2.4 million in 1947 and it once sold more copies than any other newspaper in the United States. But that had plummeted to 200,000 by the time Tronc purchased the paper for $1 in 2017.
It is known for one of the most famous newspaper headlines in U.S. history, ""Ford to City: Drop Dead,"" following a 1975 speech by President Gerald Ford that denied the city financial aid as it tottered on the brink of bankruptcy.

The New York layoffs are the latest in a series of cuts at Tronc's media holdings. In April, the company laid off several dozen staffers at the Los Angeles Times, a month after a round of cuts at its flagship property, The Chicago Tribune.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>","European shares extend losing streak as autos, Ryanair drop","By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday in a broad-based pullback led by declines in  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) after deteriorating health forced Fiat's CEO to quit, while a disappointing earnings update sent Ryanair (I:RYA) sharply lower.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.2 percent at its close, posting its third straight day of losses as worries over trade tensions lingered following Washington's threat last week to slap tariffs on $500 billion of Chinese imports.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Ferrari both fell as much as 5 percent after CEO Sergio Marchionne fell seriously ill following complications from surgery, prompting an early change at the helm of both companies.
Jeep division head Mike Manley was named on Saturday to succeed Marchionne, one of the auto industry's most tenacious and respected auto chiefs, as CEO of Fiat Chrysler. 
""Sergio’s dealmaking and political skills will be missed as FCA faces trade/tariff uncertainty, some labor unrest in Italy and a constantly shifting landscape in Latin America,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts led by Brian Johnson wrote.
""We nevertheless believe that the investment case for margin expansion and eventual strategic options remains intact,"" they added. Fiat shares clawed back some losses to end 1.5 percent lower, while Ferrari closed down 4.9 percent.
Ryanair (I:RYA) declined 6.7 percent after the Irish carrier said that average fares would be lower than expected during its key summer period due to high competition, unusually hot weather in Northern Europe and uncertainty caused by a series of strikes.
""Some sense from reading these results that the expected dent to the low-cost model from unionization etc is already feeding through to the bottom line, although it may be unwise to read too much into a single quarter's numbers,"" said Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson.
""We note that full-year profit guidance remains unchanged... although this remains on the whims of French air traffic controllers, its own staff talks, Brexit and close-in Q2 fares,"" he added.
Philips (AS:PHG) also fell after results. France's Atos (PA:ATOS) dropped 6.7 percent after the French IT services company reported revenue growth of only 1.5 percent for the second quarter and said that it was going to buy Michigan-based IT services provider  Syntel  Inc (O:SYNT) in a $3.4 billion cash deal. [nL1N1UI0AT
Despite Monday's disappointments and broader caution that any trade war escalation could slow global growth, analysts are upbeat about earnings growth in Europe, having been revising their estimates upwards over the past few weeks.

According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, second quarter earnings for the STOXX are seen up 6.7 percent.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 12:08PM ET</span>",Marvel sales help Hasbro soothe Toys 'R' Us headache,"By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - U.S. toymaker  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) beat expectations for quarterly profit and revenue on Monday as a jump in Marvel toy sales helped it recover ground lost in last year's Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy, sending its shares up as much as 14 percent. 
Expectations for earnings by the maker of Play-doh and Monopoly were almost half of what they were a year ago going into the results release, driven chiefly by concerns over the disappearance of its biggest retail partner.
In the event, net earnings fell 11 percent to $60.3 million, or 48 cents per share, but were way past analysts' average estimate of 29 cents per share - the biggest beat in nearly two years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""We don't expect to recapture all of the loss (of) revenue in 2018, but by 2019, we should have moved beyond Toys 'R' Us,"" Chief Executive Brian Goldner said.
Toys 'R' Us accounted for 10 percent of all Hasbro sales and the company has moved quickly to reallocate inventory to Walmart (N:WMT),  Target  (N:TGT) and others. Partnerships with big media producers like Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) also helped.
The company was also creating exclusive products and programs online to support retailers and retail events such as JD.com's JD day, Amazon's Prime Day, and the 11/11  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Singles Day, executives said on a post earnings call.
The company said it had benefited from higher sales of a Marvel portfolio that has been boosted by two of the past year's biggest movie successes, Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther. 
Revenue at the company's three main business segments all topped estimates based on the forecasts of three sector analysts, according to data firm FactSet. 
D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser said Hasbro's performance was extremely good this quarter and it should be a really strong year going forward. 
""They'll mitigate quite a bit of the loss in third and fourth quarter,"" she said.
The company's overall revenue fell 7 percent to $904.5 million in the quarter, but was nearly half the drop that analysts were expecting. Analysts on average were estimating revenue of $833.1 million.
The only segment to report an outright rise in revenue was the entertainment and licensing business, which rose nearly 26 percent to $64.7 million in the quarter.
""While product sales were weak in Q2, the benefits of entertainment and licensing was a meaningful offset,"" Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said in a note. 

Shares of rival  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) were also trading up 4 percent at $16.58.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - One of the main defendants in India's largest bank fraud case made a court application on Monday for cancellation of an arrest warrant against him, citing fears for his life because of a growing number of mob lynchings in the country.
Mehul Choksi, who is accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of $2 billion along with his nephew, diamond tycoon Nirav Modi, fled India before the accusations came to light and said in Monday's application that he could not disclose his location in public because of the threat to his life. 
The recent trend of ""mob lynching is growing"", Choksi's lawyer said in the application seen by Reuters, adding that he fears such a fate if he were ever to return to India.
Fake news messages on alleged child abductors circulating on WhatsApp, and via text messages and word of mouth, have led to a spate of mob lynchings in the country.
Choksi's lawyer said that a lack of prosecutions in lynching cases is encouraging more mob violence.
Those with grievances against Choksi, who owns Gitanjali Gems, include employees who have not been paid, families of detained employees and various creditors, he said.
Choksi and Modi are accused of colluding with a handful of bankers to secure credit from overseas banks using fraudulent guarantees. Both have denied the allegations. 
Authorities have said that Choksi and Modi left India before the PNB complaint against them was filed and their whereabouts remain unknown.
Choksi has been highly critical of investigating agencies, alleging that the seizure of his assets, bank accounts and the shutting down of all his offices in India has caused prejudice against him.

A special court for cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act had issued a non-bailable warrant against Choksi this month after the Enforcement Directorate, which investigates financial crimes in India, filed charges against Choksi and his associates last month.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 11:34AM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler loses another executive after Marchionne illness,"By Agnieszka Flak 
MILAN (Reuters) - New  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) boss Mike Manley was handed extra responsibilities for the carmaker's European business on Monday when a fellow executive quit after being passed over for the top job, adding to the challenges Manley faces.
Jeep division head Manley was named on Saturday to succeed Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, one of the auto industry's most tenacious and respected leaders, who fell seriously ill after suffering complications following surgery.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said on Monday that Alfredo Altavilla, head of its business in Europe, Middle East and Africa had resigned and those responsibilities would go to Manley on an interim basis.
Altavilla, who joined Fiat in 1990, had been a rival for the top job along with Manley and CFO Richard Palmer.
Marchionne had been due to step down next April as head of the world's seventh largest carmaker, so the market reaction to his sudden departure was relatively limited. The shares initially fell more than 5 percent, but then pared some losses and were down 1.7 percent by 1510 GMT.
""The downside may be modest, at least in the next 12 months. But long-term concerns will build – Marchionne ran FCA in a command and control style, with constant firefighting measures,"" said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton. 
FCA said British-born Manley would pursue the strategy that Marchionne outlined last month.
FCA has pledged to increase production of sport utility vehicles and invest in electric and hybrid cars to double operating profit by 2022. It also unveiled bold targets for Jeep, which has become FCA's ticket to creating a high-margin brand with global appeal.
The future appears less clear at  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), which Marchionne had been due to lead until 2021, having spun off the luxury carmaker more than two years ago. Ferrari shares lost almost 5 percent.
WORK TO DO
FCA's group executive council was meeting at FCA's Italian base in Turin on Monday, chaired for the first time by Manley. 
Analysts said choosing the 54-year-old Manley, under whose watch Jeep's sales surged fourfold, sent a clear message that FCA was staying on course and would keep the Jeep brand at the heart of its growth plan.
Under Manley, the company is expected to sharpen its focus on revamping individual brands, including ailing Fiat in Europe, Chrysler in the United States and Alfa Romeo, which has yet to turn a profit despite multibillion-euro investments.
Marchionne, widely credited with rescuing both Fiat and Chrysler from the brink of bankruptcy, had focused on fixing FCA's finances first, notably erasing all debt. 
He was a gift to investors, including Italy's Agnelli family, through 14 years of canny dealmaking, growing Fiat's value 11 times, helped by spinoffs of tractor maker  CNH Industrial  NV (MI:CNHI) and  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE). The Agnellis still have a controlling interest in all three companies.
But his track record at fixing some of FCA's brands was mixed, with investments and product launches repeatedly delayed.
Profitability in Europe is only gradually recovering, FCA has yet to make significant inroads in China, and the company relies on North America for three-fourths of profits just as that market is expected to come off its peaks.
QUESTIONS FOR FERRARI 
Marchionne had advocated industry mergers to share the cost of building electric, hybrid and self-driving cars, but gave up the quest when his preferred target, General Motors Co (N:GM), rejected his advances.
FCA said on Saturday that Manley would execute the new strategy to ensure a ""strong and independent"" future, but for some investors future M&A remained part of the investment case.
""Like for others in the auto sector, a tie-up seems ultimately inevitable for FCA,"" said Stefano Fabiani, a fund manager at Milan-based Zenit SGR.
""I believe there will be opportunities on a 18-24 months horizon which they won't be able to refuse, that's part of the reason I hold on to the stock,"" 
In the absence of a partner, Manley needs to show FCA can keep churning out profits on its own, even as emissions rules tighten, SUV competition intensifies and worries over potential U.S. emissions fines abound.
""FCA has a defined way forward, the management was chosen by Marchionne which reassures, and the choice to focus on Jeep is a winning bet, but I still plan to sell for now to lock in a profit as the sudden change creates uncertainty,"" said Umberto Borghesi, chief investment officer at London-based Albemarle Asset Management. ""We need to see if they can execute the plan.""
The script is less well defined for new Ferrari CEO Louis Camilleri after his promotion. 
Ferrari announced some midterm targets this year - pledging to double core earnings and churn out hybrids and an SUV - but a detailed strategy was due in September.
Camilleri ""inherits an absurd valuation, a product plan that's far from settled internally and 2021 financial targets that Sergio scribbled on a napkin and that may be difficult to deliver,"" Bernstein's Warburton added. 
Marchionne made some bold choices in recent years, notably raising production beyond a self-imposed cap, but was always careful to not dilute the brand's exclusivity. 
Analysts questioned whether Camilleri would be able to do the same and grow Ferrari beyond what it is today while keeping dealers, racing fans, owners and collectors on board.

""(Ferrari) will always be like a fine race car. Marchionne increasingly had it tuned to perfection,"" said George Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI. ""It has to be seen if it can remain so without him.""

773,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Foreign investment in UK edges up in first full year after Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - The value of foreign direct investment in Britain grew at its weakest pace in eight years but still inched up in 2017, the first full year after voters in the country decided to leave the European Union, official data showed on Monday.
Long-term investment in Britain by foreign businesses and residents stood at 1.564 trillion pounds ($2.06 trillion), 12 billion pounds or 0.8 percent higher than in 2016, the Office for National Statistics said.
That was the weakest growth rate since the global recession of 2009, and much smaller than the almost 15 percent jump in 2016 that was boosted by handful of major takeover deals. 
Nonetheless, last year's rise was not far off the increases seen in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the ONS said.
Uncertainty about Britain's planned departure from the EU in March next year has led to a slowdown in growth in investment by companies in the country, according to the Bank of England.
But the fall in the value of the pound after the referendum in 2016 has made companies in the country more attractive to foreign investors.
The ONS also said British companies and investors saw the first net increase in their foreign direct investment since 2011 last year, reflecting an increase in oil and commodity prices and a pick-up in the global economy. 
Flows of investment income in and out of Britain are a major component of the country's current account balance. The balance of payments deficit narrowed last year but remains a potential risk to the economy.

774,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Eskom Irregular Spend Tops $1.5 Billion as Loss Posted,"(Bloomberg) -- Irregular spending at Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. swelled to 19.6 billion rand ($1.5 billion) as South Africa’s state-owned power utility comes under pressure to restore its credibility and improve its finances.
Irregular expenditure, or spending incurred in contravention of or not according to applicable laws, “has increased significantly as a result of the cleaning-up exercise” at the electricity producer that generates about 90 percent of South Africa’s power, it said in a report released Monday. The company and its auditors, SizweNtsalubaGobodo Inc., reviewed all open contracts from April 1, 2015, for compliance with the country’s Public Finance Management Act, Eskom said.
The business that’s facing declining demand for power amid tepid economic growth has been at the center of scandals involving the financing of transactions and awarding of contracts to firms linked to the Gupta family. They are alleged to have used their connections with former President Jacob Zuma to their benefit. Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing.
“The damage wasn’t done overnight, so cannot be fixed overnight,” Chairman Jabu Mabuza, who was appointed in January, told reporters in Johannesburg. “We will have to take short-term pain.”
Eskom reported a loss after tax of 2.3 billion rand for the year ended March 31 from a profit of 0.9 billion rand 12 months earlier. Sales declined 0.9 percent, while its gearing ratio, which measures debt relative to equity, went to 72 percent from 68 percent, it said.
“Eskom continues to face significant financial and liquidity challenges,” the company said. This is due to the “high debt burden, low sales growth and increased finance costs. The auditors raised uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
Chief Executive Officer Phakamani Hadebe, who started earlier this year, has pledged to improve governance as the first step in stabilizing the business. The company has opened 11 criminal cases, five of which involve nine senior executives, he said.
Eskom will reduce non-essential positions among its workforce of 48,628 people, and sees the optimum group-staffing level at about 33,249 positions, which means it’s about one-third overstaffed, according to its annual report.
Pay negotiations with labor that started two months ago resulted in protests and power cuts after the utility said it couldn’t offer an increase to workers. Eskom backed down and has most recently tabled a three-year deal with raises of about 7 percent annually, compared with the current inflation rate of 4.6 percent.
Eskom depends on government support to service its 368 billion rand of debt. It has raised 22 percent of the funds it requires this year, the company said.
“Ultimately we have to decide about the future of Eskom,” Hadebe said. “We need to review the business model and see whether this remains relevant. We need new growth markets and products for us to grow this business as we move forward. ”

777,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Halliburton revenue beats on strong North American activity,"By Liz Hampton and John Benny
(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) on Monday reported a 24 percent increase in quarterly revenue, narrowly beating analysts' estimates, as higher oil prices sparked a surge in U.S. crude production activity. 
Halliburton has benefited from soaring U.S. oil production, which reached a record 11 million barrels per day in July, according to a government estimate. The spike in production is driving up demand for oilfield equipment and services, especially in the Permian Basin, where Halliburton has a heavy hydraulic fracturing presence. 
Halliburton reported revenue of $6.15 billion for the second quarter, up from $4.96 billion a year ago and surpassing analysts' estimates of $6.11 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Rivals Schlumberger (N:SLB) and GE's  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE) on Friday missed quarterly revenue forecasts but delivered an upbeat outlook for the second half of the year.
Shares of Halliburton were off about 1.3 percent in premarket trading as profit matched Street estimates and on a lack of commentary on logistical bottlenecks in the Permian basin, which is at the center of the U.S. shale boom.
Societe General analyst Edward Muztafago said Halliburton's second quarter was less about the earnings number and more about worries around transportation constraints in the Permian Basin.
The company's stock price has declined about 20 percent since mid-May on concerns that pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin will slow production growth.
Analysts at investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co on Monday said the results were in line with expectations and unlikely to jump-start the stock.
Halliburton's North America revenue rose 38.4 percent to $3.83 billion, while revenue from its international business increased 6 percent to $2.31 billion.
Margins in U.S. onshore operations are closing in on what the company achieved during the previous peak in 2014, Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller said in a statement.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 58 cents per share, in line with Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net profit attributable to Halliburton rose to $511 million, or 58 cents per share, in the quarter, from $28 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier.
The company took a charge of $262 million in the year-ago quarter.

The company also declared a dividend of one right for each outstanding common share. The rights plan expires on July 22, 2019 and the record date for dividend distribution is Aug. 2, the company said in a statement.
The pizza chain's former chief executive and founder, John Schnatter and his affiliates and associates who currently beneficially own common shares in excess of 30 percent have been grandfathered under the Rights Plan, the company said. 
The rights plan intends to protect the interests of the company and its stockholders by reducing the likelihood of gaining control of the company through open market accumulation or other tactics without paying an appropriate control premium, Papa John's said.

Schnatter, who founded the company in 1984, resigned after Forbes reported that he used a racial slur on a conference call.

781,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Further FAANG Disappointments Could Be Detrimental: Taking Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- The last five days have provided plenty of fodder for the bulls, as my colleague on the Markets Live blog Andrew Cinko pointed out on a post titled ""What We Learned This Week Is Stocks Are Still in a Bull Market.""
It’s early, but the consistency of earnings beats have been nothing short of spectacular -- as of last week, 95% of the 86 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results topped EPS expectations -- JPM points out that out of the results so far, the stock reaction to the beats is the best in two years while we’re also seeing the second best quarterly guidance outlook in five years (67% of companies have revised earnings forecasts higher).
Not to mention the relative strength in the financials (BKX banks index finished the week up 2.3% vs a flat S&P 500) and the fact that the cash index keeps holding its ground at the 2,800 mark, which has served as resistance for months -- so far the futures are off lows and pointing to an open just a few handles below 2,800.
But the resistance-becomes-support theory could start to look even clearer if the market continues to zone in on earnings, guidance and long-term fundamentals and shrug off the most recent bout of trade discord (Trump’s $500b tariff threat), geopolitical browbeating (Trump’s fuming all-caps tweet against Iran’s Rouhani) and the jitters over a currency war breaking out (Mnuchin attempted to assuage those concerns over the weekend). If the earnings continue to come in anywhere close to what we’ve seen so far -- and no major bellwether utters the words ""high-water mark"" or ""peak cycle"" -- and the more macro noise gets drowned out, then the stage would likely be set for a prolonged rally that would ultimately test January’s closing record of 2,873.
Further FAANG Disappointments Could Hurt
But one area where I think the market needs cooperation from, in this scenario, is the momentum trade. I’m not so sure the tape can withstand further disappointments in the FAANG complex (key metrics underwhelming sell-side models and buy-side whispers, worrisome capex commentary, etc.) after what we just saw happen to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares, which dropped almost 10% since last Monday’s results to notch its worst week in over two years.
This is partly because these long trades are crowded by so many hedge funds, partly because the sell-side is beyond one-sided in their recommendations for the group -- the FAANG stocks collectively have 182 buy ratings versus 7 sells -- and partly because the topic of FAANG frothiness has been brought up more and more lately.
If any of the three FAANGs due to report this week (Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tonight, see our preview; Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Wednesday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Thursday) react poorly after their results, or if Netflix starts to really spiral downward, or if other momentum names begin to show weakness (like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) -3.7% pre-market after this Wall Street Journal article over the weekend: ""Tesla Asks Suppliers for Cash Back to Help Turn a Profit""), then that frothiness could quickly turn to a pain that has the potential to kneecap the odds of a continuation rally in the broader market.

Notes From the Sell Side
Tons of initiations out on recent IPOs, including BJ’s Wholesale (BJ) with more buys than holds so far and BrightView Holdings (BV) with nothing but buys from the seven analysts who launched coverage..
Goldman strategist David Kostin has a note out on potential impact from tariffs: ""A 10% tariff on all imports from China would lower our 2019 S&P 500 EPS estimate by 3% to $165. If tensions spread and a 10% tariff were implemented on all US imports (highest rate since 1940s) our EPS estimate would fall by 15% to $145"".
Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, who has advised investors to get more defensive recently, says he sees negative signals developing (consumer confidence, business confiditions, corporate margins, PMIs) that ""make us think the path of least resistance is lower for US equities"".
Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas says Waymo launching its fully public commercial service later this year will drive GOOGL towards the $1 trillion bull case.. BTIG’s Richard Greenfield initiates SPOT with a buy rating and Street-high price target of $230, calling it a ""must-own stock"" that will be a long-term winner in a category (subscription music) that remains in its infancy..
Needham boosts ROKU price target to a Street-high $60 on earnings upside and the potential for the company to be bought (""we expect companies that could have bought NFLX at less than $10B will not want to make that same mistake again"").
Several positive notes out on DATA this morning, including Needham, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman, with the latter tagging the stock with a Street-high price target of $130 as demand remains strong and ""still some stickiness in negotiating large subscription contracts"".

Blackstone is making its biggest bet since the financial crisis with the $20 billion deal which pits co-founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Much like Thomson Reuters, Blackstone's portfolio company Ipreo, which it agreed to sell to IHS Markit (O:INFO) in May,provides information and related services to financial market professionals, the Commission said.
The EU enforcer said it did not see any competition concerns despite the overlaps between the two companies.
""The proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns given the limited market shares of the companies, the fact that a number of competitors will remain in the market post-transaction, and the fact that Blackstone accounts for only a minimal share of the demand for Thomson Reuters F&R's products,"" it said.

Thomson Reuters declined to comment on the Commission's decision.

785,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Magna-BAIC deal raises prospects for an 'automotive Foxconn' in China,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - In China, where the future of the car is looking more and more electric, newcomers to the auto industry are looking for partners to help them build their vehicles.
Enter Canadian auto supplier Magna International (TO:MG) which aims to spearhead a shift to contract vehicle manufacturing through its new partnership with state-owned Chinese carmaker BAIC Group [BEJINS.UL].
According to five people familiar with the matter, their joint venture is likely to build vehicles for ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and possibly Chinese electric car startup Singulato Motors, in addition to BAIC's electric unit BJEV. The venture has yet to disclose talks with Didi and Singulato.
The Magna-BAIC deal, announced in June, realises a long-held dream of Magna Steyr, the supplier's Austrian unit and the world's biggest player in the still niche business of contract car assembly, to expand beyond Europe.
It could also portend the rise of an 'automotive Foxconn' for electric cars - an idea discussed by industry executives for years. Given EVs' low volumes compared to traditional models, it makes sense for some firms to outsource assembly in the same way Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and other tech companies do with Taiwan's Foxconn, formally known as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317).
The time is ripe for such a development in China, some experts say. Beijing's use of industry quotas and other policies to make the world's biggest auto market as electric as possible has given rise to at least 50 Chinese EV startups, many of which will need a helping hand.
Magna is well placed to take on the challenge, already producing cars for Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar in Europe, including the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace SUV. The venture with BAIC will co-opt a BAIC plant in Zhenjiang in the eastern province of Jiangsu which has an annual production capacity of 180,000 vehicles.
""This is exactly what some people think companies like Tesla should have done — let experienced companies like Magna do the manufacturing for them,"" said James Chao, Shanghai-based chief analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.
""They would allow them to ramp up much more quickly, without production hiccups.""
Magna officials say the China joint venture's primary objective is to help develop vehicle technologies for BJEV. It is also expected to produce cars for BJEV's Arcfox brand that aims to compete with Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), according to BAIC.
But it could offer the same services to external companies or make ""already developed products"" with different platforms from the one the joint venture would help develop for BJEV, said Klaus Drobnak, head of Magna Steyr's Asia operations.
Asked how quickly and big contract manufacturing would grow in China, Drobnak, who is based at Magna Steyr's headquarters in Graz, Austria, said he wasn't sure at this early stage. ""But we are trying to spearhead such a development,"" he said.
BAIC spokesman Lian Qingfeng said there are some auto companies in China who need a premium manufacturing service and that ""any of them could be the potential customer of the new JV."" 
DIDI'S AMBITIONS
Didi will most likely be one of Magna's first clients in China given its deal with BAIC this year to work together on customised vehicle design, according to three of the people. All sources declined to identified as they were not authorised to speak to media on the matter.
The firm, which dominates China's ride-hailing market and which sources have said was valued at $56 billion in 2017, wants its own fleet, tailored for ride-hailing and car-sharing. The cars are set to emphasise passenger comfort but may not have features such as the high performance engines found in mainstream models as they will not need to go that fast.
Its plans come amid increased restrictions on car ownership in cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou to ease congestion and combat pollution - changes expected to spur more use of ride-hailing and car-sharing, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.
Didi's first-generation car, dubbed the D1 internally, is slated to be deployed by 2020, people familiar with the plans said. Its D2 and D3 models are also being worked on, although they are still in the early planning stages.
Didi declined to comment on specific plans, saying only that BAIC was a valued partner.
For both companies, partnering makes sense as they seek to manage the very expensive costs involved in electric car technologies.
""We pay half and half for R&D and manufacturing costs and we would share revenues. We save a ton of money,"" said one of the people.
Singulato, backed by domestic investors and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) which has a small stake, also has a pre-existing partnership with BAIC. That deal includes the development of 'intelligent vehicles' and sharing manufacturing resources.
It needs a contract manufacturer's help rather urgently because it has not yet received a car assembly license from regulators, even though it plans to begin producing and selling its first model, an SUV called the iS6, by the end of this year.
Two sources said the Magna-BAIC plant, which needs to be modified and re-tooled in line with Magna's production system, may not be able to help Singulato immediately. In that case, the iS6 would likely be first made by BAIC with the joint venture possibly taking over later, they said.
""Even if Magna in the end were not able to help Singulato initially, it's great for BAIC to have access to Magna's engineering, manufacturing and quality-control know-how,"" said one of the people.

Atos will pay $41 per share, a premium of 4.78 percent to Syntel's closing price of $39.13 on Friday. Including net debt, the transaction is valued at about $3.57 billion.
Atos said it expects the deal to provide double digit earnings per share (EPS) growth from 2019, with Syntel bringing the group around $1 billion in revenue and an operating margin of around 24 percent.
Analysts at Invest Securities said the price was ""not excessive"", but a Paris-based trader pointed to the funding of the deal as a cause for concern.
""They are financing it through debt, which is becoming a source of concern among investors with rising interest rates and a high level of debt among companies,"" he said.
Analysts and traders also pointed to the company's first half results as a source of concern.
""Atos’ H1 release suggests to us a deteriorating underlying picture, particularly in North America, against hopes that by this time its organic growth trajectory should have been improving,"" said Ameet Patel, Senior Analyst for  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets.

Atos' payments division Worldline (PA:WLN) on Monday reported half-yearly organic revenue growth of 5.8 percent and announced a deal to process payments for Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), sending its shares up over 4 percent.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China Huarong trying to recall some loans as cash crunch bites - sources,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's biggest manager of bad debts is trying to exit early from at least three loans and investments as it wrestles with a liquidity crunch triggered by an anti-corruption probe into its chairman, people with knowledge of the matter said.
 China Huarong Asset Management  (HK:2799), one of four state-backed so-called ""bad banks"" formed in 1999, has been trying to raise cash since Lai Xiaomin resigned as chairman in April amid a graft probe, the sources said.
Huarong's attempts to call back loans shows the extent of its liquidity woes. It has already begun divesting equity stakes that were bought as part of a diversification push and has also forced employees to take pay cuts.
Huarong did not respond to calls, emails and faxed requests for comment.
The asset manager is the latest major Chinese company to struggle in the wake of allegations of misconduct by its leader. Others include CEFC China Energy and Anbang Insurance, both of which are now undergoing government restructuring.
The exact nature of the allegations against Lai remain unknown, but sources with knowledge of the matter said the investigation had slowed down operations at China's largest asset management firm and forced it to be cautious about taking on new business.
When a firm comes under investigation, ""it's possible that the efficiency of business will fall, which leads to a liquidity squeeze,"" said Meng Shen, director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank.
Shortly after the investigation became public, Huarong asked one fund to return millions of dollars it invested only a few months earlier, citing liquidity issues, one person with knowledge of the matter said. The fund is trying to negotiate early payment of management fees in return for the early termination, the source said.
And a multi-year loan of just under 2 billion yuan ($296 million) to a medium-sized developer made by Huarong via a Shanghai branch of a trust firm this year is another deal the bad debt manager is trying to exit, said a second person with direct knowledge. 
Huarong has approached the developer directly and is currently trying to negotiate an early exit, citing liquidity issues, said the person. Since the investigation, the trust firm, which usually receives regular business from Huarong, has received no new deals from the asset manager, he added.
In another instance, Huarong has been trying to offload some loans in Hong Kong, including its portion in a two-year HK$5.81 billion syndicated loan to Huge Group Holdings Limited, a major shareholder of China Grand Auto's (SS:600297), again citing liquidity concerns, said two separate people with direct knowledge who have been approached as buyers. 
The loan was drawn down in August last year, the people added. 
Two other people have also been informed of Huarong's liquidity concerns. 
Huge Group did not respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
PROBES
The investigation by China's anti-corruption watchdog into Huarong's ex-chairman Lai is expected to finish this month, two people said. Senior bank regulatory official Wang Zhanfeng was confirmed as Huarong's new chairman last month.
At least two Huarong units in Hong Kong are seeking to reduce staff costs by cutting some employees' pay by between 20 percent and 65 percent and not paying bonuses, said two people.
And many mainland employees have been asked to take an 18 to 20 percent pay hit and what was a monthly bonus will become a quarterly one, said two other people with knowledge of the issue. 
In June, Huarong said it would refocus on its core bad-debt business in a shift after years of overseas acquisitions ranging from a Hong Kong broker to a Chicago hotel.
Divestments have already begun. In May, Chinese firm Northeast Pharmaceutical Group (SZ:000597) said that Huarong planned to unload a stake of up to 6 percent in the firm within six months.

Earlier this month, Chinese media reported that Huarong had sold a 36.2 per cent stake in a unit of CEFC China Energy which it had bought only in March.

794,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 04:22AM ET</span>",Bond yields rise on BoJ easing talk while stocks slide,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Signs that the Bank of Japan could scale back its monetary stimulus faster than expected sent tremors through bond markets on Monday, while European stocks slid as threats of further U.S. tariffs on China drained risk appetite.
Europe's bond yields climbed after a Reuters report that the BoJ was discussing modifying its huge easing program sent Japan's 10-year bond yield to a six-month high.
The report rekindled anxieties about global monetary policy easing and piled further pressure on investors already struggling to navigate rising protectionism and tense geopolitics.
The yield on Europe's benchmark bond, the German 10-year Bund, hit a one-month high of 0.39 percent while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also hit their highest in a month at 2.90 percent.
The yen climbed to two-week highs against the dollar  and was last up 0.4 percent at 110.98 per dollar.
""It's all that concern investors have about the move from global quantitative easing to global quantitative tightening. That fear gets stoked when you have reports such as this,"" said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management. 
""The ECB meeting this week will be more in focus now that we've had this concern about Japan."" 
(Graphic: Japanese bond yields jump to six-month high https://reut.rs/2LgVPjJ)
The dollar index (DXY) meanwhile languished at two-week lows after U.S. President Trump criticized the Federal Reserve's tightening policy and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies.
""We see the latest news on trade policy as pointing to continued high risk of escalation between the U.S. and China, and a renewed focus of the Trump Administration on currency matters,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts. 
Trump's comments against Fed rate hikes also helped steepen the Treasury yield curve .
Trump's new threats to slap duties on all U.S. imports from China triggered sell-offs across stock markets, though good corporate earnings kept a lid on losses.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.1 percent and the MSCI all-country world index declined just 0.02 percent.
Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.3 percent as investors braced for a packed week of corporate earnings in Europe and a meeting between European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker and Trump to discuss threatened auto tariffs which could damage carmakers. 
Goldman Sachs analysts said auto tariffs, if they came to pass, would likely cause weakness in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, possibly also affecting the euro, pound, yen, and Korean won as investors priced in a hit to the economy.
""The global economy is still OK, but the risk is now very high, and if trade policies don't make a U-turn very soon, we'll see a measurable impact on growth already next year,"" said UniCredit chief economist Erik Nielsen. 
The euro (EUR=), which has been gaining from dollar weakness, climbed for a third straight day to a two-week top of $1.1750. It was last up 0.2 percent at $1.135.
Concerns about fuel demand dented oil prices after finance ministers and central bank governors at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires said the risks to global economic growth have increased due to trade and geopolitical tensions.
U.S. crude  fell slightly to $68.24 a barrel after posting its third straight weekly loss. Brent crude (LCOc1) rose 16 cents to $73.23.
Copper, among the most sensitive to trade tensions, hovered above a one-year low hit last week, trading at $6,151 a ton. Copper fell for the sixth week in a row last week. Gold prices declined 0.1 percent to $1,30.76 an ounce .

798,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2018 03:00AM ET</span>",China regulator says stock index futures 'back to normal' soon: sources,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - A top Chinese securities regulator said on Monday that trading in stock index futures will soon be ""back to normal,"" two sources said, suggesting the government is about to lift the draconian restrictions on such derivatives it imposed during China's 2015 market crash.
Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), made the remarks during an internal training meeting with futures brokerage executives, the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter, told Reuters.
The sources said Fang did not define ""normal status"", but the easing gesture, made after China's stock market has fallen about 14 percent this year amid a nascent trade war with the United States, points to regulators softening their approach.
The CSRC did not immediately respond to Reuters emailed request for comment.
China imposed draconian restrictions on stock index trading during the stock market crash in the summer of 2015, sharply raising margin requirements and tightening position limits.
The CSRC also blamed foreign and domestic short-sellers for worsening a crisis that sent shockwaves across global financial markets.
But there were fewer signs of direct government intervention during last month's panic selling, driven by the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on some Chinese exports and threats to impose more.
China granted global hedge fund managers Bridgewater Associates LP and Winton Group licenses to launch products in China, a move seen as underscoring Beijing's commitment to financial deregulation [L4N1TZ3CE].Although China has been gradually loosening its restrictions on index futures trading, investors have complained current rules are still too rigid.
The inclusion of Chinese stocks into MSCI's emerging market benchmark has increased the urgency of further deregulating the derivative market, because foreign investors have long complained over the lack of hedging tools in China.

On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies.  
""China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower,"" Trump said in a tweet over the weekend. That, coupled with U.S. interest rate hikes, was weakening U.S.’s economy as the dollar strengthened, Trump claimed. 
In a separate tweet, Trump added that ""[t]ightening now hurts all that we have done."" That came after the president told CNBC in an interview that he was ""not thrilled"" about the central bank hiking interest rates. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin clarified at the G-20 meeting over the weekend that Trump didn’t intend to interfere with the Fed’s decision. “The administration completely supports the Fed's independence. Where the Fed ends up on interest rates is one, completely up to them, and [two], is also dependent upon what happens to the economy.” 
Meanwhile, G20 warned after a meeting on Sunday that recent trade and geopolitical tensions could harm global growth.
""Global economic growth remains robust and unemployment is at a decade low,"" the finance leaders said in a statement. ""However, growth has been less synchronized recently, and downside risks over the short and medium term have increased,” G20 finance ministers and central bank governors said in a statement following a meeting held in Buenos Aires over the weekend.

804,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 22, 2018 09:57PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Slip; Nikkei Underperforms as Yen Strengthens After Trump’s Comments,"Investing.com – Asian stocks slipped in morning trade on Monday, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 underperformed its regional peers with a stronger yen being cited as the catalyst for the selling in equities.
On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies.
""China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower,"" Trump said in a tweet over the weekend. That, coupled with U.S. interest rate hikes, was weakening U.S.’s economy as the dollar strengthened, Trump claimed.
His comments on currency came after he told CNBC in an interview that he was prepared to impose tariffs on all Chinese goods to the U.S.
""I'm ready to go to 500,"" said Trump, referring to the $505.5 billion in goods from China the U.S. imported in 2017.
The U.S. and China exchanged new tariffs on $34 billion worth of goods on each other earlier this month. The Trump administration has also announced a list of proposed duties on $200 billion in Chinese imports, although those tariffs have not yet kicked in.
In Asia, Japanese stocks were under pressure by strength in the yen as the dollar weakened following events over the weekend. The Nikkei 225 was down 1.2% by 9:55PM ET (01:55 GMT).
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both slipped 0.1%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also fell 0.2%.
South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.7%. Index heavyweight Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) declined almost 2%, although the losses were partially offset by gains in automakers.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.8%.
Looking ahead, Australia CPI and South Korea’s GDP are both due later this week."

BHP said it would defend the claim lodged in Victoria state. It did not specify who had filed the class action, which relates to a 2015 dam burst that killed 19 people.
Samarco and its parent companies Vale SA and BHP signed a deal with Brazilian authorities in June to settle a 20 billion reais ($5.30 billion) lawsuit related to the failure.
The miner also agreed to fund a total of $211 million in financial support for the Renova Foundation, created to help victims of the Samarco dam disaster in Brazil.
Last week, BHP said it expected to record a charge of $650 million in its fiscal 2018 results on account of the failure. The charge was at the lower end of expectations according to analysts.

The company said in a statement on Saturday that it has not received any complaints of illness, and that it issued the recall as a precautionary measure. 
The concern is over the ingredient whey powder, which one of Mondelez's suppliers has recalled due to ""the potential presence of Salmonella,"" according to Mondelez. 
Salmonella is a microorganism that can cause people to experience fevers, nausea and gastro-intestinal problems, which can be serious in children and others with weakened immune systems, the company said. 

The recall extends to more than a dozen types of Ritz cracker sandwich and Ritz Bits products sold in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

A Fiat Chrysler spokesman confirmed Marchionne was in Zurich's University Hospital, one of the country's largest medical centers.
The spokesman did not give the 66-year-old Italian-Canadian executive's condition or say in which of the hospital's 43 divisions he was being treated.
Fiat Chrysler named its Jeep division boss Mike Manley on Saturday to take over immediately from Marchionne, who had been due to step down next April.
SGS, the Swiss logistics services company, also announced on Sunday that it had named a new acting chairman to take over for Marchionne, since his illness prevented him from fulfilling the role's obligations.
SGS said in a statement it was ""deeply saddened"" by the news, as did Lausanne, Switzerland-based Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), where Marchionne is also on the board.
Marchionne was credited with rescuing Fiat and Chrysler from bankruptcy after taking the Italian carmaker's wheel in 2004. On Saturday he was also replaced as chairman and CEO of Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and chairman of tractor maker CNH Industrial - both spun off from FCA in recent years.

In additional management changes linked to Marchionne's illness, Ferrari named FCA Chairman and Agnelli family scion John Elkann as new chairman, while board member Louis Camilleri becomes chief executive.

Carmakers are rushing to get models through a new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) tests on a limited number of exhaust emission test benches as they won't be able to sell new vehicles after Sept. 1
Volkswagen (VW) acknowledged in June a potential delay in up to 250,000 vehicles worldwide triggered by the stricter anti-pollution test procedures and plans to throttle back production of some models at various plants due to testing bottlenecks.
VW has rented some multi-storey car parks and open parking lots to park the vehicles it cannot yet deliver, the spokeswoman said. 
The timing of when it will have to stockpile inventory depends on the plant where vehicles are built, she added.
One option is to use Berlin's long-delayed international airport, Berlin-Brandenburg, although a decision has not yet been made, she said.
VW said in June it would shut its main Wolfsburg factory for 1-2 days a week between August and the end of September. It will also close its Zwickau factory on some days and components manufacturing will face resulting delays.
The group's plant in Emden will be closed on some days in the third and fourth quarter due to lackluster demand for mid-sized cars.

German newswire DPA first reported on Sunday that VW would temporarily park vehicles from August.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2018 07:24PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler names Jeep boss to replace stricken CEO Marchionne,"By Agnieszka Flak and Laurence Frost
MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) named on Saturday its Jeep division boss Mike Manley to take over immediately from Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, who is seriously ill after suffering major complications following surgery.
The carmaker said British-born Manley, who also takes responsibility for the North America region, will push ahead with the mid-term strategy outlined last month by Marchionne, who had been due to step down next April.
Marchionne, 66, was credited with rescuing Fiat and Chrysler from bankruptcy after taking the Italian carmaker's wheel in 2004. On Saturday he was also replaced as chairman and CEO of  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) and chairman of tractor maker  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) - both spun off from FCA in recent years.
""FCA communicates with profound sorrow that during the course of this week unexpected complications arose while Mr Marchionne was recovering from surgery and that these have worsened significantly in recent hours,"" the statement said.
FCA disclosed earlier this month that Marchionne, a renowned dealmaker and workaholic, was recovering from a shoulder operation. But his condition deteriorated sharply in recent days when he suffered massive complications that were not divulged.
Ferrari named FCA Chairman and Agnelli family scion John Elkann as new chairman, while board member Louis Camilleri becomes chief executive. CNH appointed Suzanna Heywood to replace Marchionne as chairman. All three companies remain controlled by the Agnellis.
Marchionne had previously said he planned to stay on as Ferrari Chairman and CEO until 2021.
DEAL FOCUS
One of the auto industry's longest-serving CEOs, Marchionne has advocated tie-ups to share the growing cost burden of developing cleaner, electrified and autonomous vehicles.
He resisted the comparatively easy option of selling off coveted brands such as Jeep, saying that would leave too big a problem with Fiat as ""the stump that is left behind"".
But after being rejected by his preferred partner General Motors (N:GM), he turned back to the task of cutting FCA's debt - a goal he achieved last month - while maintaining that a merger for FCA was ""ultimately inevitable"".
Investor hopes for a transformative deal had largely dwindled and are unlikely to hit the shares on Marchionne's departure, according to Evercore analyst George Galliers.
""The valuation doesn’t suggest expectations of a buyout are high,"" Galliers said.
Even without Marchionne, FCA will remain ""culturally more open to dealmaking and savvy to potential capital market opportunities than much of the competition"", he added.
""A lot of that's now ingrained, so I don't think you lose everything he's brought to the company overnight.""
Yet, Manley will have a tough act to follow. 
Marchionne resurrected one of Italy's biggest corporate names and revitalized Chrysler, succeeding where the U.S. company's two previous owners - Mercedes parent  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and private equity group Carberus - both failed.
He has multiplied Fiat's value 11 times since taking charge, helped by moves such as the spinoffs of CNH Industrial and Ferrari. The planned separation of parts maker Magneti Marelli, due this year, should further increase that value-generation. 
He also flattened an inflexible hierarchy, replacing layers of middle management with a meritocratic leadership style. He slashed costs by reducing the number of vehicle architectures and creating joint ventures to pool development and plant costs.
A tough negotiator known for getting his way, in 2005 Marchionne forced GM to pay Fiat $2 billion not to exercise an option to sell its auto division to the U.S. carmaker - a history that may not have helped his later merger overtures.
Marchionne's track record with operational turnarounds was a little more patchy than his dealmaking.
Profitability in Europe is only now gradually recovering, FCA has yet to make any significant inroads in China and Alfa Romeo has yet to turn a profit. 
In North America, however, Marchionne was quick to end production of unprofitable sedans and retool plants to build pricier SUVs and trucks, a move since emulated by Ford and GM.
But for fund managers like Umberto Borghesi who were still hoping Marchionne would bring in another big deal before signing off, the FCA investment case may just have changed. 
""The day he leaves, this company will lose its appeal,"" Borghesi, who is chief investment officer at London-based Albemarle Asset Management, said earlier this year.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 09:40PM ET</span>","Amazon, Toyota, Alcoa and others working to counter Trump's tariff plans","By Jeffrey Dastin and David Shepardson
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big companies in the United States from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and  Alcoa  Corp (N:AA) are working to counter the effect of the Trump administration's trade policies and to head off new tariffs.
Companies are attempting to avoid any confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump but want to exert as much influence as they can to dissuade him from tearing up trade agreements or introducing tariffs on a wide swath of imports.
Amazon, the world's largest online retailer and cloud-computing company, which could be hurt by tariffs on items sold through its website and components for its data centers, is discussing industry-wide advertising campaigns and more extensive government lobbying, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
Amazon declined to comment. 
Toyota Motor North America, a subsidiary of Japan's Toyota, which could suffer if Trump follows through on a plan to impose tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, flew workers to Washington for a rally this week in front of the U.S. Capitol while the unit's chief has met key members of Congress in recent weeks to discuss the potential impact of tariffs.
Executives from General Motors Co (N:GM), which could be hurt if Trump pulls the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement or if he imposes auto tariffs, have also held meetings with the administration and Congress over the last year to raise its concerns about trade issues. Tariffs would lead to ""a reduced presence at home and abroad,"" the company said in June.
The largest U.S. automaker is set to hire Trump's former deputy director of the National Economic Council and adviser on international economic affairs. Everett Eissenstat, who left the White House earlier this month, will head GM's public policy efforts, according to sources familiar with the matter. GM told Reuters it had an opening but declined to confirm the hire. Eissenstat could not be reached for comment. 
Those already suffering from the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which went into effect in June, are also pushing for relief in private. 
The chief executive of Alcoa told investors on a conference call this week that the aluminum producer was in ""active discussions"" with the Trump administration, the Commerce Department and members of Congress about the elimination of tariffs or getting an exception for Canadian aluminum. 
Alcoa said this week it will incur as much as $14 million a month in extra expenses, mainly from tariffs levied on aluminum imported from Canada, its biggest supplier.
CLOUD PAIN 
In addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs already imposed, the Trump administration has threatened 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods which would affect thousands of imported products from furniture to network routers.
Seattle-based Amazon is concerned such tariffs would hit shoppers during the crucial holiday shopping season, the person familiar with the matter said. 
Amazon has identified a wide range of items, some of them high-value, the tariffs would hit and is assessing the potential impact on its business, the person said. 
High among its concerns is an increase in import costs for components used in data centers or other items that would make its cloud computing division less competitive, two people familiar with the matter said. Amazon Web Services is the company's most profitable unit. 
Amazon is not alone in the technology industry with its worries. ""It’s hard to think of many of our companies that don’t have some risk and exposure as a result of the tariff,"" said Dean Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, which counts Amazon rivals  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and others as members.
Lobbying administration officials and members of Congress can be costly with no guarantee of victory, but some have succeeded. 

Apple Inc (O:AAPL) won guarantees from the Trump administration that its lucrative iPhones would ship from China without being subject to tariffs, the New York Times reported last month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York will bring the biggest U.S. municipal bond deal to market amid an overall weak supply load next week, issuing nearly $1.2 billion of future sales and income tax-backed debt to help finance capital projects in the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
The New York City Transitional Finance Authority is set to issue $850 million of negotiated future tax-secured subordinate bonds and another $301 million of competitive taxable future tax-secured subordinate bonds in a three-part series. J.P. Morgan will act as the deal's underwriter.
The bonds earned a AAA rating from S&P Global Ratings and an A-one rating from Moody's Investors Service. 
The strong ratings are due in part to New York City's diverse and resilient economy, favorable bond provisions and a large population that supports the future sales and income taxes the bonds are secured by, S&P said. 
In another major New York-focused deal next week, the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York is set to issue $559.04 million in taxable Montefiore Obligated Group Revenue Bonds Series 2018A and 2018B. The bonds, from the Montefiore Medical Center, will be used for refinancing of certain existing debt and reimbursement purposes. 
Outside of a handful of large deals, which also includes the Idaho Health Facilities Authority's sale of $314.9 million of revenue bonds, the municipal market is poised to suffer through a sleepy week ahead. 
Next week will bring $5.31 billion in bond debt issuance, with $4.23 billion in tax exempt and $1.08 billion in taxables, and a sharp drop-off from the current week's $9.22 billion of scheduled deals.
Meanwhile, U.S. municipal bond funds have reported an inflow surge compared to last week. Those funds saw $1.3 billion of net inflows in the week ended July 18, the most in more than a year, and a surge from the $651 million recorded the previous week, according to data released by mutual fund tracker Lipper on Thursday. 
The four-week moving average remained positive at $535.4 million, said Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. High-yield muni bond funds reported inflows of $313.8 million, down from $313.9 million in the previous week.

841,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 05:09PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Buyout firm Apollo in advanced talks to buy LifePoint Health - sources,"By Joshua Franklin and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) is in advanced talks to acquire LifePoint Health Inc (O:LPNT), in its latest bid to consolidate the rural U.S. hospital sector, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The deal could value LifePoint at close to $6 billion, including debt, the sources said. It would come as weak admission trends, pressures on Medicaid funding and increased efforts by private U.S. insurers to reduce healthcare costs are driving hospital operators to seek merger partners that will give them more scale to tackle these issues.
LifePoint shares rose 36 percent to $64.85 on the news in after-hours trading on Friday.
Apollo plans to merge LifePoint with another regional hospital operator that it owns, RegionalCare Hospital Partners, according to the sources. 
Apollo declined to comment, while LifePoint did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It would be by far the biggest acquisition for Apollo this year. LifePoint currently has a market capitalization of $1.9 billion and long-term net debt of $2.9 billion. 
If the negotiations are completed successfully, a deal could be announced as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning that it was possible talks could fail at the last minute. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Based in Brentwood, Tennessee, LifePoint operates hospitals in around 70 communities across 22 states, focusing largely on small towns and rural areas. 
Rural healthcare providers such as LifePoint have been challenged in recent years because their reliance on federal insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid has made them particularly vulnerable to changing reimbursement programs. In addition, hospital operating costs have been rising faster than reimbursement rate increases.
Nevertheless, LifePoint has been a relatively strong performer in the rural healthcare space, buying up underperforming facilities and streamlining operations through targeted investments, according to Morningstar Inc analysts.
LifePoint shares, however, have remained under pressure, losing around a quarter of their value in the past 12 months.
""LifePoint has a high level of committed capital expenditures, which will weaken free cash flow and interest coverage metrics over the next 12-18 months,"" Moody's Investors Service Inc analysts wrote in a research note in March. 
Many healthcare providers have been bulking up through mergers and acquisitions in recent years in an effort to weather the challenges facing the sector. 
Recent deals have included the sale of Davita Medical Group to health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) for $4.9 billion in 2017 and the sale of Envision Healthcare to private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) for $5.5 billion earlier this year. 
Apollo, which raised a $24.6 billion private equity fund last year, acquired RegionalCare in 2015, and merged it with another hospital operator, Capella Healthcare, in 2016.

843,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Banks Lead in Earnings; Netflix Plunges
Earnings season was in full flight for the week and the majority hit or beat Wall Street expectations.
The financial sector continued to perform well.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) led the broker-dealer reports and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also topped estimates, although concerns about its succession plan hit the stock later in the day.
And it was a tale of two techs as a momentum stock fell short of what investors wanted and an old stalwart came through.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock tumbled at the start of the week after the company missed expectations on new subscribers, a key metric for the streaming company. Netflix added 5.14 million subscribers in the latest quarter, shy of analysts’ expectations for more than 6.2 million.
But after the bell Thursday, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported second-quarter earnings that beat consensus thanks to cloud services revenue.
2. Fed’s Powell Sees Steady Rate Increases; Trump Not Thrilled
The prospect for the path of U.S. interest rates took an interesting turn at the end of the week. At first things seemed to jibe with market expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates once and possibly twice before the year is out.
At his Humphey-Hawkins testimony before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank should gradually increase interest rates.
But President Donald Trump shook some of the market’s confidence, saying on Thursday he’s “not thrilled” about the Fed hiking rates and going into more specifics on Twitter Friday.






The tweets had little overall impact on the market forecasts for upcoming rate hikes. But they did take the legs from the dollar on Friday. The U.S. Treasury Department has long had a policy of simply stating that a strong dollar is in America’s best interest.
3. Buffett Buyback Bonanza in the Offing?
Big names can still move the market. Warren Buffett showed that when Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) led the financial stocks higher on Wednesday after saying that the Oracle of Omaha (and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger) would have fewer restrictions on stock buybacks.
Buffett and Munger will now be able to buy back shares when they feel those shares are below “intrinsic value.”
Under its previous buyback policy the company only repurchased shares when they were below 1.2x book value.
That led to some speculation that a big buyback could be coming after Berkshire reports earnings Aug. 3. The company hasn’t bought back stock since 2012.
4. Trump Threatens More Tariffs
Trade-war concerns took at back seat through most of the week, but were revived Friday and could weigh more heavily next week, despite another full earnings calendar.
President Trump said in an interview on CNBC that he is ready to impose tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods to the U.S. if China does not back down on its trade policies.
“I’m not doing this for politics, I’m doing this to do the right thing for our country” he said on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box."" “We have been ripped off by China for a long time.”
5. Oil Down for the Week, Again
Crude oil prices posted a second-straight weekly decline and may continue to weigh on energy stocks, as they have of late.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery rose $1.30 to settle at $70.46 a barrel Friday.
Investors continue to weigh up the prospect of a global shortage in supplies, despite Saudi Arabia's pledge to hold off flooding the market with more output.
Crude oil prices were supported Friday by the plunge in the dollar following Trump’s remark about the greenback and other currencies."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended slightly lower on Friday as escalating trade anxieties driven by U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff threats against China offset a string of robust earnings led by Microsoft.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its third consecutive weekly gain, while the S&P 500 also rose for a third straight week after eking out a gain for the period.
Shares of  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) hit a record high and ended the session up 1.8 percent on the heels of a strong second-quarter earnings beat. The company narrowed the race with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN) in the race to be worth $1 trillion in market value.
Microsoft's advance provided the biggest support to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Trump said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of Chinese imports, the latest salvo in a series of protectionist moves that have prompted retaliatory measures from U.S. trading partners around the world.
""I think there's a divided line on the Street,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. ""One side believes that (the trade dispute) is only going to lead to a global recession, where the other side believes that the president is trying to get the other side to negotiate."" 
Trump also repeated his criticism of planned interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, writing in a Twitter post that tightening U.S. monetary policy would diminish any U.S. trade advantage.
Long-dated U.S. government bond yields rose on worries that the president's comments would encourage Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to slow the pace of rate hikes by the U.S. central bank, which could increase inflationary pressure.
""The president can't control interest rates,"" Pavlik said. ""He's not a king. So I think the Street's reaction to that is a major overreaction."" 
As the second-quarter reporting season picks up steam, analyst forecasts have grown rosier. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are now estimated to have grown 22.0 percent in the quarter, compared with the 20.7 percent seen on July 1, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
So far, 87 companies of the S&P 500 have posted results, of which 83.9 percent have beat consensus estimates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 6.38 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,058.12, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 2.66 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,801.83 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 5.10 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,820.20.
Diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc's (N:HON) stock rose 3.8 percent after its earnings beat expectations and the company raised its profit forecast. 
 General Electric  Co (N:GE) dropped 4.4 percent, the biggest drag on the S&P 500, after the conglomerate reported a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit but trimmed its cash flow target.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 109 new highs and 38 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.00 billion shares, compared with the 6.42 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

847,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Extends Weekly Winning Streak Despite Trade-War Jitters,"Investing.com – Wall Street notched a third-straight weekly win despite closing flat Friday, as concerns about an escalating U.S.-China trade war offset optimism over solid quarterly earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.03%. The S&P 500 fell 0.09%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.07%.
U.S.-China trade war tensions returned to the fold after President Donald Trump said he was ""ready"" to slap $500 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods imported to the United States.
Fears over an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China were exacerbated as Trump took to Twitter, criticizing China, and other countries for ""manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower.""
Trump's rebuke of China came as the Far-East nation lowered its overnight its 7-day Treasury rate by 103 basis points, pushing the yuan to its lowest level in a year. Some cited the move as a countermeasure against U.S. tariffs.
That dampened the upbeat start to the session, which followed quarterly earnings results from Microsoft, Honeywell and General Electric that beat consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) stocks rose sharply, helping to steady the broader market. But GE's (NYSE:GE) cut of its free cash flow forecast for the year overshadowed its earnings and revenue beat, pressuring the stock more than 4% lower.
Financials also underpinned the broader market as a string of mostly better-than-expected results from major Wall Street banks kept demand elevated.
Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reported above-consensus earnings this week, adding to a bullish report from JPMorgan last week.
Energy, however, weighed on sentiment as energy stocks shrugged off the a rise in U.S. oil prices Friday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery rose $1.30 to settle at $70.46 a barrel. That, however, failed to prevent oil prices slipping to a second-straight weekly loss amid a slump earlier in the week.
On the currency front, the US Dollar Index Futures had its worst day in a month, supporting upside in the equities, as President Donald Trump slammed the Federal Reserve's monetary policy measures, arguing that higher interest rates were denting the United States' ""big competitive edge.""

GSK Chairman Philip Hampton has been in discussions with the group's biggest shareholders about the creation of a standalone pharma and vaccines company in the medium term, the FT reported, citing sources. The move could happen within two or three years, the report said. https://on.ft.com/2mwBuYT
One of the company's top ten shareholders, whom the FT did not name, acknowledged having conversations with the GSK chairman, adding that shareholders ""don't quite believe in the company.""
Some investors have long called for the group's break-up, arguing that it would crystallize value for component businesses and that there are limited synergies between consumer and pharma.
A GSK spokesman said the group's priority is to improve the performance of its pharmaceutical business, especially research and development. The company is set to outline its new approach for the division next week. 
The company's ""3 business structure"" offers stability to its earnings and helps in free cash flow generation, the spokesman said in a statement. 
""But as we have consistently said this is subject to each business continuing to perform competitively and having access to capital. We are pleased to have completed the buyout of the Consumer Healthcare business for which we see very good potential for growth and have set an increased margin target for that business to achieve by 2022,"" according to the statement.
In April, GSK said it was divesting its rare disease gene therapy drugs to private biotech company Orchard Therapeutics.

Last year, GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley had announced a wide-ranging overhaul designed to narrow the focus of drug research and improve returns in the core pharmaceuticals business.

854,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 03:47PM ET</span>",Wall Street braces for tariff fallout as S&P 500 companies report,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tariffs are starting to bite big manufacturers and Wall Street could get another bout of caution and uncertainty from major industrial companies when a swath of reports comes in over the next week. 
Investors are worried about the impact on earnings should the United States' trade war with China and other major trading partners escalate.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in June estimated that an escalation of the dispute to include $200 billion of imports would hit earnings growth by 1-1.5 percent. 
""If today's political rhetoric intensifies and translates into actual protectionist policies, it will be a negative for all businesses in the U.S. and abroad, including ours,"" Hamid Moghadam, chief executive of supply chain management company Prologis, warned on a conference call on Tuesday.
Manufacturers across the country are concerned about Washington's recent trade policies, with some saying that uncertainty related to tariffs was already hitting them, according to anecdotes collected by the U.S. Federal Reserve in its Beige Book, released on Wednesday.
That is starting to show up in early reports by companies. Earnings from Honeywell International (N:HON),  General Electric  (N:GE) and Stanley Black & Decker (N:SWK) show companies facing higher costs due to already enacted tariffs, and uncertainty about tariffs on as much as $500 billion in Chinese goods threatened by Trump. 
GE said it expects tariffs on its imports from China to raise its costs by up to $400 million and  Alcoa  (N:AA) said the tariffs led to an extra $15 million in costs. [
Second-quarter corporate earnings seasons kicks into gear starting on Monday, with results on tap from companies including Corning (N:GLW), Ford Motor (N:F), 3M Co (N:MMM) and Boeing (N:BA), which has fallen nearly 2 percent since the start of March. 
The United States in March said it would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, and on July 1, Washington and Beijing applied tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's goods. Trump has threatened additional tariffs, possibly targeting more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
Since March 1, S&P 500 industrials (SPLRCI) have fallen nearly 3 percent, reflecting the sector’s dependence on international commerce. The S&P 1500 steel index <.SPCOMSTEEL> has lost 1 percent since March 1, as investors worry that a slowdown in global demand could offset U.S. steelmakers’ benefits from tariffs against their foreign competitors.
Many of the roughly 180 S&P 500 companies reporting their results next week are not directly exposed to China, but they may still have reasons for concern. 
""There are companies that might not be significantly impacted by tariffs from a cost perspective, but from the uncertainty around it,"" said Kurt Brunner, a portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ""They could see customers holding off on spending because they don't know what is going to happen.""
Harley-Davidson (N:HOG), which said last month it would move some of its motorcycle production abroad as a result of the European Union's retaliatory tariffs, reports its results on Tuesday.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), reporting on July 25, depends on China for two thirds of its revenue. The U.S. chipmaker is also facing a drawn-out wait for Chinese regulators to approve its $44 billion takeover of  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI), a delay widely seen as connected to the trade conflict.
A strong U.S. economy and deep corporate tax cuts have fueled a 5 percent increase in the S&P 500 this year, even as Wall Street worries about the tariffs' impact. 
Super-charged by deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings are expected by analysts to grow 22 percent in the June quarter and 23.1 percent in the September quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Estimates for the September quarter are likely to change as companies provide their outlooks over the next few weeks.

""The market is looking through Trump's trade negotiations and governing style because of this strength. However, we are more cautious on the trade overhang and think headline risk, both to the upside and downside, will remain high,"" EventShare Chief Investment Officer Ben Phillips wrote in report on Thursday.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",'Coworking' surge in Manhattan raises asset-liability quandary,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The amount of office leasing by ""coworking"" firms in Manhattan is nearing 10 percent of all new leases, a sign of growing demand for short-term contracts by companies seeking workspace but a warning for a potential mismatch in assets and liabilities.
Coworking, in which tenants share workspaces, is driven by strong demand for knowledge-based workers in cities like New York, where May's unemployment rate in Manhattan was 3.1 percent - the second-lowest rate across New York state. Nationally, the current unemployment rate is 4 percent. 
Coworking's growth, however, raises the issue of liabilities that flexible office operators face as they dole out contracts as short as one month while assuming leases of 10 years or more.
Commercial real estate is being swept up by two key changes, said Woody Heller, executive managing director at brokerage  Savills  Studley, a U.S. unit of Savills Plc (L:SVS).
One is the rise of ""plug and play"" smaller units known as pre-builts that do not require any work by the tenant. ""You just show up and turn your space on; all your needs are dealt with,"" he said.
The other concept is term flexibility, which no longer locks a tenant into a fixed number of years but allows for the lease to expand and contract seamlessly without any consequences - a fundamental change in the industry, said Heller.
Only flexible space operators now provide this option, but landlords will have to offer it universally or have a subset of their space furnish the service, he said.
""If it wasn't something that was appealing it would cease to exist,"" said Heller. ""A lot of tenants want to have a shorter-term exposure.""

CREATING OR FILLING SPACE?
The amount of coworking space leased in the first six months of the year was double that for all of 2013, when office leasing in Manhattan first boomed after the recession and topped annual rates before the downturn except for the record year of 2003.
Coworking firms leased 1.45 million square feet of Manhattan office space in the first half of 2018, or 8.1 percent of all new leases, according to brokerage Colliers International.
Coworking's growth also is responsible in part for a decline in subleasing as companies, which in the past leased 20 percent more than their needs to accommodate future growth, no longer do so. Instead, they appear to be turning to flexible office space when they increase staffing.
Coworking has steadily risen from 2.1 percent of all Manhattan leasing five years ago. But the length of office leases has in recent years remained about eight years, said Craig Caggiano, an executive director at Colliers. 
Coworking executives say many landlords resist short-term contracts even as the phrase ""flexible leasing"" gains cachet.
Flexible leasing is a term that's being bandied about but it's more a concept than a practice, said Jonathan Iger, chief executive of the William Kaufman Organization, which owns six large office buildings, among other assets, in Manhattan.
But Iger, who rolled out a flexible format at one of his buildings earlier this year, acknowledged that large tenants expect landlords to accommodate their short-term needs, which is driving coworking's growth.
""I don't know anyone who's doing it at scale, and to be honest with you, I don't know how you do it. Because as a landlord it defeats the purpose in a sense,"" he said.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",U.S. carmakers expected to warn of tariff pain when releasing results,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - When Detroit's automakers report earnings on Wednesday, they are likely to highlight escalating tariffs and use the opportunity to warn investors of far greater pain ahead should U.S. President Donald Trump impose broader tariffs on the industry's vehicles and parts, consultants and analysts said. 
""The automakers really want to get that narrative out there,"" said Jeff Schuster, president for the Americas at consultancy LMC Automotive, who stressed it is unusual for General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) to post quarterly earnings on the same day. 
""All three automakers are on the same page with tariffs,"" he added. ""They can demonstrate the impact so far and warn about the risks of taking this further.""
The shares of the Detroit Three automakers have been drifting down as Trump has escalated trade threats against China and Europe.
So far, in a bid to reduce America's trade deficit with China and protect U.S. industries, Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and on a range of Chinese goods including Chinese-made vehicles, starting July 6. China has responded with tariffs of its own on U.S. goods, including vehicles. 
The metals tariffs have pushed up steel and aluminum prices, raising costs and concerns in the auto industry, which expects vehicles sales to decline in 2018. 
Early this year, even before tariffs became a reality, Ford warned that rising aluminum and steel costs would hurt 2018 profits.
""On the expense side, those extra costs are going to eat into automakers' profit margins,"" said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. ""There's little room to pass those costs onto consumers.""
Detroit's automakers also face rising costs on specific models thanks to the tit-for-tat tariffs with China. 
GM, for instance, imports the Buick Envision from China, but has not yet said whether a 25 percent tariff will force it to raise prices on the SUV in the United States.
Ford faces a difficult situation in China, with sales down 22 percent in the first five months of the year. 
The company's luxury Lincoln models are all imported to China from the United States, and Ford has said it is not planning price hikes for now.
With Chinese sales already cratering, price hikes are seen as a tough sell for Ford. 
""Lincoln specifically will be stillborn in China if they don't eat those duties and they are significant,"" said industry consultant and former GM executive Warren Browne. 
But altogether, these margin hits are seen as small compared to the effect of sweeping tariffs on imported vehicles and parts that Trump has threatened.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday it was ""too early"" to say if the administration would impose the tariffs, even as many automakers think it is a foregone conclusion.
Administration officials have said the potential tariffs are in part designed to win concessions during the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico.
About 40 percent of the content in GM's U.S.-sold vehicles comes from outside the United States, while that figure is 45 percent for FCA and 20 percent for Ford, according to data from research firm Edmunds.com. 
""The problems the automakers currently face are a drop in the bucket compared to what could be coming,"" LMC's Schuster said.
GM has already warned that higher tariffs on imported vehicles under consideration by Trump's administration could cost jobs and lead to a ""a smaller GM"" while isolating U.S. businesses from the global market.
A group representing major automakers said on Thursday that imposing tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts would raise the price of U.S. vehicles by $83 billion annually and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
Because of the U.S.-China trade war, Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) last month cut its 2018 profit forecast, warning sales of its Mercedes-Benz cars would be hurt, and BMW (DE:BMWG) said it was looking at ""strategic options.""
There is also the risk Trump might unilaterally withdraw from NAFTA. Boston Consulting Group last year estimated U.S. tariffs in the range of 20 percent to 35 percent would add $16 billion to $27 billion annually to costs at automakers and their suppliers if the U.S. left NAFTA. 

""That would be a disaster, both short term and long term,"" said Browne, who expects Detroit's automakers to address these issues on earnings calls to prepare investors and warn Washington. ""Look for them to be very vocal.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday that  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) (N:DB) has agreed to pay nearly $75 million to settle an investigation into the mishandling of pre-release American Depositary Receipts (ADR). 
Deutsche Bank did not admit or deny the SEC's findings but agreed to return its ""ill-gotten gains"" and comply with the SEC's fine, the regulator said.
The SEC said its investigation has revealed ""industrywide abuses” in pre-released ADRs, said Stephanie Avakian, of the SEC's Enforcement Division.
“Failures at each institutional link in the chain of these transactions, from depositary bank to broker-dealer, left the markets for those ADRs ripe for potential abuse at the expense of ADR holders.”

Deutsche said in a statement: ""The bank provided substantial cooperation to the SEC in its inquiry and voluntarily stopped engaging in pre-release ADR transactions entirely by late 2016.""

873,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",GE beats on EPS but trims cash flow target; shares fall,"By Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co reported a smaller-than-expected drop in profit on Friday, but cut a key financial target, raising questions about its full-year outlook and sending shares sharply lower.
The 126-year-old industrial conglomerate, whose power and financial-services units are struggling, said it expects to generate perhaps $1 billion less free cash flow than expected this year.
The forecast cast doubt on GE's full-year adjusted profit target of $1.00 to $1.07 a share. Though GE affirmed that target on Friday, many analysts see it as unrealistic and have cut their estimates to less than $1.00. 
""We are getting questions as to how the company can maintain EPS guidance while cutting free cash flow guidance,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on Friday.
GE's conference call with analysts also cast doubt on the outlook. ""They gave you all the conditions for why the forecast could go down,"" said Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
For example, GE had previously said it expects to ship 50 to 55 large power turbines this year. ""On the call, they said 'We're targeting 50.'"" GE also said power equipment sales may take longer to close. ""The only thing you're going to hear from that is there's downside risk,"" Dray said. 
The stock was down 5.2 percent at $13.02 in midday trading. 
The stock decline was ""all about cash and (GE's) acknowledgement of risk to the second half,"" said Jeffrey Sprague, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. 
GE cut the industrial free cash flow target to $6 billion from a range of $6 billion to $7 billion. 
Its adjusted earnings, which exclude certain pension and restructuring costs, fell 10 percent to 19 cents a share, beating analysts' expectations of 17 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Total revenue rose to $30.1 billion from $29.1 billion.
GE said weakness in power and renewables energy offset gains in its aviation and healthcare units. 
A decade and a half ago, GE was the world’s most valuable public company. But the Boston-based conglomerate foundered in several industrial markets and its move into financial services steered it into the global financial storm in 2008. 
GE shares have halved in the past year. Though investors are still interested in GE, many want to see the power and capital units stabilize and even improve before buying the stock, analysts have said.
'THEY DIDN'T SCREW UP' 
GE revealed no new bad news about ongoing accounting investigations, a shareholder lawsuit and a federal inquiry into subprime mortgage activity, and appeared to be operating better, some analysts said.
""They didn't screw up,"" said Nick Heymann, analyst at William Blair. ""This was a quarter driven entirely by aviation and healthcare."" 
GE beat earnings expectations in part because it cut overhead costs more than expected and the losses at GE Capital were less than analysts expected, said RBC's Dray. 
The results capped an unusually busy quarter in which Chief Executive John Flannery announced a long-awaited plan to spin off its healthcare unit and sell its 62.5 percent stake in oil services firm Baker Hughes. 
In May, GE announced an $11.1-billion deal to merge its locomotive unit with Wabtec Corp. In June, it announced a $3.25-billion sale of its distributed power unit to U.S. buyout group Advent.
GE also restated results for 2016 and 2017 to reflect new accounting standards. Last month, it was removed from the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Finally, GE's top executive in Latin America was jailed in Brazil after prosecutors said he was involved in a price-fixing scheme for medical equipment.
Losses widened at GE Capital, the company's financing arm, during the quarter. Power unit profit fell 58 percent in the quarter and orders there were down.
GE's power unit is relying on services revenue to offset declining sales of new equipment. But the services business also is under attack from competitors in important markets such as Saudi Arabia.
Earnings from continuing operations attributable to GE shareholders fell to $736 million, or 8 cents a share, from $1.03 billion, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. 

One positive for GE: Adjusted free cash flow from industrial activities swung to a positive $258 million in the quarter from a negative $1.7 billion in the first quarter.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) shares rose about 5 percent to an all-time high on Friday, after investors cheered another blockbuster quarter, backed by growth in its legacy software business and Azure cloud computing services.
Shares of one of the technology world's oldest and best-known names rose nearly 4 percent to $108.20 in early trade, adding more than $30 billion to a market capitalization that was already $802 billion at Thursday's close.
At least six brokerages raised their price targets on the company's stock after the results. 
Helped by a boom in demand for cloud-based software, Microsoft has more than doubled in value since Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in 2014 and refocused the software behemoth on newer businesses.
While Microsoft's core productivity and business processes unit, which includes the Office 365 software suite, rose 13.1 percent to $9.67 billion, revenue for the Azure cloud service jumped 89 percent. 
""Based on the results, they were able to beat on all major metrics that people were focusing on. I don't see anything that should raise an eyebrow of concern"", said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust who holds 418,716 Microsoft shares.
Microsoft has been investing heavily to bolster the fast-growing cloud business and catch up with market leader Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS).
""Given the competitive market and need to invest in both capex and operating expenses, profitability along AWS's level may prove elusive for Azure for several years, if not forever,"" Jefferies analysts said.
Microsoft also competes with Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL),  IBM  (N:IBM) and  Alibaba  (N:BABA).
According to research firm Canalys, AWS is beating the competition in terms of market share, followed by Microsoft, which continues to grow faster than AWS, as of April this year. Google was ranked third.
""Our early investments in the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge are paying off, and we will continue to expand our reach in large and growing markets with differentiated innovation,"" Nadella said on a conference call on Thursday.
Analysts expect the investments to pay off in the long run and provide rich dividends to shareholders, allowing Microsoft to rival Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon in the race to be the first company worth $1 trillion.
""Our view on MSFT is unchanged: the stock is our favorite large cap name and we expect MSFT to deliver 10-20% annual stock price appreciation for the next several years,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis wrote in a client note.
Of the 35 analysts covering the stock, 31 have a ""buy"" or higher rating, three are on ""hold"" and only one on ""strong sell"".
""Microsoft has successfully come from behind to exceed Amazon's cloud revenue, and that gap is only increasing in Microsoft's favor,"" Mark Sami, vice president at consultancy firm SPR said.
""I predict that Microsoft's cloud market share will continue to grow and impress investors.""

""Imports of our nation's automobiles and auto parts have never damaged U.S. national security and will not do so in the future,"" Abe said at a news conference to mark the end of the parliamentary session. 
Washington launched an investigation in May into whether imported vehicles were a threat to national security threat. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs as a key part of his economic message, repeatedly lamenting the U.S. auto sector trade deficit, particularly with Germany and Japan.
Abe said Japanese companies built some 3.8 million cars annually in the United States, more than double the number of vehicles shipped there from Japan.

""Trade restrictions will not benefit anyone, and we will keep explaining that to the U.S. and work closely with them to ensure those tariffs are not imposed, "" Abe said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese firms are likely to pursue stakes in the country's first casino resorts, after parliament on Friday enacted a law smoothing the way for large-scale gambling - a business expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue.
Japan legalized casinos in 2016 but a further law was needed to lay out specific regulations before these resorts - complexes hosting casinos, retail and conference space - could be set up. 
The new law, which allows three licenses to be given out initially, calls for a 30 percent tax on gambling revenue and caps casino space at 3 percent of total resort size, provides the clarity that was missing.
It will embolden local companies that have been wary of a sector that the Japanese public associates with addiction and crime, setting the stage for a race for stakes, casino executives and lobbyists told Reuters. 
The prize for Japan Inc is clear: these resorts will earn up to $25 billion in revenue, analysts say, representing a rare chance of growth for domestic firms that have been bruised by decades of deflation and weak demand.
Various Japanese firms spanning sectors from finance, real state to construction and tourism will target equity stakes in consortia with casino operators, the sources added.
While no Japanese company has announced any plans yet, firms regularly cited by lobbyists as seeking participation include Obayashi Corp, Mitsubishi Estate Co and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (SMFG). 
A spokesman for Obayashi, which in May set up a team to explore casino resorts, said the firm had not decided whether to seek equity in any project. Mitsubishi Estate said the chances of it taking a stake were low but involvement in related real estate projects was possible.
A spokesman for SMFG's banking unit said the firm was not considering investing in a resort, but was speaking to foreign operators as it researched the sector.
International casino operators looking to enter Japan include Las Vegas Sands Corp, MGM Resorts International and Macau's Galaxy Entertainment Group. 
""There is going to be greater focus, greater attention, more budget and more human capital put on this,"" said George Tanasijevich, managing director of global development at Las Vegas Sands. ""You'll see more activity, to the point that people are going to start to formulate their true options, and what their shareholders would see as favorable.""
PUBLIC OPPOSITION
But even as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe personally champions the creation of a casino industry, Japanese firms have stayed away, reluctant to be the first mover in a controversial sector.
A government survey last year showed some 3.6 percent of Japanese, or 3.2 million people, had been hooked on gambling - often ""pachinko"" pinball - at some point in their lives. 
A Jiji news agency poll shows over six in ten Japanese are opposed to the latest casino law. 
""Large firms don't want to put their neck out before others,"" said Lance Miller, country managing partner at law firm DLA Piper in Tokyo. 
Still, some companies have already set out their stall.
Slot machine maker Sega Sammy Holdings Inc, which controls 45 percent of a South Korean resort, has said it will seek a majority stake in any Japanese project. 
Of potential locations, Osaka is seen as a frontrunner. 
The city of 2.7 million boasting strong local political support for casinos is expected to become the first to request proposals for plans in late 2019.

""Osaka is the only location where everything is clear: it will move forward immediately,"" said Seth Sulkin, chairman of the integrated resorts task force run by the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan.

On July 23, a quiet period expires for perhaps the most amicable analysts on Wall Street: Those working at banks that underwrote BJ’s initial public offering last month. The listing’s 25-day anniversary will probably prompt initiations from lead banks Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The syndicate also included Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Jefferies, Wells Fargo, Nomura, Baird, Guggenheim, Natixis and William Blair.
Shares in the warehouse club operator have jumped more than 50 percent from the June 27 IPO, which priced at the top of the deal’s $15-$17 offering range. A hike in membership fees and an expected milestone in merchandise comparable-store sales have fueled the bullish view on BJ’s. Rival Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) has also risen since the listing, reaching a record high on Thursday and putting its valuation at $95.4 billion, 28 times that of BJ’s $3.4 billion market capitalization.
Among analysts not beholden to the 25-day quiet period, two suggest buying BJ’s and one has the equivalent of a sell rating. The average price target is $22, below Thursday’s $25.70 closing price. Costco recently got a new Street-high price target at Loop Capital after posting a better-than-expected sales report for June, but was downgraded to neutral from buy at Northcoast earlier this month.
BJ’s may rise on Monday if analysts surprise the market with especially bullish views, but a cautious approach from Wall Street could weigh on shares.

LONDON (Reuters) - After a year laying the groundwork for his Karachi-based clothing company's expansion to Europe, businessman Abdul Aziz was poised to start delivery to British shops such as TK MAXX.
That was before HSBC (L:HSBA) froze his corporate account around August 10 last year, catching Aziz up along with scores of other unintended victims of the bank's crackdown on money laundering whose cases have been reported by Reuters. 
The 12-week freeze on international payments cost Aziz's company, Safetex, those customers, he says. Now he may soon be in breach of the terms of his Tier 1 entrepreneur visa, which allows him to run his business in Britain only if specific conditions are met about the number of people he employs and the income he earns.
""The account freeze has meant I've lost my customers, payments to my company stopped, the business is on the verge of collapse and I'm facing having to return to Pakistan and start my life from scratch,"" Aziz told Reuters.
HSBC says it is investigating the merits of Aziz's claim of two million pounds ($2.6 million) in compensation and is trying to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
""We have listened to our customers and made a number of significant improvements since last year,"" spokesman Michael Clarke said this week when asked about Aziz's case and others.
""But we recognize mistakes still occur, and we are working hard to put things right and to make the process as simple as possible. We deal with complaints as a matter of urgency to minimize any impact on our customers.""
HSBC's problems, first reported by Reuters last August, stem from a $1.9 billion fine imposed in 2012 by the U.S. Justice Department and financial regulators who found it had allowed itself to be used to launder drug money from Mexico.
The bank tightened checks on its customers and has acknowledged freezing the accounts of hundreds of small business customers, without specifying where they were located.
The bank says it has improved internal communication and training and hired more staff in order to be able to handle complaints quickly.
But interviews with HSBC customers, letters and emails from the bank seen by Reuters and a review of the lender's social media complaints channels show some problems continue.
RECENT INCIDENTS 
The number of affected UK businesses is a tiny percentage of all business accounts at HSBC, but they are in the small and mid-sized sector which the government has said it wants to encourage and hopes will thrive after Britain leaves the European Union.
More than 40 businesses have written to Reuters since last August to share their stories, many saying they were prompted to do so only after they felt they were being ignored by the bank. 
According to their accounts, backed up by emails and letters between the parties, cases have taken weeks and even months to resolve. In more than fifteen cases, the frozen accounts were unblocked only after Reuters brought the bank's attention to them during the course of its reporting, the account holders said.
Six account holders said they had been given compensation ranging from hundreds to as much as 3,000 pounds.
Beyond acknowledging Aziz's claim, HSBC declined to comment on specific cases. The spokesman said the bank was sorry for any cases ""where we have not reached the high level of customer service we strive for"". 
Many of the complaints arise from recent incidents. 
Clothing supplier Britwear, cookware manufacturer Home Cook Wholesale and charity Ganet's Adventure School Fund are among five businesses which contacted Reuters in the last month to say their HSBC accounts had been frozen for weeks.
All three accounts were restored within days of Reuters contacting the bank to ask about their cases.
Steve McInerny, a media executive who is also chair of Ganet's Adventure School Fund, which supports a school in rural Malawi, said the charity was frozen out of its account for six weeks from mid-May to the end of June. 
""The direct effect of this was we were unable to send funds to the school in Malawi we support to build toilets for its nursery classes,"" McInerny said. 
The account was unfrozen after McInerny approached Reuters and the Financial Ombudsman, he said.
Ombudsman spokeswoman Debbie Enever said it assisted some businesses who approached it after logging a complaint with the bank. She did not have data on how many customers the ombudsman had helped.
""From speaking to people who've had their business bank accounts frozen suddenly, we've heard about the significant stress and upset it can cause,"" Enever said. 
Banks worldwide have in recent years shut thousands of customer accounts as they seek to avoid fines from U.S. authorities for abetting money laundering and sanctions-busting.

The correction--defined as a decline of at least 10% from the market's peak -- is now the third longest since 1950, according to WSJ Market Data Group.
Earlier this week, the correction surpassed the one from 2007-2008, when both the S&P 500 and Dow Industrials went 108 trading days before regaining their record highs.
The next correction milestone isn't far off -- 122 trading days for the S&P 500 and 123 days for the Dow. That was in 1984.
The average duration of the three dozen market corrections since 1950 is about four months.
Though the current correction is unusually long, it is still far shy of the longest in history. That one lasted 229 trading days in 1977-1978.
There are, however, two bright spots to this correction. One is that the S&P 500's 10.1% decline is well below the 13% average.
The other is that the index is just 2% away from reclaiming its January 23 record high of 2,829.13."

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish pulp, paper and packaging board maker  Stora Enso  (HE:STERV) missed quarterly profit expectations on Friday, partly blaming wood supply problems stemming from the exceptionally hot and dry weather in the Nordics.
Wildfires have swept across Sweden and to smaller extent have flared in Finland. Concerns that harvesting could start more fires has reduced activity in the region where the company has most of its mills.
Stora said it was forced to turn to wood supply from Poland and Ireland, which has lifted costs, while machine breakdowns in Sweden and Finland also had a negative effect in the quarter.
Shares in the company fell 9.9 percent by 0927 GMT after it reported an adjusted operating profit of 327 million euros ($380 million), short of the 338 million euros expected by analysts.
But profit still jumped 49 percent from a year ago with the help of increased prices and a new packaging board mill in China.
""We had a number of headwinds ... so we have an additional potential that (we) did not realize in the quarter,"" CEO Karl-Henrik Sundstrom told a news conference.
For the third quarter, he forecast a flat profit compared to the second quarter due to seasonal factors, but said the guidance was ""probably on the conservative side"".
Stora, known for supplying the boxes for Apple (O:AAPL) iPhones, has shifted its focus in the recent years away from paper production, a declining industry in Europe due to the rise of reading in digital formats.
The majority of Stora's profit comes from pulp and packaging board. Alongside paper, pulp is needed to make tissues and packaging board, products that are growing on the back of Chinese demand and growth in online shopping.
As an example of the ongoing shift, Stora said last month that it was evaluating a potential 700 million euro ($815 million) investment to convert its Oulu paper mill in Finland into packaging board production.
Some analysts said the share fall was overdone, and added that the stock was still 24 percent higher than a year ago.
""Their underlying performance is very good... but sometimes, if the stock has risen recently, the markets do not tolerate even slight profit misses,"" said Antti Viljakainen from Inderes Equity Research who holds an 'accumulate' rating on the stock.

Leanne Caret, chief executive of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, told Reuters in an interview at the Farnborough Airshow this week that Boeing was watching the situation but that it was premature to make more definitive statements.
""They are still going through own defence reviews and understanding where they're going,"" she said.
""If there is an opportunity where the Boeing Company can participate and play, we will be absolutely honoured and thrilled to be part of that journey,"" she added.
Britain this week unveiled its plans to build a stealthy new future fighter jet called Tempest, launching a rival to the Franco-German programme first unveiled in the summer of 2017.
Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) and Airbus (PA:AIR) are leading the Franco-German programme, while the British project will be run by BAE Systems (L:BAES), Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF), engine maker Rolls Royce (L:RR), and missile maker MBDA.
It remains unclear whether the two projects could merge after Britain's exit from the European Union, or whether Britain will forge new alliances, perhaps with Sweden's Saab (ST:SAABb), maker of the Gripen fighter jet. 
It may also look to Boeing (N:BA), which recently teamed with Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) and has close ties to Saab, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group. 
Teaming up with BAE, Saab and possibly Embraer on a new fighter would provide a serious counterweight to the Franco-German project, which has not yet awarded initial study contracts to Airbus and Dassault.

It would also offer Boeing, which builds F/A-18E/F and F-15 fighters, a chance to get back into a new fighter development programme after losing out to  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter contract in 2001.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's government bond yields rose on Friday and equities sold off after local media reported tensions within the ruling coalition government and a newspaper interview with a lawmaker raised fresh concerns about Rome's commitment to the euro.
The benchmark Italian stock index pared losses after Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio denied newspaper reports that he had demanded Economy Minister Giovanni Tria resign unless he backed government nominees to head key companies.
Still, signs of discord in the euro zone's third biggest economy served as reminder of heightened risks in Italy following the recent formation of a coalition government between the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
Two-year government bond yields briefly jumped more than 10 basis points on the day, while an index of bank stocks tumbled to a three- week low.
According to a report in Italian daily Corriere della Sera, the head of the budget committee in Italy's lower house of parliament, Claudio Borghi, said the country would come out of the euro sooner or later.
Signs of tension between Tria and the government's two deputy prime ministers also weighed.
""BTPs (Italian bonds) are falling sharply, probably due to the Borghi comments, that he is sure the Italy will get out of euro soon or later, and due to tensions in the government on Tria,"" said one Milan-based trader.
One reason for strained relations is disagreement over appointments at some state-controlled firms including state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), traders said. CDP is expected to be a crucial institution in the new Italian government's spending plans.
Several newspapers reported the deputy prime ministers have issued an ultimatum to Tria that he should back the government's nominees for key posts at the companies or resign.
La Stampa and Repubblica, in unsourced reports, said Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini want Tria to back several nominations, which he has so far not done.
Di Maio's denial on Friday bought some brief relief, although both bond and stocks remained on the back foot.
Italy's two-year bond yield was last up 6 basis points at 0.61 percent (IT2YT=RR), having risen as high as 0.667 percent as markets digested the newspaper reports.
Italian 10-year bond yields were 4 bps higher, trading at 2.55 percent - pushing the gap over German Bund yields (DE10YT=RR) to 221 bps from around 218 bps late Thursday.

""The fact that Tria is entering on a collision course with the two leaders of Italy's government forces has put (investors) on alert,"" said Marco Vailati, head of research and investments at Cassa Lombarda. 
""A resignation would obviously be traumatic. The market reaction is logical, even though (the sell-off) could be seen as a buying opportunity should the whole thing turn out to be a journalistic exaggeration,"" he added.
The news did not seem to have a noticeable effect on the euro, which was up 0.1 percent on the day against the dollar (EUR=D3).
But as Italian bonds sold off, banking stocks in Milan underperformed the broader stock index. 
Italy's banks index (FTIT8300) fell 1.3 percent to a three-week low, as rising yields hurt lenders who are big holders of Italian debt.
The broader Italian FTSE MIB equity index (FTMIB) fell 0.4 percent, underperforming the broader European market (STOXX), but moving off lows after Di Maio's comments.

""The reports out of Italy today are a reminder of just how dysfunctional the Italian government is,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. ""It's not helpful that these parties are packed with euro sceptics.""

903,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",China markets gyrate as yuan hits one-year lows,"By Winni Zhou and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's yuan rebounded from more than one-year lows against the dollar on Friday afternoon, driven up on suspected dollar sales by major state banks to prop up a currency that has been hit by a bitter Sino-U.S. trade conflict.
The frenetic action in the currency market was matched by some sharp gyrations in the country's stock markets, which recovered from early losses to close solidly higher amid reports of the imminent release of detailed rules governing the wealth management industry. 
Markets were already tense in early trade after U.S. President Donald Trump told CNBC on Thursday U.S. time that a strong dollar puts the United States at a disadvantage and that the Chinese yuan ""was dropping like a rock.""
Beijing's currency management has been a sore point in relations between China and the United States in the past, so any suspicions that Chinese authorities might be deliberately weakening the yuan could further inflame tensions between the two countries.
The latest bout of yuan weakness, catalysed by concerns over the brewing trade war and a slowing Chinese economy, has seen it shed 7.5 percent of its value against the dollar since the end of the first quarter of this year - its biggest 90-day fall since the market exchange rate was unified in 1994.
Since a shock devaluation of the yuan by Beijing in 2015 triggered a sharp slide in the currency and rattled global markets, Chinese authorities have been at pains to keep the yuan largely stable to prevent a destabilizing flight of capital.
Friday's yuan fixing of 6.7671 per dollar was the lowest since July 14, 2017, and represented the biggest one-day weakening in percentage terms since June 27, 2016.
The midpoint largely matched market forecasts, traders said, an indication that the authorities did not appear eager to hit the brakes on the yuan's fall.
Later, though, four traders said they had seen major state-owned banks selling dollars and propping up the yuan.
""Big banks were offering dollar liquidity onshore and offshore, instead of only selling onshore as what they used to do. In this case, it could have better effect,"" said one of the traders.
Another trader said he saw state banks selling dollars onshore at around 6.81 per dollar. The dollar selling had the effect of causing the yuan to pull back from its downhill dash.
After falling to a low of 6.8128 per dollar, the yuan  recouped its losses in the afternoon. The yuan finished its onshore trading session at 6.7795 to the dollar, the weakest such close since July 14, 2017, 1 pip firmer than the previous late session close.
Offshore the yuan  was trading 0.2 percent softer than the onshore spot at 6.7955 per dollar. 
Some traders said dollar liquidity offered by the big state-owned banks in the morning halted the sharp decline in the yuan, causing it to reverse course.
WMP REBOUND
The Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) closed 2 percent higher Friday, after earlier dropping 0.7 percent. The blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) ended 1.9 percent higher, turning around from a 0.9 percent drop.
Traders attributed the moves to a report by the 21st Century Business Herald that China will soon publish detailed rules on banks' wealth management products (WMPs). 
The newspaper said it was unclear whether the threshold for WMPs will be lowered, or whether WMPs will be allowed to invest in the secondary market. All the same, investors saw it as a sign that rules will be less rigid than expected, helping drive banking shares <.CSI300BI> up by more than 4 percent. 
Reuters was not able to independently verify the report. The China Banking Regulatory Commission and People's Bank of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The turnaround in stocks saw Chinese government bond futures fall, with Chinese 10-year treasury futures for September delivery , the most traded contract, dropping as much as 0.9 percent on the day. They were last 0.8 percent lower at 95.725.
A fixed-income trader in Shanghai said that the sharp drop in treasury futures reflected an expectation that the new WMP rules would be bullish for stocks and riskier assets.
""(Prices of) Chinese government bonds have been going up for a long time. Many people want to realize their gains"" have been waiting for an event to trigger sales, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan slid to its lowest in more than a year on Friday, further undermining global sentiment and stoking worries Beijing's currency management could be the next flash point in a trade dispute with the United States.
The yuan slid as low as 6.8128 to the dollar in the onshore market after the central bank set a weaker fixing for the currency for the seventh straight session, forcing a volatile session in Asian stocks.
After falling 0.4 percent, MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended the day 0.6 percent higher as the yuan rebounded. Market participants suspected state intervention to support the currency.
The drop in the yuan came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was concerned that the ""Chinese currency was dropping like a rock"" and the strong U.S. dollar ""puts us at a disadvantage"".
His comments knocked the dollar, forcing it off one-year highs against a basket of currencies
But the yuan, hurt by concerns over the China-U.S. trade war and a slowing Chinese economy, has shed 7.6 percent of its value against the dollar since the end of the first quarter of this year.
""A weaker Chinese yuan remains a source of risk for global currency markets – and the large dollar-yuan fixing higher by the (central bank) overnight requires some cautionary monitoring,"" ING Bank told clients.
Investors have vivid memories of China's sudden devaluation of the yuan in 2015 and the subsequent turmoil in global financial markets as investors worried about the stability of the world's second-largest economy.
European markets were not immune to the jitters. The pan-European STOXX index and Germany's DAX - which is highly exposed to trade and China - fell 0.2 percent at the start of trading.
MSCI's all-country world Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.2 percent on the day but was set to end the week flat.
Meanwhile, political concerns returned to dog Italian assets. The country's bonds and stocks sold off after local media reported tensions within the coalition government and a newspaper interview with a lawmakrer raised fresh concerns about Rome's commitment to the euro.
Italian newspapers reported tension between Economy Minister Giovanni Tria and the government's two vice prime ministers. One reason for strained relations is disagreement over appointments at some state-controlled firms, including state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), traders said.
And according to a report in the newspaper Corriere della Sera, the head of the budget committee in Italy's parliament, Claudio Borghi, said Italy would come out of the euro sooner or later.
""The reports out of Italy today are a reminder of just how dysfunctional the Italian government is,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. ""It's not helpful that these parties are packed with euro skeptics.""
The news had little effect on the euro, however, which was up 0.1 percent on the day.
In Asia on Friday, Japan's Nikkei was down 0.3 percent, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.45 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index rose 2 percent.
Worries about a full-blown global trade war are likely to persist as officials from the EU Trade Commission, due to arrive in Washington next week for trade talks, are said to be preparing a list of retaliatory measures in response to proposed U.S. tariffs on European Union cars.
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of peers, was down 0.1 percent on the day at 95.118.
Trump on Thursday criticized Federal Reserve policy and expressed concern about the potential impact of rising interest rates and a stronger dollar on the U.S. economy and American corporate competitiveness.
Brent crude futures rose 0.9 percent to $73.24 a barrel, maintaining their gains so far this week, after Saudi Arabia's OPEC governor said the kingdom's exports are likely to fall next month and inventories may be squeezed in the third quarter [O/R].
Spot gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,222.85 an ounce.

Trump said he is “not thrilled” with the Fed’s plan to raise rates four times this year and expressed concerns that the work he has done would be nullified.
Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have raised interest rates twice this year so far and have pointed to two more before the end of 2018.
“I’m not thrilled,” Trump said in an interview with CNBC. “Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don't really — I am not happy about it. But at the same time I’m letting them do what they feel is best.”
“But I don’t like all of this work that goes into doing what we’re doing,” Trump added.
Overnight, the U.S. markets reacted to his comments, with stocks, the dollar and Treasury yields all falling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5%, the S&P 500 edged down by 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.4%.
The White House later said in a statement that Trump did not mean to influence the Fed’s decision-making process. ""Of course the President respects the independence of the Fed. As he said he considers the Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell a very good man and that he is not interfering with Fed policy decisions,” the White House said in the statement. “The President’s views on interest rates are well known and his comments today are a reiteration of those long held positions, and public comments.""
Asian markets also slipped amid Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve. China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were 0.1% and 0.4% lower respectively by 10:01PM ET (02:01 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also slipped 0.1%. The yuan was in focus as it fell to a one-year low after China weakened the Chinese currency’s daily fixing by the most in more than two years.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.4%, outperforming its regional peers, as the energy subindex led gains. Those gains were offset by steep losses in materials, which dropped after base metal prices took a hit overnight.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp (T:6752) said it was unable to determine how much of the cobalt used in batteries it makes for Tesla cars comes from Cuba, a country subject to U.S. sanctions, and that it had suspended relations with a Canadian supplier as a result of its concerns.
The Japanese electronics maker, the exclusive supplier of batteries to Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), made the comments following questions from Reuters about whether the batteries contained Cuban cobalt.
Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that some of the cobalt that Panasonic uses to make Tesla's batteries is mined in Cuba by Canadian supplier  Sherritt International Corp  (TO:S). 
Panasonic said it was unable to tell how much cobalt sourced from Cuba via its Canadian supplier ended up in the batteries it provided to the U.S. market ""due to co-mingling of sources by its suppliers in several phases of manufacturing processes"".
""Panasonic has chosen to suspend its relationship with its Canadian supplier,"" a spokeswoman said, without naming the supplier. She added that Panasonic had used cobalt from the Canadian supplier for batteries used in the Tesla Model S and Model X, but only after February this year.
""Panasonic has sought guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regarding its interpretation of the scope of the U.S. ban on Cuban-origin imports,"" she said. 
A U.S. Treasury official, who asked not to be named, said Treasury does not discuss investigations and could not confirm whether one existed. 
The United States imposed sanctions on Cuba after Fidel Castro nationalized swathes of American assets more than 50 years ago.
Tesla, when asked for comment by Reuters, did not address questions about whether its batteries contained Cuban cobalt or whether that could potentially put the company in breach of sanctions.
A spokesman said: ""Tesla is aiming to achieve close to zero usage of cobalt in the near future.""
The electric vehicle maker, run by billionaire Elon Musk, said in May that it had been working for years to reduce the amount of cobalt it uses in its batteries.
Sherritt declined to comment on questions about whether it sold cobalt to Panasonic.
""We don't respond to questions about specific client activities,"" Sherritt's spokesman Joe Racanelli said.
""We've been working in Cuba for 25 years and we sell our Class 1 nickel and cobalt that's refined from our facility in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, to customers in Europe and Asia.""
SCRAMBLE FOR RESOURCES
An anticipated electric vehicle revolution has sent demand and prices for cobalt - a crucial component in car batteries - surging over the past two years. 
Companies are under pressure to prove that the minerals they consume are sourced from mines that do not employ children or cause major environmental damage. Global cobalt supply is dominated by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is riven by conflict and political instability. 
Sherritt produces Cobalt at the Moa mine in Cuba, a 50-50 joint venture between the Canadian company and the state-owned General Nickel Company of Cuba.
Panasonic buys cobalt from Sherritt and the metal is then turned into specialized cobalt chemicals by a contractor, according to the sources.
Panasonic is also supplied with cobalt chemicals by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd (T:5713), which produces most of its material in the Philippines, the sources said.
The sources said that Sumitomo supplied the bulk of the cobalt used in Tesla batteries. Reuters was unable to determine what proportion of the cobalt used in Panasonic's batteries made for Tesla came from Sherritt.
Sumitomo declined to comment on its supply chain.

When asked about a potential cobalt supply crunch, a Panasonic spokeswoman said, after the Reuters report, that the company ""will secure its demand of cobalt from existing and new sources"". The procurement from the Canadian supplier it suspended was not a majority, she added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit by New York City seeking to hold major oil companies liable for climate change caused by carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.
In dismissing the city's claims against  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX),  BP  Plc (L:BP), ConocoPhillips (N:COP),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa), U.S. District Judge John Keenan in Manhattan said climate change must be addressed through federal regulation and foreign policy.
""Climate change is a fact of life, as is not contested by Defendants,"" he wrote. ""But the serious problems caused thereby are not for the judiciary to ameliorate. Global warming and solutions thereto must be addressed by the two other branches of government.""
Seth Stein, a spokesman for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the city planned to appeal the decision.
""The mayor believes big polluters must be held accountable for their contributions to climate change and the damage it will cause New York City,"" Stein said.
The city sued the oil companies in January and announced it intended to divest fossil fuel investments from its $189 billion public pension funds over the next five years.
The city said the companies knew for years that carbon emissions caused global warming, yet they promoted fossil fuels while pushing public relations efforts to discredit science on the risks of climate change. The city said it must spend billions of dollars to safeguard against flooding and other hazards of global warming, and sought money damages.
The oil companies moved to dismiss the case on numerous grounds, including that the federal Clean Air Act authorizes only the Environmental Protection Agency to bring lawsuits over pollution.
Keenan agreed with that argument on Thursday. He also said that because climate change is a global problem, the city's claims ""implicate countless foreign governments and their laws and policies,"" and could not be decided by a court.
""Judge Keenan got it exactly right,"" Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron, said in a statement.
Shell, Exxon and ConocoPhillips all said they were pleased with the court ruling.
""Judge Keenan’s decision reaffirms our view that climate change is a complex societal challenge that requires sound governmental policy and is not an issue for the courts,"" Shell said in a statement.
ConocoPhillips spokesman Daren Beaudo said climate change was ""a global issue that requires global policies and solutions.""

BP could not immediately be reached for comment.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies are increasingly turning to investment banks and public relations firms for advice on dealing with potential approaches by activist investors who are targeting low valuations and cross-shareholdings in the nation.
Among those advising company board members on how to handle activists are  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). Two other banks, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue to clients, also told Reuters they were coaching Japanese executives on engaging with such investors. 
Japan was the top destination in Asia for activist campaigns last year, with its companies the target of a third of all such campaigns in the region, according to a report by JP Morgan. 
The trend of firms seeking advice shows a shift is underway in Japan's attitude toward activists. Its companies have long held a reputation as a graveyard for investors demanding change, with activists traditionally viewed by boards as asset-strippers to be resisted, not legitimate investors with whom to engage. 
""It is like a regular medical check-up – we do it regularly for Japanese clients even before they are approached by an activist,"" said Akihiko Manaka, head of Japan mergers and acquisitions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
""We offer Japanese clients analysis to look at the industry benchmark in terms of financial statistics as well as corporate governance and shareholding structure."" 
A sense that executives are increasingly prepared to listen is encouraging more activists to join the fray, analysts said. Last month, U.S. hedge fund ValueAct Capital announced its first-ever Asian investment with the purchase of a $600 million, 5 percent stake in Japanese medical equipment and camera maker Olympus Corp. ValueAct tends to avoid public battles with companies in favor of closed door-discussions.
And Elliott Management has taken a stake of more than 5 percent in Japan's Alpine Electronics and plans to make significant proposals, according to a filing by the activist U.S. hedge fund last week.
That comes after Hong Kong-based activist fund Oasis Management objected to the components maker's sale to a bigger affiliate.
POLICY, VALUATION DRIVERS 
Investment banks aren't the only ports of call for Japanese companies preparing to deal with activists. Three public relations firms described to Reuters growing demand for such services. 
""We have done a lot of work with companies on vulnerability assessments, helping them proactively assess where they may be susceptible to activist demands before an activist arrives or begins agitating for specific changes,"" said Nicola McGowan, managing director at Finsbury Japan. 
Activists have also taken heart from corporate reforms driven by the government. A governance code introduced in 2015 and updated later lists situations when boards can consider ousting a chief executive - a key shift in Japan's non-confrontational working culture. 
The potential to untangle a web of cross-holdings and a corporate tendency to hoard cash have also attracted activists, as has Japan's relatively low valuations. The blue-chip Topix 500 is trading on 14 times earnings, according to ThomsonReuters data, compared with 22 times for the US S&P 500.
""Japan is the ideal target place – there's so much value to be unlocked,"" said Zuhair Khan, an analyst at Jefferies in Tokyo, who said the lingering tradition of cross-holdings could make activists' task tricky.
Examples of successful activism at companies, especially bluechips, remain rare in Japan. And even in cases where change does happen, firms rarely acknowledge the role played by activists. 
In 2015, Japanese robot maker Fanuc Corp raised dividends and stock buybacks after demands by activist investor Daniel Loeb for better shareholder returns. Fanuc said at the time it was responding to the government's push for better corporate governance and not to Loeb's demands.
And activist hedge fund investor Daniel Loeb’s Third Point failed in 2013 to get electronics and entertainment firm Sony Corp (T:6758) to partially spin off its entertainment business.
STEPPING IT UP 
Still, emboldened by the government's governance push, activists have become increasingly vocal in their demands for change. The shift is forcing companies to look at how to deal with activists before as well as after they propose changes, bankers said. 
Seth Fischer, founder of Oasis, whose campaigns have helped produce strategic change at Nintendo Co (T:7974) and raise the price Panasonic Corp paid to take a unit private, has over the past 18 months used more public tactics to push companies for change. 
""Every engagement starts soft but if we don't get meaningful dialogue, we escalate to writing letters, then setting up websites and maybe going as far as proxies and lawsuits,"" he said. 

""Companies are engaging more and they're asking banks to help them figure out how to address our concerns - which hopefully means they'll meet us somewhere in the middle.""

(Reuters) - Fund investors piled into U.S.-based equity exchange-traded funds in the week ended Wednesday, following six straight weeks of withdrawals, Lipper data showed on Thursday, as investors geared up for strong quarterly earnings.
The flows showed that investors were ""putting money back into play,"" said Pat Keon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters Lipper.
ETF investors put $4.7 billion of the $5 billion in net inflows to U.S.-based equity ETFs into funds focused on domestic stocks.
The S&P 500 rose 1.5 percent from July 11 to 18 as earnings trickled in from major banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), as well as railroad CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX) and airline United Continental.
Results were mixed, but investors are still expecting market-leading technology firms and several other sectors to deliver double-digit profit growth over the year prior, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) data.
Elevated risk appetite was also evident in withdrawals from U.S.-based money-market funds, which posted $6.5 billion in outflows, after $21 billion in inflows the week prior. Investors use money-market funds to temporarily park cash.
In the coming weeks, companies will have to live up to strong expectations for results and investors will contend with continuing disputes between the U.S. and its major trading partners.
Uncertainty over trade has helped demand for some lower-risk sources of yield. U.S.-based corporate investment grade bond funds brought in cash for the 19th straight week with $2 billion in deposits.
Municipal bond funds took in $1.2 billion, the most cash since April 2017.

(Reuters) - A lawyer for discount e-commerce company Groupon Inc told a court in Delaware on Thursday that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp has shaken down practically every large tech firm for patent fees. 
 IBM  is suing Groupon for $167 million, accusing it of infringing four basic internet technology patents, in a case that is being closely watched by the tech industry.
Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM has portrayed itself as an innovator whose licensing fee requests are reasonable in light of its research and development costs. But Groupon is defending itself by trying to portray IBM as using outdated patents to squeeze money out of other tech companies with threats of litigation. 
""IBM has approached every significant company in the web technology space asserting patents against them,"" Groupon lawyer J. David Hadden said during cross-examination of IBM licensing executive Thomas McBride in federal court.
""If someone comes to me and says 'pay me,' I would view that as a demand,"" Hadden said.
Two of the four patents in the case relate to Prodigy, IBM's late-1980s precursor to the web. IBM's patents describe commonplace internet technology like password management and online advertising.
McBride disputed Hadden's assertion that IBM has approached every major web-based company, but said it had engaged in discussions with companies like Yelp Inc and Airbnb Inc, among others. An IBM spokesman told Reuters it had not reached licensing deals with Yelp and Airbnb.
McBride said license fees help it recoup the billions it spends on R&D and reach productive arrangements with other innovative companies. IBM has secured more U.S. patents than any other company for the past 25 years.
Earlier on Thursday, McBride described licensing agreements the company has previously struck with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and Twitter, who have paid IBM fees ranging from $20 million to $50 million each.
Hadden also questioned McBride about IBM sales to so-called ""patent trolls,"" who hold intellectual property solely for the purpose of filing lawsuits and have been widely criticized in the tech industry.
A lawyer for IBM objected to the questioning, saying it was irrelevant, but the judge instructed McBride to answer.
McBride said IBM was ""selective"" about who it sells patents to and strikes such deals in part to protect itself from trolls.

""If a patent troll wants to buy a patent from us then we insist on a covenant not to sue IBM,"" McBride said. ""We achieve some level of protection from being sued ourselves.""

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) on Thursday posted quarterly profit and revenue that beat analysts' estimates, as more businesses signed up for its Azure cloud computing services and Office 365 productivity suite.
The company's flagship Azure cloud product recorded revenue growth of 89 percent in the fourth quarter ended June 30. Its shares rose nearly 4 percent in after-hours trading. 
Much of Microsoft's recent growth has been fueled by its cloud computing business, which has benefited from companies rushing to shift their workloads to the cloud to cut data storage and software costs.
""The combination of the cloud, which is a megatrend that's going to last for years to come, and the execution, this is company that knows how to sell and be innovative - it's hard to argue with anything here,"" said Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace.com analyst.
Microsoft shares have risen 180 percent since Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in 2014, refocusing the company on cloud computing rather than PC software. Its market cap edged above $800 billion for the first time earlier this month.
Azure has a 16 percent share of the global cloud infrastructure market, making it the second-biggest provider of cloud services after Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Amazon Web Services, according to April estimates by research firm Canalys. 
Revenue at Microsoft's productivity and business processes unit, which includes Office 365, rose 13.1 percent to $9.67 billion, topping analysts' average expectation of $9.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""This was another gem of a quarter from Microsoft as Nadella's cloud vision is coming to fruit on the heels of massive Azure growth and secular tailwinds,"" said Daniel Ives at research firm GBH Insights.
Revenue for the company's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) business and job network grew 37 percent from the year-ago quarter, while its Dynamics 365 online business application suite posted a 61 percent increase.
The combination of those two services highlights Microsoft's rise as an alternative to Salesforce.com Inc (N:CRM), which dominates the customer relationship management market, said Johnny Won, founder of Hyperstop, a tech consultancy firm.
""It seems like this is actually a formidable threat to Salesforce,"" Won said.
Overall, the Redmond, Washington-based software maker's revenue rose 17.5 percent to $30.09 billion, above expectations of $29.21 billion.
Net income rose to $8.87 billion, or $1.14 per share, from $8.07 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the year-ago fourth quarter. https:// 
Excluding certain items, Microsoft earned $1.13 per share, while analysts had expected $1.08.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 06:35PM ET</span>",U.S. court OKs speedy appeal of AT&T-Time Warner tie-up,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday approved the U.S. Justice Department's request for an expedited schedule for an appeal of a judge's ruling that allowed AT&T Inc (N:T) to buy content provider Time Warner.
The department said last Thursday that it would appeal a federal judge's approval of the $85.4 billion acquisition.
The court approved the Justice Department request that legal briefs must be completed by Oct. 18, with oral arguments ""as soon as practicable."" That would be a significantly faster-than-normal timetable for an appeals court to hear a case.
The Justice Department said on Wednesday, in requesting the expedited schedule, that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, could use Time Warner's Turner content, especially live sports and news, to raise the costs of smaller, rival pay TV companies.
""The merged firm will have the incentive and the ability to raise its rivals' costs and stifle growth of innovative next-generation entrants,"" the department said in the filing.
Essentially, they argued, AT&T could push smaller pay TV companies to pay more for Turner's CNN and sports programming, increases that would be passed on to U.S. consumers. They also argued that withholding Turner content from online distributors, such as Hulu, would stunt the development of cheaper online video.
The Justice Department said this week that District Court Judge Richard Leon ""rejected fundamental principles of economics"" in his decision to rule for the companies. Leon had called one of the government's arguments against the deal ""gossamer thin"" and another ""poppycock.""
Under an agreement with the Justice Department, the companies closed the deal in June.

One of the many people who are skeptical that the government will prevail is AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, who said last week that the original court decision was well reasoned. ""We think the likelihood of this thing being reversed or overturned is really remote,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (O:SBGI) ""did not fully disclose facts"" about aspects of its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media (N:TRCO), the U.S. Federal Communications Commission said in an order released on Thursday that referred the issue to an administrative law judge for a hearing.
The order is a serious and potentially fatal blow to Sinclair's bid to acquire Tribune. Tribune said it is ""currently evaluating its implications and assessing all of our options in light of today's developments.""
Sinclair had sought to remove questions about three stations referenced in the order by dropping divestiture plans on Tuesday. The FCC said the judge will review whether Sinclair engaged in misrepresentation or a lack of candor and whether the deal would violate the FCC's broadcast ownership rules.
Sinclair did not immediately comment on Thursday, but said on Wednesday ""at no time have we withheld information or misled the FCC in any manner whatsoever with respect to the relationships or the structure of those relationships proposed as part of the Tribune acquisition.""
Shares of Sinclair, the largest U.S. local broadcast station operator, closed down 4 percent at $26.30 a share on Thursday and are down 20 percent since FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said on Monday he had ""serious concerns"" about the deal. Tribune shares closed down 4.6 percent at $32.49 a share on Thursday.
Tribune, which owns or operates 42 broadcast stations, said on Thursday it ""will be greatly disappointed if the transaction cannot be completed, but will rededicate our efforts to running our businesses and optimizing assets.""
Tribune Chief Executive Peter Kern told employees in an email the deal is on hold pending the review. Tribune or Sinclair can terminate the merger agreement if it is not completed by Aug. 8.
Three FCC officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters it is almost certain that Sinclair will have to withdraw its bid in light of the hearing. 
Sinclair said on Wednesday it will drop plans to divest stations in Dallas, Chicago and Houston to ""expedite"" the transaction after the FCC suggested the company would still control the stations.
The FCC, which voted 4-0 to send the issue to a hearing, suggested that three Tribune stations being divested were being sold at below-market prices to entities with close ties to Sinclair. 
Sinclair had proposed to sell WGN in Chicago to Maryland auto dealer Steven Fader, a longtime business associate of Sinclair Executive Chairman David Smith, and would largely continue to operate the station under a services agreement. Instead, Sinclair said it would acquire WGN. 
Sinclair also said it was withdrawing plans to sell stations in Dallas and Houston to Cunningham Broadcasting Corp, a company controlled by the estate of Smith's mother. Sinclair said on Wednesday it now wants to put the two Texas stations into a divestiture trust to be sold and operated by an independent trustee.
The FCC said Sinclair did not ""fully disclose facts,"" including the pre-existing business relationships between Fader, Smith, and Sinclair nor the full entanglements between Cunningham, Smith, and Sinclair.""
The FCC said the $60 million purchase price for WGN ""appeared to be significantly below market value"" and noted that Fader is CEO of a company in which Smith has a controlling interest. The FCC also noted Sinclair would have owned most of WGN's assets and would have been able to buy back the station in the future.
""Such facts raise questions about whether Sinclair was the real party in interest ... and attempted to skirt the commission's broadcast ownership rules.""
The FCC said it questioned ""the legitimacy of the proposed sale of such a highly rated and profitable station in the nation's third largest market to an individual with no broadcast experience, with close business ties to Smith and with plans to own only the license and minimal assets.""
Critics of Sinclair's deal for Tribune wrote a letter to Tribune's five-member board of directors on Thursday arguing that the company should pull out of the planned transaction.

The group included the advocacy group Public Knowledge and Sports Fans Coalition Inc.

1.  General Electric  , Honeywell Earnings Eyed
Corporate earnings will continue to weigh heavily on market direction amid a lack of top-tier economic data on the calendar for Friday.
Quarterly earnings from both General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) due Friday will likely garner the most attention amid a slew of earnings from several companies including Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, State Street, SunTrust Banks and others.
General Electric, which has undergone a revamp under the stewardship of CEO John Flannery, reports second-quarter results before market open.
General Electric is expected to report earnings of 17 cents a share on revenue of $29.23 billion.
The industrial conglomerate's guidance for full-year 2018 earnings will likely be closely scrutinized after the company said in its first-quarter earnings call that earnings per share (EPS) will likely trend toward the lower end of guidance.
GE's aviation segment will also warrant close attention as it was one of the main factors that supported profit growth in the first quarter.
General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock closed 0.15% lower at $13.73.
Honeywell, meanwhile, is expected to report second-quarter earnings of $2.01 a share on revenue of $10.82 billion.
2. Will Microsoft Earnings, Revenue Beat Lift Nasdaq?
Shares of Microsoft rose modestly during afterhours trade, as the tech giant topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines amid double-digit revenue growth across all segments.
Microsoft reported earnings of $1.13 cents per share on $30.09 billion in revenue. That was above Wall Street estimates of $1.08 per share on revenue of $29.21 billion.
A uptick in its more personal computing segment boosted quarterly performance, as the segment saw revenue grow to $10.8 billion for the quarter, up 17% from the same period a year ago.
Microsoft’s cloud business continued to strengthen as Azure, a competitor of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, showed robust growth as product sales soared 89% for the quarter.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock rose 0.24% to $104.75 in afterhours trade.
3. US Rig Count Data; Oil Prices Recovery in Focus
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production, which hit a record high last week, a government report showed.
U.S. oil output rose by 100,000 barrels last week to a record 11.0 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.
Data last week showed the rise in U.S. oil rigs steadied at 863, unchanged from the prior week.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude contract for August delivery, which expires on Friday, settled 70 cents, or 1% higher at $69.46 on Thursday amid falling U.S. and Saudi output.
U.S. oil prices, however, are set to post a second weekly slump after falling more than 4% on Monday on comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, hinting at the prospect of the U.S. providing waivers to some Iranian crude buyers."
937,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 04:06PM ET</span>",Trump slams EU over $5 billion fine on Google,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday criticized the European Union over a record $5 billion fine EU antitrust regulators imposed on Google, saying the bloc was taking advantage of the United States.
EU officials on Wednesday also ordered Google to stop using its popular Android mobile operating system to block its rivals, adding to trade tensions between Washington and Brussels. 
Trump took to Twitter over the decision: ""I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!""
In an interview aired on Sunday by CBS, Trump labeled the EU a ""foe"" with regard to trade. 
Two former antitrust enforcers said it was unusual but not unheard of for officials to comment on decisions by enforcers in other jurisdictions.
""This is totally counterproductive. Whether or not you like the result, this is law enforcement in Europe and we wouldn't like anyone interfering with law enforcement in the U.S.,"" said Gene Kimmelman, a Justice Department veteran now with advocacy group Public Knowledge. ""I see it doing no good for Google or anyone else.""
William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission who teaches at the George Washington University Law School, agreed it was unusual but not unheard of.
In 2015 former President Barack Obama said in an interview with Recode that the EU was sometimes ""more commercially driven than anything else"" in its probes of U.S. tech companies, including Google.
In 1997, former Vice President Al Gore took up the cudgel against the EU on behalf of a planned merger of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and McDonnell Douglas, saying that the United States was ""watching the outcome of their (EU) deliberations extremely carefully,"" the New York Times reported at the time. The deal closed in August 1997. 
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House next Wednesday to discuss trade and other issues. 

Google said it would appeal against the EU decision. The 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) fine is nearly double the previous penalty that the company was ordered to pay last year, but it represents a little more than two weeks of revenue for its parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Kimberly-Clark weighs sale of European tissues business: sources,"By Harry Brumpton and Martinne Geller
(Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) is exploring a sale of its European tissue business, as it tries to slash costs and combat slowing sales by exiting less profitable areas, according to people familiar with the matter.
The maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers has contacted private equity firms to gauge their interest in acquiring the business, which is likely to fetch above 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), the sources said.
Kimberly-Clark's European portfolio includes toilet paper brands Andrex in Britain and Ireland, Hakle in Austria and Switzerland and Scottex in Belgium, Italy and Spain. 
It was not immediately clear whether any potential divestment would also include the European licenses for brands sold both in Europe and elsewhere, such as Kleenex and Cottonelle, though the standard practice would be to include them, three of the sources said. 
The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Kimberly-Clark declined to comment. 
Kimberly-Clark is one of many packaged goods companies grappling with a fast-changing landscape being rocked by the rise of e-commerce, challenger brands and changing habits. 
Earlier this year, the company said it would consider exiting some lower-margin businesses, chiefly in the competitive consumer tissue segment, which is battling higher commodity costs and private label manufacturers.
The Irving, Texas-based company also said it planned to close or sell 10 of its 91 factories worldwide and cut 5,000 jobs - about 13 percent of its workforce - as it strives for more than $2 billion in cost cuts by 2021.
This would not be the company's first retreat from Europe. In 2012, it quit the diaper business in most of Western and Central Europe to focus on what it saw at the time as faster-growing regions such as China, Brazil and Russia.
In Western Europe, the retail tissue market - which includes tissues, toilet paper, napkins and paper towels - was worth about $14.7 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International. It ranks Kimberly-Clark second, with a 10 percent market share, behind Sweden's Essity (ST:ESSITYa). 

Europe has been tough for Kimberly-Clark, as it vies for shopper loyalty against other multinationals with deeper European focuses such as Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR).

939,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Blackstone seeks to boost assets with new fundraising 'super cycle',"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), the world's largest manager of assets such as private equity and real estate, is kicking off a fundraising ""super cycle"" which could see it manage more than half a trillion dollars in assets, its chairman and CEO Stephen Schwarzman said on Thursday.
Blackstone has faced questions from investors in recent years over how much room it has to grow further after increasing its assets under management five-fold since it became a publicly listed firm in 2007, amassing $439.4 billion as of the end of June. 
This has left it with $88 billion in uninvested capital, yet Blackstone still plans to begin raising new flagship private equity and real estate funds in the coming months, Schwarzman said.
""We expect our fundraising super cycle to bring the firm's total assets under management above the $500 billion milestone, likely in the first half of next year,"" Schwarzman said in an investor call.
Blackstone Chief Financial Officer Michael Chae said the New York-based firm could amass around $300 billion in new fund capital between 2017 and 2019.
A growing asset base will boost the amount Blackstone earns from management fees, typically 1.5-2 percent of the assets it manages. These fees tend to be valued at a premium by investors because they are considered more stable than performance fees, Blackstone's other main revenue stream. Blackstone is paid performance fees when investments are successful. 
The private equity industry raised a record $453 billion in 2017, as investors sought returns that beat the stock market.
Overall, Blackstone reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly distributable earnings, which it uses to pay dividends, as asset sales slowed even as many of its funds appreciated much more than the stock market.
Its buyout funds increased in value by 9.5 percent in the second quarter, significantly outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index's (SPX) 2.9 percent rise.
Distributable earnings fell to $700.1 million from $781.4 million on a decline in total proceeds from asset sales, which help drive performance fees. Still, Blackstone declared a quarterly dividend of 58 cents per common unit, including a 10 cent special dividend. This compared to 54 cents a year ago when there was no special dividend.
Blackstone shares were down 1.7 percent in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, lagging the wider market.
Economic net income per unit, which reflects the mark-to-market valuation of gains or losses on Blackstone's portfolio, rose 55 percent to 90 cents from 58 cents a year ago. Analysts expected 75 cents, according to  Thomson Reuters  I/B/E/S.

In January, Blackstone agreed to buy a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of  Thomson Reuters Corp  (N:TRI) (TO:TRI), the parent of Reuters News, in a $20 billion deal. Reuters News will remain part of Thomson Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who claimed her cancer was caused by using Johnson & Johnson's baby powder for decades said she believes justice was served after a jury found the company should pay her and 21 other women $4.69 billion in damages.
A St. Louis jury on July 12 concluded that J&J's talc-based products contained asbestos, causing the 22 women, six of whom have died, to develop ovarian cancer.
J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky earlier this week expressed confidence that the jury decision will be overturned on appeal.
""Justice has been served"" regardless of the ultimate outcome, Toni Roberts, 62, told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""We have made a difference. We have alerted the public,"" said Roberts of Philadelphia, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2014. 
New Jersey-based J&J, which is battling some 9,000 talc product liability cases, has consistently denied that the products cause cancer and says they never contained asbestos. The St. Louis trial was the first to allege asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer.
J&J has successfully overturned prior verdicts in the talc litigation.
A company lawyer told Reuters J&J would argue on appeal that the case was based on flawed science, and that it should not have been heard in Missouri because many of the defendants were from out-of-state. A 2017 U.S. Supreme Court decision severely restricted state courts' jurisdiction over injury lawsuits brought by non-residents against out-of-state companies.
One of the women in the Missouri case, Krystal Kim, from West Chester, Pennsylvania, told Reuters she had been using J&J baby powder several times a day since she was 10. The now 53-year-old Kim said she put the powder on bed sheets, carpets, her hair, face and body and even on her dog.
Kim said she put her faith in the brand because of its promise of purity. ""They call it baby powder to make it seem innocuous,"" she said. 
Kim and Roberts said J&J should take its talc-based powder off the market or add a warning label.
J&J has said those steps were unnecessary, citing scientific tests concluding talc does not cause cancer or contain asbestos.
During the trial, the company's lawyer, Peter Bicks, said J&J had deep compassion for the women, but that the company was not to blame for their diseases.

""Just because something terrible happened doesn't mean that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) had anything to do with it,"" Bicks said.

Private equity group TPG Capital, Poundworld's majority owner, put the discount retailer up for sale in May but it has failed to find a buyer.
Deloitte which earlier this month said that 145 stores would close, issued a statement saying all Poundworld's 335 outlets would close by Aug. 10. The distribution and head offices will also shut on Friday with the loss of 299 jobs, it said.
More than 4,100 people worked in Poundworld stores and when the administrators were appointed, it had a total workforce of about 5,100 people.
""We would like to thank all the employees for their continued support and commitment during this difficult time,"" joint administrator Clare Boardman said. ""We are keeping staff appraised of developments as they happen.""
Deloitte said talks would continue with interested parties for the potential sale of parts of the remaining business.

Poundworld, based near Wakefield, northern England, is the latest British retailer to be hit by rising costs, cash-strapped consumers and a shift to online shopping. It follows the collapse this year of Toys R Us UK, electricals group Maplin and drinks wholesaler Conviviality.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Trump administration proposes altering rule on drug rebates,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration has proposed a rule that would scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) website.
Bloomberg first reported the existence of the proposed rule, which comes as the administration works to implement a wide-ranging plan to lower prescription medicine prices. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday night sent the proposed rule to the OMB. 
Details of the proposed rule have not yet been made public, but its title on the OMB site refers to removing the safe harbor protection for rebates from the anti-kickback law.
The move is the first concrete sign that the Trump administration has started to review the legal status of these rebates since Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb raised the idea early this year that they should not be exempted from anti-kickback law. 
The anti-kickback law makes it illegal to pay an incentive for drugs or services that Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs cover. 
Shares of drug wholesalers such as AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK), and pharmacy benefit managers, including CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and Express Scripts (O:ESRX), fell slightly on Thursday on the move. 
The administration has placed blame on ""middlemen"" such as pharmacy benefits managers - which administer drug benefits for employers and health plans - and health insurers for driving up drug prices by demanding hefty rebates in exchange for the broadest access to patients. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Gottlieb have questioned whether rebates provided by drug manufacturers should remain protected by federal law. 
Health and Human Services and OMB did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
U.S. President Donald Trump made lowering prescription drug prices a top priority during his 2016 presidential campaign. In May, his administration unveiled a drug pricing blueprint that included broad proposals for lowering prices that largely spared pharmaceutical manufacturers and instead went after pharmacy benefits managers. Pharmaceutical stocks rose after the blueprint's release. 
JP Morgan analyst Lisa Gill said Wall Street overreacted to the proposal submitted on Wednesday because rebates are only one component of pharmacy benefits managers' profit streams.

""If there are any changes around rebates they can adjust other aspects of the pricing model to ensure they are being paid fairly for the value they are adding,"" Gill wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Out-of-favor U.S. industrial shares will get a chance to win over investors in the coming days as the companies report quarterly results and address concerns about escalating global trade tensions.
Trade disputes involving the United States and its trading partners, including China, have muddied the economic environment for large industrial manufacturers, which rely on business across the globe.
Investors will be paying close attention to management comments on how tensions may be impacting business.
""There are a lot of companies that have really been hit with these trade talks and that is going to be critical in how they are going to handle it,"" said Alan Lancz, president of investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates.
Second-quarter results pour in starting on Friday with  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Honeywell International Inc (N:HON), and continue next week with  Boeing Co  (N:BA), United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) and 3M Co (N:MMM). 
Early S&P 500 industrial reports have been strong, with eight of the first nine posting higher-than-expected earnings. Shares of airline United Continental Holdings (N:UAL) and railroad CSX Corp (O:CSX) soared on Wednesday following their results.
The sector, which accounts for 9.5 percent of the S&P 500's market value, is expected to have increased earnings by 16.2 percent for the quarter and revenue by 8.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That trails S&P 500 companies overall, which are expected to post a 21.5-percent rise in earnings and an 8.2-percent rise in revenue.
The S&P 500 industrial sector (SPLRCI), seen as a reflection of the economy's health, has underperformed the overall S&P 500 (SPX) this year, down 2 percent versus a 5 percent rise.

""Trade has really weighed on this sector, especially,"" said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) recently estimated industrials' financial results would be hurt more than twice as much as any other U.S. sector in the event of an escalated trade war with China.
A stronger dollar, which reduces the value of companies' foreign sales, cost concerns, and the lack of a major U.S. infrastructure spending package, also hurt the sector, investors said.
Industrial shares are now cheaper on a price-to-earnings basis, trading at 15.8 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, down from 19.5 times in January, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That is also a discount versus the S&P 500's 16.5 times valuation.
Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist with Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, said valuations ""have become more and more attractive in industrials.""

""We are hopeful that in the second half of the year we see a rebound,"" she said.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 01:12PM ET</span>",Comcast concedes to Disney in bidding war for Fox assets,"By Liana B. Baker and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) dropped its $66 billion bid for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) entertainment assets on Thursday but said it would still try to expand its international footprint by acquiring 61 percent of European broadcaster Sky Plc (L:SKYB), the remainder of which is owned by Fox. 
Comcast's withdrawal is a concession to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), which last month sweetened its offer for the Fox assets to $71.3 billion, in a bid to unite two storied Hollywood studios and several television networks under one corporate umbrella.
Comcast's move de-escalates one of the media industry's most high-profile confrontations, which pitted Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts against Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Disney CEO Bob Iger. However, it still leaves the two companies competing to expand in Europe via a bidding war for Sky, which is 39-percent owned by Fox. 
Fox has also made an offer for the 61 percent of Sky it does not own, although Comcast is currently the highest bidder with a 14.75 pounds-per share-offer, worth $34 billion, for the London-listed pay TV group.
Shares of Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, rose 2.7 percent as investors were relieved the company did not try to outbid Disney further. Disney shares were up 1.6 percent. 
Fox shares fell 1.2 percent and Sky ended down 1.5 percent. One of the reasons Comcast dropped its bid for the Fox assets was that the bidding war was inflating the value of Sky, given its partial ownership by Fox, according to sources familiar with the company's thinking. 
""Walking away from the battle for Fox at this price we think supports the view that (Comcast is) fine without it,"" said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research. ""It remains to be seen how Sky wraps up, but we think it is highly unlikely that they would bid up to a price that would suggest desperation."" 
In a regulatory filing last week, Fox and Disney acknowledged for the first time they may not try to again outbid Comcast on Sky, though the sources stressed no decision has been taken.
Bernstein analysts have said Disney's debt pile could now hamper its ability to take on Comcast with a new bid for Sky, partly because it will need to invest even more to launch a successful direct-to-consumer streaming platform. 
Disney and Fox did not immediately reply to requests for comment. On CNBC, Disney's Iger said he was ""extremely pleased with today's news."" Fox and Disney shareholders will vote on their deal next week. 
Comcast dropped its bid for the Fox assets because it was concerned the price was becoming too high, even though its banks were ready to finance a new bid, according to the sources. It was also worried how much revenue it would lose in divesting assets to appease U.S. antitrust regulators. 
""I'd like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company,"" Comcast's Roberts said in a statement on Thursday.
Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and ""Star Wars"" producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group with FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels, plus Fox's stake in Hulu.
Immediately before the acquisition by Disney, Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly-listed company that it will spin off to shareholders.
SKY'S THE LIMIT
The bidding between Comcast and Disney is part of a bigger battle in the entertainment industry as media giants splash out tens of billions of dollars on deals to be able to compete with Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
While an acquisition of Britain's Sky, a broadcaster of sports, films and TV shows to 23 million homes across Europe, would significantly diversify Comcast's business overseas, it would do little to give it scale in its core U.S. market.
""Our view is that probably there is less chance of Fox/Disney coming back with an increased offer for Sky given that Comcast would have more available firepower,"" said Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker.
Nevertheless, Sky shares ended trading at 15.09 pounds on Thursday, above Comcast's 14.75-pound-per-share offer, as investors continued to bet on a better deal. ""I don’t think Disney wants to give up Sky,"" said Crispin Odey, whose eponymous hedge fund owns Sky shares.
Comcast was drawn into a bidding war for Fox because of the scarcity of big media assets up for sale, given that the industry is dominated by powerful families and personalities reluctant to cede control. CBS Corp (N:CBS) and Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), for example, are tightly controlled by the Redstone family. 
However, smaller media companies could become acquisition targets.  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp  (N:LGFa) rose 5.2 percent on investor speculation it could become an acquisition target. Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc and MGM Studios Inc are also seen as potential targets. 

Comcast first made an offer for the Fox entertainment assets last November, but Fox decided to go with Disney, even if its bid was lower, because it believed a deal with Comcast would not win antitrust approval. The U.S. Department of Justice last month approved Disney's deal with Fox.

Trump said on Wednesday the United States might hammer out a trade deal with Mexico, and then do a separate one with Canada later. Talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement are moving slowly.
""From the outset President Trump has articulated a desire to do bilateral deals rather than multilateral deals so his comment wasn't a tremendous surprise,"" said David MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to the United States.
""(NAFTA) is a tripartite agreement, we'd like to keep it that way ... I am still fully confident we are going to end up with a trilateral deal and not two separate bilateral deals,"" he told a televised news conference in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.
Hanging over the NAFTA talks is Trump's threat to impose tariffs on auto imports, which would hit the highly integrated North American car and light truck industry.

MacNaughton said he was encouraged that major firms in the United States were now starting to speak out against the idea.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 12:21PM ET</span>","Wall Street dips on weak earnings, strong dollar","By Amy Caren Daniel
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday after a slew of weak quarterly reports dampened hopes of a robust earnings season, with a strengthening dollar and trade tensions also weighing on.
The dollar hit a one-year high on Thursday, boosted by the Federal Reserve's bullish view of the U.S. economy. But the gains in the greenback dragged on metal prices and could hurt companies that get a chunk of their revenue from overseas.
Earlier this week, Netflix (O:NFLX) said the strong dollar impacted its results and U.S. multinationals are starting to reevaluate their currency hedging strategies.
""On most people's minds is the strength of the dollar and it has been pushing new highs over the past 24 hours,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK) fell 6.13 percent after saying the loss of two clients will continue to hurt results, while insurer Travelers (N:TRV) dropped 3.3 percent after missing profit estimates due to storm-related losses.
The financial sector (SPSY) fell 0.96 percent, the most among the 11 S&P sectors. The materials group (SPLRCM) followed with a 0.90 percent drop as metal prices fell.
Trade tensions loomed over the markets, with the European Union saying it was preparing a list of imports to hit if the United States imposes tariffs on EU cars.
A group representing major automakers said U.S. tariffs on cars and car parts could raise vehicle prices by $83 billion. Ford (N:F) fell 0.5 percent and General Motors (N:GM) skid 1 percent.
At 11:33 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 78.43 points, or 0.31 percent, at 25,120.86, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 7.89 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,807.73 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 13.85 points, or 0.18 percent, at 7,840.59.
Still, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.25-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.24-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
Traders are looking at 2,800 point-mark on the S&P as a break-out level, Antonelli said .
Market optimism was also dented by disappointing earnings reports from eBay (O:EBAY), slumping 8.2 percent, Phillip Morris (N:PM), falling 4.5 percent and  American Express  (N:AXP), down 2 percent.
Among the bright spots was  IBM  (N:IBM), which gained 3.4 percent, after its results topped estimates.
Comcast (O:CMCSA) gained 3 percent after dropping its pursuit of a group of media assets owned by Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA), which fell 1.6 percent.
 Disney  (N:DIS), which has agreed on a deal to buy the Fox assets, rose 3.2 percent.

The S&P index recorded 17 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 74 new highs and 24 new lows.

Wells Fargo charged monthly fees for these products ranging from pet insurance to legal services that customers did not fully understand, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is probing the matter, according to the report. 
Wells Fargo said in its latest quarterly filing that there was an ongoing review of ""add-on"" products across the company, adding it had started remediation efforts where it had identified impacted customers.
The lender has been trying to recover from a sales scandal for close to two years now. 

It has acknowledged opening millions of accounts in customers' names without their permission, signing others up for unwanted auto insurance, charging some for a mortgage rate-lock feature they did not request and tacking other costly add-ons to accounts.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Boeing sees foreign orders making 40 percent of defense sales in a decade,"By Mike Stone and Andrea Shalal
FARNBOROUGH (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace giant  Boeing Co  (N:BA) could generate more than 40 percent of its defence sales from international customers in a decade, the head of international sales told Reuters.
Boeing is the world's largest planemaker and its commercial backlog is nearly 10 times that of its defence business. The company on Thursday said it won 528 new orders and commitments for commercial aircraft at the Farnborough Airshow this week.
International demand for weapons and defence products and services is also increasing steadily, Gene Cunningham, Boeing's head of international sales, said in an interview.
Boeing's Defense, Space & Security business had a backlog of $50 billion with 36 percent destined for non-U.S. customers, the company said on its first quarter earnings call. That compares to $415 billion in commercial backlog.
Over the next 10 years, Cunningham said, ""We see the international (sales) number growing to somewhere in the 40 percent range, but we also see the company growing.""
Big wins in the domestic defence sector could alter that forecast, he said.
Boeing is focused on several large competitions in Europe, including Germany's push to buy around 90 new jets to replace its ageing Tornado fleet.
Germany has said it will prioritise a purchase of more Eurofighter jets, but is also looking at Boeing's F/A-18E/F and F-15 fighter jets, as well as  Lockheed Martin  Co's (N:LMT) stealthy F-35 fighter.
Boeing is also eyeing a potential sale of Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters to Poland as a part of the ongoing KRUK competition that could be decided in 2019. Cunningham said Poland could order about 32 choppers, although numbers have ranged from 16 to 64.
Boeing is also eyeing Switzerland's competition for a new fighter jet, Cunningham said. 
Under its Air2030 programme, Switzerland is seeking to procure new combat aircraft and ground-based air defences in a programme valued at up to 8 billion Swiss francs ($8.08 billion).
Switzerland needs to replace its fleet of Boeing McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C and D Hornets and outdated Northrop (N:NOC) F-5 Tigers, all of which are scheduled to be retired in the 2020s. 

Boeing has annual revenues of about $95 billion dollars.

967,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Trade war won't hurt sovereign ratings, but dollar might: Fitch","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The global trade war kicking off between the United States and China will not trigger a spate of credit rating downgrades, Fitch's top sovereign analyst says, but the dollar's growing strength could.
The recent imposition of tariffs between the world's two largest economies and the threat they could reach $200 billion means a trade war has gone from ""a risk to a reality"", Fitch's head of government ratings James McCormack told Reuters.
It has changed the firm's overall view of the world. Fitch had hoped the trade tension might blow over, but now believes it could wipe as much as 0.5 percentage points off U.S. economic growth and probably the same off Chinese growth too.
While that certainly isn't healthy, the developments on their own however shouldn't cause a mass wave of downgrades.
""I wouldn't anticipate it to be honest on a trade war alone,"" McCormack said.
""The U.S. is on the strong side of triple A,"" he said, adding that U.S. debt as a proportion of its GDP would have to rise somewhere between 20-35 percent before Fitch's in-house model started flashing downgrade warnings.
China's A+ rating should also be able to handle it, although there are some caveats.
""Weaker growth in itself wouldn't bring the (China) rating lower, it would be a policy response to weaker growth to try to prevent that.""
""In other words, another run up in credit growth such that the corporate debt stock got larger and concerns about the imbalances got larger - that would be a rating issue.""
Some signs of that old reflex are starting to emerge. But even zooming out to the global list of countries that could see tariff increases, there are hardly any obvious rating cuts in store. 
Mexico is one that could see one, but it faces the specific threat of the NAFTA trade pact being unravelled. Its new government could also potentially roll back energy reforms which have helped its finances since being introduced.
Could that move the rating outlook to 'negative' on its own? ""Potentially yes."" McCormack said. ""It depends on the magnitude of the changes and what the government wants to do."" 
Scrapping NAFTA, meanwhile, would certainly be damaging. One example cited was that 9 percent of Mexico's exports to the United States are ""light"" trucks. Under NAFTA there are no tariffs, without it they would be an eye-watering 25 percent.

DOLLAR UP, RATINGS DOWN
More broadly the bigger risk for emerging market ratings in particular is the ongoing rise of the dollar. 
The greenback hit its highest level in a year on Thursday, having surged 7 percent since April and for four months in a row, a run not seen for over 3 years.
There is a 20-year pattern of downgrades for poorer countries whenever the U.S. currency strengthens and their FX reserves drop. EM ratings fell 1-1.5 notches on average between 2013 and 2017 when the greenback surged 30 percent.
It could mean a turnaround for emerging market ratings which had only just started to creep higher again. Fitch's overall balance between positive and negative rating 'outlooks' has just gone back into negative territory again. 
""We think what might happen to the dollar is a more important question (than the trade war one),"" McCormack said.
""When EM dollar income is growing faster than local currency income, in that environment we are tending to upgrade sovereigns when it is the other way round we are tending to downgrade sovereigns. That is the relationship that has always held."" 
There are plenty of other country by country issues to judge, too. Turkey, which remains on a downgrade warning, needs to refinance over $200 billion of debt between its government and companies this year. That is more than all other emerging markets.
Mexico has its NAFTA issues, while on the plus side Brazil's economy looks to ""have turned a corner"", and South Africa's rating ""has stabilized"" thanks to a potentially ""meaningful"" change in policy direction by the government.
With the dollar so dominant though it is the broader EM strains that McCormack was wary of. 
""The rhetorical question is whether we have seen the peak (of rating upgrade cycle) for emerging markets,"" he said.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Aviation industry urged to hire more women as staff shortages loom,"By Andrea Shalal
FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Executives from top aerospace and aviation companies called on Thursday for stepped-up efforts to attract more women, saying this could help solve looming shortages of pilots, mechanics and top managers in the traditionally male-dominated sector.
The industries are coming under scrutiny because of the low numbers of women employed as senior executives or airline pilots. At the same time, a growing shortage of pilots is putting the sector's recent growth at risk.
The head of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, caused a storm last month when he said that a woman could not do his job, although he later apologised, saying his comments had been intended as a joke and were taken out of context.
Charlotte Pedersen, chief executive of Luxaviation Helicopters, a private aviation operator, said urgent action was needed since the sector faced a potential ""huge gap"" in management capacity in a decade as current executives retired.
""We can't just recruit from half the population,"" Pedersen, the first female pilot in the Danish air force, told a panel discussion at the Farnborough Airshow.
Marnie Munn, an airline captain with easyJet (L:EZJ), told the conference that only three to four percent of pilots globally were women.
Jane Basson, chief of staff to Airbus CEO Tom Enders, said women now accounted for 17.5 percent of the company's workforce of 140,000 but that was just a tick up from 15 percent in 2005.
""It's not progressing fast enough,"" she said, adding that her company was now using data analysis tools to understand why it was proving so difficult to recruit and retain women.
In addition, she said Airbus (PA:AIR) was using tools such as smart phone applications to provide encouragement and support to workers, but could tailor those to reach women specifically.
Hundreds of industry executives attended the panel, with many signing a UK charter that commits organisations to support promotion of women to senior roles, set their own targets and report on their progress to boost accountability.
More than 50 aviation and aerospace companies with operations in Britain have signed the charter, and the number is growing, said Katherine Bennett, a senior vice president with Airbus. It is modeled on a similar pledge in the finance sector.
Signatories also agree to have a senior executive oversee diversity efforts, and to link pay of senior executives to meeting internal targets on gender diversity and inclusion.
Budget airline easyJet has a target that 20 percent of its new pilots should be female by 2020 and British Aviation Minister Liz Sugg said other firms were taking similar steps.
But more work was needed to close pay gaps that often exceeded 50 percent in the aerospace sector, add women to corporate boards and recruit more female pilots, she said, noting that women make up just 5 percent of pilots at UK-registered airlines.
""We really do have a long way to go before these barriers disappear altogether. There are fundamental gender issues in aviation and aerospace,"" Sugg said.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",France to bolster anti-takeover measures amid foreign investment boom,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - France wants to tighten takeover rules to protect companies deemed strategic as it walks a fine line between preserving a surge in investments and preventing its technology falling into the hands of foreign powers like China and the United States.
In a wide-ranging business bill to be debated in the autumn, President Emmanuel Macron's government is proposing to widen the scope for state intervention and substantially increase the use of ""golden shares"" to protect national interests.
Under the proposals, the finance minister could impose fines on investors who fail to seek prior approval to buy stakes in French companies deemed of strategic importance. These could be as high as 10 percent of the targeted company's annual revenues, according to a draft seen by Reuters.
The minister could also suspend investors' voting rights or appoint a special trustee as part of the protective measures.
The move comes after several national champions such as train-maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) changed flags in recent years under deals that many political heavyweights deemed unfair or detrimental to the state.
 General Electric 's (N:GE) acquisition of Alstom's power division - whose turbines equip all of France's nuclear reactors -  Technip  (PA:FTI)'s merger with U.S.-based FMC Technologies (N:FTI) and Chinese investors' increasing influence in Peugeot-Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) are other recent examples.
They triggered intense national discussion over the means the government had to fend off such buyouts and led to parliamentary inquiries that questioned the absence of a U.S.-style legislative apparatus. In the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, has far-reaching powers to intervene and block foreign takeovers.
While Macron is a former investment banker and advocate of free trade, he has shown willingness to head off foreign acquisitions when national interests may be at stake -- he temporarily nationalized French shipyard STX in July 2017 to prevent it falling into foreign hands, although he later approved its acquisition by Italy's Fincantieri (MI:FCT).
He has pushed for the creation of European corporate champions, but has been criticized by opposition lawmakers for breaking with a long tradition of protecting France's corporate jewels. 
""This is a doctrine which, because it believes in free trade, knows that free trade cannot tolerate naivety,"" said Stanislas Guerini, a member of the president's majority in parliament and part of Macron's inner circle.
BOOMING FOREIGN INVESTMENTS
The proposed anti-takeover legislation, which would increase powers given in a 2014 decree, is expected to be widely backed by a parliamentary majority and approved when it comes to a vote towards the end of 2018 or early 2019, Guerini said. Macron's party holds an outright majority in parliament.
A boom in foreign investment since Macron came to office has fuelled the sense of urgency. Direct investments by both the United States and China jumped by more than 25 percent in 2017, according to trade agency Business France.
Assets to be covered by the special powers will be identified in detail at a later stage by decree. But the government has already indicated that the scope would be extended to the fields of artificial intelligence, microchips, space technology and data storage.
Golden shares, which give special voting rights and the ability to block potential takeovers, could be distributed to the companies in France's state-shareholding portfolio if national interests are considered at risk.
Firms in which France's state investment bank Bpifrance holds more than 5 percent would also be included, meaning companies ranging from carmakers PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to airline Air France-KLM (PA:AIF) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) would fall under its umbrella.
Lawyers interviewed by Reuters praised the ""golden share"" tool as it allows debt-ridden France to sell part of its national jewels to generate cash while retaining influence.
""The full range is now comprehensive and efficient. It allows (the state) to cover all types of situations,"" said Pascal Bine, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
Investors have been more ambivalent. ""It's very protectionist,"" said Loic Dessaint, CEO of Proxinvest, a shareholder advisory firm. ""But the French government has not made an excessive use of its control prerogatives (in recent cases).""
Colette Neuville, head of an interest group representing minority shareholders, said: ""I am less opposed to this kind of thing than I was a few years ago.""
The draft legislation stipulates that the list of companies that qualify for the ""golden share"" protection could not be extended after the law's adoption.
EUROPEAN TREND
France is not alone in seeking to tighten rules on takeover by overseas buyers in Europe.
Germany, which was spooked by the acquisition of robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) by China's Midea (SZ:000333), became the first European Union country to tighten its rules last year and is now looking at lowering the threshold at which it can intervene.
Its new regulations allow its government to block moves that present a risk of critical technology being lost abroad.
Italy passed a law last year to protect companies from hostile takeovers after French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) sharply increased its holding in broadcasting firm  Mediaset  (MI:MS) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
European Union leaders agreed last year to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.
A draft EU law that would limit the ability of non-EU firms to acquire companies and technology in the bloc remains under discussion.

The cable provider said it would instead focus on  its fight with Fox for the British broadcaster Sky. 
Comcast had entered a bidding war with Disney for some of 21st Century Fox's assets excluding the Fox News and Fox Business channels.  Disney raised its offer on June 20 for the assets to $38 a share, or a total of $71.3 billion in cash and stock.
""I’d like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company,"" Brian Roberts, Comcast's CEO, said in a  statement. 
Comcast originally held back on bidding for Fox's production assets until a federal judge approved AT&T (NYSE:T)'s so-called vertical merger with Time Warner. A Comcast-Fox merger, like a Disney-Fox merger, would have been similarly vertical by combining a distributor with a content producer.
The Justice Department last week moved to  appeal the decision to clear the $85 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner. It had argued that the deal would reduce competition and raise prices.
Comcast's most recent offer for Sky values the broadcaster at £26 billion ($34 billion), up from its previous offer of £22 billion. 21st Century Fox had bid £14 a share for Sky.
Comcast shares gained nearly 3% in premarket trading, while Disney rose 1.2%. "

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar stayed strong but stocks wobbled and metal markets buckled badly on Thursday, as signs that China was resorting to credit-fuelled stimulus again helped drive its currency to a one-year low.
Asian shares had struggled following the moves and Europe's bourses were mostly in the red as traders banked some of the recent gains that had hoisted the STOXX 600, DAX and France's CAC40 to 1-month highs. (EU)
Wall Street was expected to ease off a 5-month high (N), while Britain's Brexit-bruised pound was below $1.30 for the first time in ten months, as mixed retail figures added to constant political turmoil and Wednesday's weak inflation data. 
The yen at 113 per dollar, euro at $1.16 and most other European currencies were all weaker too. Instead of politics, though, they fell because they could not fend off another advance by the dollar which is now near a 1-year high on an aggregate basis. [FRX/]
""Sentiment right now is still very much in favor of buying the dollar,"" said Crédit Agricole FX strategist Manuel Oliveri.
""It is positively correlated with risk appetite and risk appetite remains supported by the U.S. earnings season and there is a very strong notion among clients that there is further room for improvement.""
That appetite had got its latest boost as S&P 500 rose to its highest in more than five months on Wednesday, the Dow Jones climbed for a fifth session and the 'FANGs' group of big tech giants hit fresh all-time highs. (N)
Ongoing trade jitters and developments in China however meant Asia had been a different picture.
China's central bank plans to incentivise banks to expand lending to companies, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, a proposal that points to another shot of stimulus.
China's foreign-exchange regulator meanwhile said it would keep currency markets stable amid intensifying trade frictions with the United States.
The worries had pummeled the yuan to a one-year low of 6.7800 per dollar and 6.7427 in offshore and onshore trade. (SS) 
The technology-heavy Shenzhen Composite stocks index shed 1.0 percent and Shanghai Composite index fell 0.6 percent to head back towards a 1-1/2-year low it had set earlier this month. (SS)
""Market players are looking at both the onshore and offshore exchange rate to determine whether or not the People's Bank of China is intentionally allowing a weaker yuan,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
""If the difference between the two markets becomes too big, that could mean the PBOC is intervening in the market.""
She noted that although the spread between offshore and onshore yuan had widened recently, it was still far from the levels it hit during the Chinese financial market shock in 2015 when the central bank was seen intervening heavily.

Metals markets were also in the firing line again. China is the world's biggest consumer of most industrial metals so worries about its economy can have a serious impact.
Copper and nickel were both down over 2 percent on London's metal exchange, while zinc was down more than 3 percent and lead shed 2.5 percent. [MET/L] 
Oil and gold also dropped again. Gold hit another one-year low of $1,215 per ounce, while Brent and WTI U.S. crude futures were down 80 and 53 cents at $72.10 and $68.20 a barrel respectively.
Brent has fallen almost 9 percent from last week's high above $79 on emerging evidence of higher production from Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia and the United States.
""The outlook remains negative,"" said Robin Bieber, technical analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
In the fixed income markets the expectation that the United States will continued to raise interest rates this year lifted its 2-year bond yields, which move inverse to the bond's price, to a new decade high. [/US]

Italy's short-dated yields meanwhile tumbled to a one-month low with traders citing reports that the country's new prime minister has said that its euro membership was irreversible. That helped dampen worries caused anti-euro rhetoric during its recent election campaign. [GVD/EUR]

Danske shares fell as much as 10 percent on Wednesday after it released disappointing second quarter results and said it would forgo up to 1.5 billion Danish crowns ($234 million) made in profits from ""suspicious"" transactions at its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
The bank has admitted to flaws in its anti-money laundering controls in Estonia and has launched its own investigation, the results of which are expected in September.
Referring to Wednesday's share price drop, New York-based Rosen Law Firm said in a statement it was looking into the possibility of launching a class action lawsuit on behalf of Danske's shareholders over allegations the bank ""may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.""
Danske's spokesman Kenni Leth said in response: ""It is our opinion that we have complied with the rules in connection with the publication of our interim financial statements.""

Analysts say semiconductor firms like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are vulnerable because they often send their computer chips to China for assembly, testing and packaging.
That makes them subject to U.S. tariffs on chips when they re-enter the country.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could be affected if the Trump administration follows through with tariffs on networking equipment, which is used in the companies' cloud computing operations.

Detour said it had asked the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) to investigate Paulson, accusing it of ""concerning and unlawful behavior."" Paulson called the accusations ""false and misleading.""
The hedge fund, run by billionaire John Paulson, has threatened to replace the company's board if it does not successfully explore strategic alternatives, including a sale, and look for a new chief executive. It owns 5.4 percent of Detour Gold. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Paulson & Co issued a statement saying Detour Gold had received a buyout offer from another gold miner, but had failed to disclose it publicly. That sparked a 13 percent rise in Detour's shares. 
Paulson said it was informed of the offer in an unsolicited letter by the company's interim CEO last week.
In response, Detour Gold said it had not received any offer and did not have a sale process in place.
""Detour Gold Corporation notified the Ontario Securities Commission of concerning and unlawful behavior undertaken by Paulson & Co and has asked the OSC to investigate,"" the company said in a statement. It said it had filed the complaint before the hedge fund released Wednesday's statement. 
Detour added that it believed Paulson & Co's actions constituted ""serious misconduct"" under securities laws and said Paulson's possession of non-public information was due to its own actions.
In a further statement issued later on Wednesday, Paulson & Co said that Detour Gold's statement was ""false and misleading.""
""We were in contact with the OSC prior to the issuance of our press release from earlier today and provided it with the unsolicited written communication"", the hedge fund said, adding that it will support any probe by the regulator.

996,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 06:09AM ET</span>",Exclusive: General Electric's power unit faces threat in Saudi Arabia,"By Alwyn Scott and Stanley Carvalho
NEW YORK and ABU DHABI (Reuters) - One of  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) largest and most valuable customers, Saudi Arabia, is lining up competitors to bid against GE for lucrative power plant work, according to five people familiar with the situation.
State-controlled Saudi Electricity Co (SE:5110) (SEC) has qualified at least two companies - Power Systems Mfg LLC and Combustion Parts Inc - to provide service or parts for some of SEC's more than 50 GE-made F-class turbines, and is in talks with two others over investments to set up facilities to service the SEC plants over many years, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The qualifications for the first time puts SEC in position to break GE's hold on that work by having others bid against GE on maintaining the F-Class fleet - among the largest owned by a single entity and among the most lucrative service portfolios in the industry - when the existing contracts come up, according to the sources and industry databases. 
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, has grown increasingly cost conscious, and under its ""Vision 2030"" reform plan it aims to reduce oil dependence, lower state budget deficits and create jobs. The kingdom also wants to obtain the best possible prices on large contracts with big companies, according to a source with direct knowledge of SEC.
The utility is in the process of getting other companies involved in bidding for power plant services, rather than relying on GE as the sole provider, because qualifying competitors will lower prices, the source said.
Saudi Electricity Co previously created competition for an earlier-generation of turbines known as the E-class, according to the sources. After bidding began, GE ended up with less work and prices for the work fell by about 40 percent, sources said.
One side effect of Saudi Electricity Co qualifying third-party firms to repair its F-Class is that it is large enough to enable competitors to set up operations that they could use to sell the parts and repair services to customers outside Saudi Arabia, potentially threatening portions of GE's service business globally, three sources said.
For bidders, qualifying also provides inroads to selling to other utilities and even other industries because SEC is seen as technically sophisticated and other companies would rely on its qualification, one of the sources said.
SEC declined to comment, as did Power Systems Manufacturing, a unit of Ansaldo Energia SpA of Genoa, Italy, and San Diego-based Combustion Parts Inc.
In response to questions from Reuters, GE said: ""At present, GE's F-class units in SEC continue to be covered under long-term service agreements.""
GE Chief Executive John Flannery has said service revenue is important to restoring growth to GE's power business, where profit fell 45 percent last year. The division, which makes equipment for gas, coal and nuclear power plants, is coping with a steep drop in orders for new plants.
As a sign of its emphasis on increasing its own service revenue, GE in May posted videos on YouTube saying it is offering high-tech upgrades to turbines made by rivals  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (T:7011).
Saudi Electricity Co has not yet offered any substantial F-Class contracts to new bidders, and it is unclear how soon it intends to seek bids, the sources said. One source with knowledge of GE's service history in Saudi Arabia said some F-Class turbines that SEC purchased more recently may not be under long-term agreements because the service price was high, and those could be opened for bidding by SEC at any time.
In addition to PSM and CPI, two other service companies said they are in talks to qualify to work on SEC's F-Class plants: Chromalloy, based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and Al Masaood John Brown, in Dubai. Both said they already work on SEC's E-Class turbines.
Al Masaood John Brown shareholders have approved investment to enable it to repair certain F-Class components at its Dubai facility. It plans to present this to SEC as a way of ""kick starting"" the formal pre-qualification process, General Manager Brian Waddell said in an email.
Chromalloy said it is considering a large investment to enable it to work on SEC's F-Class turbines for the long term. 
""We're definitely willing to make that commitment and are in discussions with SEC on that,"" said spokesman Jeff Romaine. 

""We're looking at doing parts repairs or manufacturing of parts for the long term,"" he added. ""That's what SEC is asking us for.""

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus was set on Thursday to win a much-needed endorsement for the A330neo from its largest buyer as AirAsia prepared a long-distance finale to the Farnborough Airshow.
This week's air show has been dominated by a flurry of unidentified orders swelled by leasing companies which reached almost $50 billion on Thursday, as well as public orders for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus jets from AirAsia's Vietnam rival VietJet.
The A330neo has been hit a series of market losses to the newer Boeing 787, leaving Airbus dependent on AirAsia to restore momentum in the upgraded long-haul plane.
The ongoing battle for sales in that part of the market was underscored on Thursday when Boeing said it had firmed up an order for at least 10 787s from Hawaiian Airlines, which it secured after the airline canceled an order for the A330neo.
AirAsia, Asia's largest budget carrier, said it would hold a news conference in Kuala Lumpur for a ""major announcement related to developing long-haul operations"".
People familiar with the matter said AirAsia was expected to reconfirm an order for 66 of the upgraded wide-body A330neo, which it had threatened to cancel in favor of Boeing's 787 in a rift between Airbus and its largest Asian customer.
AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes, a regular at airshows but who did not attend Farnborough this year, was also expected to expand the A330neo deal by around 30 aircraft to bring the order close to 100, worth $30 billion at list prices, they said.
But the planemaker's hopes of securing an additional order for 100 A321neo from AirAsia appeared to have been dashed.
Airbus and AirAsia declined to comment.

Airbus meanwhile won a provisional order for 10 A320neo jets from SaudiGulf, industry sources said. Airbus announced the order on Thursday without identifying the name of the buyer.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Anbang prepares to sell overseas properties worth $10 billion - sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd is looking to offload overseas properties worth about $10 billion to shore up its balance sheet as part of a government-backed rescue, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
The sales are likely to begin within a month, said the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with media. New York's Waldorf Astoria, bought in 2014 for $1.95 billion, is not part of the sale, they said. The hotel is currently closed for renovation.
The sales come as the government pays increased attention to debt-laden firms with overseas investments. Some conglomerates, such as HNA Group Co Ltd and Dalian Wanda Group Co Ltd have recently sold foreign real estate to pay down debt.
Anbang has been one of China's most acquisitive companies, signing over $30 billion of deals in recent years. But in February, the government said it would take control of the insurer for at least a year, accusing management of illegal activity which it said put the firm at risk.
Former Chairman Wu Xiaohui, who masterminded the overseas deal spree, was sentenced in May to 18 years imprisonment for fraud and embezzlement. He is appealing the conviction.
Bankers and analysts have since been expecting Anbang to undergo restructuring involving asset divestment before the government seeks investors for re-privatization. However, neither the size nor timing of any sales was known until now.

The company has been charged by Tokyo prosecutors for allegedly violating Japan's Unfair Competition Prevention Act, Kobe Steel said in an emailed statement. 
Kobe Steel, which supplies steel and aluminum parts to manufacturers of planes, trains and automobiles around the world, admitted to supplying products with falsified quality specifications to more than 600 customers. 
It said the data fraud had been going on for nearly five decades.
""We are taking this matter brought against us very seriously. The entire Kobe Steel Group is working together sincerely and straightforwardly to carry out preventive measures and is making every effort to restore trust,"" the statement said.

The scandal, which led to similar revelations from a number of other companies, undermined faith in Japan's industrial sector. Kobe Steel is also the subject of a probe by the United States Department of Justice.

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 05:28AM ET</span>",SoftBank's Son says Japan is 'stupid' to disallow ride-sharing,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son blasted Japan on Thursday for not allowing ride-sharing services, calling it ""stupid"" and saying the country was lagging overseas rivals in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI).
""Ride-sharing is prohibited by law in Japan. I can't believe there is still such a stupid country,"" Son said at an annual company event aimed at customers and suppliers.
The comments reflect Son's frustration with Japan where he built SoftBank's domestic telecoms business, the cash engine that has powered his investments. The group has, however, focused its growing range of technology investments overseas.
Son has also been highly critical of the government previously when SoftBank was still a fledgling telecoms service trying to break up a cosy duopoly in Japan.
""A country that gives up on the future has no future,"" Son told attendees at the SoftBank World event, saying Japanese business is lagging behind countries such as the United States and China in employing AI.
Japan outlaws non-professional drivers from transporting paying customers on safety grounds and the country's taxi industry lobby has vigorously opposed deregulation.
Its strict rules have confined ride-sharing firms to providing limited services, with SoftBank and China's Didi Chuxing saying on Thursday they will trial a taxi-hailing service - matching users to pre-existing taxi operators - in Osaka beginning autumn of 2019. Uber is also piloting a taxi-hailing service.
When asked for a response to Son's comments, a spokesman for the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport said that an issue with ride-sharing services was that while the driver was in charge of transporting passengers, it was unclear who was in charge of maintenance and operation.
""The ministry believes that offering these services for a fee poses problems from the points of both safety and user protection, and careful consideration is necessary,"" he said.
HOME-SHARING CURBS
Ride-sharing is not the only service in Japan feeling the impact of government restrictions. Strict new rules on home-sharing came into force last month that have radically reduced the number of lettings on sites such as Airbnb Inc.
The curbs on Japan's nascent sharing economy come despite a rapid rise in the number of inbound tourists likely to access such sharing services, and at a time when Japan is wanting to show its international face ahead of hosting the Rugby World Cup next year and the Summer Olympics in 2020.
While Son, an ethnic Korean born in Japan, has at times criticized the Japanese government, he can also be politically suave. He has praised U.S. President Donald Trump with warm words and pledged to invest billions of dollars and create thousands of jobs in the United States.
SoftBank and its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund have invested in ride-sharing firms Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Didi, India's Ola and Southeast Asia's Grab, as well as in other technology companies. 
The event on Thursday saw presentations from executives at portfolio companies including Didi, General Motors' autonomous vehicle unit Cruise and India digital payments firm Paytm E-Commerce Pvt Ltd. 

Artificial intelligence is the common thread linking these companies, Son said, with that technology in the future able drive vehicles, diagnose diseases and power financial services.

Kerkhoff was named acting CEO after Heinrich Hiesinger resigned this month. Chairman Ulrich Lehner also quit this week, removing a leadership duo that had resisted investor calls to restructure the industrial conglomerate. [nL8N1UD2IA]
Kerkhoff should be seen only an interim solution, Elliott said in a letter sent to the company's supervisory board.
""Shareholders expect an unbiased search for a new external CEO, driven by what is best for the company and all of its stakeholders, including shareholders,"" the letter, which Elliott made available on Thursday, said.
Elliott said Kerkhoff's installation as interim CEO provides the company with a measure of stability for the company. 
""However, this interim period must be kept short so that Thyssenkrupp may quickly be set on a path to prosperity and growth,"" Elliott said.
Thyssenkrupp should continue on a path of ""structural evolution"" Elliott said, explaining that it had never demanded a wholesale dismantling of the conglomerate and that it was very disappointed with the terms of a deal struck with  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC). 
Elliott has a stake of below 3 percent in the German company according to its latest filing. Swedish activist investor Cevian also holds an 18 percent stake.
Elliott urged Thyssenkrupp's management to distance itself from remarks made by Lehner, the outgoing chairman, who in an interview with the Die Zeit weekly accused activist investors of engaging in ""psycho terror"".
Elliott denied it had harassed families and neighbors of Thyssenkrupp executives, or spread lies, and that it had merely acted as a concerned investor, the letter said. 
""It would be appropriate for the company and the supervisory board to distance itself from Professor Lehner's defamatory remarks by publicly stating that the company does not support them and does not view them as truthful,"" the letter said.

1009,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",Trade Alarms Ring Louder for G-20 as Risk of Protectionism Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- Global economic growth is poised to pick up this year, though the alarm bells about trade are getting louder.
That’s the backdrop for central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations who gather July 21-22 in Buenos Aires. It’s the first meeting of the club that oversees 85 percent of the world economy since President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China and the European Union, sparking retaliation in the first salvo of a global trade war.
Financiers and business leaders from G-20 nations cautioned about the repercussions of increased protectionism ahead of this weekend’s meetings. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said trade barriers threaten productivity and wages, while BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). boss Larry Fink warned intensifying tensions could spur a broad market downturn.
“Global growth has reached an inflection and tipping point, with signs that the escalating U.S.-China trade war is starting to disrupt business and investment,” said Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte in Singapore.
That disruption hasn’t yet dented global growth, which is poised to pick up to 3.9 percent in 2018 -- the fastest expansion in seven years, according to July forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.
Bigger Concern
The bigger concern is that tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and its trading partners will gnaw at confidence and eventually hurt business investment and consumer spending. For JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, the tension is so far “affecting psyche more than it is economics,” which can have “unpredictable outcomes.”
The trade war has been building for some time. An early warning sign was the March 2017 G-20 meeting in Germany -- the first for U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -- when members dropped from the official communique a pledge to avoid protectionism. Mnuchin said at another gathering a year later that the U.S. was “loud and clear” in its message. Trump had announced levies on global steel and aluminum imports just days before.
Since then, the U.S. has slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, with another $16 billion likely to follow and an additional $200 billion under consideration. Beijing has retaliated on $34 billion of U.S. goods, saying it will fight back against any further levies. Separately, the U.S. and EU are in a tit-for-tat battle over American metal tariffs, while Trump has threatened to erect barriers against European cars.
The tariffs are hitting supply chains and boosting prices just as some major economies show signs of decelerating.
China’s gross domestic product grew at the slowest pace since 2016 in the second quarter, while key readings on investment gains and industrial output eased in June. The IMF in its July forecasts cut 2018 growth estimates for the euro area and Japan, cautioning that global output could drop roughly 0.5 percent below its projected level by 2020 if threatened trade barriers become reality.
While the numbers point to modest deceleration, the trade clash with the U.S. has only just begun.
Trade Bellwether
South Korea, considered a bellwether for global trade, is showing signs of strain. June exports fell 0.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 2.2 percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and both the Bank of Korea and finance ministry this month trimmed their growth outlook. The softening in Asian exports is a clear warning sign, said Robert Subbaraman, Singapore-based head of emerging markets economics at Nomura Holdings Inc.
“If this growth cushion starts to give way, as we expect, watch for Asia’s market risk premium to rise more sharply,” he said.
Meanwhile Latin American economies may grow increasingly inward looking, as new governments in Mexico and Brazil are likely to focus on domestic issues rather than regional integration, the IMF’s Western Hemisphere Director Alejandro Werner said Tuesday.
Markets don’t fully reflect concerns that trade tensions will derail global growth. The U.S. S&P 500 stock index has increased 5.3 percent this year, while the STOXX Europe 600 Price Index has slipped just 0.5 percent. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has dropped 7.6 percent in 2018 after surging 35 percent last year.
Businesses, however, are finding it difficult to ignore the trade tensions. U.S. central bankers say their business contacts are expressing concerns over tariffs, with Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard reporting “full-throated angst” from companies in his district.
“Businesses are becoming a lot more dissatisfied,” said Nick Wall, portfolio manager at Old Mutual Global Investors. “That might soften the rhetoric. Trump cares about business, cares about the stock market, and this might rein him in a little bit.”

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 11:06PM ET</span>","Speakers, TVs, Kleenex in demand on Amazon Prime Day","By Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Online shoppers purchased more than 100 million products worldwide during Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) annual Prime Day sale this week, despite glitches on its mobile app and websites that prevented several customers from placing orders.
Prime Day has become a major shopping event in the annual calendar for retailers, rivaling the Thanksgiving holiday's Black Friday as a driver of sales and most retailers now run their own special promotions to coincide with the 36-hour sale.
Amazon said its sales topped those for the Prime event a year ago as well as those for Cyber Monday and Black Friday, but it gave no breakdown of the value of sales or of the scale of discounts it had applied.
Having touched a record high that valued the company at $900 billion, almost double than a year ago, shares in Amazon fell back to trade marginally lower on Wednesday.
""Given Amazon's prodigious spending, it is safe to say that any day compared to the prior year should be much better from a sales perspective,"" Moody's analyst Charles O'Shea said. 
""The continuing challenge for the company (is) driving margin and profitability in its retail business.""
The world's largest online retailer said it recorded the largest daily sales for its Echo range of smart speakers, helped by heavy discounts. Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and Echo Dot were the best-selling devices.
Other top-selling products around the world included table salt in India, Coke Zero and Kleenex tissues in Singapore and electric toothbrushes in China. 
The company gave no details on the impact of technical glitches on the day. Wall Street analysts said there were problems with executing sales for at least two hours, likely due to excessive the volume of user traffic. 
RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said the sale probably generated between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in revenue.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 11:06PM ET</span>","Billionaire James Packer quits 22 boards, deepens corporate withdrawal","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Billionaire James Packer has resigned 22 Australian company directorships in the last few weeks and no longer holds any board seat in his home country, corporate records show, signaling his almost full retreat from public business life.
The major shareholder of casino operator  Crown  Resorts Ltd (AX:CWN) cited mental illness as the reason for his quitting that firm's board in March, following a tumultuous period in his life, which included a break-up with singer Mariah Carey and the failure of Crown's expansion strategy.
He quit the board of his private company Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH) on June 27, and corporate records show he resigned from 19 other directorships on the same day, plus another two since.
Packer, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $4.1 billion, has quit 24 Australian company boards this year. 
""The changes are largely administrative in nature and reflect attempts to modernize and simplify the corporate structures,"" a spokesman of Packer's flagship CPH said by email on Thursday.
His retreat is all the more remarkable because for generations, and most of the 20th century, the Packer family has been a fixture of Australia's media business scene. 
The 50-year-old James is one of Australia's highest profile businessmen and a household name who has previously served on the boards of some of the country's biggest companies, from Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) to Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd (AX:NEC) and Seek Ltd (AX:SEK), where he was an early investor.
Packer's father, Kerry, inherited media interests from his own father, Frank, in 1974 and built them into a publishing and television empire - which James sold a decade ago in order to form Crown, a casino firm. 
He built it up before quitting as a director in 2015 amid heavily publicized personal upheaval including a brief engagement to Carey. 
Packer rejoined Crown's board a year later during a period of turmoil for the company when a dozen and a half of its employees were jailed in China for alleged breach of gambling marketing laws there. 
""Mr Packer is suffering from mental health issues. At this time he intends to step back from all commitments,"" CPH had said in March, when Packer quit Crown's board.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A European Union antitrust judgment against Google on Wednesday invites more competition from software developers including  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Samsung Electronics Co (KS:005930), but still leaves them at an disadvantage, industry executives and analysts told Reuters.
The EU found that the Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) unit illegally bolstered its dominance in the mobile business since 2011 by forcing Android device makers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser together with its Google Play app store, paying them to pre-install only Google Search, and blocking them from using modified versions of Android.
The ruling aims to open the door for Samsung, Lenovo Corp and other phone makers that have been tied to selling devices full of Google applications to start using some alternative software from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon without the device losing too much of its consumer appeal, according to EU press statements and EU sources on condition of anonymity. 
Smartphone vendors could even charge the other software makers to have their browsers or search engines set as the default on Android smartphones, said Ian Fogg, vice president of analysis at OpenSignal, which helps wireless carriers map their networks. 
Phones that feature Amazon's Alexa search or Microsoft's Bing search throughout should still be able to pre-install popular Google apps such as Google Maps or YouTube as the EU envisions it, EU sources said.
Microsoft, Amazon, Samsung and Lenovo declined to comment.
Users may opt to replace the new defaults with Google search or Google Chrome apps anyway, but at least some would stick with the default options, according to the EU. 
But the top smartphone makers are hesitant to promote inferior alternatives, an executive at one high-end Android device maker said on the condition of anonymity. Smaller hardware firms lack the market share to significantly affect Google's business, the person said.
Google also can continue to pay hardware makers to be the exclusive search provider, the business from which it derives most of its revenue, on a device-by-device basis. The EU did not specify any limits on Google's ability to outbid smaller players in search such as DuckDuckGo.
Google is ""systematically set to continue to dominate the industry,"" said Robert Marcus, a former member of Microsoft's mobile strategy team and now general partner at investment firm Quantum Wave Capital.
The ruling should give smartphone makers the ability to develop phones based on Fire OS, a version of Android customized and distributed by Amazon, the EU press statements said.
Google has allowed third parties to make such ""forks"" of Android, as they are termed in the industry, but it limited their adoption through licensing restrictions, the EU found.
The issue remains, though, that the EU did not specify that Google must provide its apps to smartphones with ""forks"", meaning that Fire OS phones could continue to lack services such as Google Maps, industry analysts said. 
The omission leaves the industry with an ""observation"" rather than offering a ""prescription"" that puts the forks on equal footing, said Kumar Shah, managing director at investment firm Transit Capital and a former leader at Indian smartphone maker Micromax. 
Instead, the EU said Google could maintain ""fair and objective"" restrictions on devices to which it does supply apps.
Smartphone vendors who try to adopt forks may also not be welcome by wireless carriers, who are focused on the rollout of high-speed 5G networks and do not want ""handset makers distracted by side issues,"" Fogg said. 
Google must stop the illegal practices within 90 days to avoid fines, or it can seek a delay of the order while it appeals. 

Google has not said how it would adjust practices if it loses the appeal nor whether it would make changes in the EU only or globally.

(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) on Wednesday reported second-quarter profit and revenue that topped analysts' expectations as it benefited from growth in higher-margin businesses including cybersecurity and cloud computing.
Under Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty,  IBM  has been focusing on an array of new technologies ranging from artificial intelligence to cloud computing as it tries to offset weakness in its legacy business of selling hardware and software.
The newer businesses, which are spread across its various divisions, have been bundled into what the company calls ""strategic imperatives"". 
Revenue from these businesses grew 15 percent to $10.1 billion in the second quarter, accounting for more than half of the company's total revenue. 
IBM Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said the company's investments to reposition itself have been paying off. 
""We accelerated our growth, really capitalizing on these emerging high value areas,"" Kavanaugh told Reuters.
Overall revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $20 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $19.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company's revenue has now risen for three straight quarters after falling for nearly six years.
Operating gross profit margin in the quarter slipped to 46.5 percent from 47.1 percent.
""One of the key components was as-a-service growth ... and as that scales through, you're starting to see margin expansion shine. Gross margin closed the gap,"" CFRA Research analyst David Holt said.
Net income rose to $2.4 billion, or $2.61 per share, in the quarter ended June 30 from $2.33 billion, or $2.48 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding items, IBM earned $3.08 per share, beating analysts' average expectation of $3.04 per share.

Shares of the Armonk, New York-based company rose about 2.5 percent to $148.13 in trading after the bell.

1015,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 07:31PM ET</span>",Trade-war concerns cloud New York City investment conference,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A prolonged U.S. trade war with China and Europe would dent global economic growth and force investors to reassess the profitability of U.S. companies, some of the biggest hedge funds and private equity investors in the United States warned at an investment conference on Wednesday.
Hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin, who runs $30 billion Citadel, said at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference that tariffs are ""damning to consumers, to companies, and to capital formation.""
Earlier this month the United States and China slapped tariffs on $34 billion of each other's imports in an escalating trade tussle that has roiled financial markets. The United States has raised the stakes in the dispute, threatening to slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items.
Griffin and the other investors sounded a nervous message on U.S. trade policies as many big investment firms this month prepare to release quarterly earnings reports that could eventually be impacted by the growing friction.
Howard Marks, co-chairman of $121 billion Oaktree Capital Group Llc (N:OAK), said tariffs and trade wars are now ""real issues"" a mere eight months after no one listed them as key problems for investors.
And Jonathan Gray, president and chief operating officer at $449 billion Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), said trade tensions, particularly with China, pose ""risks for all of us as investors.""
The money managers all spoke at the conference on Wednesday, two days after Laurence Fink, who runs $6.3 trillion investment firm BlackRock, warned that deepening trade friction could sufficiently unnerve investors to send markets tumbling as much as 15 percent.
U.S. President Donald Trump is largely perceived on Wall Street as a pro-business leader but his hard-line stance on trade could jeopardize economic gains created by his tax cuts, investors said.
""A prolonged trade war will slow global growth,"" Griffin said at the conference. ""We don't want to be with the tariffs,"" he added, saying they could hurt U.S. companies' ability to compete around the world. Investors might reassess the profitability of U.S. companies that would be hurt by the tariffs, the speakers at the event said.
Gray said there were big issues at stake but sounded a more optimistic note that differences could be resolved. ""There is a collective self-interest to try and resolve this,"" he said.
The same investment conference featured an appearance by Trump's senior economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who also addressed the topic of China and trade wars. Kudlow runs the National Economic Council.
While some investors had hoped Kudlow might use the occasion to dial back some of Trump's rhetoric and calm Wall Street's nerves, he backed his boss fully.
Although he told the audience of institutional investors and hedge fund managers that he is not a ""big fan of tariffs,"" he added he has long been a critic of China's policies.
Kudlow said the ball is now in China's court but noted that President Xi Jinping is not ready to compromise and is ""holding up the game."" 
Said Kudlow: ""Don't blame Trump. Blame China, blame Europe."" 

""At the moment the trade negotiations are kind of stalled,"" he said, noting he thinks the ""president is doing exactly the right thing.""

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 07:13PM ET</span>","Alcoa cuts adjusted EBITDA forecast citing tariffs, shares slide","(Reuters) - Aluminum producer  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) Corp lowered its forecast for adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2018 on Wednesday, citing U.S. tariffs on imported aluminum and rising energy costs.
The company's shares fell 2 percent in after-market trading, dragging shares of rival Century Aluminum Co down 1 percent.
Alcoa now expects adjusted EBITDA to range between $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion, compared to its previous forecast of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion.
U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on imports of steel and 10 percent on aluminum on countries including Canada and Mexico and the European Union that went into effect in June.
Alcoa said the tariffs led to an extra $15 million in costs in the reported quarter that were mainly levied on aluminum imported from Canada, its biggest supplier. 
The company operates 3 smelters in Canada which were not excluded from tariffs. Alcoa said it anticipates a negative monthly impact between $12 million and $14 million as long as the tariffs are in place.
Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey said on a post-earnings call with analysts that even if all U.S. curtailed capacity was back online, the U.S. would still need to import 60 percent of its primary aluminum needs from Canada. 
""In short, tariffs will not solve the challenges facing the aluminum industry."" 
On Wednesday, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.52 per share, and revenue of $3.58 billion for the quarter ending June 30 that beat Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Net income was reduced by $22 million due to rising oil and gas prices, and electricity prices in Spain, Norway and the Pacific Northwest, the company said.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 07:05PM ET</span>",Federal Reserve should ease rules for largest non-global U.S. banks: official,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should consider formally easing the regulatory framework for U.S. banks that have more than $250 billion in assets but are not global players, a top Fed official said on Wednesday.
The comments by Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles will be cheered by the country's three super-regional lenders PNC (N:PNC),  Capital One  (N:COF) and U.S. Bancorp (N:USB), which worried they would be hurt by a rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law passed by Congress in May that helped their smaller rivals.
That legislation eased oversight of U.S. banks with less than $250 billion in assets but did little for the largest U.S. lenders. Super-regional players were concerned that the changed regulations put them at a disadvantage by lumping them in with the global behemoths while giving their slightly smaller competitors a leg-up.
They lobbied successfully for the law to direct the Fed, the country's top banking regulator, to tailor regulations for firms above the $250 billion asset threshold but that are not globally systemically important banks or 'G-SIBs'.
In a speech on Thursday, Quarles said the regulator should quickly act on that direction and review the rules for super-regional banks, with the aim of devising a framework that clearly differentiates them from G-SIBs.
Quarles said the Fed should move to an expedited rule-proposal that could, for example, require less frequent ""stress-testing"" of super-regional banks, allow more flexible models for capital calculations and more finely calibrated liquidity requirements. 
""The supervision and regulatory framework for these firms should reflect that there are material differences between those firms that qualify as U.S. G-SIBs and those that do not,"" Quarles told a banking conference in his home state of Utah. 
""For example, we know that non-G-SIBs with more than $250 billion in assets are generally less complex and less interconnected than U.S. G-SIBs and thus pose relatively less risk to financial stability,"" he added.
Under the administration of President Donald Trump, who has pledged to cut red tape in order to stimulate bank lending, the Fed has made several proposals to change bank rules so as to make them more sensitive to banks' individual risk profiles.

""We have a unique opportunity to further tailor our supervision and regulation framework for large banks in a manner that allows us to be more risk-sensitive while still meeting our core goals of promoting safety and soundness,"" Quarles said.

(Reuters) - EBay Inc (O:EBAY) missed analysts' estimates for second-quarter revenue on Wednesday, as its online ticket marketplace StubHub had a disappointing quarter, leading the e-commerce website to forecast underwhelming third-quarter results.
The company's shares were down about 5 percent at $36 after the bell.
EBay blamed fewer games in major U.S. sporting events for lower ticket sales at StubHub. Even though StubHub revenue rose 4 percent to $246 million, it was its slowest growth since the second quarter of 2017.
""It was a historically bad MLB start of the season ... and it was a 4-game NBA series, it was a 5-game Final Series, it was a 5-game hockey series. There were just a lot of things that broke the wrong way on the landscape.,"" eBay Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig said on a post-earnings call.
Wenig added that he did not expect the landscape for ticket sales to get any better in the second half.
CFO Scott Schenkel also said he expects the stronger dollar — up 4 percent since the company's prior forecast — to hit revenue by $150 million for the full year.
EBay lowered its full-year revenue forecast to between $10.75 billion and $10.85 billion, from $10.9 billion to $11.1 billion earlier. Analysts were expecting revenue of $10.95 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Third-quarter revenue is also expected to be between $2.64 billion and $2.69 billion, missing Wall Street estimates of $2.73 billion.
EBay has been splurging on advertising brands available on its platform and on developing a more user-friendly format to better compete with the likes of Amazon.com (O:AMZN), but saw its efforts overshadowed by weak StubHub growth.
The online retailer is banking on initiatives like grouped listings, a way for buyers to find the items they are searching for faster, and a simplified payment process to help lure more online shoppers. 
The San Jose, California-based company had 175 million active buyers globally in the second quarter, compared to 171 million active buyers in the first quarter.
The company's gross merchandise volume (GMV), the value of goods sold on its websites, rose 10.4 percent to $23.63 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned 53 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30. Revenue rose about 9 percent to $2.64 billion.

Analysts on average had expected the company to earn 51 cents per share on revenue of $2.66 billion.

The department said last Thursday that it would appeal a federal judge's approval of the $85.4 billion acquisition.
AT&T, which owns pay-TV company DirecTV, said it did not oppose the expedited schedule.
The Justice Department filing seeks briefs to be completed by Oct. 18, with oral arguments ""as soon as practicable."" That would be a significantly faster-than-normal timetable for an appeals court to hear a case.
""In approving the merger, the district court rejected fundamental principles of economics, creating uncertainty that will have an outsized effect on vertical merger analysis,"" the Justice Department said in its filing. A vertical transaction is when a company merges with a supplier. 
""The United States therefore brings this appeal and seeks a swift correction of the district court’s errors,"" the filing said.
AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said last week that the company would win the appeal: ""We think the likelihood of this thing being reversed or overturned is really remote.""
The Justice Department sued AT&T in November, asking a court to stop its purchase of Time Warner, saying the deal would lead to higher prices for consumers. The merger, announced in October 2016, was also opposed by President Donald Trump.
But U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said last month it was legal and allowed it to move forward. The merger closed on June 14.
After the ruling, the Justice Department did not attempt to prevent the companies from closing the merger in June after AT&T said in a letter that it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until either February 2019 or the conclusion of the government's appeal.
Since winning in court, AT&T has raised the price for wireless customers with some unlimited data plans by $5 a month and informed customers it was increasing the price of its internet streaming service, DirecTV Now, by $5 a month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A threat by the U.S. government to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported auto parts could hit consumers in unexpected ways: higher repair costs, insurance premiums and even the theft of more cars for their parts, the industry said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has launched an investigation into whether auto imports pose a national security threat and threatened to slap the tariffs on cars from the European Union and elsewhere. 
A coalition of auto insurance groups said in previously unreported comments that hiking tariffs on imported auto parts by 25 percent could increase costs by 2.7 percent, or $3.4 billion annually, for personal auto insurance premiums. 
The U.S. Commerce Department will hold a hearing about the matter on Thursday.
Consumers will bear virtually all the higher repair costs, said the American Insurance Association, National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies and Property Casualty Insurers Association of America in comments jointly submitted to the Commerce Department. 
""The imposition of tariffs could likely lead to the filing of hundreds, if not thousands, of requests for rate increases by insurers with insurance regulators across all fifty states,"" the groups said.
Insurers said they might not be able to quickly get replacement parts for policyholders, ""resulting in delays and increased costs.""
""Motor vehicle theft rates could well rise, as many stolen vehicles are sold for their parts,"" the groups added. 
A Commerce Department spokesman did not comment Wednesday on the industry statements, but said the agency would send a report to the White House after ""collecting all the facts, and completing a careful analysis.""
""While we aim to complete the investigation and report to the President within a couple months, no proposal for action has yet been made,"" the department said. 
In separate comments to the Commerce Department, the Auto Care Association, which represents 150,000 manufacturers, distributors and sellers of motor vehicle parts and related goods, that its economic study estimated that the cost of car ownership would increase by more than $700 per year per household should the tariffs be imposed. 
Top executives of  Michelin  (PA:MICP) North America, Cooper Tire & Rubber (N:CTB), Sumitomo Rubber Industries (T:5110) said in a joint letter to the Commerce Department that rising costs for auto parts makes consumers ""wait longer before making a new car purchase or maintaining the safety of their vehicle."" 
""We are concerned that consumers waiting longer to replace their tires will result in increased traffic accidents and fatalities,"" they said.
Kristin Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research, said the tariffs will boost maintenance costs, since many parts regularly used for vehicles largely made overseas like air filters and water pumps.
""The costs of maintaining a car is going to go up as is fixing or insuring it,"" Dziczek said. ""But those costs are not going to go up as much as buying a new car"" with added tariff costs. 
Separately, a coalition of seven auto industry trade groups representing nearly every major automaker, auto dealers and parts companies said in a letter to Trump on Tuesday that the tariffs will be a ""massive tax"" on consumers, leading to ""increasing vehicle service and repair costs that may result in consumers delaying critical vehicle maintenance.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Erik Cetrulo, a former portfolio manager at Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management, is raising funds for a global macro discretionary hedge fund and is targeting a launch in the first quarter of 2019, two sources familiar with the situation said.
Entheos Capital Advisors formed its limited partnership in recent weeks, and is in early stage negotiations with potential seed and anchor investors, the sources said.
The macro fund - so-called because it bets on macroeconomic events across asset classes - will trade foreign exchange, global fixed income, global equity indices and liquid commodities. As a ""discretionary"" fund, it will construct portfolios based on a top-down, thematic view of global markets.
Cetrulo will be the chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Entheos, according to Cetrulo's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page. After a decade at Point72, he last worked as a global macro portfolio manager at Balyasny Asset Management. 
The investment team will include people formerly employed by Cohen's multistrategy firm Point72 as well as Ray Dalio's quantitative macro fund Bridgewater Associates, the sources said.
The head of macroeconomic research at Entheos will be Stephen Modelfino, who previously spent six years at Bridgewater, according to the sources.
Brian Cassese, a former senior analyst from Cetrulo's time at Point72, will also join the team. Joel Press of hedge fund consultancy Press Management and former head of Ernst and Young's hedge fund practice, will serve as an adviser on the operational side of the business, the sources said.  
The fund will employ quantitative macroeconomic strategies and market-based research, according to Cetrulo's LinkedIn page. 
Before February 2018, many discretionary macro hedge funds suffered in the low-volatility post-financial crisis environment. As volatility has returned to the market with the unwinding of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy and the rise in interest rates, discretionary macro funds have been outperforming the broader category of macro funds. 
Hedge Fund Research's macro Discretionary Thematic Index is up 0.77 percent in the year through June 2018, versus their broader Macro/CTA Index, which is down 1.81 percent over the same period. The research firm's HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index is down 0.85 percent in the year through June 2018.

The company has been bolstering its rewards programs as it tries to weather competitive pressures from big bank rivals, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).
New York-based AmEx, which has long catered to affluent customers, said it spent $2.43 billion on card member rewards, up 11 percent from a year earlier.
This pushed total expenses up 7 percent to $7.11 billion in the quarter.
Total revenue, net of interest expense, climbed 9 percent to $10 billion.
""Revenue growth was driven by broad-based increases in Card Member spending and fees,"" Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri said in a statement.
This is the company's first full quarter of results under Squeri, who replaced long-time boss Kenneth Chenault on Feb. 1.
Net income rose to $1.62 billion, or $1.84 per share, in the second quarter from $1.34 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier.

1. Smaller Banks Weigh in With Earnings
Financial stocks had a strong performance Wednesday and earnings in the sector will again dominate trading talk ahead of the bell Thursday.
The big-name banks have largely topped expectations and now investors will get a chance to drill down into the numbers for the smaller institutions.
Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stock climbed 2.9% Wednesday ahead of its report. Analysts predict the company will report a profit of $1.02 per share on revenue of a little more than $4.1 billion. Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) stock gained around 2.4%. It’s expected to earn 57 cents per share on revenue of about $1.6 billion.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX), KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), BB&T (NYSE:BBT) and  Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) will also issue numbers.
Insurer and Dow component Travelers (NYSE:TRV) is also on the earnings calendar ahead of Thursday trading.
The company is expected to report earnings of $2.43 per share and revenue of $6.92 billion. A lot of the attention will be on the rise in premiums for the quarter, according to Zacks.
2. Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Expected Slightly Higher
The most important economic numbers are scheduled before the open on Thursday, with data on the labor market and manufacturing on tap.
Initial jobless claims are expected to rise slightly to 220,000 for the week ended July 13 from 214,000 the previous week. The jobs market has shown continued strength without much of a jump in wages to exacerbate inflation concerns.
“With a strong job market, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the FOMC believes that -- for now -- the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said in remarks to the Senate Tuesday. He reiterated that position Wednesday before the House.
Also on the calendar, the Philadelphia Fed releases its estimate of July manufacturing activity. Economists expect that the index rose to 21.6 from 19.9 in June.
3. Oil Prices Show Resilience Despite Rising Stockpiles
Investors should keep an eye on oil prices, with the energy sector having a strong influence on overall market direction lately.
Oil prices took a surprising path on Wednesday, settling higher despite the Energy Information Administration reporting an unexpected rise in U.S. crude inventories.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery rose 1% to settle at $68.76 a barrel. Inventories of U.S. crude rose by 5.836 million barrels for the week ended July 13, confounding expectations for a draw.
The higher settlement in U.S. oil prices comes as oil observers continued to expect that major oil producers would have little room to address a potential global supply shortage.
OPEC countries have limited room to address any shortage and in the next 12-18 months the market will realize the U.S. can't support the entire market with spare capacity, RBC said earlier this week.

1031,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Notches Five-Day Winning Streak as Morgan Stanley Fuels Rally,"Investing.com – Wall Street closed higher Wednesday, led by sharp gains in industrials and financials as investors cheered mostly upbeat earnings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.32%. The S&P 500 gained roughly 0.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.01%.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock closed more than 2% higher, lifting the banking sector, after reporting earnings and revenue that topped expectations amid strong trading and investment business.
Financials were also boosted by a sharp rise in  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb) stock after the conglomerate tweaked its share buyback policy, raising expectations that the company would aggressively buy back shares after it reports second-quarter earnings on Aug. 3.
United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL) and CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), meanwhile, topped Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines, adding to the move higher in the broader market, as industrials surged.
The batch of upbeat earnings from U.S. corporates has shifted the trading narrative to earnings, overshadowing renewed threats from China warning that it was mulling new countermeasures against U.S. tariffs.
China’s Ministry of Commerce warned Wednesday of further moves in response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.
The announcement came as White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow blamed Chinese President Xi Jinping for the stalemate in trade talks, claiming Xi was ""holding the game up.""
Trade-sensitive stocks like Boeing (NYSE:BA) largely ignored the prospect of an escalation in the U.S.-China trade battle, closing nearly 1% higher amid a ramp up in new orders at the Farnborough Airshow.
VietJet announced it's buying 100 more Boeing 737 Max jets at the Farnborough Airshow. So far during the air show, Boeing has received orders and commitments of more than $70 billion at list prices.
The energy sector struggled to get behind the rally in the broader market despite a rise in U.S. oil prices on the back of a mixed petroleum report showing a surprise build in U.S. crude supplies. Product inventories declined.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for August delivery rose 1% to settle at $68.76 a barrel.
In economic news, housing starts slumped to a nine-month low, pressured by higher mortgage rates and elevated costs for labor and materials, government data showed.
Housing starts tumbled 12.3% to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.173 million units last month, the Commerce Department said.
On the political news front, U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly said that Russia is no longer targeting the United States with cyber attacks. This comes a day after Trump walked back comments about Russian meddling in the U.S. election.
Top Gainers and Losers on Wall Street Today:
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) were among the top Dow gainers for the session.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) were among the worst Dow performers of the session."
1032,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 04:35PM ET</span>","Europe hits Google with record $5 billion antitrust fine, appeal ahead","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European antitrust regulators fined Google a record 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) on Wednesday and ordered it to stop using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals, a ruling which the U.S. tech company said it would appeal.
The penalty is nearly double the previous record of 2.4 billion euros which Google was ordered to pay last year after its online shopping search service was deemed to be unfair to competitors. 
It represents just over two weeks of revenue for Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and would scarcely dent the company's cash reserves of $102.9 billion. But it could add to trade tensions between Brussels and Washington.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House next Wednesday in an effort to avert Trump's threatened new tariffs on cars made in the European Union as the president looks to reduce the U.S. trade deficit.
Alphabet, which is scheduled to report financial results on Monday, said it would set aside money to pay the fine which would cut its second-quarter profit by about $5 billion. Wall Street analysts were expecting $6.8 billion in quarterly profit on average before the fine, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Alphabet shares closed flat on Wednesday after technology analysts said the EU order would do little damage to the company's long-term prospects. 
CEMENTING DOMINANCE 
Google's Android system, which Google lets device makers use for free, runs about 80 percent of the world's smartphones, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. 
According to the EU, Google's illegal behavior dates back to 2011 and includes forcing manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser together with its Google Play app store on their Android devices, paying them to pre-install only Google Search and blocking them from using rival Android systems.
""Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine"" over rivals, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told reporters.
Google has 90 days to either halt such anti-competitive practices with smartphone makers and telecoms providers or seek a delay of the order while it appeals. Alphabet risks additional penalties of up to 5 percent of average daily global revenue for non-compliance.
Major Android smartphone makers including Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co, Sony Corp (T:6758), Lenovo Group Ltd and TCL Corp declined to comment on the EU case.
Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai warned that Android may not remain free as a result of the EU ruling or it may shift to a tightly controlled distribution model like rival Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
""We are concerned that today's decision will upset the careful balance that we have struck with Android, and that it sends a troubling signal in favor of proprietary systems over open platforms,"" Pichai said in a blog. 
The head of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday he would closely review the European decision.
'STABLE DOOR' 
Vestager dismissed Google's argument that it had competition from Apple, saying iPhones were not a sufficient check on Google's dominance because they cost more and require users to exert significant effort to adopt. 
""What would serve competition is to have more players,"" she said. 
Breaking up Google, a demand made by a number of Google foes, would not address the core problems, she told reporters.
GSMA, the global wireless carriers' trade body, welcomed the ruling, saying services developed by its members can now better compete with software vendors. 
Small Google search competitors such as Qwant and DuckDuckGo said they now stand better chance of getting promoted by device makers. 
Lobbying group FairSearch, whose 2013 complaint triggered the EU investigation and whose members at the time included competitors like  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL), Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), also welcomed the ruling, saying it could help restore competition in mobile operating systems and apps.
Industry analysts described the EU order as too late to reshape the industry.
""Any action by the EU is akin to shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted,"" said Geoff Blaber of CCS Insight.
Polar Capital fund manager Ben Rogoff said: ""The reality is that as long as they're delivering great utility to their consumers, consumers will still use those platforms,"" he said. 

A third EU case against Google, which has not yet concluded, involves its AdSense advertising service which is accused of blocking users from displaying search advertisements from Google's competitors. Google denies this.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Investment firms fight to inject cash in Brazil carrier Oi,"By Carolina Mandl, Tatiana Bautzer and Gram Slattery
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Three distressed asset funds have sued for the right to participate in a 4 billion reais ($1 billion) capital increase for Brazilian telecom Oi SA (SA:OIBR4) as part of its in-court restructuring, four sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters this week.
The fight for the chance to invest in Oi, Brazil's largest fixed line carrier, reveals a sharp turnaround in investors' perception of a company that flirted with liquidation a year ago. Brazil's consumer-led economic recovery and bets on industry consolidation have boosted interest in the company after three years of battles between shareholders and creditors.
A bankruptcy court judge responded to the lawsuits by authorizing participation in the capital injection for two of the funds, which were not party to the recovery plan approved by 16 investment firms at a December creditors meeting.
Marble Ridge Capital LP and Burlington Loan Management DAC, an investment vehicle managed by U.S. distressed debt hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management LLC, were cleared to take part in the operation.
U.S.-based Silver Point Capital LP had its first request denied by Rio de Janeiro judge Fernando Viana, because it sought a higher share of the capital increase than corresponded to the Oi debt in its possession before the creditors' meeting. It was unclear whether Silver Point was continuing its efforts in court.
Oi, Marble Ridge, Davidson Kempner and Silver Point all declined to comment on the previously unreported bankruptcy court filings and rulings.
Funds participating in the capital increase, which the company hopes to carry out by year-end, will receive a bonus of 8 to 10 percent of the amount they invest, either in cash or additional shares.
Oi collapsed under 65 billion reais of debt in 2016, kicking off Latin America's largest-ever bankruptcy protection proceedings. The contentious restructuring had U.S. and UK distressed debt hedge funds squaring off in courts on three continents.
A pivotal decision last December allowed most of the debt to be converted into equity, marking a rare bondholder win in Brazil's slow-moving bankruptcy courts. 
FUNDS JOCKEY FOR EQUITY
The debt-for-equity swap, scheduled for Friday, will convert tens of billions of reais in debt into an equity stake of about 70 percent of the reorganized company.
In a subsequent phase of the recovery plan, the new shareholders will inject an additional $1 billion into the company, further slashing its debt ratios.
The three largest shareholders after those two operations will be hedge funds GoldenTree Asset Management LP, York Capital Management Global Advisors LLC and Solus Alternative Asset Management LP, with a combined 28 percent stake in the company, according to the sources.
The sources requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.
Three other funds — Canyon Capital Advisors LLC, a vehicle managed by Canada's  Brookfield Asset Management  LLC (TO:BAMa) and another run by Davidson Kempner Capital Management — will hold a combined 15 percent, the sources added. 
GoldenTree did not respond to a request for comment on the stakes the firms will hold. The other funds declined to comment.
Next week, after the debt-for-equity swap is completed, the funds will set a date for a new shareholders' meeting to approve the capital increase and issue a list of 11 new board members.
People close to some of the funds believe the carrier has significant upside, despite corporate governance questions and a stalled effort to reform old telecom regulations.

Still, the company has its detractors. Over the last two years, while Oi has been stuck in bankruptcy protection proceedings, competitors such as the local units of  Telecom Italia  SpA (SA:TIMP3) (MI:TLIT) and  Telefonica  SA (SA:VIVT4) (MC:TEF) have gotten significant head starts in updating their mobile and broadband networks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Emerging market equities and real-estate debt remain attractive at a time when most of the year's gains in the S&P 500 have already been realized, billionaire investor Howard Marks said on Wednesday at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference in New York.
Emerging markets, in particular, have been ""significantly hit"" this year, he noted.
""How many things can you find today that are down?"" Marks said. 
The MSCI International Emerging Markets index, for instance, is down 7.6 percent year-to-date, compared with a 5.2 percent gain in the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index. 
Marks, the co-chairman of Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital, said that the U.S. bull market is nearing its later innings, though he noted that the corporate tax cuts passed in December have helped push valuations lower by increasing earnings growth.
As a result, his firm is ""trying to be fully invested but we are emphasizing caution,"" he said, and remains focused on single-B rated debt in the high-yield market.
Marks also cautioned that the popularity of exchanged-traded funds has helped push up the share prices of so-called FAANG stocks like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), and may leave investors exposed during a market downturn. 
In a tough market environment, the liquidity of ETFs ""will be shown to be illusory,"" he said. ""No investment vehicle can be liquid than the underlying"" securities on which it is based, Marks said about ETFs.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The Farnborough Airshow is typically one of the world's most publicity-focused business events, with plane giants and airline bosses battling to win headlines for deals signed under the roar of stealth fighter displays.
Not so this week, when Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) announced almost 300 orders from unnamed buyers, reversing the PR rulebook.
Airbus led the anonymous jetliner haul with almost 200 orders worth $24 billion at list prices, while Boeing said it had signed provisional deals with four unnamed customers for a total of 94 planes worth almost $11 billion at catalog prices.
Airbus declined to discuss the identity of the buyers, but industry sources said its list was dominated by Chinese-related leasing companies.
Chief Commercial Officer Eric Schulz linked the reticence to global trade tensions, telling analysts some Asian customers had asked Airbus not to fan growing disputes. ""Undisclosed or disclosed, either way the order is there,"" he said.
""If that is enough to make airline customers want anonymity, what might they do if the trade disputes were to escalate?,"" Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris commented in a note.
Several top delegates cautioned against overstating the link with trade tensions, however. Numerous factors are at play when deciding when to reveal order plans, such as waiting for board or government approvals, they said.
Winning the air show competition also has something to do with the sequence of announcements, two industry sources said. Airbus is behind Boeing in the race for orders this year.

Airbus listed orders for 80 A320neo narrowbody jets from an unidentified leasing company, another for 100 similar narrowbody aircraft, plus 14 large jets - eight A350-900 and six A330neo.
On Tuesday, Reuters reported that the first order for 80 aircraft came from China's ICBC Leasing.
Several industry sources said the largest order for 100 jets had been placed by Dublin-based global leasing giant Avolon, owned by China's HNA Group. 
An Avolon spokesman said: ""We are in constant dialogue with (manufacturers) and when we have an order to announce we will do that.""
Airbus is currently tackling payment delays from HNA Group which led to a backlog of undelivered wide-body A330 jets, first reported by Reuters last week.
One has been delivered and others are expected to follow.
Avolon is owned by HNA vehicle Bohai Leasing and made changes in its bond structure earlier this year to insulate itself from the parent group's financial difficulties.
Avolon CEO Domhnal Slattery told Reuters this week those measures were working smoothly, but did not discuss order plans.
Planemakers often strike deals during the rest of the year with customers shy about disclosing their identity, especially in countries like China with complex approval processes.
But when opting to announce at an air show, buyers are usually keen to promote their plans and firms like Airbus and Boeing invest in lavish facilities with space for briefings.
Some high-profile orders did get announced on Wednesday with Boeing bagging a provisional 100-plane order from budget carrier VietJet and Airbus confirming an order from Mexico's VivaAerobus after Reuters reported the two sides were negotiating a deal.
Market sources did not rule out a headline-grabbing finale.

AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes has left Farnborough in suspense over whether he would fly in from Malaysia to confirm an order for Airbus A330neo planes or defect to the Boeing 787, though he said earlier this week he had ""no plans"" to make the trip.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 03:08PM ET</span>","Audit faults U.S. oversight of auto safety recalls, Takata inflators","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A government audit released on Wednesday faulted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) oversight of auto safety recalls and said its ""delayed action"" may have delayed the expansion of a record-setting callback of millions of vehicles for Takata air bag inflators.
The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General said in an audit released to Congress Wednesday that NHTSA's management of vehicle recalls lacks proper oversight. The report found that in the massive Takata air bag recalls the agency did not follow its own procedures to address low recall completion rates and its ""delayed action to investigate"" complaints may have delayed the expansion of the recalls.
At least 23 deaths worldwide are linked to faulty Takata air bag inflators rupturing sending deadly metal fragments flying, including 21 in Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and two in  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) vehicles. 
NHTSA did not immediately comment Wednesday, but said in a letter with the report that it did not agree with all of the findings, but agreed to some recommendations sought by the inspector general's office.
""This is further evidence that the federal auto safety regulator isn’t doing enough to protect the public,” said U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee that oversees NHTSA. 
NHTSA has come under fire for years over its handling of prior auto safety issues, including sudden unintended acceleration issues in Toyota Motor Co (T:7203) vehicles and faulty ignition switches in General Motors Co (N:GM) cars.
This is the fourth audit by the inspector general's office since 2011 to criticize NHTSA. A 2015 audit said the agency failed to carefully review safety issues, hold automakers accountable, collect safety data or adequately train staff resulting in ""significant safety concerns being overlooked.""
NHTSA's letter released Wednesday said it remains ""concerned that the report may leave the public with misconceptions regarding NHTSA's oversight of recalls in general, and the Takata recalls in particular.""
NHTSA's letter said it has a third-party expert risk management review underway to improve its recall process.
The Takata issue has sparked the largest auto industry safety recall in history, involving about 100 million inflators among 19 major automakers that began in 2008.
The audit also said ""inadequate controls and processes for verifying and collecting manufacturer-reported information have hindered NHTSA’s ability to oversee safety recall implementation."" The audit projected that nearly 11 percent of auto vehicle recalls issued between 2012 and 2016 have missing remedy documents required by law.
On Friday, deputy NHTSA administrator Heidi King urged automakers to make their Takata recall plans public. In March, NHTSA said of 50 million U.S. Takata air bag inflators about 21 million defective air bags have been repaired.
The audit said NHTSA's ""minimal action to address low Takata recall completion rates and its poor oversight of manufacturers' reporting on recall risk may have contributed to the slow implementation of these recalls between 2008 and 2015.""

Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said the report confirms ""long-held concerns that NHTSA is failing the American public by taking a hands-off approach to recall oversight. The agency’s records indicate sloppy and incomplete documentation of manufacturer recalls, and it is well documented NHTSA does not enforce its own regulations pertaining to timeliness of recall and remedy reporting.""

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 02:39PM ET</span>",Wall Street traders set for best year since aftermath of crisis,"By Matt Scuffham and Rishika Dugyala
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street trading desks may have reached a post-crisis turning point, with revenue on track for the best year since 2011, second-quarter earnings reports from big U.S. banks showed.
Trading revenue gains of up to 17 percent helped JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) beat market expectations, and executives said they remained cautiously optimistic about the trading environment.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) was the only major bank to report lower trading revenue, citing challenges in fixed income markets.
Those five Wall Street banks generated roughly $44 billion in trading revenue during the first half of the year, a seven-year high when adjusting for one-time items, said Guy Moszkowski, bank analyst with Autonomous Research.
""There's been much more volatility,"" he said. ""It's been in fits and starts, but the thesis is still that customers are going to be more active.""
Bank executives expressed some faith robust trading conditions will persist.
Escalating tensions between the United States and major trade partners, combined with the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates again in September, could encourage investors to protect their portfolios or seize opportunities, they said.
""Despite the persistence of geopolitical and economic risks, the backdrop remains constructive,"" Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez told analysts on Tuesday.
He mentioned a stronger U.S. dollar, higher oil prices and shifts in bond yields as driving the bank's 24 percent trading revenue gain.
JPMorgan's finance chief, Marianne Lake, pointed to volatility in emerging markets and European sovereign debt to explain a 13 percent rise in trading revenue.
""There's just more catalysts in the market and, just generally, more client participation,"" she said.
Wall Street trading desks started to see their fortunes fade in 2010 as the huge relief rally that came after the 2007-2009 financial crisis dissipated.
New regulations on proprietary trading, derivatives and capital crimped big banks' trading profits in the following years, as did the popularity of passive investment products.
Market volatility has generally been subdued since 2011, apart from blips related to unexpected events like Switzerland's central bank doing away with a cap on the franc in 2015.
As Wall Street banks overhauled trading businesses and waited for markets to pick up, revenue tracked almost consistently downward since 2009.
The $71 billion in trading revenue generated last year by JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley compared with a peak of nearly $100 billion in 2009.
There have been differences in opinion about whether the business would ever fully recover.
Executives at Goldman Sachs have expressed more confidence than those at other banks, including rival Morgan Stanley. 
On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley CFO Jon Pruzan warned conditions could deteriorate later in the year due to seasonal declines and international flare-ups.
""Trade tensions, political uncertainties across Europe and the potential for an inverted yield curve, to name a few, are factors that remain at play,"" he said. 

Many consider an inverted yield curve to be a sign of a looming economic slowdown. The U.S. yield curve has flattened in recent months due to concerns over the global economy.

(Reuters) -  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) shares rallied on Wednesday after the conglomerate's board gave its billionaire chairman, Warren Buffett, more freedom to conduct stock buybacks and whittle down a $108.6 billion stockpile of cash.
The company's Class A shares climbed $14,470, or 5 percent, to $302,970 in afternoon trading, while its Class B shares rose $10.32, or 5.4 percent, to $200.73 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Berkshire announced late Tuesday that Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who make major decisions on allocating capital, may now repurchase stock when both believe the price is below Berkshire's ""intrinsic value,"" a determination that would be made ""conservatively.""
The old policy prohibited buybacks when the stock price exceeded 1.2 times book value per share, or assets minus liabilities.
Berkshire shares recently traded closer to a 1.4 times multiple. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company has not disclosed any buybacks since December 2012. 
""We're surprised that this took so long,"" wrote Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who rates Berkshire ""market perform.""
Shields called the old buyback policy ""almost obsolete,"" saying the recent slashing of the U.S. corporate tax rate materially boosted book value by reducing Berkshire's deferred tax liabilities but ""with almost no impact on intrinsic value.""
The cash hoard gives Buffett power to make what he calls ""elephant"" sized acquisitions of whole companies.
He has, however, lamented his inability to find an elephant since paying $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts in January 2016.
Buffett signaled a possible policy shift at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 5. He told shareholders that if Berkshire could not deploy capital effectively, buybacks based on intrinsic value might be a means to return capital to them.
""It'd be unlikely we'd do it by special dividend,"" he said. ""It'd be more likely we'd do it by repurchase if the repurchase didn't result in us paying a price above intrinsic value per share. We're never going to do anything that we think is harmful to continuing shareholders.""
Buffett in recent months spent some cash to build a more than $40 billion stake in iPhone maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
Berkshire said it will not conduct buybacks that reduce its cash stake below $20 billion. That provides a cushion for potential large claims losses at Berkshire's insurance units.

No buybacks under the new policy will occur before Berkshire releases second-quarter results, scheduled for Aug. 3.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mutual fund investors fled from stocks for the 14th straight week as ongoing trade war fears divided markets, Investment Company Institute data showed on Wednesday.
Withdrawals from equity-focused long-term mutual funds totaled $4.2 billion for the week ended July 11, ICI said.
The bearish sentiment among mutual fund investors ran counter to that of exchange-traded fund investors and the broader market. Equity ETFs saw net inflows of $1 billion during a seven-day period in which the S&P 500 added 2.24 percent.
Markets rose for four days on strong economic news before retracing some of the gains after Washington threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and Beijing warned that it would hit back.
Combined equity mutual fund and ETF withdrawals rose to a total of$36.9 billion since mid-June.
Ongoing investor demand for safety led to $7.4 billion in deposits to bond funds, the 21st straight week of inflows for the category.
Tax-free municipal bond funds saw the strongest demand since January, attracting $1 billion of investor cash, ICI data showed. Taxable bonds added $6.4 billion, the largest net deposit since April.
Commodity funds broke a five-week trend of outflows with $101 million in cash deposits.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 01:27PM ET</span>",Two become one? Planemakers work on tech to cut pilot numbers,"By Victoria Bryan and Jamie Freed
FARNBOROUGH, England/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Airplane manufacturers are working to adapt jets to reduce the number of pilots needed for long-haul flights and to build new cockpits designed for a single aviator in order to ease a global pilot shortage and cut airline costs.
Airbus SE and Thales SA expect the number of cockpit crew on long-haul flights, typically three or four, could be reduced to two from 2023 thanks to new technology to reduce pilot workload.
""That's not an absurd date. Reducing crew on long-range looks to be the most accessible step because there is another pilot onboard,"" Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus head of engineering, told Reuters at the Farnborough Airshow.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is examining the possibility of having reduced manning in the cockpit of a proposed mid-sized jet that it aims to have in service by 2025 if it proceeds with a launch decision next year, according to UBS analysts. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""You can see the drivers from both angles,"" said Graham Braithwaite, Director of Transport Systems at Britain's Cranfield University. ""The technology to fly an aircraft on automatic is brilliant. The other driver in all this is that we're really short of pilots. They're a very expensive resource.""
The proponents of reduced numbers in the cockpit say the move, which could begin with cargo flights, is inevitable, just as pilot numbers were cut from three to two in the 1980s when the flight engineer position was axed due to improved design on new jets like the Boeing 757.
Airlines globally could save around $15 billion a year by going down to a single pilot, UBS said, and at a time of a pilot shortage this would help ensure there are enough aviators to serve a fast-growing industry.
Replacing the vast array of knobs and switches with more digital interfaces familiar to today's teenagers could also help to shorten the amount of time it takes to train pilots, thus easing the shortage. 
Ultimately, the goal would be for a fully autonomous commercial jet along the lines of a driverless car, although that technology, which requires clean-sheet jet designs from the major manufacturers, could take until 2040, according to an estimate from Thales. 
""I would compare autonomy to an open-heart surgery of our systems. All of our systems are specified to have permanently two persons in the cockpit,"" Airbus' Dumont said. 
Critics, however, say there are good safety reasons for having more than two pilots in the cockpit on long-haul flights and at least two on shorter journeys, with the costs outweighed by the benefits. 
INCREASED VULNERABILITY
For example, reducing cockpit numbers to one in the cruise phase of a long-haul flight could increase fatigue and vulnerability in the event of an unexpected in-flight incident while the other pilot is resting, said three pilots who spoke to Reuters, pointing to the Air France 447 crash in 2009.
Even with three pilots on board, the A330 was not recovered from a high altitude stall. In that case, the two more junior aviators were at the controls and the captain, once retrieved from resting, was unable to intervene in time to save the plane.
""I have experienced the simulation of what they went through and, even being aware that it is about to happen, it is very disconcerting,"" said Murray Butt, the president of the Qantas pilots union. ""I can't imagine what it would be like for two low-time pilots in the middle of the night.""
Other concerning scenarios include the deliberate crash of a Germanwings jet by one of its pilots in 2015 and the risk of a single pilot suffering from an in-flight health problem.
Moving to a single pilot would also create training difficulties, said Stuart Beveridge, an Australian commercial pilot and aviation researcher, because the first officer role is considered an apprentice step before taking on the responsibilities of a captain.
The financial benefits of reducing crew numbers could also be marginal, said aviation consultant James Halstead, because airline cost savings would likely be passed through to passengers in the form of lower ticket prices.
""On long-haul, crewing is a tiny proportion of the cost, compared to the fuel and the capital cost of the equipment,"" he added. ""It outweighs paying the salary of one pilot.""
The flying public also has concerns; a UBS poll found only 13 percent of respondents would take a jet with a single pilot.
FORGING AHEAD
Regardless of the concerns, manufacturers are pushing ahead with projects like embedding artificial intelligence into cockpits and connectivity that allows for decision-making on the ground.
In an industry where safety is paramount, reducing cockpit crew numbers won't occur without significant testing and certification from regulators, though. 
In addition, getting airlines to spend money to retrofit their current fleet as well as cultural change to manage the new kind of pilot role will be crucial, said Christine Ourmieres-Widener, CEO of British regional carrier Flybe.
""Most of the time people who are selling solutions don't realise how complex it can be to manage change and that's a massive change,"" she said. ""The technology will definitely be ready at some point but it will be a long process.""
Whether future jets will be designed for a single pilot has yet to be decided, the manufacturers said, with Airbus highlighting that new propulsion technologies also need to be considered.
""I would add that the single pilot operation is not an absolute must,"" Dumont said. 

""But it may be made a necessity by the fact there is a disconnect between the number of aircraft and the number of pilots.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) stock market value reached $900 billion on Wednesday for the first time, marking a major milestone in its 21-year trajectory as a publicly listed company and threatening to dislodge Apple (O:AAPL) as Wall Street's most valuable jewel.
After Jeff Bezos founded the online book-selling company in his garage in 1994, Amazon survived the dot-com crisis and then expanded across the retail industry, altering how consumers buy products and setting off a Darwinian struggle among brick-and-mortar stores.
After announcing on Wednesday that it sold more than $100 million products during its annual Prime Day sale, the Seattle, Washington company's stock briefly touched $1,858.88, giving Amazon a stock market value of $902 billion. It later reversed, trading down 0.16 percent for the session.
Amazon's stock has surged more than 57 percent in 2018, bringing its increase to over 123,000 percent since it listed on the Nasdaq in 1997. An investor who bought 1 share of Amazon for $18 in the IPO would now have an investment worth more than $22,200, including three stock splits in the 1990s.
Amazon, video streaming service Netflix (O:NFLX) and a handful of heavyweight technology companies have fueled Wall Street's rally in recent years and they remain key parts of portfolio managers' portfolios. 
Apple replaced  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) in late 2011 as the U.S. company with the largest stock market value. The Silicon Valley company's shares have risen 12 percent in 2018, bringing its stock market value to $935 billion. 
To view a graphic on Amazon catching up with Apple, click: https://reut.rs/2Jz2SyR
The calculations for Apple and Amazon's market capitalizations are based on the number of shares outstanding in their March-quarter reports. Amazon has increased its share count by over 1 million shares per quarter in recent years, and if it continued that in the June quarter, its stock market value may already have exceeded $900 billion.
Amazon reports its results on July 26 and Apple, which has been reducing its share count through buybacks, reports its June-quarter results on July 31.
As Amazon expands into grocery retail through its acquisition of Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) last year, and as more businesses move their IT departments onto the cloud, its stock price has been red hot, recently trading at 111 times expected earnings, compared to more-profitable - but slower growing - Apple’s valuation of 15 times earnings.
Amazon dislodged  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February. Since then, Microsoft has been overtaken by Google-owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL).

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 12:53PM ET</span>",Novartis hints at 2018 outlook hike despite drug price freeze,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Novartis  (S:NOVN) may ratchet up its 2018 sales outlook, its finance chief said on Wednesday, despite halting planned U.S. drug price hikes amid pressure on the industry from President Donald Trump's administration over the high cost of medicines.
Shares in the Swiss drugmaker, whose decision to freeze prices this year in the world's largest drug market was mirrored by  Pfizer  (N:PFE), closed 2.5 percent higher in Zurich after the firm beat forecasts with second-quarter results.
Second-quarter core operating profit rose 7 percent to $3.54 billion, it said, better than the average forecast of $3.46 billion in a Reuters poll. Sales climbed 5 percent to $13.16 billion, topping the $12.92 billion forecast.
Full-year 2018 sales are seen rising at low-to-mid single digit percentage rates, with operating profit rising in the mid-to-upper single digit percentages.
But Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch told analysts on a conference call he expected ""continued good momentum"" for products including psoriasis-and-arthritis drug Cosentyx and heart-failure medicine Entresto. That increased the likelihood that Novartis would upgrade its sales targets for 2018, he said.
""You may see us raise (the guidance) in quarter three,"" Kirsch said. ""It's a bit too early now, but I'm quite confident we will be at the upper end of the guidance on sales.""
This would come without price hikes as Novartis keeps the lid on medicine costs under pressure from U.S. lawmakers and Trump. 
A call from the president prompted Pfizer CEO Ian Read this month to reverse course on price hikes his company had enacted on July 1.
Novartis said it made its own decision in June to forego what had been planned hikes, adding that a range of factors were considered.
Novartis Chief Executive Narasimhan told Reuters that, unlike Pfizer's Read, he did not have a direct talk with Trump on drug prices but he said his company has been speaking to the federal Department of Health and Human Services about the U.S. administration's ""blueprint"" to trim costs.
""We don't plan to take any further price increases in the United States for 2018,"" the Novartis CEO said. ""Right now, in a very dynamic environment in the United States ... we view it as the prudent course.""
Novartis's net U.S. drug prices this year are ""flat to declining,"" he said, including the impact from its Sandoz generics unit where price pressure continues in the United States. 
Novartis now predicts Sandoz sales for 2018 will fall in the low single digit percentages, after previously holding out hopes for them to remain steady. 
Narasimhan is still reviewing options for the U.S. generics business, but said Novartis remained committed to its Sandoz unit as a whole. 
Ahead of the planned spinoff of Novartis's Alcon eye-care business to shareholders, set for early next year, Novartis raised the unit's sales guidance to mid-single digit percentage growth for 2018 after revenue in the second quarter grew 5 percent to $1.8 billion.
Second-quarter growth was also helped by a 40 percent increase in Cosentyx sales to $701 billion, a development analysts said was a relief after sales of the medicine missed expectations at the start of 2018.

CASE CLOSED?
Novartis has been in the firing line over a $1.2 million contract with Trump's former lawyer for consulting work. U.S. lawmakers accused the firm last week of misleading the public about the depth of its contacts with Michael Cohen. Novartis disputes this.
Narasimhan, who has said the contract was a mistake, said no outstanding U.S. government or congressional inquiries remained into his company's ties to Cohen's firm that paid $130,000 to pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels. 
""I view the Cohen issue as closed at this point,"" he said. ""We're really focused on our future.""
Narasimhan said Novartis was on track to file for regulatory approval by October of its gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, which came with its $8.7 billion purchase of AveXis.

He also said he expected the launch of multiple sclerosis drug BAF312 in early 2019.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>","Boeing in talks with Airbus, others for German helicopter bid","LONDON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is in talks with Airbus (PA:AIR) and other companies about joining its bid for a 4 billion euro ($4.7 billion) heavy-lift helicopter contract in Germany, the head of business development for Boeing's defence unit said on Wednesday.
Gene Cunningham told Reuters that Boeing was continuing to fine-tune its approach for the German competition, which pits Boeing's CH-47 Chinook against the new CH-53K Sikorsky King Stallion built by  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT).
The German defence ministry expects to start the competition later this year or early next, with the target of awarding a contract in mid-2020 for deliveries to start in 2023.
""We are still in talks with other companies, Airbus included, and we continue to strengthen the team that we've put in place,"" Cunningham said in an interview at the Farnborough Airshow outside London.
He said those discussions would continue as the proposal process unfolded, and Boeing evaluated Germany's needs for the new helicopters and subsequent servicing.
Boeing has already teamed up with 10 German firms to bid for the contract, squaring off with the biggest U.S. arms maker, Lockheed Martin (N:LMT), which has also announced agreements with Germany's  Rheinmetall  (DE:RHMG) and other firms.
Cunningham said the CH-47 was well positioned to win the contract given its performance, cost and the fact it is already in use by a number of Germany's NATO allies, including the Netherlands, Britain, Spain, Canada and Italy.
The CH-53K is a new aircraft developed for the U.S. Marine Corps that is due to be declared operational in 2019. The new helicopters will replace the existing CH-53G fleet that has been flying for over 45 years.
Buying the Chinook would strengthen cooperation among German and its NATO partners, while providing assurance that the products and capabilities would be readily available to be available, Cunningham said.
He said he did not expect changes at the helm of the German air force and arms procurement arm to affect the competition. ""I don't envision a significant change,"" he said.
Barry McCullough, who leads business development at Lockheed's rotary and missions systems business, said cost would clearly play a role, and that his company was working hard to reduce the cost of the new CH-53K aircraft.
He said a plan was in place to trim overall programme costs by $800 million, which would drive down unit costs for possible foreign military sales to Germany and Israel.

UAL also raised its 2018 profit forecast, sending its shares up 8.5 percent and boosting other airline stocks. CSX rose 5.5 percent and pushed shares of other railroad operators higher.
""Markets are going to stay a little range bound and try to grind a little bit higher in the midst of slower trading, that we often seen at this time of the year,"" said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management, in Horsham, Pennsylvania.

The Panel's decision that Disney should make a mandatory offer of at least 14 pounds a share for Sky only applies if Disney's offer for Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA), which owns 39 percent of Sky, completes before either Fox or Comcast (O:CMCSA) succeed with their competing offers to take control of the British pay-television company.
Sky's independent directors have recommended a 14.75 pounds a share offer made by Comcast last week that trumped a 14 pounds offer submitted by Fox.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's government is considering a plan under which Aramco would buy a stake in Saudi petrochemical maker SABIC (SE:2010), a move that could boost the state oil giant's market valuation ahead of a planned initial public offering.
Saudi Aramco  has invited banks to pitch for an advisory role on the potential acquisition of a strategic stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Aramco wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the world’s largest oil producer, possibly by next year. Boosting its petrochemicals portfolio further could help attract potential investors for the IPO. 
The Aramco IPO is the centrepiece of an ambitious plan championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy beyond oil. 
Aramco made the invitation to the banks last month, said the sources, declining to be identified due to commercial sensitivities.
Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world's fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, is 70 percent owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's top sovereign wealth fund. It has a market capitalisation of 385.2 billion Saudi riyals ($102.7 billion).
The process is in the initial stages and Aramco may or may not decide to go ahead with the deal, the sources said. 
Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. SABIC declined to comment.
Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude, and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to lessen the risk of a slowdown in oil demand.
Aramco is expanding its footprint globally by signing downstream deals and boosting the capacity of its plants.
Aramco's push into chemicals also includes a mega project it is building at home with SABIC. The $20 billion project would build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly, bypassing the refining stage.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 11:26AM ET</span>","Sinclair reverses course on Tribune deal, hoping to win FCC nod","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (O:SBGI) said on Wednesday it will reverse course and not divest three television stations in hopes of winning approval of its $3.9 billion acquisition of  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO) after the Federal Communications Commission chairman said he had ""serious concerns"" about the deal.
Sinclair, the top U.S. TV broadcast group, said it will drop plans to divest stations in Dallas, Chicago and Houston to ""expedite"" the transaction after the FCC suggested that under its plan the company would still control the stations.
It is not clear if the last-ditch effort will be enough to sway regulators, who also raised concerns about whether Sinclair has misled the government.
The Justice Department is also still reviewing the deal and the FCC may have other concerns before it is willing to approve the deal. 
FCC chairman Ajit Pai, whom Democrats have accused of making a string of decisions benefiting Sinclair, said Monday that evidence suggested ""certain station divestitures that have
been proposed to the FCC would allow Sinclair to control those stations in practice, even if not in name, in violation of the law.""
Sinclair, which owns 192 stations, is withdrawing applications to divest stations in Dallas, Houston and Chicago. Reuters first reported on Monday the identity of the three stations. 
A majority of the FCC voted Monday to approve a draft order circulated by Pai's office to refer the matter to an administrative judge for a hearing, Tribune said. 
Sinclair said it was “shocked and disappointed” by the FCC's order and denied it was not in compliance with FCC rules or that it had engaged in misleading conduct.
The company said it believed it can now win quick approval. ""We call upon the FCC to approve the modified Tribune acquisition in order to bring closure to this extraordinarily drawn-out process,” Sinclair said in a statement.
The FCC declined to comment. 
A hearing is likely to result in a lengthy delay and could effectively kill the deal, as has happened in other mergers referred for administrative proceedings. Sinclair now hopes the hearing will not be needed.
The draft order circulated by Pai’s office, part of which was seen by Reuters, said Sinclair's actions around the divestiture of TV station WGN in Chicago ""potentially involve deception"" and ""includes a potential element of misrepresentation or lack of candor.""
The draft said the matter must be resolved before the FCC gives the go-ahead.
Sinclair said it will seek permission to acquire WGN in Chicago instead of divesting it. The company had proposed to sell the station to a Maryland auto dealer who is a longtime business associate of Sinclair Executive Chairman David Smith, and would largely continue to operate the station under a services agreement.
Sinclair also said it was withdrawing plans to sell stations in Dallas and Houston to Cunningham Broadcasting Corp, a company controlled by the estate of Smith's mother. Sinclair said Wednesday it now wants to put the two Texas stations into a divestiture trust to be sold and operated by an independent trustee.
Tribune shares rose 1.7 percent on Wednesday while Sinclair was down 2.6 percent.
Sinclair said in May 2017 it planned to acquire Chicago-based Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets.

In April, Sinclair said it would sell 23 TV stations to obtain regulatory approval. It needs FCC permission to own more than one station in some markets.

The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control said only vehicles costing 60,000 euros or less qualified for Germany's ""environmental bonus"", intended to encourage the purchase of electric cars. 
The Tesla Model S was removed from the subsidy list on November 30, 2017, after the office found Tesla was delivering higher specification vehicles costing more than 60,000 euros, 
""The subsidy needs to be repaid by 800 people who had received it, and another 250 customers who had been notified they were eligible and who will now not receive it,"" a spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
Customers who bought Tesla cars costing less than 60,000 euros are eligible to apply for the bonus, the spokeswoman said. 
The carmaker said it is appealing the decision and will pay the bonus to its clients in place of the German state until the issue is resolved. 
""The arbitrary decision to temporarily remove Tesla from the list of vehicles eligible for the Environmental Bonus (Umweltbonus) was unjustified, contrary to the stated goals of the program, and unfair to our customers,"" Tesla said in a statement. 

German customers have always been able to order a base version Model S which met the qualification threshold, and such cars were delivered to customers, Tesla said.

(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, driven by higher revenues in equities and fixed income trading as well as investment banking.
Banks are benefiting from increased market volatility due in part to escalating trade tensions causing investors to buy and sell assets to protect their portfolios and take advantage of opportunities. Morgan Stanley highlighted its equity financing business and a stronger performance in commodities and credit products.
Large strategic deals and cross-border activity helped drive M&A in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said on a call to discuss results. But the bank is watching for signs the trade and geopolitical concerns could dampen future underwriting revenue. 
Shares were up 3.4 percent to $50.86 in early trading.
Morgan Stanley's net revenue rose 12 percent to $10.6 billion, with institutional securities accounting for 54 percent of the gains. Institutional securities comprises the bank's investment banking and trading units.
Chief Executive James Gorman called the quarter's performance straightforward and focused some of his prepared comments on the Federal Reserve's methodology for its stress tests, noting that the U.S. regulator's extreme scenarios this year exceeded even what the bank experienced during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. 
""We will not get ahead of ourselves in predicting what the Fed will do next year, but 2018 appears to be a transition year. Going forward, we expect to be able to continue to invest in our business and offer our shareholders an attractive capital return while maintaining a prudent capital base,"" he said. 
The Fed said last month it would not let Morgan Stanley boost overall capital returns to shareholders after its leverage ratio fell below the minimum allowed in the annual stress test. A failure to meet the requirement would normally result in an outright failure. 
Morgan Stanley said net income rose 39 percent to $2.4 billion, or $1.30 per share, from $1.8 billion, or 87 cents per share, in the year-ago period.
Adjusted for special items, its profit was $1.25 per share, topping the $1.11 per share analysts expected, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net revenue from the bank's sales and trading business rose 18 percent to $3.8 billion, with fixed income and equity trading businesses recording gains of 12 percent and 15 percent. 
Rival Goldman Sachs said on Tuesday its trading revenue rose 17 percent, with bond trading showing a 45 percent jump from a notably weak year-ago period and equity revenue remaining flat.
Morgan Stanley said net revenue at its wealth management business rose to $4.3 billion from $4.2 billion a year ago.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) have all reported second-quarter earnings which beat expectations, with only  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co missing estimates.

1079,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Electrolux Sees Cost of Latest U.S. Trade Tariffs at $10 Million,"(Bloomberg) -- Electrolux, AB (ST:ELUXb) says the latest U.S. trade tariffs will cost the Swedish maker of vacuum cleaners and kitchen appliances some $10 million during the second half of this year.
The 10 percent tariffs on a raft of Chinese-made goods announced last week will drive up expenses, the Stockholm-based company said Wednesday. Those tariffs are expected to go into effect after a comment period ends in late August.
“It’s not yet in place, so it’s a little bit difficult to accurately assess what the impact is,” Chief Executive Officer Jonas Samuelson said on a conference call after Electrolux reported second-quarter earnings. “We expect the impact on this year if it goes in effect to be relatively limited,” though the company doesn’t yet “really know exactly what’s going to happen here,” he said.
The company imports components from China, some of which together with vacuum cleaners are among the $200 billion of Chinese products that are subject to the new tariffs, according to a list published by the U.S. trade representative.
Separately, President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imported into the U.S., already in place, are leading to higher raw-material costs, the company said. Electrolux manufactures appliances at plants in Tennessee and South Carolina. The company in March placed on hold its plans to expand its plant in Springfield, Tennessee, citing the steel and aluminum tariffs, according to news reports.
While Electrolux reported better-than-expected second-quarter sales and profit, Samuelson warned of increasing headwinds from raw-material costs and currency and also cut the demand outlook for Latin America and North America, “to a large extent driven by higher market prices caused by higher input costs.”
The company now estimates that higher raw-material prices will cost the company about 1.8 billion kronor ($200 million) in 2018, versus a previous forecast of 1.6 billion kronor to 1.8 billion kronor.
“We have been highlighting Electrolux as having one of the worst major negative impacts from trade wars and import duties among our industrials, and despite the company’s continual efforts to try to parry this, we believe that we now have started to see the effects of this,” Pareto Securities said in a note."

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) could still face legal action despite its decision to forfeit profits from transactions in Estonia that are subject to a money-laundering probe, Denmark's business minister said on Wednesday.
Danske Bank said earlier it would forgo profits made from the transactions, which relate to a period from 2007 and 2015.
""The sin is not erased because they now acknowledge that they can't keep the money,"" business minister Rasmus Jarlov told Reuters in an interview.
""Whatever legal options there might be for the Danish authorities, they will pursue them,"" Jarlov said.
Denmark's financial watchdog said in May it had found ""serious weaknesses"" in Danske Bank's governance after an anti-money-laundering probe into the bank's Estonian branch.
It also ordered the bank to set aside an extra 5 billion Danish crowns ($781 million) in regulatory capital in response to the laundering allegations. Analysts estimate the bank could face potential fines in the region of 4 billion crowns.
Danske Bank has admitted to flaws in its anti money-laundering controls in Estonia and launched its own investigation into the case, which is due to present its findings in September.

But one year after the acquisition, there has been only a minimal decline in grocery prices in the US.
Grocery prices fell 0.3% in the 12 months ending in June, compared to a 0.6% increase over the same period last year, according to data from Adobe Analytics.
Amazon is at least partially responsible for the decline, according to Siddharth Kulkarni, a data science manager and analyst for Adobe Digital Insights.
""Amazon is having downward pressure on pricing when it comes to groceries,"" Kulkarni said.
But the deal hasn't ignited an all-out price war in the grocery industry — at least not yet. 
That could change now that Amazon has introduced  new discounts for members of its Prime membership program at Whole Foods stores across the US. 
The discounts include 10% off sale items at Whole Foods and weekly promotions on best-selling items.
But the bigger threats to the grocery industry are discount grocers Aldi and Lidl, according to some analysts. 
According to one  study, supermarkets in close proximity to Lidl drop prices by as much as 55% to compete with the discount grocer.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is activating its Brexit contingency plans as the British government's strategy for leaving the European Union appears to be ""unraveling,"" the head of Europe's biggest planemaker said on Wednesday.
Britain is due to leave the EU in less than nine months, but there is little clarity over its future relationship with the world’s biggest trading bloc, creating a headache for companies that rely on the smooth flow of goods and parts across borders.
Airbus, which employs 15,000 people in Britain, has issued a series of warnings about the dangers of the country quitting the EU without an agreed deal, saying this month that could halt output at its plants and leave aircraft grounded.
CEO Tom Enders said at the Farnborough Airshow that the so-called White Paper published by the UK government last Thursday which laid out its post-Brexit plans for trade with the EU was positive, but that events since had changed that view. 
""I thought that the White Paper was going in the right direction,"" Enders told reporters.
""Now we see that unraveling again so all the more reason for us to take more serious decisions,"" he said, referring to the Conservative government's move to accept amendments to its plan from a group of hardline Brexit supporters in its party.
Airbus will now activate contingency plans to ensure its production can continue whatever the trading relationship after Brexit, Enders said, adding the main focus was on stockpiling parts that currently arrive at factories on a ""just in time"" basis. 
""We are now activating contingency plans which largely focus on building some buffers ... so we should be able for a short period after the exit happens to mitigate the effects,"" he said. 
British engine-maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) said on Tuesday it too could start stockpiling parts, but would not do that until around the fourth quarter of this year.

Even if UK Prime Minister Theresa May can secure enough support for her Brexit blueprint at home, she still needs to win agreement from the EU.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - James Bond would love it. Aston Martin, maker of the luxury sports cars favored by the fictional British spy, has now come up with a futuristic personal aircraft it has dubbed ""a sports car for the skies"".
Aston Martin unveiled the three-seater hybrid-electric vehicle this week at the Farnborough Airshow and, though the concept remains for now the stuff of science fiction, believes it could help one day to revolutionize travel.
The Volante Vision Concept design has vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities and will be able to hit speeds of around 200 miles per hour (322 kph), ""so you can go from the center of Birmingham to the center of London in about 30 minutes,"" Aston Martin's Simon Sproule told Reuters.
Aviation and technology leaders are working to make electric-powered flying taxis a reality, including Airbus, U.S. ride-sharing firm Uber and a range of start-ups including one backed by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) co-founder Larry Page, called Kitty Hawk.
Aston Martin believes it could corner the market for luxury flying vehicles in the future.
""The same way that you have Uber and you have an Aston Martin, you'll have 'Uber in the skies' and you'll have 'Aston Martin in the skies',"" said Sproule, adding that such an aircraft won't come cheap. 
""This is clearly a luxury object - it's a sports car for the skies - so pricing is going to be commensurate with that, so certainly into the seven figures.""
    
""FEELS LIKE A FIGHTER JET""
The company has partnered with Cranfield University, Cranfield Aerospace Solutions and British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) to develop the concept vehicle, including artificial intelligence-powered autonomous capabilities. 
""It feels like a fighter jet but at the same time it has the Aston Martin luxury,"" said David Debney, chief of future aircraft concepts at Rolls-Royce.
Commenting on how to pilot the vehicle, Cranfield's Helen Atkinson said: ""You've got to detect what's going on in the external environment and then turn that around incredibly quickly in the computer system with the artificial intelligence built in to actually achieve the necessary level of autonomy.""
Separately at Farnborough, Rolls-Royce unveiled plans for a flying taxi - an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) vehicle which could carry four to five people at speeds of up to 250 miles (400 km) per hour for approximately 500 miles.

The company said it was starting a search for partners to help develop a project it hopes could take to the skies as soon as early next decade.

1090,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",VIX Futures Close at Lowest Level in Six Months as Fear Vanishes,"(Bloomberg) -- After a storm comes the calm...eventually.
Front-month VIX futures closed at 12.12 on Tuesday, their lowest finish since before the record explosion in volatility in February, which roiled markets and wiped out several exchange-traded products that let investors bet on market tranquility.
VIX futures contracts are tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of the one-month implied swings for the S&P 500 Index that’s often called the VIX or Wall Street’s “fear gauge.”
Traders’ renewed faith that U.S. stocks won’t stumble in the near term is buoyed by the start of earnings season. This is a period in which equities usually do well and the implied and realized correlation among members of the benchmark U.S. equity gauge declines, with stocks moving for more company-specific reasons. That helps dampen volatility at the index level.
The spread between August and September VIX futures contracts -- which will become the front and second-month contracts after the July contract expires on Wednesday morning -- currently sits at around 0.8 in early trading. Should this hold, the contango (that is, upward slope) at the front portion of the VIX futures curve would be steeper than it has been on average over the past year.
This curve structure serves as a tailwind to those shorting long-volatility exchange-traded products. Those ETPs typically shift their exposure to the (generally pricier) second-month contract as time passes, which tends to converge downwards to its front-month counterpart. The “rolldown” dynamic benefits volatility sellers, giving them a reason to maintain short positions even when the level of spot VIX and the front-month futures contract seem like they can’t sink lower.
“It’s safer to be short a steep board with a sleepy market than it is with spot higher and a flatter board,” said Dave Roberts, an independent trader of volatility products and associated derivatives based in Washington, D.C.
In early February, the spread between the front and second-month contract had whittled away to nearly nothing before turning into negative steep territory amid market angst, exacerbated by a messy unwind of the short-volatility trade.
For now, however, the VIX curve is cool, calm, and in contango.

Injectable opioid painkillers, which hospitals use to manage pain after operations and in terminal illness, have been in short supply for more than a year largely due to production problems at  Pfizer  (N:PFE), the biggest supplier of the drugs.
Pfizer has said it is making progress on its recovery plan, but it estimates that the supply of some of its injectables will not be fully restored until later this year or in 2019. 
Opioids are controlled substances and therefore manufacturers are allocated quota for their active ingredients by the Drug Enforcement Administration, limiting their ability to increase production.
Hikma said it had released more than 5 million hydromorphone 2ml vials to U.S. hospitals in June and expected to release 3 million vials in July.
Daniel Motto, executive vice-president of Hikma's U.S. injectables division, said the company was prioritizing the manufacture of opioid products affected by this shortage including fentanyl, meperidine, morphine and hydromorphone.

""We have the capacity in our FDA-inspected manufacturing facility in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, for all CII opioid injectable products, and believe we can now address the current shortage of these vital and urgently needed medications, pending increased quota allowances from the US Drug Enforcement Administration,"" he said.

The China Forestry deal is one of several floats being investigated by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) as part of a wider probe into misconduct by banks sponsoring IPOs in the city.
Tian Cen, a managing director at UBS in Hong Kong, has filed an appeal with the city's Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal (SFAT), according to the SFAT's website. 
Cen was involved in the China Forestry IPO as one of the senior UBS investment bankers on the deal, another person with knowledge of the matter said. 
The punishment suggested by the SFC has not been made public. However, according to a Bloomberg report, the regulator has proposed a suspension of Cen's license.
China Forestry, whose shares have been suspended since 2011 and which is now being liquidated, raised $216 million in its IPO, which was jointly sponsored by UBS and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN).
UBS is already fighting an 18-month suspension in Hong Kong from sponsoring IPOs related to its work for China Forestry as well as a HK$119 million ($15.18 million) fine. 
The Hong Kong securities regulator has also taken action against StanChart, details of which has not been disclosed by the bank. The British lender, which has filed a review application against the SFC decision, no longer has an IPO sponsorship license in the Asian financial hub.
In March this year, the SFAT granted UBS and StanChart an extension for their appeals against the SFC's actions, but did not specify the reason for the punishments.
On Tuesday, the SFC said it had banned Joseph Hsu, a former executive at StanChart's securities unit in Hong Kong, from re-entering the industry for three years from July 6 for not exercising due diligence in a 2009 listing application.
The SFC did not name the firm involved in Hsu's ban, but said the punishment was related to its disciplinary action against StanChart and its co-sponsor for an IPO application.
The first source said the action against Hsu was related to China Forestry's listing. 

Representatives at SFC, StanChart, and UBS declined to comment. Cen did not respond to an email and a call. Hsu could not immediately be reached by Reuters for a comment.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 04:58AM ET</span>",Toshiba may face renewed shareholder accounting claims: U.S. appeals court,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court gave investors in Toshiba Corp's U.S.-listed securities another chance to show they suffered losses because the Japanese industrial conglomerate misled them about its internal controls before a 2015 accounting scandal.
In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday said a lower court judge misapplied the law in dismissing the investors' lawsuit, and that the investors should be permitted to file an amended complaint.
The Pasadena, California-based appeals court said the investors did not sufficiently allege Toshiba committed a ""domestic"" violation of federal securities law, but that it would ""not be futile"" for them to try again.
Toshiba said in a statement the company was considering various options, including filing an appeal. 
U.S.-based lawyers for Toshiba and the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Investors led by the Automotive Industries Pension Trust Fund in Dublin, California, sued in 2015 after Toshiba disclosed widespread accounting fraud, saying the revelations caused them to suffer losses as the company's stock price fell.
In September 2015, Toshiba admitted to having overstated profit by roughly $1.3 billion over seven years.
The scandal also led Toshiba to recognize large cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, and sell its memory chip business to a consortium led by private equity firm Bain Capital for $18 billion.
In Tuesday's decision, Circuit Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw wrote that investors' purchases of Toshiba's American depository shares or receipts could qualify as domestic if they or Toshiba had incurred ""irrevocable liability"" in the United States.
The lawsuit was returned to U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson in Los Angeles.
On June 25, Toshiba said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had completed a probe into its accounting, and had decided not to impose a fine.

The case is Automotive Industries Pension Trust Fund et al v Toshiba Corp, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-56058.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines conglomerate San Miguel Corp (PS:SMC) is planning to invest at least $1 billion in the next two years to build 10 breweries inside and outside the country, senior company executives said on Wednesday. 
Banking on strong consumer demand in one of Asia's fastest growing economies, the maker of San Miguel Pale Pilsen and Red Horse beer is setting up eight breweries around the country, San Miguel President Ramon Ang told Reuters in an interview. 
San Miguel is also looking to open its first production facility in the United States and build a second plant in Vietnam, Ang said.
""This is not for the volume growth. This is more to be able to produce locally, regionally for fresh beer, for better quality of beer because it is locally available and also lower logistics costs"", he said.
San Miguel is Philippines' biggest brewer and its brewery business is partly owned by Japan's Kirin Holdings Co Ltd (T:2503). It has six existing breweries in the country, and six across Asia.
Each of its new breweries would have an annual capacity of 1-2 million hectoliters (100-200 million litres) and would cost at least $100 million, San Miguel Chief Finance Officer Ferdinand Constantino said in the same interview.
At 10.6 litres per capita in 2017, beer sales in the Southeast nation of over 100 million people have much room to grow. They pale in comparison with Vietnam's 43.7 litres, China's 29.8 litres and Thailand's 27.9 litres, data from statistics portal Statista showed.
Philippine beer sales are expected to grow by a fifth to $1.74 billion in 2021 from $1.44 billion last year, Statista data showed. Beer sales were $1.03 billion in 2010.
San Miguel, valued at $6.09 billion, has pursued an aggressive expansion over the past decade to bolster revenues, adding infrastructure, mining, petroleum and power assets to its core food and beverage businesses.
Founded as a brewery in 1890, San Miguel dominates its home base for beer. The beer business accounted for nearly 13 percent of the conglomerate's net sales in the first quarter of 2018.
San Miguel is also on track to sell up to $3 billion worth of shares in its food unit in the fourth quarter despite recent market volatility, the executives said. 
San Miguel shares were unchanged on Wednesday, but are up 22.7 percent year-to-date, bucking the 13 percent decline in the broader Philippines index (PSI), the worst performing bourse in Southeast Asia so far in 2018.

1111,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>","Danske Slumps Amid $230 Million Laundering Payment, Profit Miss","(Bloomberg) --  Danske Bank  A/S (CO:DANSKE) slumped the most in more than two years after reporting second-quarter results that missed analyst estimates and as management set aside money potentially linked to laundering crimes after the Danish government said it will confiscate such funds.
Shares in the Copenhagen-based lender sank as much as 9 percent, the most since June 2016. The selloff pushed Danske to the bottom of the Bloomberg index of European financial stocks, which was down about 0.7 percent.
Denmark’s biggest bank said it may pay back about 1.5 billion kroner, or about $230 million, from its profit as it tries to deal with allegations it helped launder billions in illicit funds over several years.
Danske said on Wednesday that the amount corresponds to estimated gross income from 2007 to 2015 from the non-resident accounts in Estonia that are at the center of the laundering scandal.
“As the comprehensive investigations, which are anchored in the Board of Directors, have not been finalized, it is too early to determine the amount to be made available,” the bank said. “Conclusions from the investigations will be reported by September 2018. The amount and the way in which it will be made available will be decided after we have concluded on the investigations.”
The bank said it will make the money “available for efforts that support the interest of the societies in which we operate, such as combating international financial crime.”
The bank also appointed a new chief compliance officer, Philippe Vollot, who is due to start no later than Dec. 1. He comes with “significant international experience -– not least within the combating of financial crime and money laundering,” Chief Executive Officer Thomas Borgen said in the statement. Vollot had previously worked at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), where he was global head of anti-financial crime & group anti-money laundering officer.
The announcement was made in connection with the bank’s second-quarter earnings report. Danske reported net income that was slightly below analyst estimates, though management was able to write back 377 million kroner in bad loans. The bank said it now expects net profit in 2018 to be at the lower end of a previously announced target range of 18 billion kroner to 20 billion kroner.
For the last 1 1/2 years, a steady stream of reports by the Berlingske newspaper has placed Danske at the center of a massive laundering scandal in Europe. Well over $8 billion in dirty money was allegedly funneled from from Russia, Moldova and Azerbaijan through the bank’s Estonian office in the years 2007 to 2015.
Danske this month became the subject of a criminal complaint by Bill Browder, co-founder and CEO of Hermitage Capital. Browder links some of the laundered funds to the death of his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who ended his days in a Moscow prison in 2009 after uncovering the scheme. Browder filed his complaint with Denmark’s State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime, as well as the Danish Business Ministry.
The Danish state prosecutor says it’s treating the case “particularly seriously” and is working with “several countries” to get to the bottom of the allegations against Danske. The Danish government and central bank have said the scandal risks damaging the entire country’s reputation. Business Minister Rasmus Jarlov says the Financial Supervisory Authority is investigating new evidence as it becomes available.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc said on Tuesday that it has invested more than $500 million in Mexico since it launched there in 2013, underscoring the country's importance to the ride-hailing firm as it faces new competition.
The figure includes contributions to government-run mobility funds, ""social responsibility"" projects and unspecified security spending, it said. 
As Uber confronts regulatory battles in Europe and heightened competition in Asia and the United States, Mexico, Latin America's second-biggest economy, represents an opportunity for the company to establish a secure foothold in a major market. 
But Uber has faced pressure to step up its game with the arrival of Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing Technology Co, which launched operations in the central Mexican city of Toluca in April and has announced it is rolling out services to other cities. 
Uber also said it will remodel its Mexican support centers in addition to giving riders in Mexico the option to tip drivers through its mobile app. 
Mexico is Uber's fourth-biggest country by number of rides, trailing the United States, Brazil and India. 
The company operates in 21 of the country's 32 states, but the remaining states have regulations that are unfavorable to ride-hailing firms, Federico Ranero, general manager for Uber in Mexico, told Reuters on Tuesday. 

Of the states where Uber does not currently operate, he said Uber is particularly interested in expanding in Veracruz, Durango, Tamaulipas and Hidalgo.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 10:44PM ET</span>",Texas Instruments CEO resigns on code of conduct violation,"By Stephen Nellis and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) said on Tuesday that Brian Crutcher had resigned as the company's chief executive officer just six weeks into the role, after finding following a report that he had violated the chipmaker's code on personal behavior.
The company's shares fell as much as 2.5 percent in after-market trading even as Texas Instruments reported second-quarter earnings and sales that beat estimates.
Chairman Rich Templeton will reassume the roles of chief executive officer and president and the chipmaker is not searching for a replacement, Texas Instruments said in a statement. The company said Crutcher's violation was unrelated to the company's ""strategy, operations or financial reporting."" 
Texas Instruments would not comment beyond its statement. In a video address to employees that was posted on the company's website, Templeton said the board received a report that led to the resignation. He provided no details.
“If something is reported that does not align with our ethics and values, we respond, and that is exactly what the board did when it received this claim,"" Templeton said in the video message. ""Each of us has a personal responsibility. This is about both our accountability for how we conduct ourselves, but also, if you see something wrong, say something.""
Crutcher could not immediately be reached for comment.
Crutcher, who was appointed chief executive officer and president on June 1, has worked at Texas Instruments for the past 22 years, holding various positions including executive vice president and chief operating officer.
Crutcher's departure is the latest high-profile exit at the top level at U.S. companies in the past two months.  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich left last month after an investigation found he had a consensual relationship with an employee in breach of company policy. Barnes & Noble Inc (N:BKS) CEO Demos Parneros was terminated earlier this month for violation of company policies.
Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said Crutcher's resignation was surprising because Texas Instruments' ""corporate culture is beyond reproach.""
But Crutcher's departure is less likely to cause a disruption for Texas Instrument than did Krzanich's departure at Intel, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein. 
""There's a direct replacement who was literally on the job six weeks ago,"" Rasgon said, adding that the Texas Instruments has a ""deep bench"" of veteran executives.
Templeton, 59, served as the company's CEO from 2004 until Crutcher took over.

Texas Instruments on Tuesday also reported second-quarter revenue of $4.02 billion, up 9 percent from the same quarter a year ago, and earnings per share of $1.40, including a 3 cent tax benefit not in the company's original guidance. Those figures beat Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates of revenue of $3.96 billion and earnings of $1.31 per share.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A Toronto-based start-up has secured $10 million in funding from venture capitalists to expand its operations in the temporary tattoo business, the company's chief executive officer said on Tuesday.
The start-up, Inkbox, aims to give customers ""the look and feel of a permanent tattoo without the permanence,"" CEO and co-founder Tyler Handley told Reuters. The company, which was founded in 2015 and operates in Canada and Japan, ships approximately 60,000 tattoos per month to over 150 countries, with 75 percent of its sales going to the United States.
The company received its latest equity investment from a group led by venture capital firm Maveron LLC, in addition to $3 million raised through a line of bank credit. Inkbox had raised about $3 million in its first round of capital raising.
Handley said he believes the funds will last for at least two years, and says the money will go toward scaling the marketplace, marketing strategy, technology innovation and making strategic hires.
Inkbox sources designs from professionals - such as tattoo artists, graphic designers and fine artists - who receive a cut of the profit when their designs are purchased. The company hopes to allow anyone to submit creations in the future.
Inkbox appeals to ""millennials in their prime spending years,"" according to Handley, and it enlists the help of Instagram influencers to sell its products.
The tattoos are shipped directly to customers, who can then apply them in about 15 minutes using an included kit. The ink lasts up to 18 days. 
Handley said Inkbox does not face direct competition in the tattoo industry, which he called ""very unconsolidated and fragmented.""

(Reuters) -  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Tuesday eliminated a restriction on its ability to buy back its own stock, a change that could help billionaire Chairman Warren Buffett deploy more of the conglomerate's cash.
The new policy approved by Berkshire's board lets Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger authorize buybacks when both believe the repurchase price is ""below Berkshire's intrinsic value,"" a determination that would be made ""conservatively.""
Berkshire's old policy said repurchase prices would not exceed 1.2 times book value per share, or assets minus liabilities.
The new policy is a major change for Berkshire, where Buffett has faced pressure to deploy more than $108 billion of cash and equivalents.
Berkshire's Class A shares closed Tuesday at $288,500, roughly 1.37 times its $211,184 book value per share as of March 31.
The Class B shares rose 1.5 percent in after-hours trading, following the announcement of the new policy.
""It's a somewhat significant change,"" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California. Berkshire shares comprise about 20 percent of its $1.5 billion of assets.
""This is a good thing in an environment where Berkshire has a lot of excess cash, nothing to buy, and an underpriced stock,"" Check said.
Berkshire raised its repurchase threshold to 1.2 times book value from 1.1 times in December 2012.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based company spent $1.3 billion on share repurchases that month, mainly from the estate of a longtime shareholder. Berkshire has not disclosed any subsequent repurchases under its program.
Known as a bargain-hunter, Buffett has struggled to add large companies to Berkshire's stable of more than 90 businesses in the insurance, railroad, energy, retail and other sectors.
In recent months, he has used some cash to build a more than $40 billion stake in iPhone maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
At Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett resisted issuing a special dividend to shareholders, while supporting Apple's move to increase its own buybacks, saying that could boost the stock's value.
Munger, for his part, warned that some companies use repurchases simply to prop up their own stock prices.
Berkshire said it would not buy back stock under its new policy until it releases second-quarter results, scheduled for Aug. 3.

It also maintained it will not allow repurchases to reduce its cash and equivalents below $20 billion.

The IPA Bellwether report, conducted by IHS Markit, showed that 23 percent of marketing executives raised their budgets during the quarter, while just under 17 percent of executives who took part in the survey cut their marketing budgets.
The resulting net rise of 6.5 percent was higher than an increase of 5 in the previous quarter, the report said.
""Despite this overall positive growth, however, with continued Brexit uncertainty, the underlying story still remains one of caution, with the latest Bellwether data pointing to the second-slowest marketing budget growth since Q1 2016,"" IPA's Director General Paul Bainsfair said.
Rising inflation - driven largely by the pound's fall since Britain's vote in 2016 to leave the European Union - has squeezed household incomes, causing broader economic growth to slow. 
Around 300 UK marketing professionals, primarily from Britain's top 1,000 companies and across all key business sectors, were interviewed for the survey.
The report showed that Brexit remained a dominant theme for respondents, with a number concerned about the general uncertainty caused by the negotiations and how this might affect business and consumer confidence.
The panelists were most concerned about the dip in household spending, hurt by weaker confidence and fears over job security.
British workers' pay growth slowed to its weakest in six months despite record employment, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
The rise in marketing spend was supported by new product and service launches, overall business growth and increased optimism toward future opportunities, the report said, adding that increased competition had driven firms to boost marketing.
The survey also found that growth in advertising spending is expected to rise 1.1 percent in 2018, higher than a previous estimate of 0.8 percent. Expectations for a bounce back in Britain's second-quarter GDP growth is leading to a greater degree of optimism toward ad spending.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Las Vegas hotel seeks immunity from lawsuits by shooting victims,"(Reuters) - The owners of Mandalay Bay, the Las Vegas hotel from which a gunman launched the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, have filed countersuits against victims seeking immunity from damage claims they might bring.
MGM Resorts International (N:MGM), in lawsuits filed in federal courts in Las Vegas and Los Angeles last week, denied liability for the carnage and trauma of the October 2017 rampage in which 58 people were killed and hundreds of others injured.
Since the attack more than 2,500 people have sued or threatened to sue the hotel owners, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Nevada on Friday by MGM Resorts, Mandalay Resort Group, MGM Resorts Festival Grounds and MGM Resorts Venue Management. Survivors have accused the hotel inadequate security measures.
Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired real estate investor, poured gunfire from his 32nd-floor hotel suite into a crowd of 20,000 people attending an outdoor music festival, then killed himself before police stormed his room. 
Investigators found that Paddock amassed high-powered weapons and ammunition in the hotel room in the days leading up to the shooting, unnoticed by hotel security. 
The countersuit maintained that the hotel was protected under a 2002 U.S. law known as the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act, or SAFETY, which limits liability to certain businesses that take prescribed steps to ""prevent and respond to mass violence."" 
MGM maintained in the lawsuit that a private security company employed for the festival and certified under the SAFETY Act by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) exempted the hotel from liability.
""MGM parties cannot be held liable to defendants for deaths, injuries or other damages arising from Paddock's attack,"" the lawsuit said, adding that any claims against the hotel must be dismissed.
Robert Eglet, a Las Vegas-based trial lawyer representing shooting victims, said the SAFETY Act had ""nothing to do with MGM or Mandalay Bay"" because the hotel's own security contractors were not certified by the Department of Homeland Security. A separate security company hired by the concert promoter was DHS-certified, Eglet said, but nobody has sued them.
Eglet has about 1,000 shooting victims as clients but said most have not taken the hotel to court, and he said that none of the handful of victims who have lawsuits against MGM were named as defendants in Friday's actions seeking immunity.

At least six victims who sued the hotel in state court in Las Vegas are already contesting a previous move by Mandalay Bay to shift the case to federal court by invoking jurisdiction under the SAFETY Act, Eglet said.

(Reuters) - A judge with a U.S. labor agency on Tuesday rejected McDonald's Corp's (N:MCD) proposed settlement of a major case on whether the fast-food company is accountable for alleged labor law violations by franchisees across the country.
The settlement proposed in March lacked important details and would probably not bring an end to the sprawling case that began in 2012, National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Administrative Law Judge Lauren Esposito in New York said in a written opinion.
The settlement would have allowed McDonald's to avoid a ruling that it is a ""joint employer"" of workers at McDonald's franchises and can be held liable when franchisees violate federal labor law and made to bargain with unions. 
Illinois-based McDonald's said in a statement that it was disappointed with the decision and was considering appealing it to the five-member NLRB. 
The company said the proposed settlement ""is fair, reasonable, and provides the opportunity now for full and complete relief to all current and former franchisee employees affected by the litigation.""
The company had agreed to pay between $20 and $50,000 to individual workers who claimed they were fired for taking part in nationwide protests calling for higher wages. 
Fight for $15, a union-backed worker advocacy group that organized the protests, had asked Esposito to reject the settlement. 
The group's lawyer, Mary Joyce Carlson, in a statement on Tuesday said McDonald's and the government agreed to the ""sham"" settlement ""to hand the company a get-out-of-jail-free card for illegally harassing, surveilling and firing minimum-wage workers who joined together and spoke out for a better life.""
Business groups have said that a ruling against McDonald's could upend the franchising model by making franchisors more vulnerable to lawsuits and requiring them to bargain with unions representing franchise workers. 
The case is seen as an important test of how a 2015 NLRB decision that made it easier to prove that a company is liable for labor law violations by contractors would apply to franchisees. 
Fight for $15 filed dozens of legal claims on behalf of McDonald's workers beginning in 2012. 

    A trial began in 2015. Esposito in January agreed to pause it so that NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb, an appointee of President Donald Trump, could pursue settlement talks with the company.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 05:23PM ET</span>","United Airlines raises profit forecast, trims capacity expansion","By Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - United Airlines (N:UAL) raised its profit forecast for 2018 on Tuesday, as average fares and traffic both rose and it trimmed capacity expansion in the face of soaring fuel costs.
Shares of United rose as much as 4.2 percent in trading after the bell as the airline's second-quarter profit also topped analysts' estimates.
The third-largest U.S. airline forecast adjusted profit for the full year at between $7.25 and $8.75 per share, up from its previous range of $7.00 to $8.50 per share.
Bigger rivals Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) have both cut their full-year earnings forecasts in light of rising oil prices.
The Chicago-based carrier cut its plans for capacity growth for the year to a rate of between 4.5 percent and 5 percent, a company spokesman said. It had previously forecast a range of between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent.
The company said net income fell to $684 million, or $2.48 per share, in the quarter ended June 30 from $821 million, or $2.67 per share, a year earlier, hit by an already-flagged $105 million write-down of the value of its Brazil routes.
On an adjusted basis, the airline earned $3.23 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $3.07, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total operating revenue rose 7.7 percent to $10.78 billion, while average fares rose 1.5 percent. 
Fuel costs, which accounted for a quarter of United's total costs, surged 43.2 percent, reflecting a steep rise in crude oil prices since early 2016. 
United said it paid $2.26 per gallon for aircraft fuel on average, up from $1.63 a year earlier.

Shares of the airline have risen 7.7 percent this year, compared with a 13.9 percent fall in the S&P 500 Airlines index <.SPLRCAIR>.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 04:46PM ET</span>","Wall St. climbs on Powell comments, earnings","By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its fourth consecutive session of gains after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed an optimistic U.S. economic view and solid earnings bolstered the outlook for a robust reporting period. 
In written statement Powell signaled that an era of stable economic growth may continue, but the Fed chairman was challenged in a congressional hearing by senators worried about the Trump administration's trade policies. 
""(Powell) suggested that they're keeping an eye on trade developments and people are looking at that as a signal that they may moderate their rate increases if they see some signs of danger,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. 
The U.S. Treasury yield curve hit its flattest in over a decade as Powell's upbeat economic view supported more rate hikes, with 2-year yields climbed to their highest in nearly a decade.
As the second-quarter earnings season shifts into high gear this week, analyst forecasts have grown rosier. 
Analysts now see second-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 21.2 percent, up from 20.7 percent on July 1. Of the 39 companies in the index that have reported so far, 84.6 percent have come in ahead of Street expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Earnings optimism was boosted by a report from the Federal Reserve showing an increase in U.S. industrial production led by a rebound in manufacturing.
""Economic reports ... are suggesting that activity in the second quarter might have been better than expected,"" Jankovskis said. ""That, perhaps, is playing into some of these increases in forecasts."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 55.53 points, or 0.22 percent, to end at 25,119.89, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 11.12 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,809.55 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 49.40 points, or 0.63 percent, to 7,855.12.
The Nasdaq's advance was led by  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), all of which hit record highs.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven ended the session in positive territory, with materials (SPLRCM) and technology (SPLRCT) seeing the strongest gains.
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) led the healthcare sector's 0.5 percent advance, rising 3.5 percent after beating analysts' profit and revenue estimates.
Shares of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) edged down 0.2 percent as the investment bank reported better-than-expected earnings and said David Solomon would replace outgoing CEO Lloyd Blankfein.
UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) weighed the most heavily on the Dow, its shares down 2.6 percent as the largest U.S. health insurer reported higher-than-expected quarterly medical costs.
Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) regained ground, rising 5.2 percent after falling more than 14 percent following the streaming services company's reported shortfall in second-quarter subscriber additions.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 52 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.00 billion shares, compared to the 6.54 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Banks will get the most attention again when companies report earnings before the bell Wednesday.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is expected to post a profit of $1.11 per share for the most recent quarter on revenue of a little more than $10 billion. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) beat profit expectations on Tuesday, but shares were weaker on disappointing trading revenue.
US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) will also release results.
The pharma sector will also be in focus.  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) and Novartis (NYSE:NVS) are both scheduled to report earnings.
Bernstein initiated coverage on Abbott Labs late last month with an outperform rating, predicting that strong product launches would spur growth.
2. Housing Starts Expected to Post Small Decline
On the economic calendar, investors will get a glimpse on how the housing sector is performing.
Housing starts for June are expected to have dropped slightly to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million. Building permits are forecast to post a gain to 1.33 million.
There will also be the weekly data on oil inventories. The Energy Information Administration is expected to report that crude stockpiles fell 3.622 million for the week ended July 13.
And Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell wraps up his two-day appearance before Congress when he testifies at the House Financial Services Committee.
3. United Tops Expectations
Airline stocks could be active Wednesday following a solid earnings report from United Continental (NYSE:UAL).
The company reported second-quarter results that beat on the top and bottom lines.

Jane Buchan and Girish Reddy, who have run the $30 billion firm since early 2017 when PAAMCO and KKR Prisma merged, will stay on as senior advisors until the end of the year.
Buchan, who co-founded PAAMCO in 2000, plans to launch her own quantitative investment fund early next year and Reddy, who co-founded Prisma in 2004, will retire from the money management business.
""Today we feel the organization is ready to move to the next generation,"" Buchan said in a statement about the decision to step aside. 
The move comes as hedge fund investing is becoming more difficult. Many pension funds who have traditionally relied on firms like PAAMCO Prisma to create portfolios of hedge funds for them are trying to save money by cutting out these types of middlemen. 
And identifying the next superstar hedge fund managers is also becoming tougher as the average fund returned less than 1 percent in the first half of 2018, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.
Eric Wolfe will chair the new executive committee which will have three members who came from PAAMCO and three who came from Prisma. Anne-Gaelle Carlton, Mayer Cherem, Vince Cuticello, Von Hughes, and Paul Roberts will also sit on the committee.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.22%. The S&P 500 gained roughly 0.40%, while the Nasdaq Composite added about 0.63%.
Bargain-hunting investors piled into Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock after it plunged more than 14% intraday on the back of a weaker-than-expected quarterly report.
The streaming giant said Monday after markets closed that it added just 5.2 million subscribers in the second quarter of the year. That was well below the company's own guidance of about 6.2 million new user additions for the quarter.
Tech was further bolstered by a surge in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to record highs after a report suggested the e-commerce giant 'Prime Day' sales growth soared year on year in the first 12 hours of the sales event.
Sales soared by 89% in the first 12 hours of Prime Day compared to the first 12 hours last year, according to Feedvisor.
Positive earnings from Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth Group also boosted the broader market.
Goldman Sachs posted earnings that topped consensus, while UnitedHealth reported above-consensus earnings, but premiums fell short. Johnson & Johnson, meanwhile, topped consensus on both the top and bottom lines.
Goldman Sachs also revealed, as was widely expected, that David M. Solomon would succeed Lloyd Blankfein as the bank's chief executive officer.
Sentiment on equities was also supported by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's upbeat assessment of the economy.
""Our policies reflect the strong performance of the economy and are intended to help make sure that this trend continues,"" Powell said.
Powell will remain in focus Wednesday as he slated to testify before the House Financial Services Committee.
The rally in the broader market was held back, however, by continued weakness in the energy sector, as oil prices remained under pressure despite rebounding from a nearly one-month low intraday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery gained 2 cents to settle at $68.08 a barrel.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 02:28PM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs pressed on strategy as new CEO confirmed,"By Matt Scuffham and Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) was pressed for details on new businesses after an uneven second-quarter performance, a likely preview of challenges incoming Chief Executive David Solomon will face as he leads the Wall Street bank's overhaul.
The bank on Tuesday confirmed Solomon will take over from Lloyd Blankfein, who has held the position for 12 years, on Oct. 1, ending months of speculation. Solomon is tasked with executing a plan to boost revenue by entering new businesses and refashioning old ones. 
The bank has pledged $5 billion more in annual revenue by growing its fledgling consumer bank, squeezing more from businesses like asset management and changing how it approaches trading. 
Once considered the most savvy Wall Street trading house, it has suffered because of tougher regulation since the financial crisis of 2007-2009 and low market volatility crimping revenues.
Goldman's quarterly profit topped analyst estimates, but equities trading was flat and higher fixed-income trading followed a notably weak year-ago period. 
Its shares, down 10.6 percent since the start of the year, were down 1.6 percent at midday.
In a research note,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts attributed the decline to questions about the bank's shift in focus and noted Solomon's absence from the earnings call.
Goldman Chief Financial Officer Martin Chavez told analysts on the call that Solomon's promotion was ""all part of the strategy.""
""You'll see here the emphasis on more recurring fee-based revenue and you've seen that in the results. The emphasis on the growth plan, on driving revenue and earnings growth,"" he said.
Chavez was also questioned on whether the bank was looking to improve disclosure and transparency for newer businesses. 
The bank gave some details on its new consumer lending business, Marcus, for which it has big ambitions, including a planned launch in Britain. Marcus' loan book currently totals just $3.1 billion compared with rival JP Morgan's $400 billion consumer loan book. 
Chavez was asked why Marcus has yet to offer a banking app at a time when mobile banking is becoming the primary way customers transact.
Analysts also asked why Goldman's compensation ratio had declined and for details on Goldman's investing and lending division and planned cash management push.
Second-quarter profit rose 44 percent to $2.3 billion, or $5.98 per share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $3.95 per share. Analysts' average estimate was for $4.46 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Analysts suggested investing and lending business and the bank setting aside less money for bonuses fueled the profit beat.
Goldman said bond trading revenue climbed 45 percent from an unusually weak year-ago quarter.
In equity trading, Goldman Sachs lagged rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), all of which reported gains.
Total revenue rose 19 percent to $9.4 billion, including increases in everything except fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",U.S. judge questions scope of indictment against Insys founder,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday expressed concern about the scope of an indictment against several former  Insys Therapeutics Inc  (O:INSY) executives accused of bribing doctors to prescribe an opioid and suggested U.S. prosecutors streamline the case to avoid its dismissal.
U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston said she believed the indictment did not contain enough allegations to support a racketeering conspiracy charge against billionaire Insys founder John Kapoor and six other former executives and managers.
""The indictment has a core of conduct that's problematic and may be criminal,"" Burroughs said during a hearing. ""I don't know, that's what a trial is for. But I'm have having difficultly with the way it's laid out."" 
The indictment charges Kapoor, former Insys Chief Executive Michael Babich and others with conspiring since 2012 to pay bribes to doctors to prescribe the drugmaker's fentanyl-based cancer pain medication Subsys and to defraud insurers.
Burroughs said she believed the indictment lacked sufficient allegations to establish a relationship between the Insys executives and the various doctors accused of taking bribes that would legally support the racketeering charge.
She made the comments as Beth Wilkinson, Kapoor's lawyer, urged Burroughs to dismiss the case, saying prosecutors seeking to bring a big opioid epidemic-related case under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act had overreached.
""They're getting pressure to show they're being tough on the opioid crisis,"" she said. ""We don't have to guess why they did it.""
Burroughs did not rule. But she said prosecutors should look at whether the case could be ""streamlined and clarified"" as she did not want to dismiss the charges due to a lack of evidence. A trial is scheduled for January.
Subsys is an under-the-tongue spray containing fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine. It won U.S. regulatory approval in 2012 for use in managing pain in cancer patients.
The U.S. Justice Department has accused Insys of paying kickbacks to doctors to prescribe Subsys, often via fees to participate in sham speaker programs ostensibly meant to educate medical professionals about the drug.
Kapoor was indicted in October and added as a defendant in a case against six other people, including Babich, who were first charged in December 2016.
Other defendants include Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry, former Insys vice presidents, former National Sales Director Richard Simon, and Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan, former regional sales directors. They also have pleaded not guilty.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Netflix shares take hit as subscriber slip hints at 'lumpy' road ahead,"By Vibhuti Sharma and Brijesh Patel
(Reuters) - Shares of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) headed for their worst day in two years on Tuesday, falling as much as 14 percent after reporting a surprise shortfall in new subscribers in a quarter marked by the lack of a blockbuster new show and World Cup soccer. 
While Wall Street remains overwhelmingly positive on Netflix and its role in video streaming globally, the second quarter figures did raise question marks over future growth and six brokerages cut their price targets on the company's shares.
""The quarter is a reminder that Netflix's cadence of net adds is not linear, but lumpy in nature,"" said Justin Patterson, an analyst with Raymond James and Associates in San Francisco, while pointing to the absence of a new hit series as a driver.
""The company had lots of new content during the quarter; what it did not have was a major new breakout series."" 
Riding on the success of its original shows such as ""13 Reasons Why,"" ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black,"" Netflix had beaten subscriber growth expectations in seven out of last 10 quarters.
The stock price doubled in the last year, raising its value to within sight of $200 billion as of Monday's close. 
What is not clear is where the hurdles to that unbroken run of growth will come from, be it stronger competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime or the changes in control of major film and TV franchises heralded by Walt Disney Co and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's bid for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.
Analysts at MoffettNathanson said that Netflix's domination of its sector looked less durable than the other high-flying FAANG group of new media and internet companies. 
""The moat around Netflix's business model does not appear as deep as other models,"" it said. ""We doubt that they can create and enjoy monopoly economics in content creation and internet distribution."" 
Netflix added 5.15 million customers from April through June, 1 million fewer than forecasts from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S and down from 7.41 million in the first quarter.
""While subscriber weakness is obviously an issue, the company's inability to explain it satisfactorily could weigh on the stock over the coming quarter,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said. (Click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2NpRgAv for an interactive on Netflix subscriber additions verses estimates) 
Still, there was only one outright cut in a trading recommendation on the stock - by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to hold from buy - and two others actually boosted their recommendations. At least three raised their price targets. 
""Netflix has faced hurdles before and this Q2 report won't be the last,"" PiperJaffray analyst Michael Olson wrote.
""The long term potential is too great for us to suggest anything other than buying (the shares),"" he added, listing a just 15 percent share of internet households outside China as a huge potential market. 
Olson and several others pointed to the World Cup as a possible distraction in the quarter that might have encouraged subscribers to hold off or freeze subscriptions for a month. 
The 2018 soccer tournament that is among the most-watched TV events started on June 14 and has just finished.
""Netflix is in a business that varies by quarter anyway and perhaps the company shouldn't have gotten too enamored with the crazy success of the last two quarters, which was invigorating but not sustainable,"" Forrester analyst James McQuivey said.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 12:36PM ET</span>","Next Goldman CEO to take on old problems, new businesses","By Matt Scuffham and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) named David Solomon as its next chief executive officer on Tuesday, ushering in a new era for the Wall Street bank as it expands into different businesses and revamps familiar ones.
Solomon's promotion from his current role as president and chief operating officer comes months after the 56-year-old investment banker was first reported as next in line to succeed longtime CEO Lloyd Blankfein. His first day in charge is October 1.
""David is the right person to lead Goldman Sachs,"" Blankfein said in a statement. ""He has demonstrated a proven ability to build and grow businesses, identified creative ways to enhance our culture and has put clients at the center of our strategy. Through the talent of our people and the quality of our client franchise, Goldman Sachs is poised to realize the next stage of growth.""
The change comes at a turning point for Goldman Sachs, which is trying to generate another $5 billion in annual revenue by growing its fledgling consumer bank, squeezing more from businesses like asset management and changing the way it approaches trading.
Management detailed parts of that plan last September after years of insisting that Goldman's once-lucrative trading business would come roaring back to life when markets picked up. Instead, since 2009, Goldman's annual trading revenue has declined by $20.8 billion.
Unlike Blankfein, who rose through the trading ranks to become CEO, Solomon made a name for himself advising corporations on financing and strategy in Goldman's investment bank. He joined as a partner in 1999 after working in commercial paper, junk bonds and leveraged finance at firms including Salomon Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns.
Alan Schwartz, executive chairman at Guggenheim Partners who worked with Solomon at Bear in the 1990s, said he showed natural leadership qualities early in his career.
""David is a very good big picture thinker while at the same time staying on top of all the details,"" Schwartz said. ""Finding both in one individual is unusual.""
Several Goldman bankers who spoke to Reuters said employees in the business have been celebrating Solomon's triumph in a long succession race. (http://reut.rs/kPAtnJ)
Though he was considered a ""dark horse"" candidate years ago, Solomon managed to outlast a number of rivals, including several from the trading business. Among them are former longtime chief operating officer Gary Cohn, who left Goldman last year for a role in President Donald Trump's White House that he has since departed, and former co-chief operating officer Harvey Schwartz, who left the bank in April after Solomon was chosen as Blankfein's successor.
Through most of its history, Goldman has alternated between traders and bankers as CEOs. There is natural tension between the two sides of the house at most Wall Street banks, especially after the trading losses and scandals that stemmed from the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
Nonetheless, Solomon will have to get traders and bankers to cooperate on the revenue growth plan, which depends partly on the idea that customers should rely on Goldman Sachs not just for merger advice or stock offerings, but for all their borrowing, trading and money management needs.
He may also pursue acquisitions to bolster Goldman's consumer banking operation, or expand into areas like corporate cash management.
News of Solomon's appointment came on the same day Goldman reported second-quarter results, which showed a 44 percent profit rise but ongoing struggles in trading.
Beyond the business turnaround, Solomon's legacy will depend on whether he can fill Blankfein's shoes.
The 63-year-old CEO, who took the helm in 2006, oversaw Goldman Sachs through its most difficult period in modern history, involving a taxpayer bailout during the financial crisis, protests over Goldman's role in the crisis and massive regulatory changes that curtailed some of its most lucrative businesses.
""We've had tough days (or a crisis or two),"" he joked in an internal memo viewed by Reuters announcing the succession plan.
Blankfein resisted pressure to leave during some of those moments, saying there was no better job to have. But in more recent years, he has joked that he does not want to die on the job like one of his predecessors, Gus Levy, who suffered a fatal stroke at a meeting.
He is stepping away at a time when Goldman Sachs is on steadier footing, but needs fresh leadership to reinvent itself, said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst at Vining Sparks.

""That is what David Solomon's challenge is,"" said Mosby. ""That is why they're changing the management team.""

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Boeing to seek supplier cost reductions after Embraer deal: CEO,"By Tim Hepher and Eric M. Johnson
FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) will press for deeper price cuts from suppliers with overlapping operations once it completes its planned acquisition of the regional jet business of Brazil's Embraer, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters on Tuesday.
""The key thing you are going to see is that through the combination between Boeing and Embraer, we will be able to increase volume for our supply chain, which is generally going to be beneficial. And that beneficial volume should also turn into more affordability and competitiveness,"" he said.
Asked if he would expect further price cuts over and above those baked into Boeing's Partnering for Success cost-cutting drive, he said: ""Yes. Because you'll see additional increases in volume. And a very typical discussion we'll have with our supply chain is if there's an opportunity for them to increase volume or access to additional platforms, if we can gain a cost advantage in the marketplace, that's a mutual benefit.""
Boeing, meanwhile, continues to ""keep a very close eye"" on consolidation trends among its major suppliers and will continue to expand where it sees it necessary to support its business.
""In some cases, consolidation can be beneficial where it allows the supply chain to take costs out. If we get to a point where consolidation is reducing our sources to a level where we can't stand, we've had the opportunity to build new sources of supply. We always have that flexibility,"" Muilenburg said.
Muilenburg indicated Boeing would continue to push into areas traditionally dominated by its suppliers, by bringing some parts of the supply chain in-house, a process known as vertical integration.
Some aerospace suppliers have been rattled by Boeing's recent moves to integrate parts. In the most recent example, it set up a joint-venture with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) to break into the highly concentrated market for auxiliary power units.
""We are very targeted in that area,"" Muilenburg said, when asked where he would set the limits for such expansion.
Boeing has 30-40 categories or ""verticals"" across its platforms and when deciding which ones to invest in, it will be driven first by what adds value and then by whether there is a good services business attached, he said.
Muilenburg was speaking shortly after Boeing unveiled a higher 20-year demand forecast for passenger jets driven by the untapped travel demands of a steadily expanding global middle class.
He did not see any reason to modify those forecasts despite global trade tensions.

""In the past where we had an aerospace sector that was largely dominated by U.S. and Europe, our backlogs were dominated there ... it's a much more globally distributed [business] today.""

Sandy Munro, president of Michigan-based Munro & Associates, said the car generates net profit margins in excess of 30 percent. Munro, whose firm tore down the Model 3 to better understand it, made his comments on an appearance on Monday on Autoline, an automotive-focused television show.
In previous episodes discussing the Model 3, Munro had been critical of the car's fit and finish but praised its handling on the road.
""The Model 3 is profitable, so I have to eat crow. I didn't think it would happen this way,"" he said on Monday. ""No electric car is getting 30 percent net, nobody.""
Munro could not be reached by Reuters for comment on Tuesday.
Tesla, whose shares were up 1.7 percent at $315.42 in Tuesday morning trading on the Nasdaq, is pushing to increase production of the Model 3, which starts at $35,000 and is key to the electric carmaker's profitability. The company has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3.
Munro's firm has done work for several automakers and also is followed closely in the analyst community.

1171,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",J&J's Rising Pharmaceutical Sales Hurt by Strong U.S. Dollar,"(Bloomberg) -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) recorded 20 percent growth in its drug unit in the second quarter, but the company is trimming its forecast for the year as a strong dollar hampers its growth.
The U.S. medical conglomerate said in a statement Tuesday that it was cutting its full-year revenue projection to $80.5 billion to $81.3 billion, from $81 billion to $81.8 billion, and narrowing its adjusted earnings forecast.
The shares were up 0.6 percent to $125.40 in trading before the markets opened in New York, reversing earlier losses.
J&J is based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, but generates about half its sales overseas. It’s one of the first major U.S. multinationals to report earnings after President Donald Trump began implementing a round of tariffs and threatening others, which has rattled markets.
Those changes in the markets appear to have affected J&J. Three months ago, the company said exchange rates would give it a 4.2 percent boost to sales; this quarter it cut that estimate to 1.9 percent.
Currency trends could weigh on other large drugmakers as well, said Vamil Divan, an analyst with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
“This was a key driver of the company lowering full-year sales guidance and sets a potentially cautious tone for earnings season for the U.S. pharma space, especially those with greater ex-US exposure,” Divan said in a note.
Since April 16, the day before J&J’s last quarterly report, the U.S. dollar is up 5.4 percent against a basket of 10 major global currencies. Trade and monetary policy tensions between nations can have a stark impact on currency markets.
J&J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk, who took over the role this month, said the company hadn’t been hurt by specific tariffs -- although products in its consumer unit are most vulnerable
“It’s really not attributable to the trade war at all,” Wolk said. “It’s simply the macro effect of a stronger dollar.”
The currency shifts have also affected J&J’s drug unit, which has grown quickly through deals and new products to become the company’s biggest. The unit’s benefit from exchange rates fell to 2.3 percent in the second quarter, compared to 4.3 percent in the prior period.
Wolk also said the company will continue to defend itself in the legal saga surrounding its talc products. Last week, a jury ordered the company to pay $4.69 billion to women who claimed asbestos in the products caused them to develop ovarian cancer, the six-largest product defect verdict in U.S. history.
“We believe the science is overwhelmingly on our side,” Wolk said. The company has said it will appeal the judgment.

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 10:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lloyds Bank plans three EU subsidiaries after Brexit - sources,"By Sinead Cruise and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group plans to operate three subsidiaries in continental Europe after Britain leaves the EU, according to a source familiar with the matter, in a sign of how Brexit is fragmenting a banking industry long concentrated in London.
Lloyds (L:LLOY), Britain's biggest mortgage lender, was widely expected to manage its continental business from one new subsidiary in Berlin. But executives now plan two further hubs to service customers across the European Union, the source told Reuters. One is likely to be in Frankfurt and the location of the second is yet to be confirmed, the person said.
The plans by Lloyds - an institution more than 250 years old that has always concentrated its operations in Britain - shows how Brexit is forcing banks to upend history and business models to guarantee they can continue selling their products in Europe.
They are part of a wider trend that is seeing lenders distribute their post-Brexit resources among a number of cities on the continent rather than basing the bulk of operations in one place as they have for decades in London.
Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) said in March it would pursue a ""decentralized"" model, in line with moves by Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Bank of America (N:BAC) and JPMorgan (N:JPM).
Such plans will incur greater costs and complexity, as each subsidiary needs to be capitalized and licensed by regulators. They run counter to the expectations among many executives and analysts, following Britain's 2016 vote to leave the EU, that banks would each choose one main continental hub to replace London, with Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin the frontrunners.
A spokesman for Lloyds declined to comment.
Earlier this year, separate sources told Reuters that Lloyds would house its main European subsidiary in Berlin, after converting an existing Bank of Scotland branch that Lloyds inherited following the HBOS takeover a decade ago.
SINGLE MARKET
The plan to run three continental units has partly been prompted by new British regulations that have already forced UK banks to carve up balance sheets into individually capitalized ""ringfenced"" and ""non-ringfenced"" entities ahead of a January 2019 deadline.
The rules are aimed at insulating bank depositors from riskier trading activities and protecting taxpayers from having to backstop troubled banks once deemed ""too big to fail"".
To comply with the rules following Brexit, Lloyds needs a second subsidiary to support its non-ringfenced euro bond trading business, the source said.
That subsidiary is likely to be set up in Frankfurt, the source said, which is home to Europe's biggest euro bond trading market outside London and offers the bank the best chance of running a smooth service to clients following Britain's expected exit from the EU single market on March 29 next year.
The Frankfurt subsidiary will not need a full banking license but Lloyds has applied to Germany's financial markets regulator for the requisite investment firm license, the source added.
Lloyds is also seeking to establish a third subsidiary in an as yet unconfirmed location to support its Scottish Widows ""closed-book"" insurance business, which include premium-paying policies from customers based across the European Union.
All three subsidiaries will need to be capitalized individually, the source said, but the total pool of capital needed is not expected to be large compared with the size of the group's overall balance sheet.
Earlier this year, Reuters reported the ultimate size of the pool of capital carved out to capitalize the Berlin subsidiary was expected to run to the ""low hundreds of millions of pounds"", representing less than 1 percent of the bank's overall capital.
Lloyds already employs around 300 people in Berlin, including a full management team, finance, risk and human resources staff. It expects to shift no more than a handful of staff from Britain to complement the existing workforce, the source said.

1174,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 09:41AM ET</span>",IT'S OFFICIAL: Goldman Sachs names David Solomon next CEO,"It's official. David Solomon will succeed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein as the Wall Street firm's new CEO. The firm made the announcement on Tuesday, saying Solomon will become CEO and join the board on Oct. 1. 
Solomon's ascension to CEO was largely expected after he was named in March as the sole president of Goldman,  following the departure of his co-president Harvey Schwartz. With the formal announcement, Solomon can now begin to make changes to his leadership team.
Blankfein will remain chairman through the end of the year, and then take the title of senior chairman after his retirement. 
“David is the right person to lead Goldman Sachs,"" Blankfein said in the firm's statement. ""He has demonstrated a proven ability to build and grow businesses, identified creative ways to enhance our culture and has put clients at the center of our strategy.""
Blankfein, who once joked that he would die at his desk, was the longest-serving Wall Street CEO after JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon. Taking the reigns of Goldman in 2006, Blankfein, a former gold salesman, navigated the firm through the financial crisis and the subsequent fallout in which the firm was demonized  and called the ""vampire squid"" of finance.
He later helped improve Goldman's public image, serving as an elder statesman of sorts for the industry. Under Blankfein, Goldman has expanded away from its roots as a pure investment bank and  into new areas such as its consumer banking business, Marcus. 
Raised in a housing project in Brooklyn’s East New York neighborhood, he attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School through financial aid. 
Solomon cut his teeth as a banker at Bear Stearns before joining Goldman as a partner in 1999. He ran the bank's leveraged finance unit and rose up the ranks of the the investment banking business  with a reputation for being Goldman's point man on many key client relationships, including those with 3M, Disney's Bob Iger, and the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.
He's also known for his work to address gender imbalance within Goldman's workforce, and for spearheading a task force to try and retain junior bankers. 
Solomon is also known for his unorthodox hobby: production of electronic dance music. Solomon, known as DJ D-Sol, recently released his first track, a dance remix of Fleetwood Mac's 1977 hit ""Don't Stop."""

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",UPS tests 'smart lock' technology in New York apartment buildings,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) on Tuesday said it is testing ""smart lock"" technology that allows its delivery drivers to open doors and drop multiple packages at secure locations inside apartment buildings around New York City.The test includes ""hundreds of non-doorman"" multi-family buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn that have installed Latch's ""smart access system."" The project comes as UPS is working to make ""last-mile"" e-commerce deliveries to households more convenient and cost effective by reducing package theft and the need for drivers to make repeated delivery attempts. 
""It's difficult to securely deliver packages in high-density, multi-family urban residences, especially when people are not at home,"" said Jerome Roberts, vice president of global product innovation at UPS.
The partnership with Latch - a New York City-based startup that has raised $26 million in private funding - enables UPS drivers to open entry doors with a handheld device that has a different access credential for each building on a route. Every time a driver enters a building, Latch creates a traceable record.
Derek Banta, UPS's director of global product innovation concepts, said the parcel delivery company will assess the potential cost savings from ""completing more deliveries on the first attempt.""
UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, and rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX) have invested billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to handle surging demand for e-commerce deliveries. Residential deliveries typically cost more than business deliveries because drivers usually drop more packages per stop at offices than at homes.
FedEx told Reuters it began testing smart lock technology in select markets before the winter holiday shipping season last year. FedEx declined to identify the test markets or its smart access technology partner.
Latch a year ago teamed up with Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) Jet.com e-commerce site to test its technology at 1,000 residential buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Walmart also made waves in September when it started dropping packages inside homes - or groceries inside refrigerators - as part of a test with August Home smart lock customers in Silicon Valley.

Amazon.com (O:AMZN) late last year announced a secure-lock service called Amazon Key that enables Amazon Logistics delivery workers to briefly unlock a customer's door to drop a package inside.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) raised its rolling 20-year industry forecast for passenger and cargo aircraft on Tuesday, as a steady flow of deals on day two of the Farnborough Airshow underscored the industry's resilience to rising global trade tensions. 
The world's biggest planemaker predicted 42,700 industry deliveries over the next two decades, up three percent from its estimate of 41,030 a year ago. That would be worth $6.3 trillion at list prices versus last year's $6.1 trillion forecast.
The U.S. group and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) continued to rack up deals at the air show in southern England after a brisk opening day on Monday.
Russian airline Volga Dnepr committed to buying Boeing freighters worth $11.8 billion at list prices, while U.S. leasing company Air Lease Corp committed to buying as many as 78 Boeing aircraft worth $9.6 billion.
In the meantime, Airbus bagged a provisional deal with an unidentified customer for 100 single-aisle A320 family jets, worth about $11.5 billion at list prices.
But analysts cautioned many deals firmed up provisional ones, disclosed previously unidentified buyers, or changed existing orders, making it hard to gauge the level of demand. 
Rising oil prices and interest rates, trade tensions and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union all pose a risk to an eight-year boom in civil aviation, which has boosted industry order books and share prices. 
Boeing's forecasts underscored the sector's reliance on emerging markets in general and China in particular, making the U.S. planemaker especially vulnerable should trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalate into a full trade war.
Boeing, which calls itself America's biggest exporter, delivered more than one out of every four jetliners it made last year to customers in China, one of the world's fast-growing aircraft markets.
Boeing's vice-president of commercial marketing Randy Tinseth told a news briefing that China looked set to overtake the United States as the world's biggest domestic air travel market in 10-15 years.
But he declined to be drawn into commenting on U.S. trade policy, saying: ""We are going to focus on what we can control.""

INTENSIFYING COMPETITION
Dominating Boeing's upbeat outlook was a five percent increase in the forecast for single-aisle aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, underpinned by an unchanged prediction for average global traffic growth of 4.7 percent.
The Chicago-based planemaker now sees 31,360 deliveries in the medium-haul, single-aisle category, the cash cow of the world's top two planemakers and popular with low-cost airlines. Two weeks ago, Airbus (PA:AIR) raised its own rolling forecast for industry deliveries by more than seven percent and revamped the way it predicts demand, introducing new plane categories from 'Small' to 'Extra-Large' and blurring the traditional boundaries between aircraft types. Boeing's Tinseth said Airbus sought to show it was winning a sizable share of the aircraft market. 
""Let me make one thing clear,"" Tinseth said. ""By every measure, in every way, our wide-bodies are winning. Period."" Even so, Boeing lowered its wide-body delivery forecast by 140 aircraft to 8,070, saying higher deliveries over the last year and longer-range single-aisle planes ate into the rolling forecast. Boeing saw a small increase in demand in the cargo market, a barometer of trade and business confidence, forecasting 980 new freighters from a projected 920 a year ago, fuelled by the growth of e-commerce, particularly in China. The planemaker unveiled a volley of freight orders in the first two days of the Farnborough show.
Boeing's overall forecast tally is a bigger number partly because it counts aircraft with 90 seats or more, whereas Airbus starts at 100 seats. The smaller-end of the aircraft market has seen its biggest shake-up in decades after Airbus closed a deal to buy Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) 110-130-seat CSeries jet, mirrored last week by Boeing's tentative deal to acquire the commercial unit of Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3). Boeing shaved its forecast for the regional jet fleet to 2,320 deliveries. Analysts expect Boeing and Airbus to use their scale to heap pressure on suppliers to lower costs, which could trigger consolidation.

With the industry giants moving onto its turf, Japan's big hope for the regional jet market, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), was dealt a setback on Tuesday when it had to cancel a demo flight after the jet was hit by a truck.

LONDON (Reuters) - Fund managers have cut equity allocations to the lowest level since November 2016, with 60 percent of investors seeing a trade war as the biggest risk for markets, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's (BAML) latest monthly poll showed on Tuesday.
The bank's July 6-12 survey of funds managing $663 billion worldwide showed a 14 percentage point cut in equity exposure to a net 19 percent overweight, the lowest level since the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States.
To view a graphic on BAML poll - global equity allocation, click: https://reut.rs/2NiIUun
BAML said investor conviction of a trade war being the biggest tail risk was the highest since concerns surrounding European Union sovereign debt funding in July 2012. Another 19 percent cited a hawkish policy mistake by the U.S. Federal Reserve or European Central Bank.
Trump has stepped up his attack on the U.S.'s key trading partners over the last month, rolling out tariffs against China and threatening more, while labeling the European Union a ""trade foe"".
China has accused the United State of bullying, warning it will hit back after Washington threatened 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. This followed tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods.
""Investor sentiment is bearish this month, with survey respondents eyeing the risks from a possible trade war,"" said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BAML. ""Equity allocation has fallen notably while growth and profit expectations have slumped.""
To view a graphic on BAML poll - Biggest tail risks, click: https://reut.rs/2JtVYL9
Profit expectations are now the lowest since February 2016, with a net 9 percent of respondents saying they do not expect an improvement in the next 12 months, down 53 percentage points since the start of the year.
Emerging market equity allocations were among the biggest casualties of the growing trade war fears. These suffered their biggest monthly drop in two years, taking the allocation down 23 percentage points to a net 1 percent underweight.
Emerging stocks (MSCIEF) are down almost 8 percent year-to-date.
However, investors remained bullish on U.S. stocks, raising their exposure to a 9 percent overweight, the highest since February 2017. Conversely, the eurozone equity allocation fell to a net 12 percent overweight, the lowest since December 2016.
U.S. stocks (SPX) are up about 4.6 percent so far this year after robust economic growth and large corporate tax cuts, while the European equity market has flatlined (STOXX).
So-called FAANG and BAT (LON:BATS) technology shares were identified as the most crowded trade for the sixth month in a row, cited by 53 percent of survey respondents. ""Short EM equity"" was cited by 12 percent and ""long oil"" by 10 percent.
The FAANG category includes Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAP), Amazon (O:AMZN), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google (O:GOOGL). BAT refers to China's Baidu (O:BIDU),  Alibaba  (K:BABA) and Tencent (HK:0700).
BAML said this was the most crowded trade outright since ""long U.S. dollar"" in 2015. The allocation to tech stocks rebounded 10 percentage points to a net 33 percent overweight in July, making it the most favored sector of the month.
Conversely, banks suffered their biggest drop in global exposure in two-and-a-half years, down 17 percentage points to a net 3 percent overweight. BAML noted this was a 33 percentage point drop over two months and a two-year low, as the U.S. yield curve fell to a post global financial crisis low.
The allocation to UK equities rose to a net 18 percent underweight, the highest in over two years. Investor sentiment towards Britain has been poor since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016 but sterling weakness has lifted equity markets in recent months.
In BAML's survey of European fund managers, a net 18 percent preferred to overweight France on a 12-month time horizon.
Italy, where two anti-establishment markets have formed a coalition government, remains the least favored market in Europe, with a net 36 percent of investors saying they would underweight Italian stocks.

Meanwhile, the firm’s revenue increased 19% from the same quarter a year earlier to $9.4 billion, beating the forecast for $8.66 billion. Goldman commented that it was the highest second quarter revenue in the last nine years.
However, the firm also reported that revenue from equities sales and trade was $1.89 billion, which missed the consensus forecast for $1.97 billion.
According to the press release, Goldman ranked first in worldwide announced mergers and acquisitions for the year-to-date and also ranked first in worldwide equity and equity-related offerings, common stock offerings and initial public offerings for the year-to-date.
“Solid performance across all of our major businesses drove the strongest first-half returns in nine years,” Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman’s chairman and chief executive, commented in the press release.
“With a healthy economic backdrop and deep client franchises, the firm is well-positioned to invest in attractive opportunities to meet the needs of our clients and continue to generate earnings growth,” he concluded.
At 7:52 AM ET (11:52 GMT), shares fell 0.71% to $229.50, compared to the previous closing price of $231.44.
Traders will now turn their attention to the firm’s conference call due to start at 9:30AM ET (13:30GMT)."

Sales across the company's three main units rose, with the pharmaceutical business surging nearly 20 percent to $10.35 billion, accounting for almost half of total sales in the second quarter. 
The company's shares were volatile in premarket trading, recovering from an initial drop to trade up 1.4 percent at $126.46.
J&J has vowed to appeal a Missouri jury verdict that earlier this month ordered the company to pay a record $4.69 billion to 22 women, who had claimed their cancer was caused by J&J talc products. 
The company is facing about 9,000 lawsuits alleging that its talc-based products, including its baby powder, caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, a rare cancer linked to asbestos. The company has denied that the products contain asbestos or cause cancer of any kind.
Net earnings rose to $3.95 billion, or $1.45 per share, in the second quarter, from $3.83 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company reported a profit of $2.10 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.07.
Total sales rose to $20.83 billion from $18.84 billion a year ago, above analysts' estimates of $20.39 billion. 
International revenue for J&J rose 11.8 percent in the reported quarter, and accounted for nearly half of its total sales. 
The healthcare conglomerate said it expects full-year sales of $80.5 billion to $81.3 billion, compared with a prior estimate of $81.0 billion to $81.8 billion. The company cited a strengthening dollar for the trim.
Analysts had expected full-year profit of $8.12 per share and sales of $81.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
J&J said it now expects adjusted earnings of $8.07 to $8.17 per share, compared with an earlier forecast of $8.00-$8.20 per share.

Air Lease told a press briefing at the Farnborough Airshow that three 787-9s and the first 20 737 MAX airplanes in the total deal were firm purchases, while the remaining 55 737 MAX airplanes were provisional commitments.
Air Lease said it had flexibility for taking 737 MAX 8 and 9 variants and expected to take delivery between 2020 and 2024, though most of the jetliners would likely be delivered during the latter portion of that time frame.
Separately, Air Lease Chief Executive John Plueger said he was convinced, based on conversations with numerous airlines, there was strong interest and a need for a new mid-market jet Boeing is considering.
""There's definitely strong interest in the entire global airline marketplace in this aircraft,"" Plueger said. ""The business case is up to Boeing, to be able to get there.""

Steve Udvar-Házy, executive chairman of Air Lease's board, said later that choosing an engine for the mid-market jet would be one of the toughest choices Boeing has to make, adding it would be ""nice"" to have a choice between two engines.

Most budget airlines offer short-haul routes, but Level was established last year to offer low-cost long-haul flights, joining a handful of other airlines in this relatively new market, including Norwegian (OL:NWC).
""One of the reasons we chose the Level brand to operate from Vienna (is) that we are looking for opportunities to further expand long-haul flights,"" Walsh said at a news conference in Vienna to launch Level, adding that a decision on the new routes had not been taken yet.
But Level will initially fly short-haul routes from Vienna where it will compete with Europe's biggest low-cost carrier Ryanair (I:RYA). 
Vienna Airport (VI:VIEV) has been trying to attract budget carriers with an incentive scheme in the aftermath of the collapse of Air Berlin. 
Budget airlines which have launched or increased services in Vienna in the past few months include easyJet (L:EZJ), Lufthansa's (DE:LHAG) Eurowings, Budapest-headquartered Wizz Air (L:WIZZ), and IAG's own short-haul low-cost carrier Vueling.
Aviation industry experts have already started speculating that there might eventually be casualties in such a crowded market.
Walsh said: ""We would not do this if we weren't convinced this is for the long term."" He said the Austrian market was still under represented and under served and that its short-haul budget brand Vueling would continue to fly from Vienna.
IAG initially agreed to buy former Air Berlin's Austrian business Niki before it lost out to Niki Lauda. 
Level will start operating from Vienna with four leased Airbus A321, which were part of Air Berlin's insolvency estate, and plans to increase its fleet to 30 within the next five years, Walsh said.
Its 14 European destinations include routes which are already served from the Austrian capital such as Palma de Mallorca and Barcelona. 
IAG has already ordered more aircraft for its carriers and is currently in talks with Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) about buying more planes for its long-haul fleet, Walsh said. 

The group can chose between several options to buy or lease aircraft, according to Walsh. A decision was not expected before the first quarter of 2019.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 07:18AM ET</span>",Reviving supersonic passenger flights to harm environment: study,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Reviving supersonic passenger flights will harm the environment as the jets will not likely be able to comply with existing fuel efficiency, pollution and noise standards for subsonic aircraft, according to a study released on Tuesday.
U.S. based startups Aerion Supersonic, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace are all aiming to revive ultra-fast flights by the mid-2020s by modifying existing engines rather than spending billions of dollars to make a new one to serve a market that has been dormant since Concorde stopped flying in 2003.
Modified engines will burn five-to-seven times more fuel per passenger than subsonic jets, exceed global limits for new subsonic jets by 40 percent for nitrogen oxide and 70 percent for carbon dioxide, the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) said.
The ICCT said, based on its study, supersonic jet makers would be unlikely to meet environmental standards unless they used a new engine design with technology like a variable cycle that would operate differently at take-off than in cruise mode.
The alternative is for policymakers to ease standards for supersonic jets, the ICCT adds. 
The United States is already pushing for different standards for ultra-fast planes but facing resistance from European nations that want tough rules on noise.
""There are reasons to be worried about the environmental impact of reintroducing supersonic aircraft,"" said Daniel Rutherford, aviation director at the U.S.-based independent non-profit research organization. 
""A modest first step is for manufacturers to commit to meeting existing standards for new aircraft,"" added Rutherford, a co-author of the ICCT study.
ENGINE HEADWINDS
But finding an efficient engine for supersonic jets is tough in an industry that has for decades been catering to subsonic planes by improving fuel efficiency, expanding range and reducing noise through the use of larger fans.
Supersonic jets are most efficient at cruising altitude with smaller engines that are far noisier on takeoff, like those on fighter jets or old 727s that do not meet modern airport noise standards. Smaller engines help reduce aerodynamic drag when flying above mach speed - the speed of sound. 
 Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT)-backed Aerion has selected a GE (N:GE) engine core used in F-16 fighter jets and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737s as the basis for the engine on its planned jet, which will have a top speed of Mach 1.4.
Boom and Spike, which plan top speeds of Mach 2.2 and Mach 1.6 respectively, have yet to select engines.
""Even if you built something new, I think you are going to be struggling,"" said Daniel Edgington-Mitchell, an aerospace engineering lecturer at Melbourne's Monash University. 

""I think that is why there is such a push in the United States to reconsider the standards particularly for supersonic aircraft because it is just going to be really difficult.""

EU officials have pressured VW to do more to compensate European customers after it admitted to U.S. regulators in September 2015 that it had cheated on emissions tests there using software installed in as many as 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide - the majority of them in Europe.
Agencies from the EU's 28 member states and the European Union executive reiterated concerns that the German auto giant has not done enough to respond to a request it improve consumer information on the repairs, speed up the process and pledge to fix any problems arising after the repair.
Actions taken by VW on the 8.5 million car recalls made in the bloc ""so far resulted in positive developments,"" the EU said in a statement. The repair rate has almost reached 80 percent of all affected cars in Europe, it said.
But it added that: ""Volkswagen has not provided a full and clear guarantee that the update is not affecting the cars' performance and has refused to simplify the conditions giving access to the Trust Building Measure.""
Pushing VW to admit wrongdoing, consumer protection authorities asked the carmaker ""to make it clear that the use of that particular software was prohibited according to EU-law.""
""On the reason for the repair, Volkswagen is not clear enough,"" they said.
Despite VW's admission of harm to consumers in the United States, it says it has not broken the law in Europe and sees no need to offer similar compensation to consumers there.

1225,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",Trump's Metal Tariffs Spark Outcry From Companies Denied Relief,"(Bloomberg) -- Todd Adams won what he thought was a career-defining order last summer for his small, family-owned stainless steel manufacturer. Now, he’s paid “several hundred thousand dollars” from President Donald Trump’s tariffs that have cut deeply into that sale.
Adams is vice president of Stainless Imports Inc. and president of Sanitube LLC in Lakeland, Florida, one of the more than 40 initial U.S. companies whose requests for exemptions from tariffs on steel and aluminum imports were denied by the Trump administration. Adams was told his application was rejected for being incomplete, but he said he had to wait almost three weeks for an answer about what was wrong and still has questions about his denial.
While more than 30 companies have had their requests for relief from the duties granted so far, some businesses that were rejected say they weren’t given adequate consideration after other companies objected. Others, like Adams, are still trying to get a complete explanation for why they were turned down. They’re weighing how to respond and deal with added costs from duties that Trump started to impose in March on national security grounds.
“He’s fighting this trade war with my money,” Adams said. “It’s a gut punch.”
Companies can request exclusions from the duties if the imports they need are not produced in the required quantity or quality in the U.S. or for national-security considerations. More than 26,400 requests had been filed as of July 9, with 719 decisions so far, according to the Commerce Department.
Total Confidence
Adams said he was “100 percent” confident he would get an exclusion because he had to use a Chinese mill to get the unusually sized tube product needed for the order to supply a Midwestern dairy factory. There were high fives at the company with 15 employees because the contract was for more than $1 million, when the firm’s average order is $20,000, he said.
The Commerce Department posted its decision June 22 that the company’s request “has not met the requirements for consideration as a ‘complete submission.”’ But Adams said it wasn’t clear what was incomplete, and it took repeated calls and emails before he was told his application had the wrong product code -- a code he’s been using on imports for years, including on the order in question.
‘Not Knowing’
Arrow Gear Co. in Downers Grove, Illinois, also hasn’t gotten an explanation why four of its applications were rejected for being incomplete, and it still has 10 applications pending, said John Waller, the company’s material manager.
The firm with 200 employees wants duty relief from steel imported from the U.K. to make gears and pinions for aircraft, and it doesn’t have a “Plan B” besides resubmitting corrected applications, Waller said.
“For me, the whole not knowing is worse than anything else,” Waller said.
The Commerce Department said in a statement it hasn’t received requested funds to add needed staff, but that virtually all inquiries have received a response as of Monday. Matters such as submitting incorrect product codes are beyond its control, the department said, adding that companies should contact U.S. Customs and Border Protection for help before refiling.
Kyle Isakower, vice president for regulatory and economic policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said the administration’s process is arbitrary and lacks transparency.
“It’s not clear how and why certain exclusion petitions are granted or denied,” Isakower said in a statement.
Rejected, Accepted
Schick Manufacturing Inc. is trying to get answers from the Commerce Department because different requests involving the same material were both rejected and accepted, spokeswoman Lauren Medina said.
Joel Johnson, chief executive officer of Borusan Mannesmann Pipe U.S. Inc., said he made what he thought was a good offer to the deal-making president: grant his Texas pipe maker’s exclusion on importing steel from its parent company in Turkey to finish in Baytown, and he’d build a new mill and hire 170 people.
To drum up support for its requests, the company collected 4,500 postcards from its 275 employees and their relatives sent to Trump and other officials, offering cash prizes for the best written cards.
But the administration rejected the company’s exclusion requests, after other companies including U.S. Steel Corp. objected on grounds that the product Borusan Mannesmann wants to import is available from U.S. sources.
‘Bootstrap’ Argument
U.S. Steel said in an objection posted online that Borusan was trying to “bootstrap” an argument related to national security by promising to build the new factory.
“There is no national security interest in drawing further foreign Turkish investment into the United States to produce a product that is already produced in the United States, and for which substantial excess capacity exists,” the company said in its filing.
The Commerce Department agreed in its decision memo that there’s enough U.S.-made product for Borusan to use. Johnson said he’s reviewing his options, but the duties will cost his company between $25 million and $35 million a year.
“I think it’s just they didn’t maybe understand our offer,” Johnson said. “‘No’ is a lot easier to say than ‘yes.”’
Companies have been told to contact objecting businesses and request a quote on the steel or aluminum they want to buy, and if they are refused or can’t get the product, Commerce will reconsider their applications, the department said in its statement.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has promised changes to address criticisms of the exclusion process, including immediately granting a request if it’s properly submitted and no objections are received.
But Ross said at a June 20 Senate Finance Committee hearing that based on what officials have seen, “there is a high probability that relatively few of those will be granted” because many lack substance or face well-grounded objections. Ross also has suggested that some companies are “gaming the system” by filing requests they know don’t qualify.
Adams, of Stainless Imports, said he’s considering legal action, and losing the money paid in tariffs would be “crippling” to a small business that doesn’t operate with a high profit margin.
“We are the actual people who are feeling the real effects,” he said."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks recovered some ground on Tuesday as oil prices stabilised, while the dollar edged lower and most other markets were subdued before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies to the U.S. Congress.
MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was broadly unchanged, with energy companies in Europe and Asia recovering ground from early losses caused by the previous day's turbulence in commodity markets.
Brent crude initially fell for a second day after a 4 percent slump on Monday, as Libyan ports reopened and traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other producers, but they recovered to trade up 0.5 percent.
Europe's Stoxx 600 was up 0.1 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent, snapping two days of gains amid concern over growth in China.
In Europe, technology stocks fell 0.4 percent after U.S. tech giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) missed estimates for growth in subscribers.
""It's been a fairly sluggish and unexciting start to the week for markets. Whether things get more interesting or not probably depends on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell has to say when he testifies today in front of the Senate Banking Committee,"" said Craig Nichol, a macro strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
In currencies, the dollar index fell 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies to 94.409. The index shed 0.25 percent on Monday, nudging away from a two-week high of 95.241 on Friday.
POWELL TIME
Powell will testify on the economy and monetary policy before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.
He is likely to reiterate the Fed's stance towards gradual monetary policy tightening. Markets will focus on his views on recent trade tensions.
""In short, we expect the chairman to signal optimism on growth and inflation, consistent with continued 'gradual' tightening,"" wrote Jim O'Sullivan, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.
""He will undoubtedly acknowledge some downside risks associated with the administration's trade warmongering, but he will likely try to avoid sounding critical of the administration.""
Even before Powell's testimony, traders said the Sino-US trade conflict was keeping a keeping a lid on equity prices and currencies in both countries.
The Chinese government said on Tuesday it would hit its 2018 growth target, a day after it reported slower growth in the second quarter and the weakest expansion in factory activity in June in two years.
On Tuesday, economists at UBS lowered their estimates for Chinese gross domestic product to take into account trade war escalation, warning clients the country's currency is likely to weaken.
Chinese stocks were among the biggest losers in Asia on Tuesday, falling 1.7 percent.
Trading in government bonds was largely subdued ahead of Powell's testimony. Euro zone government bond yields across the bloc inched lower by 0.5 to 2 basis points, with investors unwilling to push yields any higher before Powell testifies.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade ban on Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE (SZ:000063) (HK:0763) wreaked havoc at wireless carriers in Europe and South Asia and forced operators worldwide to consider broadening their supply networks, industry sources told Reuters. 
Disruptions at Russian and emerging markets mobile operator Veon, one of the world’s 10 largest mobile firms by number of customers, illustrate the effects of the U.S. ban, which lasted three months, ending when the U.S. Commerce Department lifted the order on Friday. 
Veon was especially hard hit, suffering launch delays at its Italian joint venture and in Ukraine, near network outages in Bangladesh, and lesser disruptions at its Pakistan operations, sources at the Amsterdam-based operator told Reuters. “Veon has decided to second source everything,” a person familiar with the strategy shift at Veon said of moves to reduce dependence on any one supplier of network gear. 
“We don’t want the company to be in the same position we were in when the U.S. (ban on ZTE) came out: It caused massive problems in three or four of our markets,” the source said. 
Perhaps the biggest setback was for Italian mobile operator Wind Tre, which had a 1 billion euro ($1.17 billion) contract with ZTE to upgrade radio equipment.
The ban forced ZTE to abandon more than half of the remainder of the contract, and Wind Tre will use gear from network supplier Ericsson (ST:ERICb) instead, sources told Reuters. 
The original deal had marked ZTE’s biggest breakthrough into the European market, which has been dominated by regional players such as Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) of Finland. 
Ericsson's win with Wind Tre could be a sign of renewed momentum for the Swedish equipment supplier, which has struggled in recent years with slowing growth, restructuring and big job cuts. 
One industry expert said operators may start using multiple vendors to avoid being stuck with a supplier that comes under trade sanctions or suffers other extended disruptions. 
“Many supplier strategies will be reviewed,” said Bengt Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), a telecoms industry consultant based in Sweden who advises operators on equipment purchasing strategies. 
“Wind Tre was the first example so far. This is a wake-up call to the industry that if you have a single vendor dominating your network supply chain – ZTE for now, but other vendors eventually – you are leaving yourself exposed."" 
NETWORK FALLOUT 
Veon’s Ukrainian unit, Kyivstar, the largest mobile operator in that country, postponed its introduction of 4G mobile services in April because of the ZTE ban, according to two sources at Veon and one at ZTE. 
""The 4G launch had to actually be put on hold, so Kyivstar lost ground to competitors because of our obligations to comply with the denial order,"" said one of the sources, a senior executive at Veon.
Kyivstar's two main rivals are  Vodafone  Ukraine, owned by Russia's MTS/Sistema and UK-based global operator Vodafone (L:VOD); and Lifecell, a unit of Turkcell of Turkey. 
Kyivstar launched its 4G service in early July, more than two months behind schedule, by using a part of the network that didn't depend on ZTE, one source said. 
Network blackouts were narrowly averted at Veon’s Bangalink unit in Bangladesh.
""There was an issue with Bangladeshi network upgrades that really went down to the wire,"" the source told Reuters. ""Only at the 11th hour did the U.S. allow some temporary relief from the order.""
Global telecoms trade group GSMA negotiated a one-month reprieve with the Commerce Department that allowed Bangalink and other ZTE customers to engage in ""essential transactions"" that allowed existing networks and handsets to keep working, the group said. 
Veon has maintained strict compliance with the ZTE ban in all markets, two company sources said. All ZTE equipment shipped to Veon's subsidiaries after the U.S. order was returned. This included both network hardware and ZTE mobile handsets, a Veon executive at its Russian operating subsidiary said. 
Spanish telecom operator  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) relied on technical workarounds during the ban, but still canceled some ZTE contracts, a separate source with knowledge of the relationship between the firms told Reuters.
Lawyers at the two companies held weekly meetings to ensure careful compliance, the source said. 
ZTE was unable to ship any gear to the Spanish telecoms giant that relied on components from U.S.-based chipmakers Qualcomm (O:QCOM) or Intel (O:INTC) or smartphones running the Google (O:GOOGL) Android operating system, for example. 
Disruptions were minimized because ZTE contracts accounted for less than 5 percent of the telecom giant's equipment spending, the source said. 
The scale of workarounds and outages at other major ZTE customers, including China Mobile (HK:0941) and MTN (J:MTNJ), Africa's top operator, is not yet known. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce in April banned U.S. companies from selling goods to ZTE after the Chinese company failed to comply with a 2016 settlement involving evasion of sanctions against Iran. 

The U.S. lifted its ban on Friday, weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said the punishment was too harsh.

Ulrich Lehner resigned on Monday saying he was no longer able to safeguard the interests of employees and shareholders, deepening a leadership crisis after Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger resigned earlier this month. [nL8N1U91S5]
""A sharply worded resignation announcement from Dr. Lehner makes clear that aggressive restructuring may be in the cards, supporting our 33 euros sum of the parts based price target,"" Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld said in a note late on Monday.
""It is clear that Thyssenkrupp is at a crossroads.""
Thyssenkrupp shares closed at 20.60 euros on Monday.
Lehner, 72, said in a statement he no longer enjoyed sufficient support to develop the company in the interest of its customers, employees and shareholders and would leave at the end of July.
""I take this step consciously to enable a fundamental discussion with our shareholders on the future of Thyssenkrupp,"" Lehner said.
""A break-up of the company and the related loss of many jobs is not an option.""
Hiesinger and Lehner had championed a European merger of Thyssenkrupp's steel interests with those of India's  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC), sealed on June 30. [nL8N1TV6BY]
But activist shareholders have demanded deeper restructuring steps to raise the performance of its various businesses.
Hiesinger embarked on a restructuring push, merging the company's European steel operations together with rival Tata, but failed to win unanimous backing from some Thyssenkrupp shareholders.
Thyssenkrupp installed Guido Kerkhoff as acting chief executive but Hiesinger's departure opens up more fundamental questions about a company that was long run not only for profit, but also with the aims of upholding the legacy of its founding family and preserving jobs for its 158,000 workers.
Thyssenkrupp’s materials trading business is widely seen as a potential candidate for a sale, joint venture or listing.
But activists have called for more radical steps.
Thyssenkrupp has, however, insisted that some divisions such as elevators are a core part of the company.
""I respect Lehner's decision, but I regret it,"" Wilhelm Segerath, head of the Thyssenkrupp works council and a senior official in the IG Metall industrial trade union, said in a statement.
Workers command half of the seats on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board. Together with Krupp foundation, workers have the power to block deeper restructuring moves.
Segerath called on the main shareholders to work together to develop Thyssenkrupp.
""There can be no break-up of the business,"" he told Reuters.

A number of analysts and investors, requesting anonymity, told Reuters that Musk's comments were adding to their concerns that his public statements were distracting him from Tesla's main business of producing electric cars. The stock sell-off knocked almost $2 billion off the company's market value.
Tesla shares were at $307.20 in after-hours trading on Monday from Friday's close of $318.87.
James Anderson, a partner at Tesla's fourth-largest shareholder, asset manager Baillie Gifford, called the weekend's events ""a regrettable instance"" and said he had reiterated to the company the need for ""peace and execution"" of its core business.
The billionaire entrepreneur's spat with British caver Vernon Unsworth started last week, after rescue teams rejected Musk's offer of a mini-submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX to help rescue a 12-member soccer team and their coach trapped inside a flooded cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai.
""He can stick his submarine where it hurts,"" CNN quoted Unsworth as saying last week. ""It just has absolutely no chance of working.""
Musk shot back on Sunday on Twitter: ""We will make one (video) of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it."" The tweet was later deleted.
Tesla spokespeople and lawyers did not respond to emails and phone calls from Reuters requesting comment on Musk's comments on Twitter.
Musk gave no evidence for alleging Unsworth was a pedophile. Unsworth said he would consider taking legal action against Musk over the remarks, in comments filmed in Chiang Rai on Monday by Australia's 9News.
""It’s not finished. No justification. At the end of the day we were here to rescue 12 young boys. I don't really understand the guy. Obviously it's a bruised ego. I'll take advice when I get back to London,"" Unsworth told 9News.
Reuters could not immediately reach Unsworth for comment.
His wife, Voranan Rattawipakhun, told Reuters on Monday that her husband would return to Britain on July 19, where he will speak to lawyers.
A police officer in the Chiang Rai district where Unsworth has lived for seven years, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said that no charges or complaints had ever been filed against Unsworth.
In a Tweet, Musk had proposed ""a tiny kid sized submarine"" for the rescue. He showed a test of the submarine in a Los Angeles swimming pool on July 9.
Last week, Narongsak Osottanakorn, the leader of the rescue operation in Thailand, rejected Musk's mini-submarine as not suitable for the task. Musk responded on Twitter on July 10, calling Osottanakorn ""not the subject matter expert.""

Musk also regularly uses Twitter to criticize media reports on Tesla, which has struggled to meet its own production targets for its Model 3 sedan, which is seen as key to the company's profitability.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>",Ford agrees to $299.1 million U.S. Takata air bag settlement,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co agreed to a so-called economic loss settlement of $299.1 million covering at least 6 million U.S. vehicles with potentially faulty Takata air bag inflators, court documents filed in a federal court in Miami on Monday show.
The settlement covers several forms of economic damages linked to the inflators, including claims that vehicles were inaccurately represented to be safe, buyers had overpaid for cars with defective or substandard air bags and faced out of pocket costs to deal with recalls.
Six automakers have previously agreed to similar settlements worth over $1.2 billion combined, including: Honda Motor Co; Toyota Motor Corp; Nissan Motor Co; Mazda Motor Corp; Subaru Corp and BMW AG.
At least 23 deaths worldwide are linked to the rupturing of faulty Takata air bag inflators. The issue has sparked the largest auto industry safety recall in history, involving about 100 million inflators among 19 major automakers.
More than 290 injuries worldwide are also linked to Takata inflators that can explode, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks.
To date, 21 deaths have been reported in Honda vehicles and two in Ford vehicles.
Ford said in a statement it remains ""focused on working with our customers to get their vehicles repaired.""
The settlement also covers out-of-pocket costs, including lost wages and child care costs, Ford owners may face, or already incurred, to get vehicles repaired. Under the settlement, Ford will also provide free rental or loaner vehicles to owners of recalled vehicles who are awaiting repairs when parts are not available.
In total, nearly 30 million U.S. vehicles remain unrepaired in the recall.
Takata last year pleaded guilty to a felony charge of wire fraud to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation and agreed to a $1 billion settlement.
The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017. In April, auto components maker Key Safety Systems completed a $1.6 billion deal to acquire Takata. The merged company is now known as Joyson Safety Systems and is a subsidiary of Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp.
Heidi King, the deputy administrator of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday urged automakers to make their Takata air bag recall plans for replacing all defective parts.
""It is imperative that manufacturers take every available step to reach each and every owner of a vehicle with deadly air bags, and take action to ensure that those dangerous air bags are replaced as soon as is safely possible,"" King said.

The Ford-Takata settlement must still be approved by a federal judge.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said on Monday he had ""serious concerns"" about Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc’s (O:SBGI) proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO), a surprise move which could potentially scuttle the deal and sent shares of both companies tumbling.
Pai, a Republican, said evidence presented as part of the approval process suggested that the planned divestiture of certain television stations ""would allow Sinclair to control those stations in practice, even if not in name, in violation of the law."" 
Pai, whom Democrats have accused of making a string of decisions benefiting Sinclair, proposed referring the matter to an administrative law judge. The move could result in a lengthy delay and could effectively kill the deal, as in other mergers referred for administrative proceedings.
Sinclair, the top U.S. television broadcast group, said in a statement late Monday it was ""shocked and disappointed"" by the announcement and denied it was not in compliance with FCC rules. The company said it was ""prepared to resolve any perceived issues"" and looked ""forward to finalizing our acquisition of Tribune Media."" 
Tribune shares closed down 16.7 percent to $32.12, while Sinclair dropped 11.7 percent to $29.10. 
Tribune declined to comment. Pai and Sinclair have previously denied the Democrats' accusations. Democrats have also said the FCC's inspector general is probing the allegations. 
Sinclair, which owns 192 stations, said in May 2017 that it planned to acquire Chicago-based Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets. 
In April, Sinclair said it would sell 23 TV stations to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. It needs FCC permission to own more than one station in some markets.
Pai's statement raising questions about whether Sinclair would continue to control some of the stations it proposes to divest followed similar questions raised in separate filings with the FCC last month by the American Civil Liberties Union and conservative news outlet Newsmax Media. 
The deal has come in for sharp criticism that it would lead to significant TV station consolidation in the United States by many Democrats and by the attorneys general of three states who in a filing last month urged the FCC to reject the deal.
Sinclair, based in Hunt Valley, Maryland, has said that if the deal was approved, it would reach nearly 59 percent of the nation’s television households. Sinclair said Monday the deal ""will create numerous public interest benefits and help move the broadcast industry forward at a time when it is facing unprecedented challenges.""
A majority of the FCC voted Monday to approve the draft order circulated by Pai's office to refer the transaction for a hearing, a person briefed on the matter said. 
""It's widely recognized that when something is set for a hearing that the deal is not going to survive,"" said Gigi Sohn, a top aide to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. 
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said that after a string of policies ""custom built"" to support Sinclair, “the agency will finally take a hard look at its proposed merger with Tribune.” The draft order circulated by Pai's office, part of which was seen by Reuters, said the deal raised an issue that ""includes a potential element of misrepresentation or lack of candor"" that must be resolved before the FCC gives it a go-ahead. 
That could amount to ""misconduct,"" the order said. The Justice Department's separate review of the merger is still ongoing, the department said Monday.
The draft order raised questions about the divestiture of stations in Dallas and Houston as well as representations made by Sinclair about the divestiture of WGN-TV in Chicago. 
Sinclair responded that it denies ""such allegations in the strongest possible manner"" and said it has been ""completely transparent about every aspect of the proposed transaction."" 
Two FCC officials briefed on the matter said the language in the order made it extremely unlikely that Sinclair would be able to proceed with the merger as planned.
The order ""could also (put) pressure on them to divest more stations cleanly in the open market,"" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge.
Advocacy group Free Press said Sinclair forces stations to ""air pro-Trump propaganda"" - a charge it denies.

President Donald Trump has defended the conservative-leaning Sinclair, tweeting in April that the company was “far superior to CNN.”

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 07:38PM ET</span>",Netflix shares tank after big miss on subscriber growth,"By Lisa Richwine and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Inc's subscriber growth fell short of Wall Street expectations on Monday, sending shares of the normally high-flying stock down 14 percent on fears that the company's rapid expansion is slowing. 
The streaming video pioneer added 5.2 million customers from April through June, 1 million fewer than forecasts from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, as it added new programming including ""Lost in Space"" and new episodes of Marvel's ""Jessica Jones"" and ""13 Reasons Why."" 
""We had a strong but not stellar Q2,"" Netflix said in a quarterly letter to shareholders. 
Netflix said it had ""over-forecasted"" quarterly fluctuations in the pace of new customers. The company noted that it had underestimated subscribers for seven of the past 10 quarters.
Before the earnings report, Netflix shares had gained 109 percent, making it the second-strongest performer on the S&P 500 index. In after-hours trading on Monday, Netflix shares sunk 14 percent to $343.60, eroding $24.2 billion in market capitalization and down from an earlier close of $400.48.
""Investors are devastated by Netflix’s Q2 projection that went down in dramatic flames. Now future projections are suspect and that decimates valuation,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm Patriarch.
Wall Street had been betting that Netflix would deliver outsized growth as demand for online entertainment increases around the globe. The company is spending heavily to hook new customers, budgeting $8 billion for programming and $2 billion for marketing in 2018.
Netflix added 670,000 subscribers in the United States, well below analysts' estimates of 1.19 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
It signed up 4.47 million subscribers internationally, while analysts were expecting 4.97 million.
The overly optimistic projections were ""pretty broad across multiple markets,"" Chief Financial Officer David Wells said on a post-earnings webcast.
Executives voiced confidence about the long-term health of the streaming service. Chief Executive Reed Hastings said median viewing hours were growing, though he did not provide specifics.
""The fundamentals have never been stronger,"" Hastings said. 
Forrester analyst James McQuivey said he believed that the quarterly results were ""not a sign of softening in the business overall.""
""These are still millions of new subscribers, even if they didn't meet the expectations that might have been set by the last two quarters, which were extraordinarily high,"" he said.
Earnings per share came in at 85 cents, beating analyst forecasts of 79 cents. Total revenue rose 40.2 percent to $3.91 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $3.94 billion.
For the current quarter, Netflix projected it would add 5 million customers. It is making a big push in India. Earlier this month, it debuted its first Indian original series, ""Sacred Games,"" part of a slate of new shows aimed at the vast Bollywood entertainment market.
Netflix said operating margins would be narrower than previously expected because of the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated by more than 5 percent against major trading partners’ currencies in the second quarter. While most of the company’s revenue growth comes from international markets, the vast majority of its costs remain dollar-denominated.
Hastings said the company would make adjustments to account for foreign exchange rates in order to ""steadily"" increase operating margins.
At the same time, Netflix faces growing competition. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to add more regional content in India as it builds the Prime video service around the world. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is pouring money into original programming, signing up A-list names including Oprah Winfrey. And AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) has promised to boost investment in HBO after taking over the network in its Time Warner acquisition.
Meanwhile, cable distributors are offering smaller and cheaper bundles of channels. 
In the letter to shareholders, Netflix said it expected more competition from international players including ProSiebenSat 1 Media in Germany and on-demand service Salto in France.
""Our strategy is to simply keep improving,"" Netflix said.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Fast-growing e-cigarette maker Juul to launch in UK,"By Martinne Geller
LONDON (Reuters) - Silicon Valley e-cigarette start-up Juul Labs is bringing its small flash drive-sized vaping device to the United Kingdom this week, aiming to reproduce its break-neck U.S. growth overseas.
Since launching in 2015 Juul has transformed the market in the United States, where it now accounts for nearly 70 percent of tracked e-cigarette sales.
Juul says it targets adult smokers, but it has faced scrutiny over the popularity of its products with teenagers. In April the U.S. Food and Drug Administration launched a crackdown on the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to minors, particularly those developed by Juul Labs.
A day after the FDA's announcement, Juul revealed several initiatives to address the issue, such as earmarking $30 million to support government initiatives to raise the minimum tobacco-buying age.
Grant Winterton, Juul Labs' president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told Reuters that its activities in Britain would adhere from the start to its new ""social and public policy"", which calls for using only adults in its marketing and making sure its brand ambassadors are older than 28.
""It's true there are too many teens using our product, but they are far the minority,"" Winterton said.
Public health advocates are still debating whether e-cigarettes represent a health risk or potential benefit.
The Juul device will be available in 250 vape shops across the UK by the end of this week. A starter pack, including the device and four nicotine pods, will cost about 29.99 pounds ($39.66).
Winterton said Britain was Juul's third market after the United States and Israel, partly because it has the world's ""most supportive government"" when it comes to encouraging smokers to vape. Also on the radar are France, Germany and Italy.
The San Francisco-based company recently raised $650 million in equity financing as part of an investment round aimed at raising $1.25 billion, a securities filing showed last week.
A source familiar with the matter said the round would be completed by the end of July and that it valued Juul at more than $15 billion.
Winterton and co-founder James Monsees declined to comment on company valuation, revenue or growth.
Juul's main rivals are tobacco companies such as Altria (N:MO), Philip Morris International (N:PM) and  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS), who also sell e-cigarettes.
Despite many meetings with big tobacco companies, Monsees said he was not interested at the moment in partnerships or a takeover, saying their missions were at odds.
If Juul ever believed that a partnership with one of those companies would help to eliminate cigarettes, then it would take it very seriously, he said.
Apart from increased scrutiny and competition, Juul also faces potential U.S. tariffs on its electronic devices, which are made in China.
""We have a number of different options, but we're still looking at the implications of the tariffs so we can understand what strategy would be best for us,"" Monsees said.
The empty pods are made in China but more of their manufacturing process is moving to the United States, he added.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>","U.S. banks depositors shifting money, asking for higher rates","By David Henry and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Slowly but surely, depositors are starting to shift money from basic U.S. bank accounts to products that pay more than a sliver of a percent in interest.
While reporting second-quarter results in recent days, executives at the largest U.S. banks noted an acceleration in deposit outflows from wealthy individuals and companies, which are more sensitive to interest rate hikes. But there are signs that Main Street depositors are getting restless too, after the Federal Reserve lifted its interest rate target for the seventh time in less than three years.
""Lazy money is moving,"" Bill Demchak, chief executive officer of PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC), said on a call with analysts on Friday.
Wealthy customers reduced deposits by between 4 and 12 percent at the wealth management units of three of the biggest banks by assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, compared with a year earlier, the banks said.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), the third-largest bank by assets, said that more affluent clients were behind a 3 percent decline in deposits in its retail bank in North America.
The banks said that while the shift in deposit costs on smaller accounts is less noticeable, they are factoring higher deposit costs into their models for future earnings.
Deposits are the raw inventory of bank profits and provide some of the cheapest and most reliable funds. While deposit costs have started rising, the gap between what banks pay for deposits and what they generate from making loans remains wide.
JPMorgan, for instance, was paying more than twice as much on interest-bearing deposits in the second quarter as it did a year earlier, at 0.51 percent compared with 0.25 percent. Its loans generated 4.99 percent in the second quarter.
Overall, since the Fed began boosting rates in December 2015, banks have been able to avoid passing along even one-third of the total 1.75 percentage-point increase to depositors, according to analysts at Bernstein.
Some bankers are not too worried about retail deposits fleeing or costing substantially more. Bank of America's checking and savings customers are not pushing for higher rates, with the average balance rising to $7,500 from $7,000 a year earlier, executives said.
But others are bracing for further pricing pressure as the Fed is expected to boost rates again in September.

""You are going to start to see the U.S. retail customer, not just for Citi, but for the industry, begin to clamor for higher rates,"" said Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach.

The question for stock investors after the first helpings of second-quarter earnings is whether they’ve outstripped reality.
And while it’s way too early for a definitive answer, what scant evidence is visible now isn’t instilling confidence. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). plunged after reporting disappointing subscriber growth Monday, pushing an exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 index down 0.8 percent.
Results haven’t been awful -- Netflix actually beat profit estimates and reaffirmed its forecast for full-year cash flow. And earlier, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rose the most since March after reporting the highest earnings in eight years at its consumer unit. But particularly for tech stocks, many of which are up another 10 percent in 2018, not awful is not enough.
“The market maybe thinks if it happens to Netflix, it could happen to the others,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. “But we’ll have to see. I’m not sweating my holdings because of Netflix.”
S&P 500 companies are estimated to have earned $39.18 a share in the second quarter, up 20 percent from a year ago. For technology stocks the bar is higher. The group’s 31 percent expected growth rate is third highest out of 11 industries, behind energy producers and raw-materials suppliers.
So far, tech is having the worst time of the young reporting season. On average, shares in the industry fell 3.4 percent on the first day post earnings -- despite better-than-expected profits. That compared with a gain of 0.6 percent for S&P 500 companies that have announced results, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Only about 30 companies have reported to date, six of them in tech.
Netflix said it added 5.2 million users in the second quarter, about a million fewer than the company predicted. The world’s largest paid online TV network expects to add 5 million customers, a slower pace than a year earlier.
“It’s not the earnings that matter, or even the reaction to earnings,” Jonathan Krinsky, Bay Crest Partners chief market technician, wrote in a note before Netflix’s results. “It’s the ‘reaction to the reaction. In other words, expectations are high, and stocks largely reflect that coming into the numbers. So we will be watching to see how they react to those ‘good numbers.”’
A scenario equity bulls have dreaded is a repeat of the first-quarter reporting season, when virtually no number was enough to move the needle in Nasdaq stocks that had risen 30 percent or more in 2017. Netflix was more vulnerable than others to disappointment, with its previously $400 stock up more than 100 percent before today.
“Technology continues to be the most crowded sector,” Ann Larson, a quantitative analyst Bernstein, wrote in a note to clients. “Crowded trades are typically already priced for perfection, and as such the stocks don’t react much to incremental positive news, while negative news has a much more pronounced effect.”

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 05:28PM ET</span>","Bank of America profit beats on consumer loan growth, lower expenses","By Sweta Singh and Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) reported quarterly profit above analyst expectations on Monday as the second-largest U.S. lender cut expenses and benefited from growth in loans and deposits on the back of a strengthening economy.
Noninterest expense dropped 5 percent in the quarter from a year earlier as the bank trimmed headcount and worked on digitizing its retail operations to lower overhead.
Revenue rose in each of the bank's segments with the exception of global banking, where lower investment banking fees dragged revenue down 2 percent. 
The bank's shares were up 2.4 percent to $29.24 in morning trading.
During his near-decade long tenure, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan has focused on making the bank's sprawling operations more efficient. Two years ago, he pledged to cut expenses to $53 billion by the end of this year, and the bank confirmed it is on track to meet that goal and plans to hold expenses at that level through 2020.
Banks have been broadly expected to report higher investment banking fees this year as lower U.S. corporate tax rates and a friendlier regulatory environment encourage deal making.
Moynihan acknowledged on a call with analysts that the bank is underperforming peers when it comes to earning M&A advisory fees.
""The team knows they can do a better job, and they're after it,"" he said. 
The corporate tax cuts have helped boost Bank of America's bottom line along with its Wall Street peers, while Federal Reserve interest rate hikes have padded net interest income. 
Total loans increased 2 percent in the quarter for Bank of America, led by growth in its consumer banking and wealth management businesses.
Total loan growth continued to be weighed by its runoff portfolio of consumer real estate loans, while year-over-year growth in Bank of America's business segments was 5 percent. 
In comparison, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's core loans, which exclude consumer credit and loans to the biggest corporations, rose 7 percent in the quarter.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc's total loans rose 5 percent.
Loan growth combined with higher interest rates helped push net interest income up during the quarter, but rising interest rates also increased the price the bank pays for its deposits. 
The bank has increased the rate it pays for deposits in its wealth management and global banking units, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said.
Overall, Bank of America's net income applicable to common shareholders rose 36.3 percent to $6.47 billion in the second quarter. 
Excluding items, it earned 64 cents per share compared with the average expectation of 57 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net interest income rose 6 percent as the bank's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities helped it take advantage of four interest rate hikes in the past year.
Revenue, net of interest expense, fell 1 percent to $22.76 billion. Revenue in the year earlier quarter included a $793 million pretax gain on the sale of the bank's non-U.S. consumer card business. Analysts had expected revenue of $22.29 billion.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett has donated roughly $3.4 billion of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) stock to five charities, the billionaire's largest contribution in his longstanding plan to give away his fortune.
Buffett's 13th annual donation comprised about 17.7 million Class ""B"" shares of Berkshire, valued at $192 each as of Monday's market close.
The largest block went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Buffett's own foundation, named for his late first wife Susan, and charities run by his children Howard, Susan and Peter received the rest.
Buffett, 87, has since 2006 made more than $30.9 billion in donations to the charities, including roughly $24.5 billion to the Gates Foundation.
His largest previous annual donation had been $3.17 billion, in 2017.
Buffett still owns roughly one-sixth of Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he has run since 1965, despite giving away 43 percent of the shares he owned in 2006.
Following the latest donation, Buffett was expected to rank as the world's fourth-richest person, worth $79.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
He would have trailed Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' $149.7 billion,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates' $93.6 billion, and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) Chief Executive Bernard Arnault's $80 billion.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg ranked fifth, at $78.5 billion.

The five charities typically sell Buffett's shares to finance their activities, reflecting his desire that money be spent. Buffett makes smaller donations to other charities.

1270,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 04:23PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. J&J, Goldman Sachs {{0|Goldman Sachs}}) Lead Earnings Report
Two Dow components will headline earnings reports ahead of trading Tuesday.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is forecast to earn $2.07 per share for the latest quarter on revenue of $20.39 billion. But apart from the numbers, investors will be listening to the conference call for any updates about a recent judgment to pay $4.7 billion to women who said J&J’s talcum powder resulted in ovarian cancer.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is expected to earn $4.63 a share on revenue of $8.66 billion. Trading revenue will be in focus given JP Morgan's (NYSE:JPM) outperformance in that area.
Goldman Sachs is also expected to reveal that President David M. Solomon will succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein as the bank's next chief executive officer Tuesday.
Also reporting are  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH).
2. Fed Chief Powell Heads to Capitol Hill
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell heads to Capitol Hill Tuesday for the first appearance of his two-day Humprey-Hawkins testimony to Congress.
He will appear at the Senate Banking Committee first before appearing before the House Financial Services Committee.
Based on recent data and comments from Federal Open Market Committee members, the Fed is content with its plan of gradually increasing interest rates, which likely means two more hikes before the end of the year.
There is a more than 90% chance that rates will go up at the September meeting and a more than 60% chance of another rate hike in December, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Congressional testimony from the Fed chief rarely elicits hints on the direction of interest rates beyond what the central bank has already intimated. But there could be interesting comments on the state of the economy and the impact of the new U.S. trade strategy.
According to the latest University of Michigan report on July consumer sentiment, “negative concerns about the potential impact (of tariffs) had risen from 15% in May to currently 38% in July, while 52% of those surveyed in the top third of income distribution - equivalent to half of consumer spending - negatively mentioned the economic impact.”
3. Netflix Tumbles on Weak Subscriber Growth
Tech stocks could face weakness tomorrow after Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported disappointing earnings after the bell Monday.
The stock fell nearly 13% in after-hours trading.
The company reported subscriber growth – a key metric for the streaming service – well below what analysts predicted.
Netflix added 670,000 U.S. subscribers in the second quarter, far from the 1.19 million Reuters consensus estimate.
Revenue came in at $3.91 billion, lower than the $3.94 billion expected."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.18%. The S&P 500 fell roughly 0.13%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost about 0.26%.
BlackRock and Bank of America reported second-quarter earnings beats, but investors dumped BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) stock as the bank reported a slowdown in inflows.
Yet the more-than-4% gain in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock more than offset losses, driving financials to a solid gain for the day.
The upbeat performance in financials, however, were offset by a slump in the energy sector on falling oil prices. Oil prices settled lower on expectations the loss of Iranian crude from the global market would be less than many had anticipated after the U.S. said it may provide waivers to some importers of Iranian crude.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery fell 4.2% to settle at $68.08 a barrel.

Netflix kicked off earnings for blue-chip tech stocks after the bell Monday, with weaker-than-expected second-quarter results. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will report earnings on Thursday after market close.
Tech started the week on the back foot, ending the day mostly unchanged despite a rally in shares of Amazon to a record high.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed 0.52% higher as the tech giant got its 'Prime Day' sale underway, a 36-hour event which traditionally bolsters sales as customers flock online to scoop up discounts.
In economic news, core retail sales rose 0.4% last month, compared with an upwardly-revised 1.4% increase for May. The Empire State manufacturing index fell 2.4 points in July to a reading of 22.6.
The data came a day ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony on the economy and monetary policy before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT) in Washington, followed by the House Financial Services Committee the next day.
On the political front, a summit between US President Trump and Russian leader Putin drew little market reaction as focus was mostly centered on Russian meddling in the U.S. election.

MADRID (Reuters) - Brazil's government will go ahead with the auction of one of state-owned utility Eletrobras' power distributors planned for July 26, while delaying five others to Aug. 30, Planning Minister Esteves Colnago told Reuters on Monday.
Cepisa, the utility's energy distributor in the northeastern state of Piaui, has drawn the most interest and will be auctioned as planned despite recent legal challenges, Colnago said in an interview during a visit to Madrid.
There are ""several groups"" interested in Cepisa including potential Spanish buyers, Colnago said, without elaborating.
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, as Eletrobras is formally called, is seeking to offload the six heavily indebted distributors ahead of government plans to privatize the overall company.
The auctions hit a snag after a Supreme Court judge in June ruled that all privatizations must be approved by Congress moving forward, with a lower court stepping in to apply the decision to Eletrobras. The lower house of Congress gave its approval earlier this month to privatize the distributors, but the Senate has yet to vote on the matter.

The government initially said it would maintain the scheduled auctions of all the distributors set for July 26 as it appealed the decision, but Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia said earlier on Monday it was ""no problem"" to delay as legal issues are sorted out.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 03:18PM ET</span>","India ministry urges duty on Chinese solar cells, modules","By Sudarshan Varadhan and Sai Sachin Ravikumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's trade ministry on Monday recommended imposing a 25 percent duty on imports of solar cells and modules from China for one year to try to counter what it sees as a threat to domestic solar equipment manufacturing.
Falling prices of solar cells and modules, over 90 percent of which India imports from China, have triggered a decline in the cost of solar power generation and led Indians increasingly to adopt the technology.
India plans to make renewable power account for 40 percent of its total installed capacity by 2030, from 20 percent currently.
The proposed safeguard duty, which would apply for two years in total to imports from China and Malaysia, would be reduced in the second year to 20 percent for six months and then 15 percent for six months. The proposed duty is less than the 70 percent recommended by Indian authorities in January.
The recommendation, contained in a report published by the ministry and to be submitted to the government for approval, is intended to address a serious threat to the domestic solar manufacturing industry from Chinese imports, the directorate general of trade remedies (DGTR) said in the report.
Indian solar cell and module manufacturers said cheap Chinese imports were hurting the domestic industry, while Chinese manufacturers say imports are helping India accelerate its renewable energy adoption program.
""Solar module manufacturers are facing tough and unhealthy competition from imported modules,"" the report quoted the North India Module Manufacturer Association as saying.
The China Chamber of Commerce for Imports and Exports of Machinery and Electronic Products said the ""real cause of injury to the domestic industry is aggressive pricing practices of other Indian producers and not imports.""
Trade relations between the two Asian nations have thawed recently despite fears of a trade war elsewhere, with the two sides discussing ways to increase Indian sales of farm products and India pushing China to give access to its software service firms.
However, the trade deficit has widened to $62.9 billion in China's favor, an over nine-fold increase over the last decade.
India's share in China's exports of solar cells and modules rose from about a fifth in the first half of 2016 to two-fifths a year later, the DGTR wrote, adding that China had ""started targeting the Indian market more vigorously.""

Some Indian solar power generators, like Avaada Ltd, have expressed reservations about the duties. A safeguard duty would put solar projects worth more than 1000 billion Indian rupees ($14.59 billion) under jeopardy, Avaada told DGTR.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - China is saddling poor nations with unsustainable debt through large-scale infrastructure projects that are not economically viable, the head of the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) said on Monday. 
The criticism of Beijing - targeted by President Donald Trump in a trade war that has sent ripples through economies around the world - comes as Washington seeks to ramp up development finance in the face of China's global ambitions. 
Unveiled in 2013, President Xi Jinping's ""Belt and Road"" initiative aims to build an infrastructure network connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. 
China has pledged $126 billion for the plan, which has been praised by its supporters as a source of vital financing for infrastructure-starved partners in the developing world.
But in an interview with Reuters in Johannesburg, OPIC CEO Ray Washburne warned that the Chinese strategy created a debt trap for many poor nations.
""Just look at any project in these countries and they're overbuilding the size,"" he said. ""We try to have countries realize that they're indebting themselves to the Chinese.""
Washburne is not the first to warn of growing debt linked to Chinese infrastructure projects.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde in April cautioned China's Belt and Road partners against considering the financing as ""a free lunch"".
Sri Lanka formally handed over commercial activities in its main southern port in the town of Hambantota to a Chinese company in December as part of a plan to convert $6 billion of loans that Sri Lanka owes China into equity.
U.S. officials have warned that a strategic port in the tiny Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti could be next, a prospect the government there has denied.
Washburne also voiced concern over a $360 million expansion of the airport in Zambia's capital Lusaka currently being carried out with financing from the Exim Bank of China.
""The local economy isn't benefiting from that. It's a much too large airport. They'll have too much debt on it. At some point, someone's got to pay. Pay or the Chinese take control,"" he said.
KEEPING PACE
Lawmakers in the United States are advancing a new law - the BUILD Act - through Congress that Washburne says should bolster private U.S. investment in developing nations by doubling OPIC's access to U.S. Treasury credit to $60 billion. 
About a quarter of the active portfolio of OPIC, a government agency that helps U.S. businesses invest in emerging markets, is currently focused on Africa and it typically invests around $1 billion annually on the continent.
""With the right quality projects, it could double here,"" Washburne said, adding that many investments would focus on the kinds of infrastructure projects Chinese firms are currently dominating. 
""The Chinese are in with ports and railroads and highways, things that we need to be in as a competitor."" 
OPIC this month launched an Africa-focused initiative that will earmark more than $1 billion over the next three years for projects supporting transportation, information and communications technology and value chains.
""Instead of giving them a fish, we want to teach them how to fish,"" Washburne said. ""They'll have to stand on their own two feet. So we're not in making loans or doing projects that don't make economic sense.""

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","With new airport, Israel's Eilat competes for European tourists","By Steven Scheer
EILAT, Israel (Reuters) - Once almost lost to international tourism, the Israeli resort of Eilat hopes a new airport will attract a million foreign visitors a year by 2025, with eastern Europeans especially offering growth for the winter holiday season.
International tourist arrivals in Israel hit a record 3.6 million last year, pumping $5.5 billion into the economy. But three-quarters of them opted for Jerusalem, leaving the Red Sea beaches of Eilat more for Israeli holidaymakers.
Foreign tourists are scarce in the winter when temperatures in Eilat are warm but hotels are half empty.
Travelers to Eilat flying into Israel's main international airport near Tel Aviv need to take an extra domestic flight, or make an arduous four-hour drive through the Negev desert.
But the most glaring problem is the old airport in the city center, which can take only eight flights an hour and no wide-body aircraft. That capacity is already filled by the 1.4 million plus Israelis who fly to Eilat each year.
""Eilat almost disappeared from the map of international tourism,"" Tourism Minister Yariv Levin told Reuters. ""We saw only four (international) flights a week to Eilat three years ago, which is almost nothing. From next winter, we will probably see more than 50 and maybe even 60 flights per week."" 
Direct international flights are now available thanks to government incentives, but only to a stop-gap civilian terminal at the Ovda military airfield 60 km (40 miles) from Eilat. More than 175,000 foreign tourists flew into Ovda in the first five months of this year, double the entire figure for 2017.
But the $500 million Ramon International Airport will have an annual capacity of 2.5 million passengers, with room for expansion. Scheduled to open later this year, it will be able to handle 20 takeoffs and landings an hour and accommodate larger aircraft such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747s.
Ramon International, 18 km from the city, will replace the old airport while Ovda will revert to sole military use.
With Eilat bordering on Egypt's Sinai peninsula, where Islamic State remains active, it will be protected by a 30-metre (100 foot) high fence equipped with sensors and detection technology to protect against missile and other attacks.
DEAD SEA AND DESERT
The revival began in 2015, when the government and Eilat Hotels Association began offering airlines 60 euros ($70) per passenger they brought on direct flights from abroad to Ovda. Taxes and fees were also scrapped for three years to keep fares low. 
Mostly low-cost carriers such as Ryanair (I:RYA) fly in the winter season to Ovda, particularly from eastern and central Europe where rising living standards now allow many to take a second holiday as well as the traditional summer break. Links with western Europe are also growing, with flights from Zurich and Madrid starting this winter. 
""The growth potential is in foreign tourism because the local market is at a standstill,"" said Shabtai Shai, head of the Eilat Hotels Association.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, will add flights from Prague this winter for a total of 15 routes to Eilat 
Chief commercial officer David O'Brien noted that while the Canary Islands are closer for western Europeans, Eilat is a shorter hop for central and eastern Europeans.
""For once, Israel is able to exploit its geographical market,"" said O'Brien. ""The openness of Europeans to try new destinations is growing.""
Michael Watkin, visiting Eilat with his wife Nori from Copenhagen, said he would come more if there were direct, competitively priced flights from Denmark.
""The weather is so amazing all year round. When people are looking for a winter vacation they are looking for warmth, sun, going to the pool and just being outside,"" he said.
Liat Agassi, marketing manager for the city's Municipal Tourism Corporation, said Eilat's proximity to the Negev desert was also a draw. ""If you come from Europe, you see many things but you don't get to see the desert and you don't get to see the Red Sea,"" she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, reported smaller demand for its funds on Monday as investors fled risk, overshadowing a better-than-expected quarterly profit, and its shares dipped.
The company wrestled with difficult market trends during the quarter, including an industrywide slowdown in the demand for its hottest product, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track markets.
BlackRock's iShares-branded ETFs took in $17.8 billion during the quarter, down from $34.6 billion in the first quarter. The company also cut fees on some ETFs to increase its market share.
""Broadly, we've seen a weakness in flows this past quarter driven by investor de-risking and less investor risk appetite in the marketplace,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Michael Cyprys.
Cyprys said the company's growth is ""going to have ups and downs, and this is one of the downs,"" but added that investors ""have an opportunity to buy in on the weakness.""
BlackRock stock traded down as much as 1.8 percent before rebounding to trade down 0.2 percent.
Yet even with the slower-than-usual growth in demand for the funds, which are relatively cheap to manage as they gain in size, revenue rose more than 10 percent to $2.9 billion.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.07 billion in the second quarter, up more than 25 percent, as weaker, yet still positive, demand for index funds helped plump up margins and the company settled into a lower tax rate. 
Operating income, a measure of profits after some expenses including employee pay, rose 16.4 percent to $1.4 billion in the quarter from the same period in 2017.
The company's effective tax rate was 24 percent, down from more than 30 percent in the year-ago period, before a major U.S. tax cut was passed.
""The most important thing we've been proving is the strength of our diversified business model,"" which includes not just funds but also, increasingly, technology services, said Chief Executive Larry Fink in an interview.
BlackRock earned $6.62 per share, compared with $5.20 a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned $6.66 per share, while analysts expected $6.55, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Strong earnings growth, particularly in the United States, was clouded during the quarter by rising tensions between America and its trading partners. Fink warned that it is unclear ""where we're going with trade,"" adding that ""you saw a lot of international investors pull out of the market because they're questioning what does this all mean in regard to trade and globalization.""
Fink also told Bloomberg Television that markets could fall 10 to 15 percent if tariff wars become full-blown.
BlackRock ended the quarter with $6.29 trillion in assets under management, down from $6.32 trillion in the preceding quarter.

Investors pulled $22 billion from the company's stock funds and deposited $26 billion into its fixed-income products, according to the earnings release. Overall flows, excluding funds where investors park cash temporarily, were $14.50 billion, the lowest since the second quarter of 2016.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Fox shares drop as prospects of new Comcast bid fade,"By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) shares dropped more than 2 percent on Monday, as investors viewed the absence of a new bid by Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) for most of Fox's assets as meaning its bidding war with Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) for them is likely over.
Disney fended off Comcast's $66 billion all-cash challenge to its deal for the Fox assets last month by sweetening its offer to $71 billion in cash-and-stock. Time is running out for Comcast to come back with a new offer, with Fox shareholders scheduled to vote on the Disney deal on July 27.
CNBC reported on Monday, citing sources, that Comcast was ""highly unlikely"" to make a new offer for the Fox assets. However, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has kept his arrangements with banks in place to make a new offer, but he has not communicated his intentions or made a final decision.
Comcast would not be required to make a new announcement about walking away from the main Fox assets, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. It would be very difficult for Comcast to press on a new bid if it did not come this week, according to the sources.
Fox declined to comment. Comcast and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A new bid from Comcast for the Fox assets, which include its movie studio and several TV networks, would stretch the cable operator's finances, given that it has also offered $34 billion to acquire 61 percent of European broadcaster Sky Plc (L:SKYB). Fox, which owns 39 percent of Sky, has been also seeking to acquire the majority stake.
Comcast has also been seeking to convince Fox and investors that regulators would approve its bid for the main Fox assets after U.S. Department of Justice gave the green light to Disney's bid for them. However, the Justice Department's decision last week to appeal against the loss of its challenge to AT&T Inc's (N:T) takeover of  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) served as a reminder that risks persist of antitrust measures.
Walking away from the main Fox assets would give Comcast less negotiating leverage with Disney and Fox to end the bidding war for Sky. Several analysts have suggested that the two bidding wars for the main Fox assets and Sky could have been resolved with some kind of grand bargain between Comcast and Disney.
The fight between Disney and Comcast has been part of a bigger battle being waged in the entertainment industry as the growth of Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN) force the world's traditional media giants to spend tens of billions of dollars to keep pace.

Yet the chief executive officer of U.S. manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. and the commercial chief at European rival Airbus SE want no part of President Donald Trump’s trade war with China. They agree that nothing good will come from the tension that’s been gathering momentum over recent weeks.
Speaking at the Farnborough air show south of London on Monday, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg made the case that finding a solution to the dispute is essential because the aerospace industry relies on the free flow of goods. His stance was seconded by Guillaume Faury, who runs Airbus’s operation making jetliners for airlines across the globe, using parts shipped in from dozens of countries.
“There will be no winner if there’s a trade war around the world,” Faury said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “Aviation will continue to be international. We are based in the U.S., in Europe, in China, we do business across those blocs.”
Airbus and Boeing are locked in a global duopoly for most of their aircraft, so any imbalance stands to hand the other side an advantage. While Muilenburg said the risk of Airbus benefiting from the current trade spat is “a concern we have,” he dismissed the notion of any sudden shifts in order or backlog patterns because the industry is long-term and Boeing has an established presence in China.
Aerospace is the biggest trade-surplus generator in the U.S. and provides key manufacturing jobs, while China relies on foreign aircraft to help fuel economic growth, Muilenburg said.
“We are concerned about some of the discussions right now around trade,” the CEO said in a separate interview with Bloomberg Television. “Our aerospace business thrives on free and open global trade and we’re hopeful we’re going to find solutions as alternatives to some of the tariff discussions that have been going on.”
Boeing generated 13 percent of its sales in China last year, up from 7 percent in 2011. Sales in the region during that time more than doubled. The Chicago-based company stands in the direct crossfire of the retaliatory measures between the U.S. and China. But Trump has also lashed out against Europe on trade, and said it’s a “foe” when it comes to trade.
Besides its relationships with China, Boeing can also rely on its proximity to the U.S. government. The company has “a seat at the table” as it tries to contribute to a solution to the trade dispute, Muilenburg said. “Our voice is being heard.”
The two aerospace giants are facing off this week at the Farnborough event, which alternates with Paris as the year’s biggest showcase for orders and announcements in the aviation world.
In the past, they’ve traded accusations at the World Trade Organization over government subsidies. Boeing’s complaints to the U.S. about state subsidies to Bombardier Inc. ended up driving the Canadian planemaker’s C Series jet into Airbus’s hands. The Toulouse, France-based manufacturer is now taking orders on that aircraft, now dubbed the A220, at Farnborough.
Airbus stands to pull in deals for its A320neo and A350 jetliners, while investors are waiting for an update from Boeing on a potential new aircraft that would slot in between its 737 narrow-body and 787 wide-body jets. Muilenburg reiterated in the interview that the company wants to make a decision next year on the new aircraft, nicknamed the 797, and is holding onto a time slot of 2025 for a possible debut."

Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said that intensifying global trade tensions may spur a broad market downturn and a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
Stocks could drop 10 percent to 15 percent and U.S. gross domestic product would start slowing in 2019 if the Trump administration sees through its threat to levy tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports, Fink said, adding that would elevate the current tensions to a full-blown trade war.
“The market’s having a hard time digesting the whole change in globalization and trade,” Fink said in an interview Monday with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television. “The foundations of international trade are being raised and being questioned.”
Trade worries are already causing investors to “pause,” he added, despite record deal-making and stock repurchases. That effect has been compounded by the fact that for the first time in a decade investors can earn a return by keeping money in cash.
In the BTV interview, Fink also said he expects the yield curve to invert this year, yet he doesn’t think it signals an imminent recession.
The world’s largest asset manager is already seeing signs of investor skittishness. Earlier Monday, BlackRock reported that investors pulled $22.4 billion from its equity products in the second quarter. Inflows into its iShares products totaled $17.8 billion, the lowest since the second quarter of 2016. That was against a backdrop of muted investor flows in ETFs for the industry in general.
Some institutions also yanked money from equity markets to serve deal-making and share buybacks, Fink added in a separate interview Monday. No matter, BlackRock is built to withstand short-term market tremors because of its size and diverse product offerings, he said.
“Let’s be clear: over the years, BlackRock has modeled its business to have strong results in rising markets and declining markets,” he said. “No firm has our composition,” he said, touting the company’s expansion in technology, cash management and alternative investments such as infrastructure. Spikes in volatility drive greater demand for its risk-monitoring technology Aladdin, according to Fink.
BlackRock’s total assets under management were about flat at $6.3 trillion as of June 30. The New York-based firm also reported total net inflows of $20 billion in the period. Overall, the company had a solid quarter with adjusted second-quarter earnings of $6.66 per share, topping analyst estimates of $6.55 per share. Revenue gained 11 percent year-over-year.
“Investors have become accustomed to iShares consistently delivering outsized growth relative to peers,” Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders wrote in a note Monday. “However, today’s results are a reminder that even BlackRock is not immune to jittery markets.”

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 09:12AM ET</span>",Jetmakers see brisk start to air show as UK tries to soothe Brexit worries,"By Tim Hepher and Sarah Young
FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Planemakers racked up more than $20 billion of deals on the opening day of the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, suggesting demand for new passenger jets remains in rude health despite worries over trade tensions and Brexit.
The deal-making came as host Britain tried to convince a skeptical aerospace industry about its plans to leave the European Union, saying supply chains would continue to run smoothly and pledging money for a new fighter jet program. 
European jetmaker Airbus (PA:AIR) and U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) have been enjoying an almost decade-long boom thanks to rising emerging markets growth and a need among Western airlines to upgrade their fleets, and order books are bulging. 
Higher oil prices, rising interest rates, global trade tensions and uncertainty over Brexit have all raised concerns that demand may slow. 
But business was brisk on the first day of the July 16-22 air show, though analysts will be watching closely to see how many of the deals are new, and how many involve adjusting earlier business or switching models - something not always easy to spot at first.
Even before the first displays had taken to the skies over a sun-baked southern England, Boeing said delivery firm DHL, part of  Deutsche Post  DHL Group (DE:DPWGn), had placed a $4.7 billion order for 14 777 freighters, and purchase rights for seven additional freighters. 
It followed that up with a $3.5 billion deal for 30 of its hot-selling single-aisle 30 737 MAX 8 aircraft with U.S. aircraft leasing firm Jackson Square (NYSE:SQ) Aviation, while Qatar Airways finalised an order for five 777 freighters.
Meanwhile, Airbus announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for Taiwanese start-up StarLux Airlines to buy 17 of its A350 wide-body planes worth around $6 billion at list prices, and another MoU with an unidentified leasing firm for 80 A320neo single-aisle jets worth about $8.8 billion. 
The Farnborough Airshow is the industry's biggest event this year. It alternates with the Paris Airshow and collectively they account for over a quarter of industry order intake each year.
BREXIT
Opening the event south west of London, British Prime Minister Theresa May sought to reassure aviation bosses that her under-fire Brexit plan won't disrupt their supply chains.
""We will take back control of our borders, our laws and our money. But we will do so in a way that is good for business and good for our future prosperity,"" she said.
Businesses have been getting increasingly frustrated about the lack of clarity over future trading relations less than nine months before Brexit day on March 29, 2019.
Airbus, which employs around 15,000 people in Britain, warned earlier this month that if Britain left the EU without a deal - a so-called ""hard"" Brexit - it could result in production at its factories stopping and aircraft being grounded. 
Also at the air show, Britain's defense minister Gavin Williamson unveiled a model of a new fighter jet called ""Tempest"" that the country plans to build. 
He announced 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) of funding for the project to 2025 and said he was looking for other countries to join, with a senior Royal Air Force official saying Sweden was the most likely partner. 
The project faces competition from a rival European one after France announced in June that it would take a leading role on a new fighter program, saying it would start as a bilateral effort with Germany that could be expanded later.
WIDE-BODY WORRIES
On the civilian side, the air show is expected to confirm demand for narrowbody jets from airlines such as Mexico's VivaAerobus, which is shopping for some 40 Airbuses, and lessors like Goshawk, which ordered 20 A320neo jets on Monday but is also expected to be interested in 737 MAX. Major lessors Air Lease and Avolon are also in town.
But both Airbus and Boeing are under pressure to increase orders for some of their wide-body jets due to a recent slowdown in that part of the market. One exception is the Boeing 787, after a multi-year effort to end delays and cost overruns.
Speaking after the deal for wide-body A350s with StarLux, Airbus chief commercial officer Eric Schulz said he was confident the market for such planes would pick up. 
""What I have said consistently is that I see the wide-body market picking up within 18-24 months. I am quite confident.""

""There are explanations as to why this wave is now coming. We had a very massive wave 4-5 years ago with a lot of orders. I think the market had to pause a little bit until we could deliver consistently and get to ramp up and rate. I think this is behind us now.""

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - United Airlines (N:UAL) said on Monday it would buy four new  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787-9 widebody jetliners, as the third-largest U.S. air carrier looks to refresh its fleet with more efficient planes.
The deal, valued at roughly $1.1 billion at current list prices and announced during the Farnborough Airshow in southern England, was previously listed as unidentified in Boeing's backlog. 
Reuters reported in May that United was in talks with Boeing and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) over the purchase of wide-body, long-haul passenger jets to replace a fleet of 50 Boeing 767 aircraft.
United said it expects to take delivery of the aircraft in 2020. The longest-range version of the 787 family uses 20 percent less fuel than older-generation aircraft, United said. 
United also announced an order for 25 new E-175 planes from Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) to replace 25 CRJ-700 aircraft flown by its United Express service.

Najib and his family have faced intense scrutiny since a shock defeat in a May election by his former mentor-turned-foe, Mahathir Mohamad, who reopened an investigation into 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) after becoming prime minister.
Najib's initial suits came days before he was arrested and charged over suspicious transactions at SRC International, a former unit of 1MDB. Najib, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing regarding 1MDB and SRC, pleaded not guilty.
The three suits were withdrawn after pretrial hearings to allow Najib to file fresh suits, state news agency Bernama on Monday quoted lawyer Alice Loke Yee Ching, who was acting for the government, as saying.
A spokesman for the law firm representing Najib, Badrul Samad Faik and Co, told Reuters it needed to make changes reflecting recent developments regarding its client's criminal charges before filing new applications.
In the three civil filings, Najib's lawyers accused anti-graft chief Mohd Shukri Abdull, police commercial crimes head Amar Singh and Attorney General Tommy Thomas of prejudice against the former prime minister.
Najib's law firm had earlier told Reuters it was seeking a court decision whether there was ""an element of conflict of interest"" among those handling the case.
Shukri declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, while Amar did not immediately respond to telephone calls or messages to seek comment. The attorney general's office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from Thomas.
Last week, media reported Shukri as saying he would face any civil suit filed by Najib, while Amar told reporters the police would ""respond accordingly"" if there was a need.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) expects second-quarter net profits will be more than double analysts' forecasts in a rare piece of good news for Germany's largest bank which is cutting costs to try to revive profitability.
The stronger performance partly reflects higher revenues and a bigger drop in costs than analysts had been forecasting. It is a positive sign for new chief executive Christian Sewing, who took over in April and has embarked on plans to cut more than 7,000 jobs in an overhaul of the bank. 
But analysts and investors said it was too early to judge whether Deutsche was on a sustainable path to recovery.
The bank's unexpected earnings preview on Monday said net profit would be around 400 million euros ($468 million) in the quarter, more than double a consensus forecast of 159 million euros but still below 466 million euros reported a year earlier.
The bank also halted a steep decline in revenue, which it said was around 6.6 billion euros, ahead of expectations of 6.4 billion. That is flat compare with the same quarter in 2017, when revenue fell 10 percent from a year earlier.
""Management believes that these results demonstrate the resilience of the franchise,"" Deutsche Bank said ahead of its full earnings report due on July 25.
Deutsche Bank shares were up 7.4 percent at 1100 GMT, paring back earlier gains but still well ahead of a largely flat DAX index (GDAXI). The bank's shares are down 35 percent this year.
The bank, trying to bounce back from three consecutive years of losses, has had a run of negative headlines, including an abrupt management reshuffle, a downgrade by Standard & Poor's and failing the U.S. Federal Reserve's stress test.
""It's a bit of a relief that things are not all that bad, but I'm not sure if it's premature to call this a change in the downward trend,"" said Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon in Munich.
Deutsche's preliminary report said its key sales and trading revenues were down 15 percent, while revenues at the investment bank benefited from about 100 million euros from an asset sale.
Neil Wilson, chief analyst with brokerage Markets.Com, said the share price rise could be a selling opportunity for some. 
""It is perhaps a little churlish to be too negative, but it remains something of a habit that is hard to shake given the last few years,"" Wilson wrote in a note to investors.
The bank said it had made progress on plans to reduce staff, with headcount down about 1,700 people to just over 95,400.
Costs are expected to come in at 5.8 billion euros, compared with estimates of 6.0 billion euros, Deutsche said.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>","Boeing, Embraer defend planned deal, expect regulatory approval","FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Top  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) executives on Monday defended their planned commercial aircraft partnership, saying they were confident it would win regulatory approval.
""I can't anticipate that anyone will be against this project given the benefits that this will bring to Brazil,"" Embraer's Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva told a news briefing at Farnborough Air Show. ""Who can be against more jobs, more exports, more technology, more access to capital?""
The companies this month said they had struck a deal under which Boeing will take a controlling stake in Embraer's commercial aircraft arm in a new $4.75 billion joint venture that will reshape a global passenger jet duopoly.
The new company, encompassing Embraer's airliner business, thrusts Boeing into the lower end of the market, giving stiffer competition to the CSeries jets designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) which are backed by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the deal would mark a defining moment in Boeing's history and that there was ""great alignment"" between the companies.

He said the deal would allow Boeing to go to customers with combinations of fleet services between the 737 MAX airplane and E2 family, and offer other values in technology and services.

The U.S. investor is offering 53 euros for every share it does not already own, valuing the German firm at around 1.52 billion euros ($1.78 billion).
VTG stock, listed on Germany's small cap index (SDAXI), spiked 14 percent to 55 euros, indicating that some investors are hoping for a higher offer.
Kuehne Holding AG agreed to sell around 20 percent of VTG for more than 300 million euros, raising Morgan Stanley Infrastructure's stake in the company to 49 percent.
""We have friendly intentions and believe that due to our infrastructure expertise we are an excellent partner to drive VTG's growth,"" Markus Hottenrott, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners, told Reuters.
He added that the fund holds its investments for an average of seven years and that a potential domination agreement - requiring 75 percent of the shares - or a delisting of VTG are not crucial to Morgan Stanley's plans for the company.
Kuehne had bought his stake for less than 30 euros a piece from U.S. investor Wilbur Ross, who had acquired the company from TUI (DE:TUIGn) in 2005 and floated it in 2007.
VTG's third-largest investor, the Joachim-Herz foundation behind consumer goods firm  Beiersdorf  (DE:BEIG), said it has not yet decided whether to tender its shares.
Ahead of the deal, VTG will need to close the 780 million euro acquisition of French peer Nacco, which will be financed in part by a planned 300 million euro capital increase.
Separately, a solution needs to be found for VTG's small Russia business as Morgan Stanley wants to avoid any of its companies doing business with Russian counterparts targeted by U.S. sanctions.
VTG last year posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 343 million euros on sales of 1 billion euros. It has 80,000 rail freight cars which it leases to companies active in the chemicals, oil and agriculture sectors.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Laudamotion rejects Lufthansa allegations of late payments,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian leisure airline Laudamotion said on Monday it had always paid its bills for planes leased from Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) in full and on time, rejecting allegations made by the German rival.
The German flagship carrier said on Friday that Laudamotion repeatedly failed to meet its contractually-agreed lease payment obligations and that it plans to end the leasing agreement for 9 Airbus (PA:AIR) A320s, nearly half of Laudamotion's fleet. 
""These accusations are unfounded,"" Laudamotion managing director Andreas Gruber told journalists in Vienna. ""We have paid all our bills on time."" 
Laudamotion was formed by former formula one motor racing champion Niki Lauda out of the remains of the Niki carrier that was part of Air Berlin. 
It flies a fleet of 9 Airbus (PA:AIR) A320s leased from Lufthansa and 10 Boeing (N:BA) 737 jets from shareholder Ryanair (I:RYA). 
A first hearing at a court in Britain regarding the lease agreement is scheduled for Friday. 
Asked about a plan B in case the court decides in favor of Lufthansa, Gruber said: ""There is no need for a plan B.""
Laudamotion is examining whether to claim damages from Lufthansa for delayed payment of around 1.5 million euros ($1.8 million) for flights which Laudamotion operated for Lufthansa in March, April and May, Gruber said.
""We are examining all legal options,"" he said. 
Gruber also said he expects Ryanair to take control of Laudamotion in the coming weeks, strengthening its position in the power struggle with Lufthansa.
The Irish budget carrier agreed in March with Lauda to buy a 75 percent stake in Laudamotion. 
The European Commission approved the increase from its current 24.9 percent stake last week.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 07:13AM ET</span>","FANG surge leads stock market recovery, putting Netflix in spotlight","By Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The FANGs have gotten their bite back, and they are helping Wall Street erase the wrenching correction that beset it in February.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have led the technology and consumer discretionary sectors back to record high levels in recent days. Whether they can haul the wider market over that threshold likely hinges on the rush of quarterly scorecards due soon from the four of them, starting with Netflix late on Monday.
A star performer in the quartet of the so-called FANG stocks that have fueled the market's gains in recent years, Netflix has surged 106.2 percent year-to-date, leading the S&P 500 and making it one of Wall Street's most closely-watched stocks.
Outsized gains this month from a range of tech stocks, the FANGs included, have brought the S&P 500 to within striking distance of its Jan. 26 record high close.

Also fueling gains, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s stock market value on Thursday exceeded $800 billion for the first time, below only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon and Alphabet on the U.S. stock market.
On a conference call Thursday,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said he sees technology and FANG companies becoming even more central to Wall Street's rally as they outcompete traditional consumer corporations.
""Tech is going to inherit the earth,"" Golub said. ""They're actually delivering much more than everyone else.""
Netflix has posted an average gain of about 7 percent the day after each of its previous four quarterly reports.
Wall Street's recovery has been uneven. Six of the S&P's 11 sectors remain in negative territory for the year, while the S&P 500 is up 4.8 percent, just 2.5 percent short of its January high.
The S&P 500 tech index, which led last year with a 37-percent rise, is up more than 15 percent so far this year. The consumer discretionary index, which includes Amazon and Netflix, is up about 14 percent, and sits at No. 2.

Even as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates a trade war with China that could hurt U.S. consumers and companies, investors have remained largely optimistic about stocks, pointing to corporate tax cuts that are boosting profits and share buybacks.
S&P 500 companies are expected to post 20.9 percent earnings per share growth for the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Technology earnings are seen rising 25.5 percent, while consumer discretionary profits are seen up 16.1 percent, helped by Amazon.com and Netflix.
Stock valuations are more reasonable now than back in January, with the S&P 500 price-to-earnings multiple at 16, roughly its five-year average. It was above 18 in January when stocks began tumbling.
The FANGs are far pricier than the wider market, however, with Netflix at 111 times expected earnings, Amazon at 106, Alphabet at 25 and Facebook at 24, which places even greater focus on their earnings and forecasts in the weeks ahead.
""These companies would be revalued if, for whatever reason, their earnings or revenue growth really began to wane. But right now, it's not the case,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""They have the kind of top-line growth that is the envy of the rest of the companies in the S&P 500.""
Fueled by massive spending on shows like ""Altered Carbon"" and ""O Mecanismo"", Netflix has said it expects to have added 6.2 million new subscribers in the June quarter.
Los Gatos, California-based Netflix is expected, on average, to report a 41 percent jump in revenue to $3.94 billion and earnings of 79 cents per share, up from 15 cents per share a year before, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""NFLX may well be the best global, secular growth story in tech, and we believe investors would likely take advantage of any earnings-related weakness,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a recent client note.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>","Russia's Megafon to delist from London, offers buyout","By Anastasia Teterevleva and Polina Devitt
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Megafon (MM:MFON), Russia's No.2 mobile phone operator, said on Monday it plans to delist from London shortly after completion of a $1.3 billion buyout of minority shareholders.
Megafon, controlled by the USM Group of Russian tycoon Alisher Usmanov, is the latest Russian company to delist from London, following similar moves by Cherkizovo (MM:GCHE), Russia's biggest meat producer, gold producer Nord Gold and real estate developer PIK (MM:PIKK).
In 2012, Megafon raised $1.7 billion in a share offering in London and Moscow, joining rivals MTS and Vimpelcom which went public earlier.
Russian companies started to leave London in 2014 when Western sanctions were first imposed on Russia, citing high costs of maintaining the listing and limited investor appetite for Russian stocks.
Megafon said on Monday that it decided to allow minority shareholders to sell out, as it targets broader partnerships with state-owned firms, transactions with higher risks, investments in infrastructure with lower returns and higher leverage.
The new strategy will also require more cash which may affect Megafon's dividend payments.
""The ambitious scale and nature of the further steps we may need to take to achieve this, could create significant additional risk for our minority equity holders,"" Gevork Vermishyan, Megafon's executive director, said in a statement.
""It could negate the delivery of our current OIBDA and revenue growth and leverage cap objectives over the medium term.""
In May, Megafon said it would set up a joint venture with Gazprombank and state defense conglomerate Rostec to develop digital projects. Megafon will cut its stake in internet company Mail.Ru Group (L:MAILRq) as part of that process.
OFFERING
As part of the tender offer, a Megafon unit will buy up to 128,950,036 of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares and global depositary receipts (GDRs), or 20.8 percent of the firm's issued and outstanding shares, for $9.75 for each ordinary share and for each GDR.
The buyback, worth $1.26 billion and set to take place on July 16 to Aug 22, may be financed by the Russian lender Gazprombank , which already owns an 18.8 percent stake in the telecoms company, Vermishyan told reporters on Monday.
Megafon shares were up 15.8 percent to 583.7 rubles per share in Moscow by 0928 GMT and were trading 6.9 percent higher in London at $9.625 a piece.
""We deem the news positive as the purchasing price implies an 8 percent premium to Friday's close,"" Aton brokerage said in a note.
Vermishyan said that the company will decide on the specific financing tools closer to the settlement date.
""Due to the complexity and potential costs of delisting the ordinary shares from the Moscow Exchange, the Board of Directors has not decided on such a delisting at this time,"" Megafon said in a statement separately.
""Megafon will re-visit the question of delisting of the ordinary shares from the Moscow Exchange following completion of the tender offer.""

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 06:11AM ET</span>","Beware the reach of Her Majesty's taxman, Brexit bankers told","By Sinead Cruise and Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - Financial workers weighing up offers to move to Europe after Brexit may find out that relocating is financially more complicated than they bargained for thanks to the long arm of Her Majesty's Revenues and Customs (HMRC).
Accountants and wealth planners say they are encountering widespread confusion about UK tax obligations among Britons thinking of moving abroad - many for the first time and not necessarily as their first choice - as employers put plans in motion to move jobs after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
It's not just Britons who are affected. EU nationals who have built decades-long careers in Britain's thriving financial services industry, accumulating properties and stocks in the UK, have similar concerns.
""Those who move abroad for work along with those who move by choice need to remember that just because they've crossed the border, it's not a clean break from the UK tax system,"" said Rachael Griffin, tax and financial planning expert at Quilter.
Global banks such as Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Citigroup  (N:C), UBS  and JPMorgan (N:JPM) have said they will likely relocate hundreds of jobs to rival financial centers in the EU after March 2019. 
A Reuters survey of 199 firms conducted in March indicated up to 5,000 finance jobs could be shifted, depending on the final terms agreed by Brexit negotiators.
Old Mutual International, part of Quilter, and Atomik Research surveyed 147 British expatriates across the world to gain insight into the most common misunderstandings about UK tax law.
Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said they wrongly assumed they would no longer be UK-domiciled after moving, which would free them from taxes levied by the HMRC such as UK inheritance tax, which at 40 percent is the fourth highest in the world, according to policy adviser, the Tax Foundation.
Shedding domiciled status, which has roots back to 1799, is very difficult to achieve, however, requiring individuals to sever all links and pledge never to return to live in Britain, among other strict criteria.
People who were born in the United Kingdom are generally deemed domiciled and as of April 2017, so are people resident in the UK for at least 15 of the last 20 tax years.
""We have seen occasions where an individual believes leaving the UK will break the domicile position and thereby negate UK inheritance tax,"" said Mitch Young, head of UK Tax at DeVere Tax Consultancy. ""Having informed them of the new rules they have had to reconsider."" 
For those who are domiciled, the tax code can also catch out those who seek to claim non-residency while on secondment to an overseas office, for example.
Non-residents have to pay tax on any UK income, such as rental income from a British property; residency could trigger HMRC taxes on worldwide earnings and capital gains.
NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY
A managing director at a U.S. investment bank who moved to Milan from London earlier in 2018 said many of his peers believe they can keep their families in London and return on the weekend. 
Overstaying the permitted tax year allowance of 90 days or working from the UK on more than 30 of those days could trigger residency and a hefty bill, however, he said.
After weighing up the personal stress as well as the financial risks, he said he decided to sell his home and ""cut all ties with Britain"". But it has not been easy.
""At the end of the day this is not about money. It's about life and not just about your own life. Your family has to come with you and a new balance has to be found,"" he said, asking not to be named talking about his personal finances.
Travel between the UK and the new country of residence has to be carefully managed and logged in case the HMRC requests evidence to support the individual's new non-resident status.
""Whilst we cannot recall a specific example of where a client actually changed their mind about leaving the UK entirely, we have seen clients become very frustrated by day count limits minimizing their time in the UK,"" said Christine Tuckerman, partner at wealth planner Bishop Fleming.
Workers also need to review insurance policies, wills and other documents transferring power of attorney (POA) which could be rendered worthless after leaving the UK, said Nimesh Shah, a partner at accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg. 
""Certain life insurance policies may not be effective in the other country, and the terms may not be altered easily, so portability can be an issue,"" Shah said. 
Half of the respondents to the Old Mutual/Atomik survey admitted they had no idea whether their wills would be legally recognized outside Britain.
""People may require a UK will and POA for their UK assets and a separate one covering their assets in the country they live. The wills also need to acknowledge each other so as not to supersede each other,"" Griffin said. 
Individuals may also have failed to consider the tax implications for the money they bring back into the UK for expenses or when they return home for good, the advisers said.
Clients may make financial decisions that were favorable in the country of residence but not in the United Kingdom, in which case they may face ""a large and unexpected tax bill in the year of return"", DeVere's Young said.

Following a year-long strategic review, GE said last month it would spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services firm  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE), effectively breaking up the 126-year-old conglomerate.
""The changes in GE unlock if anything more capability out of GE Aviation. I don’t feel any constraints relative to what has happened in the past year - in fact I feel the very opposite,"" David Joyce, CEO of GE Aviation and vice chairman of GE, told a news briefing at the Farnborough Airshow.
""We don't feel we are under a lot more pressure than we were before."" 
Asked about Boeing's plans for a new twin-aisle mid-market aircraft, Joyce said he expected a formal decision from Boeing (NYSE:BA) in response to engine offers in 2019.
Joyce said, in reply to a question, that he had not yet managed to reconcile the various views on market forecasts for the middle of the jetliner market.
The business case for potential engine manufacturers would depend on how many variants Boeing plans to offer, he said.
GE has the largest stake of any engine maker in the industry's status quo, since it supplies engines for best-selling single-aisle aircraft to both Boeing and Airbus through its CFM joint venture with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).
Industry experts say that means GE has the lowest strategic interest among engine makers in supporting the mid-market project, though most expect it to take part in the program if it goes ahead - especially if Boeing only chooses one supplier.
Joyce reiterated he was open-minded about whether the program should have one engine supplier or two, but that GE would not take part if there were three suppliers on board.
GE competes with Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and Pratt & Whitney, which some in the industry speculate could co-operate on the project.
The mid-market plane would sit between single-aisle and wide-body jets and compete partly with the Airbus A321neo, the European planemaker’s largest single-aisle jet.

Asked whether the mid-market plane could damage the business case for the LEAP engine, which CFM offers on the A321neo and other Airbus single-aisle models, Joyce it would not, based on the latest proposals for the aircraft, but did not elaborate.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Britain backs Scottish spaceport plan with $40 million in grants,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Britain wants to build its first spaceport for launching satellites in Scotland, with the government kick-starting the project by handing almost 30 million pounds ($40 million) in grants to companies including  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT).
UK Business Minister Greg Clark said the new site at Sutherland on the northerly-most tip of mainland Scotland would provide facilities for vertically-launched space rockets and satellites to take off into orbit.
Under the plans announced on Monday, U.S. group Lockheed and its partners will receive 23.5 million pounds in grants from the UK Space Agency which will go toward establishing launch operations at Sutherland and developing a new system for deploying small satellites in Reading, southern England. 
London-based Orbex has received 5.5 million pounds to build a new rocket launch from the site at Sutherland, which will help develop its orbital launch vehicle to deliver the small satellites into orbit.
The government said the investments were the first steps to developing a national space program. 
""We want Britain to be the first place in mainland Europe to launch satellites as part of our Industrial Strategy,"" Clark said in a statement. 
Britain is keen to boost its space sector at a time when it faces a challenge because of the country's departure from the European Union next year. This has meant some UK-based companies have been excluded from future work on the EU's 10 billion euro Galileo satellite program.
Britain's space industry is considered a success story: it is growing four times faster than the rest of the UK economy and the country has a 7 percent share of the global space industry.
Funding was also provided to other sites in Scotland, Wales and Cornwall, the western tip of England, which are examining their potential for horizontal spaceports. Horizontal spaceports will be required further in the future to underpin a UK space flight market. 
Small satellites used for observing conditions on the ground are the fastest growing segment of the $260.5 billion global satellite industry, according to the Satellite Industries Association.
The government said satellites could be launched from Sutherland as soon as the early 2020s and hundreds of jobs could be created.

Brian Chappel, sector vice president and general manager of autonomous systems at Northrop, said the German government was working closely with the U.S. Navy to move forward after the State Department in April authorized the sale of up to four drones worth up to $2.5 billion. 
Northrop and Airbus Defence and Space, a unit of Airbus SE (PA:AIR), have teamed up on the program, to be called Pegagus in Germany, which will help Germany beef up its surveillance capabilities. The aircraft are launched from land and can be programmed to fly autonomously as high as 60,000 feet to gather a wide array of intelligence data.
The German government plans to buy three of the drones, equipped with sensors and a mission system built by Airbus, with deliveries to start in 2025, according to government documents.
The decision came after the messy 2013 cancellation of plans to buy a version of Northrop's Global Hawk drone, after it became it clear it could cost up to 600 million euros to get the new system approved for use in civil airspace.
Chappel said he was upbeat given that the entire process - including preparations for certifying the drones' use in civil airspace - was moving forward more smoothly this time. 
""The German government understands what they want,"" Chappel told Reuters ahead of the Farnborough air show. ""We're going to be very careful and make sure we start a program that's going to be successful because nobody wants to have a problem again.""
He said the groundwork had been laid on both sides, and all the parties involved were closely aligned to get the deal done.
""All the homework has been done ... getting it through the contracting pipe is what we're working on,"" he said.
German government sources have said it will be less costly to get aviation approval for Triton since the process is being baked in from the start of the program.
Northrop developed the Triton, a marine-based variant of its Global Hawk, for the U.S. Navy under a contract awarded in 2008.

Australia last month said it would buy six of the Triton remotely piloted aircraft to beef up its maritime patrols, with the initial investment of A$1.4 billion ($1 billion).

Logistics group DHL placed the order for the 777 freighters and acquired purchase rights for seven more freighters, the U.S planemaker said.
Boeing and Airbus are expected to make several announcements on the first day of the July 16-22 event, as they seek to bolster their already bulging order books.
The latest order follows Boeing's deal with FedEx Corp (N:FDX) unit FedEx Express (N:FDX) in June for 24 medium and large freighters.
While global trade tensions are escalating, the industry is counting on e-commerce continuing to soar, with more people buying products online for quick delivery.
Air freight demand is expected to increase 4 percent this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
Last year was the best for cargo since 2010, with traffic growth more than doubling to 9 percent, three times the growth in capacity.
Boeing's latest order will double the size of DHL's global 777 fleet, the companies said. The delivery of the first four planes is expected to be completed in 2019, DHL said in a separate statement.
The Farnborough Airshow is the industry's biggest event this year. It alternates with the Paris Airshow and, collectively, they account for over a quarter of industry order intake each year.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 05:01AM ET</span>",Britain to unveil model of planned new fighter jet: source,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Britain's Defence Minister Gavin Williamson will unveil a model of the country's proposed new fighter jet at the Farnborough Airshow and earmark 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) in funding for the project, a source close to the matter said on Monday.
The aircraft, which will eventually replace the Typhoon fighter jet, will be developed and built by partners BAE Systems (L:BAES), Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and Leonardo (MI:LDOF), the source said.
Britain is in talks with other countries to find more companies to help develop the jet, the source added, with Sweden seen as the most likely partner, although countries such as South Korea, Japan and Turkey, or Gulf arms-buying countries like Saudi Arabia, are also possibilities. 
Under the plans, the new jet will be operational by 2035, ready to replace the Typhoon fleet, which is due to be retired in 2040. 
The UK-led project comes as Britain is due to leave the European Union in less than nine months. 
It will face competition from a rival European project after France announced in June that it would take a leading role on a new fighter program, saying it would start as a bilateral effort with Germany that could be expanded later.
The Typhoon, in contrast, was developed by the four-nation group of Germany, Spain, Britain and Italy in the 1980s. 
Britain has not developed a fighter jet alone since the 1960s. However, it has helped to develop and build the most advanced stealth fighter in the UK fleet, which is the U.S.-made F-35, with BAE Systems carrying out about 15 percent of the work on each jet.
Airbus (PA:AIR) and its long-time rival, France's Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), have agreed to work on the Franco-German project together.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors on Monday cheered the lifting of a U.S. supplier ban on China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763), pushing its shares up 17 percent, though analysts cautioned the telecommunications equipment maker still faced many challenges as it works to revive its business.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Friday lifted a crippling ban on American firms selling parts to ZTE - imposed in relation to a U.S. sanctions case - after the Chinese company deposited $400 million in escrow as part of a settlement reached last month. The settlement also included a $1 billion penalty paid to the U.S. Treasury in June.
""It's a long way back for ZTE. Not just to win back customer confidence and assure them, but also work hard to find substitutes to U.S. suppliers such as Avnet, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) etc (to reduce reliance),"" said Nikhil Batra, senior research manager at consultancy IDC.
""Essentially, this would mean going back to the drawing board and rethinking its overall design strategy.""
ZTE's Hong Kong-listed stock opened up 5.5 percent on Monday, rising over 17 percent to HK$16.12 by noon. That was still 37 percent lower than its last price in April when trading of the stock was suspended for two months following the ban.
ZTE's Shenzhen shares jumped by their 10 percent daily limit early on Monday, as investors brushed off ZTE's forecast on Friday a net loss of up to 9 billion yuan ($1.35 billion) for the first half of 2018 due to the fine.
Jefferies analyst Edison Lee estimated ZTE had an operating loss of up to 4 billion yuan for April-June due to suspending business when the ban was imposed.
Lee said he expected ZTE to go to each of its non-Chinese telecommunications customers ""and offer incentives of varying degrees to compensate for their hardship and reward their patience and loyalty"".
People familiar with the matter told Reuters that ZTE started reaching out to clients over the weekend with a letter promising to ramp up operations as quickly as possible.
Many U.S. lawmakers see ZTE as a national security threat and, on Thursday, a group of Republican and Democratic U.S. senators urged ZTE's penalties be reinstated.
The U.S. Senate paved the way for a showdown with U.S. President Donald Trump over the issue last month, when it passed an annual defense policy bill with an amendment that could reverse ZTE's settlement.
The fate of the amendment remains unclear as the Senate and House have yet to reconcile their different versions. There is bipartisan support for the measure among members of Congress, but Republicans control both the Senate and House and party leaders rarely break from Trump's policies.
""The political nature of the issue and the fact that members of the U.S. Senate are not on board this decision makes it very tricky. Anything could happen,"" said Batra.
Others agreed the prospect of ZTE continuing as before was unlikely. 
""In terms of carrier business, we think ZTE is still a competitive telecom equipment supplier, especially in the 5G era, and its return to business may help China's 5G development to be back on track,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""However, we think it remains uncertain as to what extent ZTE can win back the existing customers and explore new businesses.""
The ban had been a source of friction between the U.S. and Chinese governments at a time of escalating trade tension. The ban was imposed in April after Commerce Department officials said ZTE made false statements about disciplining 35 employees after it pleaded guilty last year to violating U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran.
Uncertainty over the ban battered ZTE shares, wiping nearly $11 billion from the company's market valuation.
As part of the deal to lift the ban, ZTE agreed to remove all members of its leadership at or above senior vice president level, along with any executives associated with the wrongdoing within 30 days.

“U.S. trade actions have been brutal and unilateral and have punctured the trust built up over decades of good-faith agreements,” the bank said in a commodities outlook. “Our base case is for negotiations to continue and for trade deals to be done ahead of the November U.S. midterm elections.”
Among Citigroup’s forecasts should the U.S. and China pull back from the brink, soybeans may rally to $9.75 to $10 a bushel in the final quarter, it said, up from this week’s $8.35. And copper, which last traded at $6,215 a ton, could hit $6,800 in the base case, or even $8,000 under a more optimistic scenario.
Commodity prices, especially metals and farm goods, have been pummeled after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods, spurring a tit-for-tat response. The U.S. administration is also embroiled in standoffs with the European Union, Mexico and Canada. A resolution of some or all of these conflicts may provide a political boost for Trump and the Republican Party heading into the November contests, when seats in the House of Representatives and Senate are up for grabs.
“The next one-to-two months may indicate whether a full-blown trade war happens or occasional overtures would indeed lead to a resolution,” analysts including Ed Morse said in the report. They added: “The next half-year should see continued robust global growth, spurring higher commodity demand.”
In addition to the tariffs already imposed on Chinese products, Trump’s administration has threatened a follow-up wave on a further $200 billion in goods. Last month, China and the E.U. vowed to oppose protectionism, saying unilateral actions risked pushing the world into a recession.
With the midterms pending, “it is logical to assume a lessening of trade intransigence, at least temporarily by end of the third quarter,” Citi said. “Tit-for-tat responses by trade partners are targeting exports from Republican-held states and Republican Congressional and Senatorial districts, also pointing to a partial pullback by the president in coming months.”
In the November contests, Republicans are trying to buck a historical trend in which the party that holds the White House almost always loses congressional seats. The Democratic Party is counting on a voting base energized by anger at President Trump to win the seats it would need to gain a majority in the House.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 01:32AM ET</span>",Rebates protect Canada's auto industry from retaliatory tariffs,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian government customs provisions are expected to soften the blow on the country's powerful automotive industry from retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel, according to trade lawyers and industry leaders bracing for higher costs.
Decades-old programs reduce or refund import duties on supplies like steel when companies in Canada can show the material is used in export products. They could protect the auto industry's supply contracts covering raw materials and parts, which often cross borders several times before a vehicle is finished.
While imposing tariffs against a long list of U.S. products this month, Canada clarified that ""duties relief"" and ""duty drawback"" programs would be available to Canadian exporters.
""That provision in the notice is overwhelmingly directed at the auto industry,"" said Jesse Goldman, a trade lawyer at Borden Ladner Gervais. Without drawbacks, Goldman said, the Canadian retaliation would have ""very significantly and very quickly"" hurt the industry.
Some 85 percent of vehicles built in Canada in 2016 were exported, meaning duty relief programs could refund roughly 85 percent of retaliatory tariffs paid by automakers.
Canada has vowed to defend the steel and aluminum industries, but vehicle manufacturing employs some 136,000, according to Statistics Canada, whereas only about 22,000 work in the steel sector, giving the government an incentive to shelter vehicle and parts makers from rising costs.
""These existing programs continue to be in place and any changes would be done in consultation with the relevant stakeholders,"" federal Finance Department spokesman Jack Aubry said when asked whether the programs would continue.
BIG OPERATORS
Automakers with operations in Canada include General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267) which assemble vehicles, as well as parts makers Magna International (TO:MG) and  Linamar Corp  (TO:LNR).
Linamar Chief Executive Linda Hasenfratz said in an emailed statement the drawback programs are of particular benefit to her company, Canada's second largest auto parts maker, since substantially all the steel that the company imports is later exported.
Honda said it was still assessing the impact of the tariffs. GM, Fiat Chrysler and Magna declined to comment. Ford and Toyota did not respond to requests for comment.
The Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association needs to do more analysis before commenting on whether drawbacks could protect his industry, President Mark Nantais said. ""There are various options that could be used - that would be one of them,"" he added.
But any relief would be temporary if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on Canadian-made vehicles after the administration's Section 232 national security probe into autos wraps up. The rebate programs limit the impact of tariffs on raw materials, not finished products.
Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, said some companies that make stainless steel parts or hardened steel tools in Canada could benefit.
Volpe said just over half of Canadian-made auto parts are exported.
John Boscariol, who leads McCarthy Tetrault's international trade and investment law group, said access to the duty relief programs had not been a foregone conclusion before the government's notice, because Canada's retaliation is technically a ""surtax,"" not a normal duty.
Some uncertainty remains as companies must apply individually for the refunds, and carefully document how imports are used, he added.

""It introduces costs and complications, and it introduces a likelihood that you might not get that relief,"" Boscariol said. ""That's not without cost.""

1396,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2018 12:08AM ET</span>","Asian shares fall on soft China data, trade war fears","By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Monday as new data showed China's economy slowed slightly in the second quarter, compounded by fears of a full-scale Sino-U.S. trade war looming over markets.
Official data showed China's economy grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter of 2018, cooling from the 6.8 percent growth registered in each of the previous three quarters. 
While the GDP figures were in line with market expectations, the new data also showed slower-than-expected growth in China's industrial output, pointing to slowing momentum and prompting some analysts to call for stronger government measures to support growth.
Taken together, the data show an economy continuing to slow under the influence of a multi-year crackdown on excessive financial risk, even as trade war headwinds gather.
But Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura, said China's underlying economic data ""appears to be quite robust"".
""I would be incredulous if China's GDP growth could continue at the level it's been historically. So I think there's always been an anticipation of some gradual slowdown, but the slowdown of the growth rate is probably less than the market really wants to believe,"" he said.
He said concerns over the trade war were dragging down markets, with investors spooked by the ratcheting up of trade war tensions.
""That's why I think markets are nervous, because there's no precedent for this type of behavior,"" he said.
After briefly moving higher on early gains in China's share markets, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.3 percent.
The Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) and the blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) fell 0.5 percent. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) was down less than 0.1 percent, but the China Enterprises Index (HSCE) took a bigger hit, falling 0.6 percent.
Australian shares (AXJO) were down 0.3 percent, and Seoul's Kospi (KS11) lost 0.1 percent. Shares in Taiwan were mostly flat.
Japan's markets are closed for a holiday. 
The soft China data undermined a boost to sentiment from Friday's gains on Wall Street, which were underpinned by strong profits from industrial and energy firms and helped offset investor concerns over the U.S.-China trade war.
U.S. stock futures touched a fresh five-month high on Monday. S&P500 e-mini futures (ESc1), the world's most liquid equity index futures, rose 0.2 percent in early Asian trade to hit their highest level since Feb. 2.
Around 0335 GMT, S&P500 e-mini futures were up 0.1 percent at 2806.25. 
The dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen to 112.48 .
The euro (EUR=) was flat on the day at $1.1681, and the dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was also flat at 94.740.
Major currencies have been in a holding pattern in recent days thanks in part to a lull in China-U.S. trade skirmishing. Investors had also been awaiting the China data, and are still looking to June U.S. retail sales figures, to gauge the state of global growth.
The U.S. Federal Reserve reiterated on Friday in its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to the U.S. Congress that it expected ""further gradual increases"" in interest rates due to ""solid"" economic growth. 
ANZ analysts said in a note Monday that the Fed's report ""yielded few surprises,"" but noted that trade tensions continue to weigh on commodity markets and U.S. consumer confidence.
U.S. crude (CLc1) dipped 0.5 percent at $70.69 a barrel, weighed by easing concerns about supply disruptions that had pushed prices higher. Brent crude (LCOc1) was 0.5 percent lower at $74.895 per barrel. 

A rising dollar drove gold prices to seven-month lows on Friday, but spot gold  was up 0.2 percent on Monday, trading at $1243.46 per ounce. [GOL/]

1397,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",China Economy Remains Robust as Country Readies for Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic expansion held up, offering policy makers a buffer as the trade conflict with the U.S. intensifies.
Gross domestic product increased 6.7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the same as forecast in a Bloomberg survey and down slightly from the 6.8 percent pace in the previous quarter.
A robust economy heading into the second half of the year provides support on two policy fronts: Withstanding the potential negative effects of higher barriers to trade with the U.S., and continuing with a multi-year campaign to control debt and clean-up the financial system. After an acceleration in 2017, the world’s second-largest economy is forecast to slow this year, with the government targeting expansion of 6.5 percent.
More growth headwinds will come in the second half, according to UBS Group AG economists, as property activity is likely to decelerate, infrastructure investment stays weak and export growth moderates on rising trade frictions. “On the other hand, a manufacturing investment revival and resilient consumption should offer some cushion,” Wang Tao and Zhang Ning wrote in a recent note.

The bourses will also bar trading in foreign companies and stapled securities via the Hong Kong stock link, according to a statement by the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Saturday, which said many investors don’t understand the risks associated with new products. Xiaomi tumbled 7 percent in pre-market trading.
The move comes before the three classes of shares are included in the city’s Hang Seng Composite Index in the third quarter, which would otherwise have made them eligible for the stock connect.
Hong Kong opened the door for companies with weighted-voting rights in April, with rules designed to lure Chinese tech firms. The new regulations allowed the type of structure favored by founder-led tech companies, which enable leaders to keep control even after going public. Dual-class shares, as they’re commonly known, were previously banned in the city, and aren’t permitted in China’s stock market.
""Companies like Xiaomi are well known in China and might attract big flows from the mainland -- regulators certainly don’t want such big outflows to cross the border while the A-share market remains weak,"" said Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International Investment Corp. ""Such potentially big outflows would pressure its currency and hurt liquidity conditions.""
Xiaomi declined to comment. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. said it’s very selective about approving listings of weighted-voting rights companies and that sufficient safeguards to protect investors are already in place, according to a statement released after the ruling. The shares should be allowed to trade on the stock connect link ""as soon as possible.""
Xiaomi pulled a planned offering of Chinese depository shares last month, prompting questions over the country’s plan to encourage its tech companies to list at home. The smartphone-maker raised $4.7 billion in its Hong Kong IPO last week, selling stock at the bottom of its marketed range.

May's words, to be delivered at the Farnborough Airshow south west of London, come at a crunch time for the prime minister as pro-Brexit lawmakers in her party threaten revolt over an EU exit strategy they say leaves Britain subject to Brussels' rule. [nL8N1UB03P]
""We will take back control of our borders, our laws and our money. But we will do so in a way that is good for business and good for our future prosperity,"" May will say, according to advance extracts of her speech.
Businesses have been getting increasingly frustrated about the lack of clarity over future trading relations less than nine months before Brexit day on March 29, 2019. 
Airbus (PA:AIR), Europe's biggest planemaker which employs around 15,000 people in Britain, warned earlier this month that if Britain left the EU without a deal - a so-called ""hard"" Brexit - it could result in production at its factories stopping and aircraft being grounded. [nL8N1U21E7] 
At Farnborough, aerospace firms will be setting out wares from luxury jets to lethal drones, hoping trade tensions will not deter airlines from buying planes even as geopolitical uncertainty allows them to sell more weapons. [nL8N1UB09E]
Brexit is also likely to loom large in their conversations.
The prime minister will set out in detail how her Brexit proposal - which was agreed by cabinet earlier this month but then sparked a wave of ministerial resignations - will protect the supply chains of firms like Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and Rolls Royce (L:RR) as well as Airbus.
No specifics were provided in advance, but the government has proposed a customs arrangement that will see it closely aligned with the EU on regulations and standards under a so-called ""common rule book"". 
May will also announce 343 million pounds ($454 million) of investment for research and development projects, investment in electric aircraft technology, and reconfirm Britain is looking at how it can remain part of EU bodies such as the European Aviation Safety Agency.
""By working closely together, government and industry have ensured we remain at the forefront of civil aviation and that our air power is second to none,"" May will say.  
“Today I want us to build on that, and ensure not only that we retain our prominence, but that in an increasingly competitive industry we make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead.""
The aerospace sector directly employs around 120,000 people in the United Kingdom, and supports a further 118,000 jobs indirectly, according to trade body ADS Group. It generated almost 28 billion pounds of exports in 2016.

Handelsblatt reported on Sunday that the Alfried Krupp foundation, which owns 21 percent of Thyssen, and Kone's largest shareholder Antti Herlin have held talks about a deal. The first conversations took place as early as two years ago, but the proposal was rebuffed by Thyssen's then-chief executive Heinrich Hiesinger, the paper said. 
The foundation said it had told Kone that questions regarding the elevator unit should be referred to Thyssenkrupp. It said it had informed Thyssen's executive board about the talks, and that it was up to the company to make decisions or respond to queries.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment, while Kone and Antti Herlin were not immediately available for comment.
Earlier this month, the Alfried Krupp foundation, which has two seats on Thyssen's supervisory board, said that a break-up of the industrial conglomerate would not happen, following similar remarks from the company's chairman.
Chairman Ulrich Lehner had said that there were no plans to divest the group's elevator unit, its most profitable business, which some investors and analysts have said would rid Thyssenkrupp's share price of a large conglomerate discount.
By contrast, activist investor Cevian, Thyssen's second-largest shareholder with a 18-percent stake, has been vocal in calling for a strategic review of all of Thyssenkrupp's business areas, saying each might thrive better in a different set-up.
Speculation about Thyssenkrupp's future intensified following the recent resignation of Hiesinger, who cited a lack of shareholder support, and who has been replaced for the interim by Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff.
Hiesinger's resignation came only days after he clinched an historic steel joint venture deal with  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) and followed months of shareholder pressure over the company's strategy.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>","Boeing concerned about tariff talk, but no business impact yet","By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
LONDON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is concerned about the impact of possible trade tariffs on the cost of running its supply chain, but has not yet seen any impact from U.S.-Chinese trade tensions on its business, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Sunday.
""The discussion right now is proposed tariffs, ongoing discussions. So in terms of actual implementation and things that are impacting us, we haven't seen a material impact yet,"" Muilenburg told reporters.
""We are very much engaged in the discussion. We are concerned that it could affect supply chain costs. But note that supply chains are flowing in both directions between (these) countries as we both support existing fleets as well as build new airplanes."" 
Washington recently imposed 25-percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing responded with tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China..
The U.S. administration then raised the stakes, threatening 10-percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting China to warn it would hit back.
""Rhetoric about potential penalty actions are a concern to us,"" Muilenburg said.
Speaking ahead of the Farnborough Airshow, Muilenburg, who has struck up good relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, said both the United States and China understood the importance of aerospace to their economies.
China needs planes to boost its transport capacity and the United States relies on the sector for thousands of valuable export jobs, he said.
""Aerospace thrives on global trade, free and open trade,"" Muilenburg said, adding the sector drove economic benefit globally.
Besides industry concerns about trade tariffs, and in some cases disruption from Britain's exit from the European Union, planemakers are also on the alert for any disruption stemming from tightness in global supply chains due to record output.
""It's on all of our radars everyday,"" Muilenburg said.
MID-MARKET JET
On Boeing's plans for a potential new passenger plane, Muilenburg said the U.S. company would not take a decision on whether to launch the potential middle-of-the-market design until 2019.
He stressed it would not let the entry to service slip beyond a target of 2025, even though it is taking the time needed to hone the business case for the novel type of jet.
""We want a 2025 airplane,"" Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Kevin McAllister said, adding it would be more economic to run than other aircraft in its category.
Boeing is looking at developing a plane to try to stimulate new routes in a gap between its benchmark 737 single-aisle model and the smallest version of its wide-body 787 jetliner.
Analysts say the deadline is crucial because it represents the sweet spot for replacements of elderly 757 and 767 fleets.
Any sign of delay would allow European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) to argue that airlines would do better to pick an improved version of its hot-selling A321neo plane, covering many of the same missions.
Boeing executives said the market would be better served by a tailor-made aircraft with superior economics. Airbus says its A321neo already accounts for a large slice of that sector.
Flanked by many of Boeing's top executives as the company prepares to play up innovation at the July 16-22 air show, Muilenburg said he saw a future for supersonic and hypersonic technology but that it was too early to talk about the timing.
Boeing executives highlighted the value of its investments in Britain after a trade row between Boeing and Canada's Bombardier threatened jobs in Northern Ireland, where Prime Minister Theresa May depends on support for her majority.

Britain is said to be nearing a decision to award a new contract for early-warning planes to Boeing, prompting a backlash from Airbus and others wanting a formal competition.

Responding to a report in German weekly Wirtschaftswoche which said that the U.S. tax authorities would likely deny a such tax exempt status, a spokesman for the charitable foundation said that the Hainan Chihang Foundation was incorporated and would comply with all tax laws.
Wirtschaftswoche reported, citing unnamed sources, that the tax exempt status had been denied due to HNA's unclear ownership structure. The foundation spokesman said: ""These 'insiders' were speaking speaking out of turn.""
Tax exemption is usually sought by U.S. charities as it shields their funds - and their donors - from the taxman, leaving more resources for philanthropy.
Earlier this month, HNA Co-Chairman Wang Jian died during a business trip in France. His death complicates the troubled conglomerate's efforts to restructure and pay off borrowings, and could increase pressure on HNA to reveal more about its opaque ownership.
Wang is regarded as the architect of a $50 billion acquisition spree during which HNA accumulated assets ranging from a stake in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to high-profile overseas properties. Under pressure from Beijing, HNA has since sold off many of those assets to slash debt.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>","Embraer pushes E2 jet's low maintenance, fuel costs amid Airbus rivalry","FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3) is pushing the low maintenance costs and fuel burn of its E2 jet as it battles tougher competition from the rival A220, now backed by Airbus (PA:AIR), executives said on Sunday.
""I'm hopeful that we'll be able to present a good showing on Tuesday,"" John Slattery, President and CEO Embraer Commercial Aviation, told Reuters onboard its E190-E2 jet, looking ahead to possible order announcements at this week's Farnborough air show. 
Boeing (N:BA) earlier this month struck a deal for a controlling stake in the commercial aircraft arm of Embraer under a new $4.75 billion joint venture, coming after Airbus completed a deal to take control of rival Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) Cseries program.
Embraer was dealt a blow last week when JetBlue opted for the A220-300, formerly known as the Cseries, over the Embraer model. 
Speaking separately ahead of the air show, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer said the Airbus deal allowed the former Cseries to reach its full potential. 
""It's the best aircraft in that segment. It's a clean-sheet design, it's not a re-engine of an existing platform,"" he said, adding its benefit lay in low operating costs and fuel savings. 
The E190-E2, which Embraer is showing at Farnborough with a shark painted on its nose, is the first of three new-generation aircraft in Embraer's commercial jet line-up with new wings and new Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) engines aimed at improving fuel efficiency.
""The combination of knowledge gained from the first generation and the new technology is what makes us unique,"" Rodrigo Silva e Souza, vice president marketing, Embraer Commercial Aviation, said, highlighting fuel burn and longer maintenance intervals as the main savings for operators. 
The smallest version of the E2, the E175-E2 has been slowed due to a scope clause in U.S. pilots' contracts that bars it from the U.S. regional aviation market due to its weight.
Slattery said Embraer was still planning entry into service towards the end of 2021, adding he saw opportunities outside of North America, such as replacing turboprops being flown in south-east Asia and CIS countries. 
Bombardier's Cromer said he didn't expect the scope clause to be changed any time soon, adding that benefited its CRJ airplane. 

Meanwhile, U.S. carriers are still interested in the current version of the E175, Slattery said, adding that jet would continue to be produced as long as it's required.

Rolls-Royce said on Sunday it had drawn up plans for an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) vehicle, or flying taxi, which could carry four to five people at speeds of up to 250 miles per hour for approximately 500 miles.
The company, which makes engines for planes, helicopters and ships, joins a variety of companies racing to develop flying taxis, which could revolutionize the way people travel.
Long the stuff of science fiction and futuristic cartoons such as ""The Jetsons"", aviation and technology leaders are working to make electric-powered flying taxis a reality, including Airbus, U.S. ride- sharing firm Uber and a range of start-ups including one backed by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) co-founder Larry Page, called Kitty Hawk.
Rolls-Royce's design will be showcased in digital form at the Farnborough Airshow, which starts on Monday. The company is looking for an airframer and a partner to provide aspects of the electrical system to help commercialize the project.
Rolls-Royce said in a statement it was well-placed to play a leading role in the ""personal air mobility"" market.
""The initial concept vehicle uses gas turbine technology to generate electricity to power six electric propulsors specially designed to have a low noise profile,"" the company said, adding the design used its existing M250 gas turbine.
Rolls's design would not require re-charging because the battery is charged by the gas turbine, it said, adding it could use existing infrastructure such as heliports and airports.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","Planemakers plot course through trade, Brexit worries to air show deals","By Tim Hepher, Eric M. Johnson and Andrea Shalal
FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Aerospace firms are setting out wares from luxury jets to lethal drones at back-to-back British air shows this week, hoping trade tensions will not deter airlines from buying jetliners even as geopolitical uncertainty allows them to sell more weapons.
The quintessentially English atmosphere of the Royal International Air Tattoo, where straw-hatted VIPs watch fighters thunder over picturesque Cotswolds villages, gives way on Monday to the Farnborough Airshow, where the hard-nose business deals in the $800 billion aerospace and defense sector will be done.
Trade tensions between the United States and both China and Europe, disputes over the consequences of Britain's exit from the European Union and an increase in global protectionist rhetoric have barely dented a prolonged industry boom.
""The overall environment will reflect industry health, despite the dark clouds of Brexit and other global trade setbacks in the background,"" said analyst Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group.
""In short, we'll see more of what we've seen for years: aviation remaining a strangely protected and happy corner of a turbulent world.""
Boeing (N:BA) is expected to confirm demand for air transport is rising after Airbus (PA:AIR) lifted forecasts last week, citing strong economic growth in emerging markets and the need to replace older planes in Western markets.
The bullish outlook was underscored ahead of the show by forecasters Flightglobal Ascend. 
The two giants will add to record orders for benchmark narrowbody jets, whose waiting lists underpin their near-record share prices, while seeking a recovery in sales of bigger jets. 
After a lull, Boeing will be looking for a boost to its largest twinjet, the future 777X. Sources said recently it is in talks for an eye-catching deal with Saudi Arabia.Airbus will hope to end uncertainty over AirAsia's support for its A330neo jet after a showdown on prices. That could also involve a deal for smaller planes, though doubts have been expressed over financial commitments to Airbus.
Farnborough is the first such event since Airbus and Boeing shook up the industry by agreeing to absorb key commercial programs of smaller rivals Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer as they prepare for future competition from China.
The result should be a fierce contest for sales in the 100-150-seat sector even before Boeing closes its Embraer deal.
A new airline, Moxy, is expected to confirm a large order for the rebranded Airbus A220, the former Bombardier CSeries.

INDUSTRIAL POKER
The event is also expected to provide new evidence of strong demand for freight planes as e-commerce drives up shippers' profits despite global trade tensions.
Analyst predictions for total commercial orders and commitments vary from last year's 900 to about half that.
While high fuel prices make efficient new planes attractive, they hurt the bottom line of buyers, delaying some decisions.
""We are not blind: there are things that need to remain on watch,"" the head of major engine-maker CFM said on Saturday.
Farnborough will also be an opportunity for aerospace firms to plot next moves on civil and defense for decades to come.
The July 16-22 show is not only about order headlines but also about sending signals to investors, keeping competitors guessing and keeping potential buyers interested. 
Boeing will want to maintain interest in a potential new mid-market plane, while giving itself until next year to decide whether to launch the new 220-270-seat jet.
While it is further ahead in pre-development than at the same stage on earlier programs, it must convince airlines it can be ready in 2025, the deadline for many fleet overhauls. 
Airbus may talk up its possible new A321XLR, designed to address a shortfall in transatlantic performance of its longest-range single-aisle jet and targeted at U.S. majors.
The aircraft, with an improved take-off weight of 100 tonnes and 4,500 nautical miles range, has already had an unannounced commercial launch in a bid to head off Boeing's proposed new jet from 2021, industry sources said.
U.S. sources doubt it will do everything Airbus claims.
Both planemakers are likely to deepen a push into high-margin services, announcing maintenance and operational deals in competition with airlines and parts providers. It's part of a tug of war for profits between planemakers and their partners.
Suppliers will be trying to gauge how far the jetmakers are prepared to go in buying up parts of their supply chain. And many in Europe will be discussing how to prepare for a possible 'hard Brexit' or a disorderly UK exit form the European Union.
Sensitive UK choices over international partnerships are also expected to loom large in the defense side of the show.
The UK government will set out a combat air strategy with potential repercussions for defense suppliers around the world. 
It could ignite efforts to develop a successor to the four-nation Eurofighter but is expected to leave open whether Britain would seek to enter a project already underway between France and Germany, or risk a repeat of costly procurement splits.
For now, Sweden is shaping up as the most likely partner and South Korea, Japan and Turkey or Gulf arms-buying countries like Saudi Arabia could be drawn in, arms analyst Francis Tusa said.

""It is a game of industrial poker,"" he told Reuters.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2018 06:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lockheed F-35 jet price falls 6 percent to below $90 million - sources,"By Mike Stone
FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The United States has struck a preliminary deal to buy F-35 jets from  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) worth about $13 billion, clearing the way for a larger multi-year purchase that aims to bring the cost per jet down to $80 million by 2020, sources said. 
The deal for 141 F-35s lowers the price of the F-35A, the most common version of the stealthy fighter jet, to about $89 million, down around 6 percent from $94.3 million in the last deal struck in February 2017, the sources familiar with the talks said.
Bringing down the cost of the world's most expensive defense program is crucial to securing more orders, both in the United States and abroad.
President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the F-35 program for delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has steadily declined in recent years as production increased. 
The current ""handshake"" deal will be solidified along with pricing and other terms in a contract that will be announced in the coming weeks, the sources said, on condition of anonymity because the talks were private. 
The agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense removes a crucial road block from the ongoing negotiations for a multi-year deal for the fighters that is expected to consist of three tranches over fiscal years 2018-2020.
The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin ""have made progress and are in the final stages of negotiation,"" the Pentagon's head of acquisitions Ellen Lord said in a statement, adding the two sides had reached ""a handshake agreement which symbolizes the Department of Defense's commitment to equip"" U.S and allied forces, while giving ""great value"" to the U.S. taxpayer.
Last summer, Reuters reported that F-35 customers including Australia, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, South Korea, Britain and the United States had aimed to procure 135 or more jets in fiscal year 2018 for delivery in 2020 for about $88 million per jet.
In addition, negotiations were ongoing for the multi-year U.S. deal that was said to be worth more than $37 billion, and encompassing a record 440 F-35 fighter jets.
But negotiations for this 11th batch of jets extended because new Pentagon leaders drilled deep into the program to understand it and its costs, prolonging negotiations for the multi-year ""block buy,"" the sources said.
On Sunday, a Lockheed Martin representative said the handshake agreement on the production contract for the 11th lot of F-35 aircraft was in place, but the total value and cost per variant would be released when the contract was finalised. 
The F-35 comes in 3 variants: the F-35A conventional take-off and landing model; the F-35B, a short take-off/vertical landing version; and the F-35C, used aboard aircraft carriers.
The F-35 program is aiming to grow the fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bring the unit price of the F-35A closer to $80 million in 2020 through efficiencies gained by ordering in larger quantifies.
The jet had production problems in 2017, but Lockheed still hit its 2017 target to deliver 66 to the United States and its allies.
Lockheed is aiming to deliver 91 jets in 2018 and the Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker hopes to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets in 2023.
Despite the challenges the program has faced, the jet completed its flight testing in April. In May, Israel said it had been the first country to use the fighter in combat. 
New international customers are also possible. In February, the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale of 34 F-35s to Belgium for as much as $6.53 billion. Belgium is due to make a decision on a new fighter later this year. 
General Tod Wolters, the top U.S. Air Force general in Europe and NATO's Allied Air Commander, said the new warplane was taking root in Europe. 
""It's a game-changing system,"" Wolters told Reuters ahead of the Royal International Air Tattoo military air show in England. ""We're in the process of integrating the F-35 into the complete environment, not just the airspace.""
Norway, Britain and Italy will have received 40 F-35s in Europe by the end of the year.

Lockheed is the prime contractor for the jet. Its partners including  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC), United Technologies Corp's (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc (L:BAES).

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - AirAsia (KL:AIRA) is discussing the possible purchase of another 100 Airbus A321neo jets as the company's chief executive officer, Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes, and Airbus go down to the wire in parallel negotiations for an expanded order for larger A330neo jets, industry sources said.
Fernandes may attend this week's Farnborough Airshow where the two sides will attempt to end a rough patch in their relations and agree all or part of a complex package of wide-body and narrow-body jetliner orders, two sources said.
However, it remained unclear just how much fresh money the deal, if completed, would put in Airbus' coffers as the low-cost carrier juggles existing orders and drives a tough bargain on prices and the size of deposits, one of the sources said.
Another said any deal could involve a significant number of conversions or ""churn"" between existing orders. AirAsia has ordered 600 jets, two thirds of which remain to be delivered.
Airbus declined comment. AirAsia could not be reached.
Two sources said AirAsia could place an order for up to 100 single-aisle A321neo jets worth $13 billion at list prices, as reported by Bloomberg News.
A third source suggested it could involve an upgrade from smaller models, which may trigger other orders. None of the sources, who are familiar with the matter, agreed to be quoted on confidential talks.
The range of options underscores the complexity of AirAsia's portfolio as it expands. But despite the lure of a 100-plane order, all eyes are on whether AirAsia will confirm the A330neo, since there is no problem selling the smaller single-aisles.
AirAsia, Asia's largest budget carrier, has been sending mixed signals for months about whether it will confirm its earlier deal for 66 of the upgraded A330neo - watched from afar by  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which hopes to replace the order with its 787 Dreamliner.
Delegates say Airbus needs a marketing lift for its A330neo and would relish bringing Fernandes to the widely publicized Farnborough Airshow to reconfirm and expand his order.
That's because losing the A330neo's biggest buyer could make bankers tighten their terms for financing the same plane for other airlines, and therefore hurt sales even more. 
However, sources have said relations between the companies cooled following recent Airbus management changes.
An AirAsia order would signal that ties between Airbus and its biggest Asian customer have improved, though Airbus has signaled a drive to protect profit margins.
Financiers speculate AirAsia will push for discounts as high as 60 percent for the A321neo and two thirds for the A330neo. Standard industry discounts are closer to 50 percent.
Depending on negotiations, the amount of money handed over on day one alongside any new AirAsia order could be small. 

""This deal is worthless in terms of (upfront) financial commitment,"" the first source told Reuters.

The exchanges were responding to a move in May to include the three types of securities in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Composite Index starting from the third quarter of this year.
The Shanghai stock exchange said in a statement it reached the decision after consulting with domestic brokerages. 
""Most of the investors expressed a lack of understanding of these new types of securities,"" the exchange said. 
Domestic investors do not fully understand the concept of ""stapled"" securities and had not completely grasped the operations and financial systems of foreign companies, it said.
""These types of securities need to wait until they have reached a certain quantity and a market operation basis before they can be considered for the participation of mainland investors,"" the exchange added.
""Stapled"" securities are formed when two or more securities are contractually bound together to form a single unit that cannot be bought or sold separately.
The decision not to include the three types of firms means that mainland investors will not be able to invest in  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810), which made its debut in Hong Kong last week.
The stock connect scheme links mainland markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen with the one in Hong Kong. There are currently 268 stocks listed on the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect scheme, and 417 on the Shenzhen-Hong Kong scheme.
Transactions via the stock connects reached an accumulated total of 11.67 trillion yuan ($1.74 trillion) by the end of June, the Shanghai exchange said.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","India's capital market regulator proposes tighter rules for auditors, valuers","MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's capital market regulator has proposed amendments to tighten laws governing auditors and other third-party individuals hired by listed companies for auditing financial results, among other things.
The Kotak Committee, formed to come up with proposals for improving corporate governance, last year recommended that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) should have clear powers to act against auditors and other third-party individuals or firms with statutory duties under the securities law.
Auditing lapses have caused several frauds to go unnoticed for years and the capital market regulator has had no direct control on the auditing firms.
SEBI has proposed giving the board of directors of the company the authority to take appropriate action after conducting an investigation against the individual or firm that violates any regulations or submits a false certificate or report. 
The proposed changes come months after  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK), India's second largest state-run lender, stunned markets after uncovering a $2 billion loan fraud that had gone undetected for years.
Merchant bankers, credit rating agencies, custodians, among others, are registered and regulated by SEBI but chartered accountants, company secretaries, valuers and monitoring agencies do not come under any direct regulators.
The amendments would mean auditors must ensure certificates or reports issued by them are true in all material respects and they must exercise all due care, skill and diligence with respect to all processes involved in issuance of the report or certificate.
The auditors would be responsible to report in writing to the audit committee of the listed company or the compliance officer on any violation of the securities law they noticed.
In January, SEBI barred Price Waterhouse from auditing listed companies in India for two years after an investigation into a nearly decade-old accounting fraud case in a software services company that became India's biggest corporate scandal. 
SEBI has sought feedback and comments on the draft regulations over the next 30 days.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday rejected an attempt by a major Puerto Rico bondholder to throw out the U.S. territory's historic municipal bankruptcy case. 
U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled that the creation by the U.S. Congress of a financial oversight board for Puerto Rico under a law known as PROMESA and the appointment of the board's members did not violate the U.S. Constitution. 
""The oversight board’s statutory objectives and scope of authority thus mark its character as territorial rather than federal,"" Swain's ruling said. 
Aurelius Capital Management, an investment firm with a specialty in distressed debt, filed a motion last year arguing that the board's creation violated the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause. The hedge fund sought to dismiss the board's May 2017 federal court case to restructure the territory's roughly $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities.
An Aurelius spokesman said the hedge fund declined to comment on the ruling.
Under the 2016 federal PROMESA law, Congress appointed six members to a board tasked with managing the territory's finances, with then-President Barack Obama adding a seventh. PROMESA gave the board authority to push fiscally struggling Puerto Rico into a court-supervised restructuring akin to U.S. bankruptcy.
""As stated in Judge Swain’s opinion, PROMESA empowers the Oversight Board to ‘approve the fiscal plans and budgets of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities’ and ‘override Commonwealth executive and legislative actions that are inconsistent with approved fiscal plans and budgets,’"" the oversight board said in a statement on Friday.
Swain, who is overseeing Puerto Rico's case, previously dismissed a lawsuit by Aurelius and other investors over the territory's default on its general obligation bonds.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 08:26PM ET</span>",University of Maine pension fund fires Guggenheim over regulatory probe,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - A university pension and endowment fund fired a Guggenheim Partners LLC subsidiary because of its ongoing investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), records showed, as the closely watched U.S. asset manager faces pressure to address clients' concerns.
The University of Maine's investment committee, which oversees $640 million, jettisoned Guggenheim Investments as a manager of more than $17 million in assets in June after getting a warning about the investigation from a top investment consultant, NEPC LLC, according to official meeting records posted online. 
Those records said that the committee ""elected to terminate Guggenheim given the risks associated with the SEC investigation."" 
Guggenheim, the university and NEPC on Friday declined to comment on the termination, which was first reported by FundFire, an industry publication.
Guggenheim has not been accused of wrongdoing and said in April it was cooperating with the SEC investigation. The agency declined to comment when Reuters asked about the investigation at that time. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
The SEC is investigating Guggenheim and has sought details on a real-estate transaction and other deals involving a company owned by two former Guggenheim managers, according to a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, and asked not to be identified.
That company, ABS Capital Co LLC, purchased several properties in Southern California, including a $13 million mansion where a former Guggenheim executive, Alexandra Court, lives.
It was not clear why the company had purchased the property, but the transaction drew attention from media and people who watch the company closely because Court's relationship with Guggenheim Chief Executive and co-founder Mark Walter had already been a subject of staff and client concern. Court left the company earlier this year after a long sabbatical.
Walter is also the part-chairman and controlling owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball team. 
While the $17 million is just a sliver of the $246 billion managed by Guggenheim's investment division, the university's decision to replace Guggenheim with Bain Capital Credit LP as manager for a portfolio of bank loans turns a spotlight on a company that has faced months of publicity over regulatory inquiries and internal rifts.
Reuters reported last December that Guggenheim clients and other industry observers were concerned that the company's work culture had deteriorated, and that a number of executives from the company were working to address those concerns.
Beginning in April, NEPC started cautioning clients to review their investments with Guggenheim, according to the Maine university's records. NEPC guides not just the University of Maine but also hundreds of investors with over $1 trillion in assets, according to its website, and these advisers' views on fund managers can be influential.
A Guggenheim spokesman, Gerard Carney, told Reuters in December that public pension assets represent about 1.4 percent of Guggenheim's overall assets under management.
Mike Sitrick, a spokesman for Guggenheim, told Reuters in September that Court and Walter ""only have a business relationship,"" but that any personal relationship would have been disclosed to the company.
A spokesman for ABS Capital, George Haj, told Reuters in April that the company did not borrow money from Guggenheim or funds they manage to finance the homes.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Commerce on Friday lifted a ban on U.S. companies selling goods to ZTE Corp (HK:0763), allowing China's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker to resume business.
The Commerce Department removed the ban shortly after ZTE deposited $400 million in a U.S. bank escrow account as part of a settlement reached last month. The settlement also included a $1 billion penalty that ZTE paid to the U.S. Treasury in June. 
""The department will remain vigilant as we closely monitor ZTE's actions to ensure compliance with all U.S. laws and regulations,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that described the terms of the deal as the strictest ever imposed in such a case.
The terms will allow the department to protect U.S. national security, Ross said.
The administration has clashed with lawmakers from its own party over issues related to China, and this was no different. On Friday, Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, criticized the lifting of the ban.
""ZTE should be put out of business. There is no ‘deal’ with a state-directed company that the Chinese government and Communist Party uses to spy and steal from us where Americans come out winning,"" Rubio said in a statement.
A photograph circulating among employees around midnight showed ZTE's new chief executive and 10 other managers each giving a thumbs-up to the news, which was flashed on a screen at the company, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The reprieve follows threats by the Trump administration this week to impose 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods in a trade war.
ZTE did not respond to requests for comment.
ZTE, which relies on U.S. components for its smart phones and networking gear, ceased major operations after the ban was ordered in April.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted in May that he closed down ZTE and let it reopen, although no agreement had been reached. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said last month Trump agreed to lift the ban as a goodwill gesture to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The company had made false statements about disciplining 35 employees involved with illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea, Commerce Department officials said. ZTE pleaded guilty last year over the sanctions violations.
ZTE paid $892 million in penalties to the United States in connection with the 2017 settlement and guilty plea. The latest $1.4 billion deal comes on top of that.
The $400 million will remain in escrow for as long as 10 years to provide the U.S. government access to the money if ZTE violates the June settlement.
On Thursday, ZTE's Hong Kong shares surged about 24 percent after Reuters broke news the United States had signed an escrow agreement that paved the way for ZTE to deposit the $400 million.
ZTE's U.S.-listed shares fell 2.4 percent to $3.70 on Friday. The news came after markets closed in Asia. 
Shares of U.S. suppliers Acacia Communications and Lumentum Holdings rose more than 3 percent on the news before ending less than 1 percent higher.
ZTE paid U.S. companies more than $2.3 billion in 2017, including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc.
The company, which employs some 80,000 people, got a limited one-month waiver last week to maintain existing networks and equipment. 
ZTE has replaced its board of directors and senior management, as required by the June settlement, the Commerce Department noted. 
It will now operate with a 10-year suspended ban hanging over its head, which the United States can activate if it finds new violations. The current ban could have lasted seven years. 
Many U.S. lawmakers see the company as a national security threat and, on Thursday, a group of Republican and Democratic U.S. senators urged that ZTE's penalties be reinstated. 
The U.S. Senate paved the way for a showdown with Trump over the issue last month, when it passed an annual defense policy bill with an amendment attempting to reverse the deal. Its fate is unclear. 
Reuters reported on U.S. demands for a deal on June 1, and on June 5, revealed that ZTE had signed a preliminary agreement with the Commerce Department, along with the fine and other terms. It also broke news of the ban in April. 

A U.S. investigation into ZTE was launched after Reuters reported in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship hardware and software worth millions of dollars to Iran from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) is still on track to hit its goals for efficiency and revenue growth, executives said on Friday, as analysts pressed them to explain how those expectations line up with second-quarter results.
Although Citigroup beat Wall Street profit expectations, its revenue fell short of forecasts and businesses like branded credit cards and retail banking in Mexico are not yet generating the kind of revenue investors want to see.
During a conference call, Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat touted progress Citigroup has made toward goals he set last year to grow revenue faster than expenses and return more capital to shareholders.
Although some businesses are not operating at their full potential, management has confidence in longer-term growth prospects, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said.
Analysts asked how Citigroup will improve performance without having to spend a lot more on those businesses. Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo, the fourth analyst to bring up a question about costs, wondered whether management would need to spend more on digital banking to attract customers. 
""I don't think there's anything we're going to surprise you with in terms of new investments,"" said Corbat.
Expenses accounted for 58 percent of Citigroup's revenue in the second quarter, marking the seventh straight period of improvement, but remained well above the ""low-50s"" range Corbat wants to reach by 2020.
Since taking the helm almost six years ago, Corbat has struggled to get Citigroup's profit engine humming. The bank has been recovering from the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which left it with a $45 billion bailout bill, a diluted stock, and an assortment of businesses around the globe.
Corbat set about divesting underperforming businesses and amplifying others worth keeping, but Citigroup is still far less profitable than rivals.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), which also released earnings on Friday, generated a return on assets of 1.28 percent last quarter compared with 0.94 percent at Citigroup. JPMorgan's return on common equity was 14 percent, compared with 9.2 percent at Citigroup.
Citigroup's share price reflects the difference, trading at 93 percent of book value, while JPMorgan investors pay 1.6 times what the bank says its assets are worth.
""We expect Citigroup to be a relative underperformer as concerns still linger about long-term revenue growth in the company's cards business,"" KBW analysts wrote in a report on Friday. ""In addition, loan growth missed estimates and that is opposite of what we have seen at peers that have reported today.""
Citigroup shares fell 2.3 percent to close at $67 on Friday. The stock is down 10 percent for the year, compared with a 3.0 percent drop in the S&P 500 Banks index <.SPXBK>.
Overall, Citigroup's net income rose 16 percent to $4.5 billion, or to $1.63 per share, compared with $3.9 billion, or $1.28 per share, in the second quarter of 2017. The boost was driven by lower taxes and more revenue from providing treasury and trade services to corporations, as well as consumer banking.
Analysts had expected Citigroup to report $1.56 per share in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose about 2 percent to $18.47 billion, slightly below the average expectation of $18.51 billion. Its loan book grew 5.0 percent to $671 billion from $641 billion.

1440,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Amazon Jumps for the Week; Netflix Sees Earnings Jitters
Wall Street ended the week higher, with all the major indices closing in the green.
Tech stocks were winners for the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished up more than 1% and the S&P Technology Index rose more than 2%.
Among the big winners in tech land was Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The stock got a boost on a price target raise by Canaccord to $2,000 from $1,800 Thursday and again when S.G. Cowen raised its price target on the stock to $2,100 from $2,000 Friday.
In the rest of the FAANG stocks, Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) all closed up for the week.
But Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which reports earnings after the bell Monday, ended in the red, hurt by Friday selloff. There are likely a few jitters about what numbers Netflix would have to report to spur more buying with the stock up around 100% year to date.
2. Inflation Data Lets Fed Stay Steady on Rates
Inflation data was paramount during the week, especially after last Friday’s employment report gave mixed signals of strong continued job creation but weaker-than-expected wage growth.
The numbers grabbing the headlines were the levels in wholesale and retail inflation not seen for a while.
The producer price index (PPI) was up 3.4% in June year over year, the highest level in 6-1/2 years. The June consumer price index (CPI) posted a year-over-year rise of 2.9%, the largest rise in six years.
But the stock market tends to focus more on the month-on-month numbers and those figures were mixed. CPI was in line with expectations month over month, while core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up less than expected. PPI and core PPI came in just a little hotter than expectations.
So, while prices are definitely rising, the economy is so far avoiding the spikes that would fuel fears over interest rates rising quickly.
More significant for those zoned in on the Fed’s rate-hike path than the inflation data was likely the shift of Chicago Fed President Charles Evans comments in a wide-ranging interview with The Wall Street Journal that the economy could handle a move to neutral rates. That was interpreted to mean he’d support two rate-hikes this year.
There is currently a more-than-80% of a rate hike in September and a more-than-55% chance of one in December, according to Investing.com’s Rate Monitor Tool.
3. Delta Results Steal the Spotlight From Banks
The bank earnings were supposed be the highlight of the week. But the mixed results from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) failed to spur anything but a muted reaction from the market Friday.
Instead, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) likely offered the most insight for investors. Shares climbed Thursday after the carrier beat second-quarter profit expectations thanks to fair increases.
But it also highlighted a jump in fuel costs of nearly 40% in the quarter, a $2 billion increase.
That’s trouble for the airline sector as whole, which is already struggling in 2018. The Dow Transports are off about 0.6% year to date. But there could be more weakness ahead if fuel costs remain high and companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS (NYSE:UPS) are hit by trade battles.
4. Trade War Jitters Abate (Somewhat)
Until earnings arrived in earnest Friday, the summer, low-volume market has been especially susceptible to the vagaries of trade tensions.
The week started off with more saber rattling between the U.S. and its trade partners. The U.S. released a list on Tuesday of $200 billion more in Chinese goods that it would assess for tariffs of 10%. China again promised retaliation.
That same day, ahead of his trip to Europe, President Donald Trump tweeted that the U.S. loses $151 billion on trade with the EU and that the single bloc charges the U.S. big tariffs and enacts trade barriers.



But worries were assuaged on Thursday when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said there was a possibility that the U.S. and China could restart trade talks. And the president, while hammering allies of NATO spending, has not made any remarks about specific trade action against Europe.
The rosier outlook on trade was reflected in the performance of Boeing (NYSE:BA), which is particularly sensitive to trade battles given the amount of its overseas business.
Boeing was one of the best Dow performers for the week.
5. Oil Holds Above $70
Oil prices fell for the week, but energy stock bulls will be heartened by crude oil’s ability to stay above $70 mark on Friday.
Crude oil futures for August delivery settled at $71.01 per barrel, up 1% on the day.
Oil did dip below $70 in morning trading, rose steadily through the rest of the day, then sold off late. The latest Baker Hughes rig count showing no change added some support to prices.
For the week, mixed signals on supplies scaled back investor expectations for a global supply shortage as Libya resumed exports, U.S. supplies fell more than expected, while bets on a significant loss of Iranian crude were trimmed."
1441,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 04:41PM ET</span>",J&J vows to overturn $4.7 billion talc verdict but experts see hurdles,"By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has vowed to appeal a $4.7 billion verdict awarded to 22 women who claim asbestos-contaminated talc in the company's products gave them ovarian cancer by arguing the plaintiffs' science was flawed and the case should not have been heard in Missouri.
But several legal experts said that even though J&J has been successful in winning appeals of other talc cases in Missouri, it will face a challenging road in appealing the verdict handed down on Thursday in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis.
John Beisner, a lawyer for Johnson & Johnson, said, ""One of the hardest things will be prioritizing what to appeal first."" He described to Reuters the company's jurisdictional and scientific arguments for overturning Thursday's verdict.
In a statement responding to the verdict, J&J reiterated its position that its products never contained asbestos and were not carcinogenic. 
Thursday's verdict is the largest to date arising from lawsuits alleging talc-based products like J&J's baby powder have caused cancer. The jury reached its decision in less than a day, following five weeks of expert testimony from both sides.
The stakes are potentially high for J&J, which is facing 9,000 cases nationwide over talc. The company has had previous success in overturning large verdicts in talc cases as well as others alleging harm from its products.
But several legal experts said Missouri courts, including at the appellate and supreme court level, were historically plaintiff-friendly and could prove unreceptive to J&J's arguments.
""J&J has strong arguments, but unless they get to certify this case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which are very long odds, this decision is likely to stand,"" said Lars Noah, a law professor at the University of Florida.
He said he expected J&J would go through the appeals process but would ultimately wind up settling the case.
Beisner said he was not aware of any interest in settlement. ""Our attention will remain focused on the appeals from this and the other trials awaiting review.""
Beisner said jurisdiction will be one major basis for J&J to appeal Thursday's verdict. Most of the 22 plaintiffs were not Missouri residents, and he said they should not have been allowed to sue New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson in St. Louis under a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that severely restricted state courts' jurisdiction over injury lawsuits brought by non-residents against out-of-state companies.
J&J seized on that decision to successfully overturn previous talc verdicts in Missouri.
Mark Lanier, the plaintiffs' lawyer who won Thursday's verdict, said he was ready for that argument.
Lanier said his team amassed ""hundreds of pages of evidence"" showing lobbying efforts and baby powder focus groups J&J conducted in the state. He also spotlighted the claim by 15 of his non-resident clients that they used a specific short-lived J&J talc-based product manufactured by Missouri-based contractor.
""I hope they focus their appeal on jurisdiction because I'm confident we'll win that,"" Lanier said. He did say that he expects the punitive damages award to be halved during the appeals process due to a Missouri state law that caps such damages, but is confident the verdict would stand overall.
The $4.69 billion in total damages includes $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages.
Elizabeth Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia, said that even under the new Supreme Court guidance, the women's claim that they used the specific product, if true, provided ""a pretty strong link to Missouri.""
At trial J&J had unsuccessfully sought to cast doubt on the 15 women's claims to have used the same product that was only available for a few months, depicting it as a ruse designed to bypass the jurisdiction issue. Beisner said J&J would make the same argument on appeal.
Along with jurisdictional arguments, Beisner said the company would continue to put forth its case that scientific studies overwhelmingly show talc itself is safe and the company's talc-based products never contained asbestos. 
""None of plaintiffs' experts were able to put forward a valid theory and there is simply no science to support what they call asbestos in the product,"" said Beisner.
J&J says decades of testing by laboratories and independent agencies, including a study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, support its position. The company said plaintiffs' tests showing asbestos contamination were ""junk science.""
But Lanier argued that it was the agencies and labs cited by J&J that used flawed testing methods that failed to detect asbestos.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Investors eye bright spots in REIT sector,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - While investors say they are wary of the broader real estate industry in a rising interest rate environment, some are still bullish on sectors such as self storage and manufactured homes.
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are typically seen as a defensive investment bet as their large dividend payouts offset slow but predictable growth.
The S&P 500 real estate index has outperformed in the last six months with a 5.8 percent climb compared with the broader S&P 500's (SPX) 0.4 percent advance.
REITs have been boosted recently on earnings strength and a slump in U.S. Treasury 10-year yields. But some investors expect them to lose steam if bonds yields turn higher, assuming that the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates and the economy stays strong. Investors typically prefer bonds to defensive sectors like REITs when interest rates are rising.
The REIT sector however is down 0.2 percent for the year-to-date compared with the S&P's 4.7 percent gain. It already lagged the S&P 500 for the last two years with a 7 percent rise in 2017 compared with the S&P's 19.4 percent advance and no change in 2016 compared with the S&P's 9.5 percent increase.
But some REIT subsectors, which have already outperformed the real estate industry so far in 2018, may continue to climb.
The FTSE Nareit Equity Self Storage index (FTFN12) has risen 18.6 percent in the last six months and 10.6 percent year-to-date making it the biggest gainer in the sector. Self storage companies include Public Storage (N:PSA),  CubeSmart  (N:CUBE) and Life Storage Inc (N:LSI).
Even with these gains, and an oversupply of capacity, self storage is still attractively valued, said Cedrik LaChance, Director of REIT Research at Green Street Advisors.
""In the last seven to eight years self storage companies have become very adept at marketing online,"" said Bob Zenouzi, a chief investment officer specializing in real estate at Macquarie Investment Management. ""People can't afford a home and need to downsize. You have stuff and need to store that stuff.""
REITs that lease land to consumers who buy or rent manufactured residences such as mobile homes also stood out.
The FTSE Nareit Equity Manufactured Homes index has risen 16.3 percent in the last six months and 8 percent year-to-date. Companies in the sector include Equity Lifestyle Properties (N:ELS) and Sun Communities (N:SUI).
""We always love manufactured homes. It's ignored by too many investors so it remains attractively priced,"" said Green Street's LaChance who sees low capital spending costs as a key advantage. ""In real estate capex is really important and takes away a lot of the economics.""
Macquarie's Zenouzi says that hefty price tags for traditional houses are making manufactured homes more attractive to cash-strapped consumers.
""Demographics are a tailwind because retirees want to downsize. House prices are up. These are lower cost options.""
Hotel REITs have also done well though some investors are getting wary. They have been helped by a boost in business travel due to U.S. economic strength and recent U.S. corporate tax cuts. And when demand is strong, hotel REITs are better placed to quickly raise rates for short-term customers than REITs in long-lease sectors such as office or healthcare REITS.
The FTSE Nareit Equity Lodging/Resorts index (FTFN24) rising 4.8 percent in the last six months and 6.4 percent year-to-date. But those gains may have run their course.
""The share prices are effectively pricing in this rebound of corporate travel. Its priced in so aggressively we're starting to see hotels as an expensive sector,"" said LaChance.
Even if there are bargains in REITS, John Laforge, head of real estate asset strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, in Florida warned against getting ""over your skis"" in the broader sector. Instead he favors fast growing sectors like industrials, healthcare or technology.
""We're late in the economic cycle. It's very classic for REITs to start underperforming,"" said Laforge who recently downgraded the sector to 'neutral"" from a ""favorable"" rating.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Some U.S. industries could thrive amid trade tensions: Cowen,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Though the escalating tensions between the United States and several of its trading partners could hurt companies across a broad range of sectors, several industries are poised to withstand them or even thrive, according to U.S. financial services firm Cowen and Company on Friday.
China's recent revisions to tariffs have a clear benefit to luxury retailers, Cowen analysts said in a report. While the country raised import duties on several categories of U.S. goods, it lowered tariffs on apparel, cosmetics, household goods and jewelry. 
The lower tariffs on jewelry could especially benefit Tiffany & Co (N:TIF), as 16 percent of its sales come from China, Cowen said.
Other industries, including banks, restaurants and discount retailers, face relatively minimal impact from the burgeoning trade war and could even benefit under certain conditions, Cowen said.
Banks do not rely directly upon imports and exports, so the biggest risk for the group would be an overall economic slowdown if the trade war were prolonged. In that case, regional and community banks in areas especially hit by tariffs, such as the rural U.S. Midwest, would have the most exposure to risk from an economic slowdown.
Conversely, if the White House's stance on trade resulted in fewer tariffs on U.S. goods and stronger intellectual property protections for U.S. companies in China, it could boost the U.S. economy and thereby brighten banks' outlooks.
Restaurants are insulated from tariffs because they source most of their food from within the United States. As with banks, the biggest tariff-related risk for the industry is a general economic slowdown.
Ongoing trade disputes have pushed down grain prices, which could lead to increased protein production and ultimately lower prices for poultry and cattle. 
As a result, quick-service restaurants may cut prices, especially if tariffs begin to hit customers' wallets. That scenario would benefit large chains such as McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and Taco Bell, owned by Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM), but not regional chains such as Sonic Corp (O:SONC) or Jack in the Box Inc (O:JACK), Cowen analysts said.
Discount and off-price retailers are also well-positioned as trade tensions ratchet up. Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) derive more than half of their sales from groceries, which shields them from tariff pressures, Cowen said.
Both chains would benefit from shoppers seeking lower prices in the event of an economic downturn. That same scenario would help off-price discretionary retailers such as TJX Companies Inc (N:TJX),  Ross Stores Inc  (O:ROST) and Burlington Stores Inc (N:BURL), according to Cowen.

1457,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 02:38PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo's loan book shrinks, profit misses estimates","By Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said on Friday its loan book shrank and it raked in less fee revenue than a year ago, factors that contributed to lower-than-expected quarterly profit and sent its shares lower. 
The bank said much of the lending decline had to do with moves to avoid riskier loans, but the second-quarter results ignited fears about lingering reputational damage from Wells Fargo's phony accounts scandal and other customer abuses.
The total average loan balance for the bank shrank 1 percent in the quarter from a year earlier as its consumer loan book fell by 2 percent and commercial real estate lending slowed. 
Wells Fargo has been running down financial crisis-era mortgage portfolios and dialing back lending in other businesses like autos where it sees too much risk. 
Its most recent pullback is in commercial real estate lending, where Wells Fargo executives say competition among other lenders has caused a broad decline in underwriting standards.
""As it relates to underwriting standards, it's not all bank-to-bank competition ... the competition here is just broad as it's ever been,"" Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told analysts, pointing to real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds and other capital sources. 
Wells Fargo shares were down 0.9 percent in afternoon trading. 
Analyst pressed Wells Fargo executives on a call to discuss the results about when they could expect to see a turning point. The bank could soon ramp up auto lending again, the executives said, without giving a specific time frame. 
""I would say that we're happy that it was sort of stabilized and we're now viewing the origination path is growing,"" Shrewsberry said.
The bank's mortgage business weighed on the income it makes from fees, which fell 8 percent in the quarter to $9 billion. 
Intensifying price competition for mortgages hurt margins and borrower prepayments cut into servicing fees. The bank also said a program that helps customers avoid overdraft charges dented fee income. 
Even with loan balances falling, the bank's net interest income rose 1 percent, helped by higher interest rates. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Friday its average core loans rose 7 percent from a year ago.
One consequence of Wells Fargo's slow loan and deposit growth is that the bank does not have to worry about bumping up against a regulator-imposed cap on its balance sheet. 
The Federal Reserve has ordered Wells Fargo to keep assets below $1.95 trillion until the bank's governance and controls improve. 
Total non-interest expenses rose 3 percent to $14 billion, with the bank noting that marketing costs from a rebranding effort to help repair damage to its reputation added to costs.
The bank said it also took a $619 million operating loss hit in the quarter for compensating customer harmed by foreign exchange, mortgage, auto lending and wealth management issues. 
The lender's expenses per dollar of revenue have remained stubbornly high after the phony accounts scandal erupted in 2016. Wells Fargo has vowed to cut costs by shrinking its branch network, overhauling internal departments, combining certain business areas and other measures.
Net income applicable to common stock fell to $4.79 billion, or 98 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $5.45 billion, or $1.08 per share a year ago.

On an adjusted basis, earnings were $1.08 per share, excluding a 10-cent hit from an income tax expense, missing analysts' estimates of $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The announcement came after the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that the planemaker is not entitled to recover certain costs associated with the 2005 sale of its production facilities in Wichita, Kansas to Spirit.
The charge translates to 21 cents per share.

Boeing is expected to report second-quarter results on July 25. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $3.45 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Second-quarter earnings reports from three of the biggest U.S. banks on Friday showed the sector is benefiting from policy changes in Washington that have lowered their taxes, boosted interest rates and allowed them to buy back more stock.
Investors were skeptical, worried that underlying businesses were not as strong as they could be and that tough talk from international leaders about trade tariffs and hardened borders could hurt their bottom lines.
""With the tariffs, there's this element of uncertainty and people aren't anxious to take loans at a time when there's uncertainty,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
Shares of large bank stocks were down 0.7 percent at 1:30 p.m. ET, as measured by the S&P 500 Banks index <.SPXBK> after JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) reported second-quarter results.
Wells Fargo was the only one of the three lenders whose profit did not meet Wall Street expectations. The scandal-plagued bank was hurt by costs relating to past misconduct and a decline in mortgage lending. Although Citigroup beat profit estimates, its revenues fell short of expectations. 
Citigroup's loan growth said little about the U.S. economy because it came largely from corporations looking for international trade loans and working capital financing as well as from private banking clients in Asia, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach told reporters.
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, had the strongest results, with profit jumping 18 percent year-over-year on strong trading revenue and loan growth. But Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned that clients are worried about a global trade war after U.S. President Donald Trump ramped up his protectionist rhetoric in recent weeks.
Trade disputes, particularly with China, are creating uncertainty, Dimon said on a conference call with reporters.
""It's affecting psyche more than it is economics,"" he said. ""There are unpredictable outcomes when you start skirmishes like this with multiple countries.""
Even so, consumers and businesses remain confident enough to transact and borrow, Dimon later told analysts.
""If you're looking for potholes out there, there are not a lot of things,"" he said. ""Growth is accelerating.""
Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat acknowledged trade concerns but said, so far, they had not resulted in significant changes to the way clients transact.
""It's the rhetoric we're tracking,"" he told analysts. ""I think the markets have fears of what the rhetoric leads to but, at this point, we're not seeing it come through in the numbers.""
Both JP Morgan and Citigroup benefited from strong equities trading during the quarter - JP Morgan's equity trading revenue increased by 24 percent while Citi's equity trading revenue was up 19 percent. That bodes well for Bank of America (N:BAC) Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), each of which have substantial equities trading operations and are due to report quarterly earnings next week. 
Despite a favorable trading environment, shares in U.S. banks have underperformed the broader market this year because investors think the record profits are the result of one-time tax cuts and share buybacks rather than underlying strength in their businesses, according to analysts.

Investors want to see more growth in revenue and in pretax profit, according to Charles Peabody of Portales Partners, who said on Thursday the strong growth in earnings across the industry ""is coming from financial engineering: a onetime tax cut and share buybacks.""

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Comcast to pay advisers as much as 243 million pound in fees for Sky takeover,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Comcast (O:CMCSA) expects to pay the banks, law firms and other advisers on its 25.9 billion pound ($34.23 billion) bid for Sky (L:SKYB) as much as 243 million pounds if it wins the battle for the British broadcaster, the U.S. cable giant said on Friday.
Sky is at the center of a complex trans-Atlantic bidding war between Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA), Comcast and Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) that will generate large fees for advisory firms working on all sides. 
Fox, which already owns 39 percent of Sky, and Comcast are fighting for control of the British pay-television group. At the same time, Comcast and Disney are vying to buy the bulk of Fox's film and TV assets, including its Sky stake.
Comcast expects to pay its advisers between 203 million pounds and 243 million pounds in total for their work on the Sky bid, the U.S. group estimated in its formal offer document for the British company on Friday. 
The lion's share of the fees -- up to 170.3 million pounds -- will go to the lenders, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), that are co-ordinating the financing for Comcast's offer.
The cable giant will also pay between 22.7 million pounds and 37.8 million pounds to the firms that are providing it with financial advice. 
They include the boutique Robey Warshaw, the small business founded by investment bankers Sir Simon Robey, Simon Warshaw and Philip Apostolides in 2013 and which is based in London's upmarket Mayfair district.
In addition, as much as 24.1 million pounds will go on Comcast's legal fees.
Meanwhile, Sky expects to spend between 88.6 million pounds and 95.9 million pounds on advice and other expenses relating to the Comcast offer, the document shows.
The broadcaster estimates it will pay  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), and boutique firm PJT Partners between 59.5 million pounds and 61.5 million pounds for their financial advice, according to the Comcast document. Legal advice will cost it between 15.2 million pounds and 20 million pounds.
Comcast said in the document that its 14.75 pounds per share offer to Sky shareholders was open until 1300 London time on Aug. 22, although it said it could extend the acceptance period
It lifted its bid for Sky on Wednesday after Fox sweetened its rival offer to 14 pounds per share earlier that day. Sky's independent directors have recommended the Comcast offer.
Sky shares closed down 0.6 percent at 15.35 pounds. 
The stock is trading above the level of the Comcast offer amid speculation that Fox will make a higher counterbid. Fox is yet to publish its offer document.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 12:59PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Jeff Bezos plans to charge at least $200,000 for space rides - sources","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos' rocket company plans to charge passengers about $200,000 to $300,000 for its first trips into space next year, two people familiar with its plans told Reuters.
Potential customers and the aerospace industry have been eager to learn the cost of a ticket on Blue Origin's New Shepard space vehicle, to find out if it is affordable and whether the company can generate enough demand to make a profit on space tourism.
Executives at the company, started by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Bezos in 2000, told a business conference last month they planned test flights with passengers on the New Shepard soon, and to start selling tickets next year.
The company, based about 20 miles (32 km) south of Seattle, has made public the general design of the vehicle - comprising a launch rocket and detachable passenger capsule - but has been tight-lipped on production status and ticket prices.
Blue Origin representatives did not respond to requests for comment on its programs and pricing strategy. Bezos said in May ticket prices had not yet been decided. 
One Blue Origin employee with first-hand knowledge of the pricing plan said the company will start selling tickets in the range of about $200,000 to $300,000. A second employee said tickets would cost a minimum of $200,000. They both spoke on condition of anonymity as the pricing strategy is confidential.
The New Shepard is designed to autonomously fly six passengers more than 62 miles (100 km) above Earth into suborbital space, high enough to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before the pressurized capsule returns to earth under parachutes. 
The capsule features six observation windows Blue Origin says are nearly three times as tall as those on a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 747 jetliner. 
Blue Origin has completed eight test flights of the vertical take-off and landing New Shepard from its launch pad in Texas, but none with passengers aboard. Two flights have included a test dummy the company calls ""Mannequin Skywalker.""
The company will do the first test in space of its capsule escape system, which propels the crew to safety should the booster explode, ""within weeks,"" one of the employees said.
SMALL STEP FOR A MAN
Blue Origin, whose Latin motto means ""step by step, ferociously,"" is working towards making civilian space flight an important niche in the global space economy, alongside satellite services and government exploration projects, already worth over $300 billion a year. 
Bezos, the world's richest person with a fortune of about $112 billion, has competition from fellow billionaires Richard Branson and Elon Musk, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's chief executive. 
Branson's Virgin Galactic says it has sold about 650 tickets aboard its own planned space voyages, but has not set out a date for flights to start. The company is charging $250,000 per ticket, in line with Blue Origin's proposed pricing. 
SpaceX, founded by Musk in 2002, says its ultimate goal is to enable people to live on other planets. 
All three are looking to slash the cost of spaceflight by developing reusable spacecraft, meaning prices for passengers and payloads should drop as launch frequency increases. 
While Blue Origin has not disclosed its per-flight operating costs, Teal Group aerospace analyst Marco Caceres estimated each flight could cost the firm about $10 million. With six passengers per trip, that would mean losing millions of dollars per launch, at least initially.

Three sources said Blue's first passengers are likely to include its own employees, though the company has not selected them yet.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 12:28PM ET</span>",China market jolt far less contagious than 2015 shock,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Three years after a financial shock in China rocked world markets, a slower-motion 20 percent reversal of China's main stock index and the yuan's worst month on record have had much less of a viral effect around the globe.
Rather than the bolts from the blue investors endured over the past decade, Chinese market adjustments this year feel more transparent and akin to those in other developed markets. 
That in part reflects a greater maturity of Chinese markets, defter control by Beijing authorities and the more resilient world economy.
A rapidly escalating trade dispute between Washington and Beijing that risks exaggerating the steady deceleration of China's rapid national output growth has taken its toll on Chinese assets since the first quarter. 
In June, some mainland indexes (CSI300) recorded their biggest fall since January 2016, when the bursting in June 2015 of China's stock market bubble eventually spilled over into global markets. 
""The bubble in 2015, that level was during a period of high euphoria, high speculation,"" said Douglas Morton at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets.
At the time Chinese main indexes traded more in value than any other single index in the world, including the S&P 500 or Japan's Topix, he added.

""We are a long, long way off that at the moment, and the renminbi and the Chinese stock market has been relatively mature at this point,"" he said, adding the lack of tampering by authorities in both currency and stock markets had also provided some reassurance. 
In June and July 2015, China's Shanghai stock index (SSEC) lost more than a third of its value in just over two weeks. Both equity and debt markets suffered hefty outflows in the following months, according to data from the Institute of International Finance (IIF). 
In recent months, China's equity markets have seen steady inflows, underpinned by MSCI's decision in June 2017 to include yuan-denominated Chinese stocks, known as ""A-shares"", in its widely tracked emerging market index.

With the trade spat between Washington and Beijing escalating in recent weeks, the IIF found non-resident portfolio equity flows had ground to a ""sudden stop"" in late June. But while overseas investment in Chinese shares has been on the rise, the share held by foreigners remains relatively small and high domestic retail participation in China's local stock market provides some extra protection. 
(Graphic: Daily non-resident portfolio equity flows - https://reut.rs/2NJhU8h)
The broad and deep economic recovery seen in the past few years has helped further diminish the prospect of sudden falls in China impacting other markets. 
""Contagion happens not because of equity markets, contagion happens because of the real world,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""The key thing about the last couple of years would be that European and U.S. domestic demand has really picked up, Asian domestic demand has started to pick up -- and this is something that mitigates a lot."" 
(Graphic: World Stocks and China Equity Indexes - https://reut.rs/2JiNlmr)
China's currency has been another flashpoint in the puzzle that keeps investors preoccupied. In 2015, just two months after the stock market bubble burst, China's central bank devalued the yuan by nearly 2 percent. 
While the yuan has weakened in recent weeks both against the dollar and against a basket of currencies of its main trading partners, drawing a parallel with the sharp move three years ago does not take into account the prolonged emerging markets crisis of the time, said Zhou Hao at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
Few fear China could see a ""hard landing"" -- a specter that haunted markets in 2015. And yuan weakness is deemed to be a policy-loosening tool, alongside targeted reserve requirement cuts, while the increased access to onshore markets for foreign investors and a falling offshore yuan pool has made betting against the currency an expensive business.
But recent moves have sparked concern among some fund managers, said Benn Eifert, chief investment officer at QVR Advisors in San Francisco. 
""There are investors who look back and see a lot of parallels to the third quarter of 2015, which started out this way, with kind of a long-trending decline in Chinese equity prices and then some rapid devaluation of the yuan. And that cascaded through global markets and led to a pretty big selloff,"" said Eifert.
""You do see just general concern about what exactly is going on over there.""

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Russian retailers, hotels emerge as World Cup winners","By Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The World Cup has captivated host Russia for a month, proving a boon for the brewing and hotel industries while dampening spending on some expensive items and curbing trading on financial markets.
As well as the usual staples of the soccer fan -- beer and snacks -- the tournament also spurred domestic demand for loans for electronic appliances, primarily TV sets and smartphones.
Meanwhile, Russian car dealers will probably welcome the end of the party on Sunday after sales slowed last month.
Economists have played down the direct economic impact from the World Cup, predicting it would be marginal and unevenly spread. 
That tends to fit the pattern of other countries that have hosted major sports events -- a brief bounce but not enough to make a lasting impact on an economy.
The tournament, which kicked off on June 14 and ends when France play Croatia in Sunday's final, attracted more than 700,000 foreign fans to Russia, who packed the streets of the 11 host cities together with locals.
Moscow saw a 60-percent increase in foreign tourists, bringing the overall number of visitors to the Russian capital during the World Cup to 3 million people, said Nikolai Gulyaev, head of Moscow's sport and tourism department, said.
All those fans needed to be housed and kept refreshed.Booking.com (O:BKNG) warned 74 percent of properties in St. Petersburg and Moscow have been booked for the World Cup final weekend. Booking.com's website gave no such warning on availability for next weekend. In the stadiums, Russian fans were the main spenders, having laid out $12 million over the first four weeks of the tournament, Visa (N:V) said on Friday.
""Sales of beer, non-alcoholic beverages and snacks have visibly increased in the first two weeks of the World Cup,"" said the Perekrestok supermarket chain, part of Russia's largest retailer X5 Retail Group (L:PJPq).In host cities, some of which have never seen so many tourists, fans swarmed to cafes and bars, draining beer supplies to alarmingly low levels.
PLANES AND SCREENS
Kviku, an online retail lending company, said the number of its customers rose more than a quarter over the past month as people took out loans to buy flights to World Cup host cities.
It also saw increased demand for loans for devices on which to watch matches, Kviku added.
Sales of TV sets and smartphones had already posted a 20 percent increase in May-June compared with a year ago, Russia's leading electrical goods retailer M.Video-Eldorado (MM:MVID) said.
""Soccer is such a desire for most active fans that it prompts them to go for extra borrowing,"" said Nikita Lomakin, the CEO of Kviku.
Purchases of World Cup-related merchandise also picked up after Russia's surprising progress to the last eight of the tournament, according to Russia's leading classified ads platform Avito.
Some Russians appear to have opted to stay at home to watch the matches on television rather than take a holiday. 
The number of Russians who had no summer travel plans this year rose to 23 percent from 7 percent seen in 2016, a survey by Russia's research center Romir showed.
COMPETING FOR ATTENTION
Other businesses in Russia were less excited about the tournament. New car sales growth slowed in June to 11 percent from 18 percent a month earlier, with analysts blaming the World Cup as the factor that distracted buyers.
Indeed, some measures announced while Russians were caught up in the World Cup excitement, such as increases in sales tax and the retirement age could have a more enduring effect on the economy.
While retailers and hoteliers tot up the takings from the month, it will take time to study the overall World Cup effect after it filters into official data.
""This is the question of no less than one year or maybe more,"" said Shlomo Weber, rector of the prominent New Economic School.
On the financial markets, activity fell on all sections of the Moscow Exchange (MM:MOEX) apart from the bond platform as traders turned their focus to live action.
And even though its economic benefits are debateable, the World Cup certainly lifted spirits.
""The World Cup is a good thing but not always for trade, more for the mood,"" the exchange's CEO Alexander Afanasyev said.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 11:34AM ET</span>",Trade policy uncertainty could bolster U.S. defensive stock sectors,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the United States ramps up import tariffs and long-date U.S Treasury debt yields remain low, stocks in so-called defensive sectors may have room to run higher in price, even though expectations for the currently quarterly earnings seasons are high. 
Stocks in defensive sectors, which generally pay steady dividends and have steady earnings, languished for the first months of 2018. Utilities, real estate, telecommunications and consumer staples all saw their stocks fall into early June even as the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index rose more than 4 percent.
But over the past 30 days, two of those sectors have led the S&P 500 in percentage gains as geopolitical risk has risen.
Utilities have jumped 7.7 percent, and real estate has gained 3 percent. Not far behind, consumer staples have risen 2.5 percent. All have outperformed the S&P's 0.4 percent advance.
By contrast, shares in several cyclical sectors, which tend to rise as the economy grows and are often favored by investors in the late stage of a bull market, have dropped over the same period. Industrials have slumped 3.9 percent, while materials have slid 3.6 percent and financials have fallen 2.7 percent.
Several conditions have supported a rotation into defensive stocks, investors said. 
They tend to perform better when interest rates are low, and they have risen as yields on the 10-year Treasury note have retreated from the 3.0 percent mark since early June. 
A burgeoning U.S. trade war with China and the European Union has also led investors to seek stability. On Tuesday, the White House proposed 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Consumer staples stocks also got a boost on Monday after PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly results. 
Seven out of 25 of the S&P 500 consumer staples companies have reported so far, and of those, 86 percent have beaten analyst estimates for revenue and profit. Generally, staples and other defensive areas lag the other S&P 500 sectors in revenue and earnings growth.
Some market watchers have begun to recommend portfolio adjustments in anticipation of a downturn in U.S. stocks. 
On Monday, Morgan Stanley's U.S. equities strategists upgraded consumer staples and telecom stocks to an ""equal weight"" rating, after raising utilities to ""overweight"" in June. They downgraded the technology sector, which accounts for more than a quarter of the weight of the S&P 500, to ""underweight.""
""We expect the path to be bumpy for the next few months,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta, which in May added exposure to real estate stocks in one of its portfolios. ""Having some dividend strategies is likely to be a nice ballast.""
Few investors believe the end of the bull market is imminent though. 
Some said the gains in defensive sectors are bound to be short-lived as strong corporate earnings and continued economic strength boost market sentiment. Others believe recent tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policy will be resolved by the autumn as the U.S. midterm Congressional elections approach.
""We have solid earnings growth, and we have an economy that continues to march down the path of acceleration,"" said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston. ""Those (defensive) sectors are not attractive to us."" 
Even so, defensive sectors could draw investors' attention in the next few months if stockmarkets remain choppy. As they have languished in the past few years, stocks in those sectors could offer value, especially if the companies raise dividends, said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.
The improving performance of stocks in defensive sectors may ultimately be beneficial for the market, some investors said.
The lion's share of growth in the S&P 500 index has come from technology and consumer discretionary stocks: most notably,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, collectively known as FANG. 
If other sectors can contribute more to the index's gains, investors may have more confidence in diversifying their portfolios.

""With a very narrow market like you've had most of this year, it's great for stock pickers, but it's hard for indexes to make money,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Sterling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. ""What you're seeing is a broadening out of the market, which is extraordinarily helpful.""

Sharon Price John, in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" program, called the overcrowded sale event, which had to be limited on Thursday, ""heartbreaking"" and said the global stuffed-animal retailer would offer a sale through the summer.
""I am sorry that we were not able to provide the service that we wanted,"" Price John said. ""We are doing our very best and we are staying very focused on making sure that we do the best we can to make it right for people.""
She added that the company wanted to ""make kids happy"" and that she was sorry some families could not be served.
Shares of the company were trading at $7.95 early on Friday morning, up nearly 2 percent from its close of $7.80 on Thursday. 
Customers in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom seeking to buy a furry friend on Thursday could buy a stuffed animal at stores for a price equaling their age, with minimum of $1 and maximum of $29, sending flocks of children and others to its outlets. Teddy bears were priced from $6 to $75 on the store's website. 
The big crowds at stores created safety concerns that led Build-A-Bear to close some stores or limit customers.
""It was beyond anything we could have ever imagined,"" Price John told NBC. ""There was really no way for us to have estimated those crowds. We were fully stocked, fully staffed.""
The company will offer U.S., UK and Canadian customers a $15 voucher through Aug. 31 and will still honor its pay-your-age promotion in stores for children during the child's birthday month, she said.

St. Louis-based Build-A-Bear has some 400 stores worldwide.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit accusing two former Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (N:OZM) executives of masterminding a scheme to funnel tens of millions of dollars of bribes to African officials.
U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn ruled on Thursday that the SEC could not collect fines, recoup profit or obtain injunctions because it had missed a five-year deadline to sue the defendants, Michael Cohen and Vanja Baros.
The SEC accused Cohen, who headed the hedge fund's European office, and Baros, an executive for African-related business, of arranging bribes to enter natural resources transactions and win investments in Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Libya and Niger.
It said the suspect transactions in many cases involved the use of investor money, not Och-Ziff's own capital.
Garaufis said in a 32-page decision that two recent Supreme Court precedents barred the January 2017 lawsuit, which challenged transactions that took place between May 2007 and April 2011.
The judge also said Cohen's agreements to put the statute of limitations on hold for some SEC claims lacked the ""broad language"" that might have averted the case's dismissal.
Och-Ziff's Michael Cohen is not the longtime personal lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump.
The SEC did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment.
Ronald White, a lawyer for Cohen, did not immediately respond to similar requests. Mark Cohen, a lawyer for Baros, also did not immediately respond to such requests.
Och-Ziff in September 2016 reached a $412 million settlement of related U.S. investigations, and its OZ Africa Management unit pleaded guilty to a criminal conspiracy charge.
Chief Executive Daniel Och, a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) trader, agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle an SEC recordkeeping violation charge, without admitting wrongdoing.
Och and Och-Ziff were not defendants in the SEC case against Cohen and Baros.

The case is SEC v Cohen et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 17-00430.

1517,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",European Court dismisses compensation claim in Cyprus 2013 deposit-grab,"ATHENS (Reuters) - An EU court has rejected a petition for compensation by bank depositors whose funds were confiscated in Cyprus's financial crisis in 2013, in a process which would become a European template for banks in trouble.
Depositors in two Cypriot banks lost billions when savings were confiscated to protect the island's banking system in 2013, in a process known as a bail-in. The move was a condition sought by international creditors for a 10 billion euro ($11.62 billion) bailout to the east Mediterranean island.
""The Court concludes that the individuals and companies which initiated the actions have not succeeded in demonstrating an infringement of the right to property, of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations, or of the principle of equal treatment,"" the General Court of the European Union, a division which addresses complaints against EU institutions, said in a news release.
The case was mounted by 51 people who lost funds and were clients of Laiki Bank, now defunct, and Bank of Cyprus. 
While a long line of EU banks were rescued at huge public expense during the 2008-09 financial crisis, the EU excluded Cypriot banks, damaged by their exposure to Greek government bonds, from any aid.
Instead, their clients paid. At Laiki Bank alone, about 3.4 billion euros in deposits were wiped out. This left savers with at most 100,000 euros, the ceiling on deposit insurance under EU regulations.
Bank of Cyprus clients saw a percentage of their deposits exceeding 100,000 euros converted to equity, exchanging the seized funds for shares in the lender. Under a completely revamped management, the bank has since staged a turnaround, attracted new investors and is listed in London.
Both banks had in the past gambled on high-yielding Greek government bonds which blasted holes in their balance sheets when Greece's debt was restructured under another EU/IMF rescue in 2012.

The move follows a newspaper report this month that put the amount laundered at Danske Bank's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 at around $8.3 billion.
MP Pension, which holds shares in Danske Bank worth around 570 million Danish crowns ($89 million) and has 115 billion crowns under asset management, said it has been in dialogue with the bank's top management.
Danske Bank has admitted to flaws in its anti money-laundering controls in Estonia and launched its own investigation into the case. 
It is due to present its own findings in September but Denmark's business minister has said the bank's own investigation might not be enough.
Danske Bank has closed down the concerned non-resident accounts at its Estonian branch and is doing all it can to prevent criminal abuse, it has said.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Investors switch to defensive equities and bonds: BAML,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors switched to defensive equities and bonds in the week to July 11 as the U.S. slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports and then raised the stakes by threatening another round on an extra $200 billion of goods.
Investors worry that a full-blown China-U.S. trade conflict could hurt global exports, investment and growth, and have scrambled to take risk off the table.
Bonds attracted inflows of $5.6 billion -- their biggest inflows in 12 weeks -- data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML) showed on Friday, while defensive equity sectors such as healthcare enjoyed their largest inflows in a year, pulling in some $800 million.
Overall, equity funds attracted some $1.2 billion, with the United States pulling in $4.3 billion, Europe $4.2 billion and Japan $1.9 billion.
Yet BAML noted that 34 MSCI equity indices were down year-to-date, and only 11 were up after a bruising first half for global markets.
Turkish equities are the biggest faller, down 36.7 percent, as investors have grown concerned by the outlook for monetary policy under President Tayyip Erdogan, who has moved quickly to cement his power since winning an election.
Other big losers include Brazilian equities, down 15.3 percent, and South African stocks, down 13.3 percent.
As a whole, emerging equities are down 6.6 percent, toward the bottom of BAML's cross-asset table of winners and losers in dollar terms. Perhaps not surprisingly then, emerging market equity funds suffered redemptions of $1.3 billion in an eighth straight week of outflows.
But emerging market debt funds enjoyed their first inflows in three months, attracting a modest $900 million.
The lion's share of the fixed income flows continued to go to investment grade bond funds, which pulled in $2.3 billion, while high yield bond funds ended their nine-week drought, attracting $500 million.

It estimated a preliminary net loss of 7.0-9.0 billion yuan ($1.05-1.34 billion) in January to June period versus a profit of 2.3 billion yuan the previous year, it said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
ZTE, which makes smartphones and networking gear, signed an agreement with the United States on Thursday that paved the way for it to resume operations after a nearly three-month ban on doing business with American suppliers.
The settlement ZTE reached with the U.S. Commerce Department included a $1 billion penalty and a deposit of $400 million in an escrow account.
""The substantial decrease in results was mainly due to operating losses and provision for losses resulting from the suspension of the major operating activities,"" ZTE said in the exchange filing.
The ban was imposed in April after Commerce Department officials said ZTE made false statements about disciplining 35 employees after it pleaded guilty last year to violating U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran, the Commerce Department said.

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Bosch must hand over e-mails in VW emissions suit: court,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] must hand over e-mails in connection with lawsuits brought by investors against  Porsche  SE (DE:PSHG_p) in connection with the Volkswagen (VW) (DE:VOWG_p) diesel scandal, a Stuttgart regional court ruled on Friday.
Investors in two separate suits claimed that Porsche SE, which controls 52.2 percent of VW's voting rights, had not disclosed the financial risks of VW's emissions scandal quickly enough when it emerged in 2015.
Their lawyers demanded that Bosch provide e-mails concerning its business with VW.
Bosch, which makes an engine control unit used by several top automakers including VW, had protested, saying it had the right to refuse to provide evidence.
The Stuttgart court ruled that Bosch had no such right in this case.
It said the e-mails showed Bosch acted in accordance with the law, which meant it could not argue that it risked incriminating itself by handing them over.
Providing the e-mails would also not risk causing direct financial damage to the company or to anyone to whom it is accountable, it said.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 08:05AM ET</span>","JPMorgan profit beats on better-than-expected trading, loan growth","By Sweta Singh and David Henry
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) quarterly profit topped Wall Street's expectations on Friday, as trading revenue came in much higher than expected and demand for loans increased on the back of a strengthening U.S. economy.
U.S. banks are benefiting from a cut in corporate tax rates, hikes in interest rates and a growing economy that is driving demand from borrowers while holding down loan loss rates.
""We see good global economic growth, particularly in the U.S., where consumer and business sentiment is high,"" Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said.
Overall, the bank's revenue rose 6.5 percent to $28.39 billion and topped the average analyst estimate of $27.36 billion, driven by growth in all four of the bank's businesses.
Shares of the largest U.S. bank by assets were up 1 percent in premarket trading.
JPMorgan's quarterly reports are closely watched for signs about the health of consumers and businesses as the lender plays a major role in several businesses, such as home mortgages, commercial lending and asset management.
Average core loans, which include consumer credit and loans to the biggest corporations, were up 7 percent compared with the year-earlier quarter.
Analysts and economists are watching loan demand at banks for signs of any impact from international trade tariffs on their business and expansion plans.
Investors have also been looking for signs that the corporate tax cuts have given companies new confidence to borrow, a phenomenon that bankers have said might not show up before the second half of the year.
Earlier this week, Dimon was quoted in an Italian newspaper saying that U.S. business executives have warned U.S. President Donald Trump that the impact of trade tariffs on economic growth could offset the benefits of tax cuts.
Trading revenue, which makes up about a fifth of JPMorgan's total revenue, was up 13 percent, compared with a 1 percent gain expected by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Susan Roth Katzke.
In May, the bank's corporate and investment bank chief, Daniel Pinto, said second-quarter markets revenue was likely to be flat compared with a year earlier.
Net interest income rose 10 percent as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates four times since the second quarter of 2017.
Net income rose 18.3 percent to $8.32 billion, or $2.29 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $7.03 billion, or $1.82 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts expected the bank to earn $2.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), the third- and fourth-largest banks by assets, are also set to report results on Friday.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 08:01AM ET</span>",British regulator sets 14 pound floor under Sky shares,"By Ben Martin and Arathy S Nair
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's takeover regulator has decided that  Disney  (N:DIS) must offer 14 pounds a share for Sky (L:SKYB) if it succeeds in buying Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA), in a key ruling in the takeover battle for the broadcaster.
The price set by the Takeover Panel on Friday is the same as Fox's current offer for the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own, which values the London-listed pay television business as a whole at 24.5 billion pounds ($32.2 billion). 
But it is below U.S. giant Comcast's (O:CMCSA) competing 14.75 pounds per share offer for Sky, which has put a 25.9 billion price tag on the business.
The Panel's ruling is important for investors as it sets a new, higher floor price under Sky shares. 
Sky, Fox, Disney and Comcast are locked in a series of interlinked takeover battles, with Fox and Comcast vying for control of Sky and Comcast and Disney battling to buy the bulk of Fox's TV and film assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake. 
The Panel had previously ruled that Disney must make an offer for the rest of Sky if it succeeds in acquiring Fox, including its Sky stake, before either Fox or Comcast have taken full control of the broadcaster.
But the level at which Disney would be required to acquire the rest of Sky has recently been up in the air. 
The Panel said in April Disney should match Fox's first offer for Sky, which was 10.75 pounds a share.
However, Disney last month raised its bid for the Fox assets, including the Sky stake, to $71.3 billion. To ensure all Sky shareholders are treated equally, the Panel hiked the level at which Disney would have to make a mandatory offer for Sky.
The regulator said it had considered ""the relative contribution of Fox's stake in Sky in the valuation work carried out by Disney's financial advisers"" as well's Fox's most recent bid for the broadcaster when arriving at the 14 pounds a share price.
The Panel added it had ""received submissions from a number of parties expressing diverging views"" and that Sky planned to request a review of its decision. 
It comes as the battle between Fox and Comcast for Sky intensifies.
On Wednesday, Fox hiked its bid to 14 pounds a share, trumping a 12.50 pound offer Comcast made earlier this year.
But Comcast struck back later on Wednesday with its 14.75 pound counterbid, which Sky's independent directors recommended to shareholders.
Sky shares were at 15.39 pounds in London on Friday, down 0.4 percent. 
The stock is trading above Comcast's bid amid investor anticipation that Fox will return with a better offer.

After JP Morgan’s positive earnings, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) will follow up with their own reports at approximately 8:00 AM (12:00 GMT).
Q2 earnings growth is tipped to be 20.7% according to Thomson Reuters data, moderating slightly from a gain of 26.6% the first-quarter, which was the highest in seven years when results were boosted by tax-cut tailwinds.
However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits, with analysts likely to scrutinize outlook statements to see whether to adjust numbers for the rest of 2018.
Trade tensions remained in focus although U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that he and the administration are “available” for discussion, but China must first agree to deeper economic reforms.
China's vice foreign minister Zhang Jun said on Friday that the U.S.’s accusations against China on trade were groundless and that Washington's actions are not supported by the international community.
Also in trade news, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to exit the European Union would likely make any type of U.S.-British trade deal unfeasible.
""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" Trump said on Friday in an interview with Sun.

Meanwhile, oil prices headed lower on Friday, extending the weekly decline to more than 4% as investors focused this week on the return of Libyan oil to the market amid concerns about a China-U.S. trade war.
Investors looked ahead to Baker Hughes’ weekly data on U.S. production due out later on Friday. The number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by five to 863 last week.
Although that was the first increase in three weeks, the U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 763 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC's past efforts to cut global output over the past year-and-a-half.
Elsewhere, European shares moved higher nearing midday trade on Friday, and looked set for a second week of gains as fears of a full-blown trade war were kept in check and optimism about the next corporate earnings season grew.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",EU markets watchdog intervenes in share trading ahead of Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's markets watchdog has proposed measures to stop share trading platforms based outside the bloc having an unfair advantage over EU rivals as Britain readies for Brexit.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said on Friday it wanted to make sure that minimum ""tick sizes"" or monetary increments for non-EU shares traded in the European Union are in line with tick sizes in their home market to avoid unfair competition.
Britain is home to the EU's main pan-EU trading platforms like Cboe Europe (O:CBOE) and London Stock Exchange's (L:LSE) Turquoise. Both, however, have applied for EU licences to open EU hubs before the United Kingdom leaves the bloc next March.
ESMA wants to make sure that such hubs and platforms already based in EU countries excluding Britain are not at a disadvantage to trading venues based in London or elsewhere by having to offer less attractive tick sizes.
""The number of third country instruments is likely to increase as a consequence of the UK's withdrawal from the EU,"" ESMA said in its consultation paper on Friday.
""While it remains difficult to accurately assess the number of shares that might become third country instruments post-Brexit, due to current uncertainties, under ESMA's current estimation roughly 18 percent of the shares currently reported into FIRDS have their most liquid trading venue located in the UK.""
FIRDS refers to ESMA's database on shares being traded on authorized platforms.
Currently up to 10,000 financial instruments, including shares, traded in the EU may qualify as third country, meaning their most liquid market is outside the bloc.
""If we considered shares that are currently available for trading not only on a UK trading venue but also in another EU jurisdiction, this represents around 1,900 potentially affected shares.""
""These specific cases where EU trading venues might be subject to minimum tick sizes larger than those applicable on non-EU venues may have the unintended result of putting EU trading venues at a competitive disadvantage,"" ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor said in a statement.
""This might result in scarcer and shallower liquidity being available on EU trading venues which can be detrimental to those trading on those venues. This timely consultation looks to address these cases and contributes to orderly financial markets.""
The public consultation ends in September and ESMA will then send a final proposal to the European Commission, the EU's executive body, for endorsement.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - A hotel in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Friday denied a report that it would charge U.S. guests an extra 25 percent amid an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing.
However, three staff members who declined to be identified told Reuters that a discriminatory rate policy had indeed been posted at the hotel as of Thursday but had since been removed.
The Global Times, a hawkish tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said in a report dated Thursday that the Modern Classic Hotel Group had put up a notice at its hotel informing guests of the extra charge.
It cited a spokesperson at the hotel, surnamed Yang, saying that the hotel had posted the notice last Friday.
""We have no idea where this news came from. My phone has been ringing off the hook all day today,"" Bai Lulu, a front office manager, told Reuters at the hotel.
""We treat all our guests equally. We wouldn’t charge one type of guest more than another type of guest,"" Bai said, adding that the hotel did not currently have any American guests.
However, another staff member, declining to be identified, said there had indeed been notices saying Americans would be charged extra.
""There were ads up yesterday in the restaurant stating Americans would be charged 25 percent extra. We took photos.""
The Global Times had cited a spokesperson for the hotel surnamed Yang as saying their boss was ""really angry about the endless tariffs the U.S. planned to impose on China"".
There has been little public evidence to date of anti-American activity in China as the trade dispute has grown increasingly bitter.
The United States and China each imposed a 25 percent tariff on $34 billion worth of the other's goods on July 6. This week, Washington published a new set of proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of goods from China, further escalating the conflict.
""Chinese public sentiment towards the U.S. is becoming more sensitive"" after Washington's latest tariff threats, the Global Times said in its report.
Several sources have told Reuters that China issued strict guidelines to its media barring personal attacks on U.S. President Donald Trump and limiting open commentary, an apparent attempt to avoid unintentional escalation.
Authorities were also censoring potentially sensitive items on social media such as Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, where trade-related items have been mostly kept off the list of top trending topics.

Official Chinese statements this week have taken a sharper tone, accusing the United States of ""bullying"" and starting the trade war.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 05:21AM ET</span>",Post-Mugabe Zimbabwe set to frustrate eager investors,"By MacDonald Dzirutwe and Joe Brock
HARARE (Reuters) - A European investor's phone rings in a Harare restaurant and it's good news: an $80 million construction deal has been agreed with the Zimbabwean government. All that's needed now is a central bank guarantee letter. It never arrives.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power when Robert Mugabe was removed in a de facto coup last November, has been trying to woo investors ahead of an election on July 30, a contest in which he is the narrow favorite.
Mnangagwa, a 75-year-old former ally of Mugabe, says he has already secured $15 billion of foreign investment, including from foreign multinationals, although these are mostly non-binding commitments, according to analysts from local financial advisory firms who reviewed the agreements.
In May,  General Electric  (N:GE) said it would look at healthcare, power and transport in Zimbabwe, while Coca Cola (O:COKE) said it planned to make the country an export hub for juice and other products, and a source of raw materials. 
Most big companies however are waiting until after the election to make their move although already the atmosphere has changed since the fall of Mugabe, whose nearly four decades in power brought a promising economy to its knees.
Harare taxi drivers say they are hearing more foreign languages in their cabs, businessmen gather around laptops at restaurants, and the often sleepy international airport is buzzing with newcomers.
But, so far, most are leaving frustrated and empty-handed.
""It's like the Wild West,"" the European businessman said, paying his bill in crisp U.S. dollars to the delight of a waiter more used to the dreaded quasi-currency 'bond notes' introduced in November 2016.
After three days rushing between government ministries to get the deal done, the signed contract in his briefcase is useless since it lacks a guarantee from the central bank that he can access the dollars he needs to import equipment.
""Right, I better go deliver the bad news,"" he said, rising to catch a taxi to the airport.
Reuters spoke to more than 20 investors, ranging from multinationals to entrepreneurs, who are interested in entering Zimbabwe for the first time or in expanding their businesses there since Mnangagwa was sworn in.
All expressed optimism about new opportunities in sectors from mining to telecoms, and financial services to construction, after a decade when China was the only big outside investor.

TURN THE NEEDLE
""When these political changes happened, immediately there was positiveness returning to the economy,"" said Adriaan de Lange, managing director at  Omnia  (J:OMNJ), a chemicals firm operating in Zimbabwe.
""The potential exists for Zimbabwe to really turn the needle."" 
But investors also raised concerns about the election and infighting over facilitating investment between factions linked to Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, the army general who led the coup against Mugabe.
The biggest obstacle is the chronic cash shortages that prevent businesses from importing the goods they need or repatriating the profits they hope to make, while portfolio investors can't get their money out of the stock market.
After raging hyperinflation, Zimbabwe abandoned its own currency in 2009 in favor of the U.S. dollar, but a widening trade deficit and lack of foreign investment have led to currency shortages.
For ordinary Zimbabweans this means winter nights sleeping outside banks in the hope of withdrawing the few dollars that are left, sometimes $20 in coins, often nothing.
The crunch wasn't solved by the introduction of the ""bond notes"" which officially trade at parity with the U.S. dollar but have already depreciated to 1.60 to the dollar.
Banking sources say the central bank has a backlog of $600 million in unpaid imports but less than $200 million cash, and the situation is getting worse.
The reserve bank declined to comment for this story.
CASH CRISIS
Hundreds of firms are waiting for the central bank to release their money, banking sources said.
London-listed Fastjet (L:FJET), the low-cost Africa airline backed by easyJet's (L:EZJ) Stelios Haji-Ioannou, said it may go bust if it doesn't recoup some of the $7 million it is owed by the Zimbabwean central bank.
""It's all at risk because of cashflow,"" Chief Commercial Officer Sylvain Bosc told Reuters.
""The demand is there, the opportunities are there. We actually want to expand in Zimbabwe.""
Mnangagwa's team acknowledges the challenges.
""For 37 years we have been living under one man. It doesn't change just like that but we are getting there,"" said presidential advisor Chris Mutsvangwa.
""For investors it is a question of risk and reward.""
The only way to convince foreign lenders and investors to provide the funds needed to end the currency crisis is if a financing program can be agreed with the International Monetary Fund, and that will come with painful terms.
A source at the IMF said in order to get funding Zimbabwe will need to overhaul its public sector, including a crackdown on rampant corruption and mass layoffs, which has led to demonstrations in the past.
A deal to compensate white farmers who were evicted from their land also needs to be reached, the IMF source said.
If the ruling ZANU-PF wins the election, Mnangagwa has said he will strike a deal with the IMF and introduce a new Zimbabwean currency within 3-5 years.
But the leader known as ""The Crocodile"" hasn't shown any signs of prudence yet, handing civil servants a 17.5 percent pay rise in May and passing a 2018 budget with a bigger deficit.
UNCERTAIN ELECTION
Even before the IMF will engage in talks, it will want to see a free and fair election. The opposition protested this week, saying the electoral process was being rigged, with ballot papers being printed without their participation.
Mnangagwa is slightly ahead in opinion polls, which are unreliable, but his challenger, Nelson Chamisa, 40, is gathering momentum and the vote may provide no clear winner, meaning a messy coalition may have to be formed.
Even if Mnangagwa wins, he does not have a firm grip on ZANU-PF, with his powerful deputy Chiwenga intent on imposing his authority after taking a massive risk in leading the coup to oust Mugabe, political and diplomatic sources say.
Middlemen from both camps want to be the gateway for investment and are obstructing deals that don't pass through their offices, making it difficult for businesses to know who they should work with, several investors said.
A party divided with the military on one side and Mnangagwa on the other is not a conducive environment for investment.
""Everyone wants a slice of the pie,"" said the owner of an energy firm who has a deal in limbo due to a dispute between factions aligned to Mnangagwa and Chiwenga.
""They must be careful. The experience 'small boys' like me are having sets the tone for how 'big boys' view the risks.""
Mnangagwa and Chiwenga did not respond to requests for comment.
Whoever wins the election won't have long to take the difficult decisions needed to get Zimbabwe's economy back on track before the public optimism built on the back of Mugabe's removal disappears.
""Do you think this is what I want to do with my life?"" said black market currency trader Charity Kambarami, waving a wad of bond notes in the air.
""I would also love to go to work and get paid at the end of the month but there are no jobs. The politicians have promised a lot. We have suffered enough.""

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 04:52AM ET</span>",Chinese imports to U.S. ports start peaking early amid tariff threat,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Chinese imports to U.S. ports rose more than expected in June, suggesting that some retailers moved up orders to insulate themselves from an intensifying trade war that threatens to send up costs on a growing number of consumer products.
Retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN) face uncertainty due to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods, and the jump in imports from the country was likely because of ""pre-emptive buying in anticipation of the tariffs"", said Ben Hackett, founder of international maritime consultancy Hackett Associates.
""This is a bump that isn't quite normal,"" he said. 
The U.S. container port peak season is traditionally driven by orders for Chinese-made clothing, electronics and toys for the back-to-school season running from June to September, and then the winter holiday season.
The volume of loaded shipping containers from China to all U.S. ports was up 6.3 percent in June from a year earlier after falling 6.9 percent in May and 3.9 percent in April, said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, the busiest U.S. container port and No. 1 hub for ocean trade with China. 
Seroka's data was sourced from IHS Markit's PIERS and analyzed by Port of Los Angeles staff.
Data about specific products and buyers, which is compiled from paperwork filed when goods are delivered, was not immediately available.
China said on Friday exports unexpectedly accelerated in June. The commerce ministry confirmed that Chinese exporters were front-loading shipments to the United States to get ahead of expected tariffs. 
Walmart, Amazon and other retailers declined to comment for this story.
Trump has vowed to reset the United States' global trade agreements, which includes a threat to impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods. Retailers, who place orders for general merchandise up to a year in advance, can offset additional costs by raising prices or finding new suppliers in countries not subject to import levies.
On July 6, the U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, including flash drives, remote controls and thermostats, from a list of $50 billion in products first proposed in April. China quickly fired back with tariffs on an equal value of U.S. goods, including soybeans, whiskey, cotton and automobiles.
Those are unlikely to immediately affect retailers.
The Trump administration raised the stakes in the trade battle on Tuesday with a plan to add 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, including furniture, handbags, pet food, refrigerators, textiles and auto parts. 
That new round could hit during the autumn lead-up to the all-important Christmas and winter holidays. Many products purchased for that season will have arrived at ports well ahead of the imposition of the new levies.
There are some indications that other industries have employed forward buying to avoid tariffs. 
Automakers hailed more ships in May in an apparent scramble to bring vehicles to the United States to pre-empt potential tariff increases. The ports of Baltimore, Jacksonville, Florida; and Brunswick, Georgia - the three leading U.S. ports for importing automobiles - unloaded a combined 23,000 more cars than they did a year earlier, according to port data, port officials and logistics companies.
Michael Binetti, an analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said the latest round of proposed tariffs, if implemented, could catch retailers like Restoration Hardware, Williams-Sonoma (N:WSM), Michael Kors (N:KORS) and Tapestry (N:TPR) in the crosshairs.

In the long run, ""I don't think that the U.S. ports will be any kind of issue,"" Binetti said. ""The boats will be coming in from Vietnam instead of from China in the same volumes.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares opened higher on Friday, and looked set for a second week of gains as fears of a full-blown trade war were kept in check and optimism about the next corporate earnings season grew.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.4 percent by 0824 GMT with a broad range of sectors, from industrials to technology and financials, adding points to the pan-European index. 
Britain's FTSE (FTSE) led European bourses with a 0.7 percent rise as dollar-earning constituents were helped by a sliding pound after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Theresa May's Brexit strategy, saying it had probably killed off hope of a U.S.-British trade deal. 
""Unsurprisingly this was all too much for sterling to handle and cable dropped below 1.32 (dollars),"" said Bart Hordijk, an analyst at Monex Europe. 
Shares in French technology consultancy Altran Technologies (PA:ALTT) tumbled more than 20 percent after the company said it had discovered a case of forged purchase orders within its recently acquired U.S. design and engineering services firm Aricent.
The forgery ""relates to one individual, in his relation with one client"" for an amount of $10 million, Altran said, adding that an investigation into Aricent's internal control procedures had been launched.
British recruitment company  Hays  (L:HAYS) was the best performer with a 5.1 percent rise after saying it expected full-year operating profit to exceed market expectations.
On the other hand, Switzerland's GAM Holding (S:GAMH) fell about 9.1 percent as it said it would take an impairment charge of around 59 million Swiss francs ($59 million) related to its 2016 acquisition of British hedge fund Cantab Capital Partners. 
Still in the financial sector, shares in Norwegian insurance group Gjensidige (OL:GJFS) fell 9.2 pct after its second-quarter results disappointed. 
Belgian telecom companies also suffered as the government considers allowing a fourth mobile phone operator to enter the market.
Telenet (BR:TNET), Proximus (BR:PROX) and Orange Belgium (BR:OBEL) fell 5.2 percent, 2.9 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.

1545,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Exxon Quits Koch-Backed Business Group After Climate Change Row,"(Bloomberg) --  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). quit the American Legislative Exchange Council, a lobbying group bankrolled by fossil fuel companies, following a disagreement over climate-change policy.
The oil giant won’t be renewing its membership after it expired in June, spokesman Scott Silvestri said by phone. Exxon had a public spat with ALEC in December when some members backed by climate skeptics such as the Heartland Institute moved to convince the federal government to drop its claim that climate change is a risk to human health.
Exxon’s departure comes amid a corporate exodus by the likes of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc. departed, largely in response to ALEC’s positions on climate rules, renewable energy and other issues.
Late last year, Exxon was among the companies that objected to a measure debated by ALEC meant to encourage states to prod the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind its Obama-era determination that climate change requires regulation.
“The American Legislative Exchange Council values partnership with Exxon Mobil and stakeholders across the business community,” the group said in an email on Thursday. “We have valued Exxon Mobil’s work and leadership with ALEC on STEM education, among other issues.”

1546,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",U.K. Energy Costs Headed Higher With Plan to Leave Single Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Britain’s paper on leaving the European Union raised more questions for the energy industry than it answered, setting up the risk that the legal arrangements allowing power and gas to flow across borders could come unraveled and drive up the cost of doing business.
The government for the first time raised the possibility of leaving the EU’s single market, though it also said it wants to maintain a trading relationship with neighboring nations. The policy was short on the details needed to reassure utilities like  Centrica  Plc (LON:CNA) and SSE (LON:SSE) Plc that they will have access to energy supplies through three international power cables and three gas pipelines after the U.K. leaves the union in March 2019.
The trading arrangements matter to both sides. The U.K. is Europe’s third-biggest energy user and a net importer of energy, taking in gas valued at more than 10 billions euros ($12 billion) a year. London is also an important trading hub, particularly for gas, hosting one of the biggest exchanges, ICE Futures Europe Ltd.
The U.K.’s negotiating position on energy isn’t yet clear, and the ongoing uncertainty is the biggest risk to markets and investment, according to Andrew Perry, a principal focused on utilities at Oliver Wyman LLC in London. Britain has 11 new electricity interconnectors to Europe planned, and investment in these could be at risk.
Trade Barriers
There’s a risk “either the arrangements we have post-Brexit become barriers to interconnectors working efficiently, or there’s so much uncertainty about the rules that investment doesn’t happen because people are so unsure about what’s going to happen,” he said.
It’s a bad time to have investors uncertain about whether British projects will pay off. The government has estimated it needs to find 100 billion pounds ($132 billion) to keep the lights on after 2020. More than a dozen aging power plants are due to drop out of service within the next decade. Governments from both of the main political parties have sought encouraged companies to invest in a new generation of atomic plants.
If the uncertainty coming from Prime Minister Theresa May’s government over Brexit is unpalatable, the alternative of a government led by Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party isn’t any better for utilities. Corbyn has talked about nationalizing parts of the utility industry. May’s ministers are seeking to limit the amount utilities can charge customers at a time when the cost of gas, coal and electricity all are rising in wholesale markets across Europe.
Brexit’s biggest impact may be on the natural gas industry. While only a small proportion of the U.K.’s electricity is imported, more than half of its gas supply comes from abroad. The industry is asking how the rules for trading will shape up after Brexit and whether taking flows from these connections will be more cumbersome in the future.
Read how energy costs could rise here
Utilities buy and sell power, gas and permits to emit carbon dioxide from smokestacks years in advance, and investment is made decades ahead. Another concern will be additional costs for energy trading that could occur by being outside the internal market.
“If you’re thinking of buying and selling power and gas two years out, companies don’t have a firm view of what the rules will look like,” said Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “The instinct will be to play safe, not innovate and companies may end up paying more to play it safe.”
None of these concerns have been resolved by the government’s white paper published Thursday.
“It tells industry there’s still no answer,” Alex Harrison, energy partner at Hogan Lovells International LLP said. It’s not clear how much thinking has been done on our side.”
Most analysts seem to agree that energy trading arrangements will be easier to agree on than other aspects of the Brexit negotiations as they benefit both sides. The main worry still remains that energy gets dragged down by bigger political sticking points or isn’t properly considered in a no deal scenario.
“I find it hard to envisage a set of circumstances where the relationship is going to get so bad that both sides would accept energy supply disruptions rather than come to some kind of agreement,” said Neil Cornelius managing director at the Berkeley Research Group LLC. “The high level objective is clear and consistent -- a high level of harmonization between the U.K. energy sector and EU energy sector.”

""We are already working on that within the organization and will present the results late November,"" Handelsblatt daily quoted Baete as saying in an interview published on Friday.
Allianz, however, will not follow some rivals such as Italy's Generali (MI:GASI) that have sold off German life insurance policies as they struggle to pay guaranteed returns to clients because of record-low interest rates. 
""We always said that we will try not to do that globally, and for Germany we categorically rule it out,"" Baete told Handelsblatt.
Under the new strategy, the group would aim to achieve customer satisfaction ratings above market average or ahead of rivals across its businesses, he said. 
""If Uber or JD.com consider with whom they want to work, they should say: Ideally with Allianz,"" he said, without providing further details.
Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com (O:JD) earlier this year bought a 33 percent stake in Allianz's China unit as part of an agreement to develop a digital insurance joint venture in China.
Asked how many jobs at Allianz would survive the group's push for automation and digitalization, Baete said he could not guarantee any jobs, including his own.
""But we can try to foster employability. We need to invest more in our employees' training,"" he said.

Paris had singled out key areas where it expected either exemptions or extended wind-down periods for French companies, including energy, banking, pharmaceuticals and automotive.
French officials had expressed little hope for securing the waivers, which were critical for oil and gas major  Total  (PA:TOTF) to continue a multi-billion-dollar gas project in Iran and for carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) to pursue its joint venture.
""We have just received Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's response: it's negative,"" Le Maire told Le Figaro in an interview published on Friday.
Le Maire said Europe needed to react quickly and protect its economic sovereignty.
""Europe must provide itself with the tools it needs to defend itself against extra-territorial sanctions,"" Le Maire added.
Washington announced in May it was imposing new economic penalties on Tehran after pulling out of a multilateral 2015 agreement, under which Tehran had agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief.
Trump's sanctions are aimed at pressuring Iran to negotiate a new agreement to halt its nuclear programs that might include Tehran's regional activities and ballistics development. In particular, Washington wants to curtail the oil exports that are key to Iran's economic revival. 
Earlier this month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani appeared to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from its neighbors if Washington pressed ahead with trying to force countries to stop buying Iranian oil.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian shares extended their recovery on Friday, as investors shifted their focus to bullish expectations for Wall Street earnings and as a weaker yen supported Japanese stocks, though Sino-U.S. trade tensions have tempered exuberance.
Keeping trade squarely in view was Chinese trade data, which showed its trade surplus with the United States swelling to a record in June, a result that could further inflame a bitter trade dispute with Washington.
Financial spreadbetters expect European stocks to rise, with London's FTSE (FTSE) set to open up 41 points, Frankfurt's DAX (GDAXI) up 57 points and Paris' CAC (FCHI) up 25 points.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was up 0.6 percent, adding to a 0.6 percent rise on Thursday, after U.S. stocks ended the day higher.
Analysts are forecasting that S&P 500 companies' earnings grew about 21 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at Axi Trader in Sydney, said that a good earnings season could nevertheless bring with it some ""troubling outlooks.""
""If you recall what happened when the CFO of  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) said last earnings season that Q1 was likely to be the high water mark. All we need is somebody with serious exposure to the global economy to do something similar and we're talking about the downside again for stocks, not the upside,"" he said.
However, fears over the impact of an escalating U.S.-China trade war continued to cloud the outlook as investors braced for the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs, with one of China's main indexes lower.
China's overall global export growth topped expectations, however, possibly as its exporters and big American customers rushed to beat U.S. tariffs.
The MSCI index rose on gains in Taiwan shares (TWII), which rose 1.2 percent, Seoul's Kospi (KS11), which added 1 percent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI), which was 0.4 percent higher.
Australian shares (AXJO) were flat after adding 0.8 percent on Thursday. 
Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) was 1.9 percent higher. The index hit a two-and-a-half-week high Friday supported by weakness in the yen, and as index-heavy stock Fast Retailing (T:9983) jumped after posting strong third-quarter results.
In China, the blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) was up 0.3 percent after dipping into the red, and the Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) was 0.3 percent lower. There was little immediate reaction in Chinese markets to the trade data.
Shares in Asia have been see-sawing as investors ponder the impact of Washington's planned 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports.
The U.S. slapped import tariffs of 25 percent on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6, prompting a matching response from China.
While China has vowed to retaliate to the new tariffs, the lack of a specific response to date has sparked global relief, helped by expectations of strong corporate earnings.
On Friday, S&P500 e-mini futures (ESc1) rose to a five-month high on expectations of solid earnings growth among U.S. firms despite the trade war threat.
RENEWED TALKS?
Offering some reassurance to investors spooked by trade war concerns, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that the U.S. and China could reopen trade talks, but only if Beijing was willing ""to make serious efforts to make structural changes.""
""Some have suggested that Chinese officials are easing back their rhetoric with the intention of going back to the negotiation table, perhaps in light of increased concerns about economic impacts,"" ANZ analysts wrote in a note on Friday.

China’s export rose more than expected in June, although the country’s export outlook is being clouded by the recent trade dispute with the United States, as both countries slapping tit-for-tat duties on each other's goods last Friday. 
China posted a trade surplus of $41.61 billion for the month, customs data showed on Friday, compared to the general consensus of $27.61 billion. 
For the first half of this year, exports rose 12.8% from the same period in 2017, and imports rose 19.9%, data showed. 
Meanwhile, markets continued to digest the latest trade development as China's vice foreign minister Zhang Jun said on Friday that the U.S.’s accusations against China on trade were groundless and that Washington's actions are not supported by the international community. 
His comments came after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that he and the administration are “available” for discussion, but China must first agree to deeper economic reforms. 
“To the extent that China wants to make structural changes, I and the administration are available,” Mnuchin said on Thursday. “We are not advocating tariffs. We are advocating fair trade.” 
China’s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen also said on Thursday “when we have a trade problem, we should talk about it.” 
China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.3% lower, while the Shenzhen Component and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index both rose 0.4%. 
An article published by state-owned Chinese paper Global Times received some focus on Thursday as it claimed Chinese tourists are ""reluctant to visit"" the United States following recent trade dispute between the two countries. 
Citing data from Mafengwo, a local trip-planning site, Global Times reported that interest in travel to major American travel destinations such as Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Las Vegas has decreased in the first six months of 2018 as ""interest in traveling to the U.S. has withered as peak vacation season approaches.” 
The newspaper further noted that the switch to other destinations ""could hurt"" key sectors of the U.S. economy that rely on tourism. 
Overall, nearly 3 million Chinese tourists visit the U.S. annually and spending has topped $30 billion in recent years. 
In other news, Donald Trump warned U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s plans for a soft Brexit would affect trade deal with the U.S. “in a negative way.” 
“If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the U.K., so it will probably kill the deal,” Trump said in an interview in the Sun newspaper to be published Friday.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Silicon Valley employees flex newfound political muscles,"By Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Employees at several of the world’s biggest technology companies have been exercising newfound political power where they work, pushing their bosses on business ethics with help from established and fledgling nonprofit groups.
Most of the highly paid professional workers at Alphabet Inc’s (O:GOOGL) Google,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and other tech companies have little experience with labor unions, and many have avoided other civil movements. But several organizations such as Tech Workers Coalition and coworker.org are helping techies learn new skills like building consensus across workgroups, drafting effective petitions and protecting themselves under labor law.
More established groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are also growing more active in Silicon Valley, engaging companies on more topics and helping workers who want to raise issues with management.   
Political concern grew following the 2016 presidential campaign. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in April before the U.S. Congress about concerns ranging from lack of data protection to Russian agents using Facebook to influence U.S. elections. Recently, activism among Silicon Valley employees has accelerated. 
Last month, workers and rights groups persuaded Google not to renew a contract to supply artificial intelligence tools to help the Pentagon analyze footage from drone aircraft. More than 4,000 employees signed the petition which argued that the project could lead to more automated killing.
“We have all this power, and we’re learning to recognize that and apply it, because we are the ones actually building stuff,” said coalition member Tyler Breisacher, who helped spread word on issues within Google before joining a smaller company in May.
In what has become a regular ritual, more than 50 tech workers shared an evening meeting last week in San Francisco’s Mission District. Attendees said they traded stories about accomplishments and tips on sounding out potentially sympathetic coworkers while reducing the risk of termination.
The event was one of a series in the tech hubs of San Francisco and Seattle held by volunteers in the loosely structured Tech Workers Coalition. Formed in 2015, its membership has surged since the 2016 election.
“We have a broad network of community groups, unions, and non-profits that we collaborate with, but the best education comes from other workers and their past struggles,” the coalition wrote in response to emailed questions. Another relative newcomer, coworker.org, coaches on campaign strategy and media relations.
After the petition drive, Google employees are debating whether, when and how to go public in the future. Many said they would rather be heard internally, earlier in the product cycle.
As Google engineer and activist Liz Fong-Jones put it in a recent talk to software developers: “Ethics crises are a process failure.”
While Google has always prided itself on an open and freewheeling corporate culture, activism is newer to other big tech employers. 
AMAZON AND MICROSOFT
Amazon employees wrote a letter protesting the company’s sale of facial-recognition technology to law enforcement agencies, noting the software can make errors and infringe on privacy and due process rights.
At Microsoft, more than 300 workers complained about contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency that had been separating families on the U.S.-Mexico border and rounding up longtime residents for deportation.
Longtime activists said they sense a golden opportunity with Silicon Valley employees who often had more experience as the subject of protests. San Francisco residents, for instance, have frequently thrown rocks at company buses they viewed as symbols of gentrification driving out longtime city dwellers.
Activists said tech executives who provide those buses, along with massages and gourmet chefs to workers, are eager not to alienate those same employees with company policies.
“If the morale goes down the tubes and the employee base is not with you, you are going to have a tough time,” said Lynn Fox, spokeswoman for the nonprofit Center for Humane Technology, begun by former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris.
ELECTION WAS A CATALYST 
Many liberal-leaning tech employees became more politically active out of concern that Facebook, Alphabet’s YouTube and Twitter had helped elect U.S. President Donald Trump, if only through inaction over incendiary posts and gamed algorithms. Others are growing more concerned about industry issues such as addictive products.
Meanwhile, activists with human rights groups said they are frustrated at fruitless efforts to influence Washington. They are going directly to Silicon Valley with campaigns involving issues such as social media and artificial intelligence.
“It is more important than ever that technologists, engineers and leadership of tech companies incorporate a human rights-based approach into the design of their products,” said Scott Campbell, a staffer for the U.N.'s permanent human rights office.
Campbell moved to California in hopes of setting up a permanent outpost there. Amnesty International started an area branch in November, and Human Rights Watch opened a Silicon Valley office in 2016.
In February, Amnesty convened a session about the implications of artificial intelligence, with engineers and policy experts from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and  IBM  Corp (N:IBM). The result was the Toronto Declaration, which says companies need to make sure that machine learning does not extend discrimination.
The statement was formally released at a May conference in Toronto run by digital rights group Access Now. Advance participation by engineers helped keep the language practical and improves the odds their companies will sign, people familiar with the process said.
The interplay among internal pressure and outside pressure is complex, activists said. For instance, top executives who want to take an ethical stand may find it more convenient to have employees take the lead, said Patrick Ball, director of research at Human Rights Data Analysis Group and adviser to many larger rights groups.
He explained that executives at publicly traded corporations ""can’t do anything that takes them away from an obvious sale without an obviously countervailing force” such as employees leaving or public embarrassment.

Caldera's complaint, filed in the New York Supreme Court, alleges that Apollo pursued a campaign of ""systematic defamation and interference,"" including ""disparaging the company in the marketplace.""
Caldera is also asking for at least $1.5 billion in damages, according to the filing.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 09:27PM ET</span>",Justice Department to appeal approval of AT&T acquisition of Time Warner,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday it would appeal a federal judge's approval of AT&T Inc's (N:T) $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, raising the prospect barely a month after the deal closed that it could be undone.
AT&T was sued by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds, saying that the deal would harm consumers, but U.S. District Judge Richard Leon last month approved the deal, allowing it to move forward following a lengthy trial. The merger, first announced in October 2016, was also opposed by President Donald Trump. 
Leon ruled that the tie-up between AT&T's wireless and satellite businesses with Time Warner's movies and television shows was legal under antitrust law.
AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told reporters on Thursday at a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, that the company was not surprised about the Justice Department's decision to appeal.
""They have the right to appeal. Everyone has the right to appeal. We have a very fact-based thoughtful order. It will be evaluated on those grounds,"" he said.
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.
The Justice Department opted in June not to seek an immediate stay of the court's approval of the merger, allowing the deal to close on June 14. The Justice Department still had 60 days, however, to appeal the decision approving the merger. 
The government's notice of appeal filed in U.S. District Court in Washington did not disclose on what grounds it intends to challenge the approval.
Michael Carrier, an antitrust expert at Rutgers University, said the Justice Department could challenge Leon's analysis of the facts of the case, the economic arguments given or what Carrier described as an apparent pro-defendant approach by the judge. 
Leon had sharply urged the Justice Department not to seek a stay of his ruling, saying it would be ""manifestly unjust"" to do so and not likely to succeed. In his ruling, he said the government had failed to show competitive harm. 
AT&T told the Justice Department in a June 14 letter that it would manage Time Warner's Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit and take other steps until February 2019 or until any government appeal. 
AT&T also said that in the short term, it would have no role in setting Turner prices and the number of Turner employees and target compensation and benefits would remain ""largely unchanged."" AT&T also said it would implement a firewall between Turner and AT&T to prevent the exchange of sensitive information of unaffiliated programmers or distributors.
In 2016, the Justice Department had demanded that AT&T sell the Turner networks, which include CNN, as part of approving the merger.
John Bergmayer, senior counsel at advocacy group Public Knowledge, said that since the deal was approved, AT&T had raised prices for some video and wireless services.
""The AT&T-Time Warner transaction is a bad deal for consumers and competition,"" he said. ""Judge Leon's decision contained numerous errors, and we believe the DOJ's position should be vindicated.""
Deals approved by a federal judge have been undone on appeal in the past. 

In 2001, H.J. Heinz Co called off its acquisition of Beech-Nut after an appeals court overturned a lower court's decision to allow the merger. The Federal Trade Commission had argued the deal would have merged the No. 2 and No. 3 baby food makers and that competition would be ""lessened substantially"" if it were to go forward.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) policy change on Thursday to increase the service's credibility cost its 100 most popular users about 2 percent of their followers, on average, according to social media data firm Keyhole.
Twitter is no longer counting as followers any accounts that have been locked because of suspected fraud, Chief Executive Jack Dorsey posted on Thursday. Locked accounts had already been kept out of Twitter's daily and monthly active user figures. 
The accounts are locked if Twitter detects unusual behavior such as a burst of activity after months of dormancy.
The new policy could be substantial for some Twitter users because follower totals serve as a top selling point when celebrities and so-called social media influencers negotiate deals with advertisers. For other users, follower counts are a point of pride.
As the change went into effect, Twitter's ""@Twitter"" account lost 12.4 percent of its followers compared with Wednesday, the steepest drop among the top 100 accounts by followers, according to Keyhole data. 
Tech executive Elon Musk saw the smallest dip, 0.3 percent, or about 71,000 followers. The median decline in the top 100 was about 734,000 followers, according to the data. Twitter said its service-wide average drop was expected to be four followers.
Twitter declined to provide additional data. Keyhole specializes in capturing data from Twitter and Instagram and selling reports to businesses.
Pop music artist Katy Perry, whose account is the most followed, lost more than 2.8 million followers on Thursday, a 2.6 percent fall from the day earlier. Other musical artists in the top 100, including Pink, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears and Eminem, all saw drops of more than 3 percent. 

Financial analysts have applauded Twitter's efforts to better limit misuse, saying that it could pay off with greater usage long term.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 08:00PM ET</span>",Jury orders J&J to pay $4.7 billion in Missouri asbestos cancer case,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A Missouri jury on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) to pay a record $4.69 billion to 22 women who alleged the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer.
The verdict is the largest J&J has faced to date over allegations that its talc-based products cause cancer. 
The company is battling some 9,000 talc cases. J&J denies both that its talc products cause cancer and that they ever contained asbestos. It says decades of studies show its talc to be safe and has successfully overturned previous talc verdicts on technical legal grounds. 
Thursday's massive verdict, handed down in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, was comprised of $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network. 
J&J in a statement called the trial ""fundamentally unfair"" and said it would appeal the decision. 
J&J shares fell $1.31, or 1 percent, to $126.45 in after-hours trading following the punitive damages award. They had risen $1.52 during regular trading.
The jury's decision followed more than five weeks of testimony by nearly a dozen experts on both sides. 
The women and their families said decades-long use of Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products caused their diseases. They allege the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since at least the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks.
""Johnson & Johnson is deeply disappointed in the verdict, which was the product of a fundamentally unfair process,"" the company said in a statement. The company said it remained confident that its products do not contain asbestos or cause cancer.
""Every verdict against Johnson & Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed and the multiple errors present in this trial were worse than those in the prior trials which have been reversed,"" J&J added, saying that it would pursue all available appellate remedies.
J&J has successfully overturned talc verdicts in the past, with appeals courts pointing to a 2017 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that limits where personal injury lawsuits can be filed. 
Of the 22 women in the St. Louis trial, 17 were from outside Missouri, a state generally regarded as friendly towards plaintiffs. The practice of combining plaintiffs in such jurisdictions, commonly criticized as ""forum shopping"" by defendants, will be challenged on appeal.
Mark Lanier, the lawyer for the women, in a statement following the verdict called on J&J to pull its talc products from the market ""before causing further anguish, harm, and death from a terrible disease.""
""If J&J insists on continuing to sell talc, they should mark it with a serious warning,"" Lanier said.
The majority of the lawsuits that J&J faces involve claims that talc itself caused ovarian cancer, but a smaller number of cases allege that contaminated talc caused mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure.
The cases that went to trial in St. Louis effectively combine those claims by alleging asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer.
Previous talc trials have produced verdicts as large as $417 million. But that 2017 verdict by a California jury, as well as other verdicts in Missouri, was overturned on appeal, and challenges to at least another five verdicts are pending.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioned a study of various talc samples from 2009 to 2010, including of J&J's Baby Powder. No asbestos was found in any of the talc samples, the agency said. 
But Lanier during the trial told jurors that the agency and other laboratories and J&J have used flawed testing methods that did not allow for the proper detection of asbestos fibers.
Talc, the world's softest rock, is a mineral closely linked to asbestos and the two substances can appear in close proximity in the earth. 

Plaintiffs claim the two can become intermingled in the mining process, making it impossible to remove the carcinogenic substance. J&J denies those allegations, saying rigorous testing and purification processes ensure its talc is clean.

Trade Turmoil
China has vowed to fight back against the Trump administration’s plans to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods, albeit with a subtle shift in tone and talks may still be on the table. American steaks, and German cars are among the early victims, while the escalating tensions are worrying some Wall Street economists, who are calculating the potential hit to growth, and hurting the confidence of investors in the euro area. On Thursday alone, China warned that new tariffs could lead to global economic recession, and the European Commission said the tensions pose significant downside risk to growth.

Meanwhile, a multi-colored graphic that’s made the rounds at the Federal Reserve hints that Jerome Powell could have to deal with faster inflation if President Donald Trump succeeds in throwing globalization into reverse.
The Bank of England, which is expected to hike next month, got good news as data suggested growth was rebounding, although politics may still derail its plans. Whatever happens, Governor Mark Carney’s communication will be back under the microscope. Elsewhere in central banking, Malaysia, Poland and Serbia kept rates unchanged, Ukraine tightened policy and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said his inflation goal is within reach. And in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan moved to cement his control over the economy, claiming the exclusive power to appoint central bank rate-setters.

Labor Market Moves
Job-market news was rosy in the U.S. this week, with Americans quitting like never before as they’re feeling quite good about prospects in new gigs. The tighter labor market in Japan is finally pushing up worker wages. Expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia are leaving their work in hordes, but for roles beyond the borders. More than 18,500 civil servants lost their jobs in Turkey on charges of security violations. And France is talking a big game about leading in the global skills war.

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 07:05PM ET</span>","Iowa, Illinois investigating infections linked to McDonald's salad","(Reuters) - The Iowa and Illinois health departments said on Thursday that they were investigating cyclospora infections linked to salads at McDonald Corp's (N:MCD) restaurants.
McDonald's shares fell 1.4 percent after-hours on Thursday.
The Illinois Department of Public Health said it had seen about 90 cases, and the Iowa Department of Public Health said it had recorded 15 cases. 
In about one-fourth of the Illinois cases people reported eating salads from McDonald's in the days before they became ill. 
McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant chain, said in a statement that it had been in contact with public health authorities in both states. 
It said that it had voluntarily stopped selling salads at the approximately 3,000 affected U.S. restaurants until it could switch to another lettuce blend supplier. 
""We are closely monitoring this situation and cooperating with state and federal public health authorities as they further investigate,"" the company said.
The parasite, cyclospora cayetanensis, infects the small intestine, typically causing watery diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive bowel movements. It is spread by ingesting food or water contaminated with feces and not directly from one person to another. 

Several outbreaks have occurred in the United States in the past several years, especially during the summer months, that had been linked to imported fresh produce including raspberries, basil, snow peas, and lettuce.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 06:22PM ET</span>","EU, Mexico, Volkswagen among those to testify at U.S. import tariff hearing","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union, Japan, Canada, Mexico, along with automotive trade groups, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), and the United Auto Workers union are among those scheduled to testify at a July 19 hearing on the Trump administration's investigation into whether imported autos and parts pose a national security threat, according to a document seen Thursday by Reuters.
The U.S. Commerce Department in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose a 20 or 25 percent import tariff on vehicles and parts.
Last month, two major U.S. auto trade groups warned that tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs in auto manufacturing, dramatically raise prices on vehicles, and threaten industry investment on self-driving cars. Major automakers have also filed comments warning of job losses and lost sales.
At a July 19 hearing, those two groups, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and Association of Global Automakers, will testify, as will the National Automobile Dealers Association, National Association of Manufacturers, Motors & Equipment Manufacturers Association and groups representing German and Japanese automakers, according to a draft agenda not yet made public.
A Commerce Department spokeswoman declined to comment.
Among those testifying are Canada, the EU, Mexico, and South Africa's ambassadors to the United States, along with other government officials from Korea, Malaysia, Taipei, Turkey as well as the China Chamber of International Commerce. Executives from Volkswagen,  Polaris Industries  Inc (N:PII),  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570), auto parts firm Jtekt Corp (T:6473) and Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd (T:5110). 
Some aides have said that Trump is pursuing the national security probe to put pressure on Canada and Mexico to agree to concessions in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Commerce Department had initially planned two days of hearings but now will hear testimony for one day.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in June he aimed to wrap up the probe into whether imported vehicles represent a national security threat by late July or August.
Ross said in May ""there is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry."" He asked for comments on ""domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements.""
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted U.S. auto production has doubled over the past decade, and said tariffs ""would deal a staggering blow to the very industry it purports to protect and would threaten to ignite a global trade war.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Thursday as top technology names hit record highs and industrials rebounded from losses driven by trade worries the day before.
Helping the move in tech, CA Inc (NASDAQ:CA) jumped 18.7 percent and was the biggest percentage gainer in the S&P 500 after chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced a surprise $18.9-billion deal to buy the business software company. Broadcom slumped 13.7 percent.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit all-time highs and, along with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), drove gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
The technology index rose 1.8 percent, the day's best-performing sector, and the group is now leading year-to-date gains among sectors. The S&P industrials index rose 1.1 percent. Health care also gained about 1.1 percent.
Helping the tech sector is the view that those companies may be more immune to problems in the trade dispute, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
But also, she said, ""The consensus is that negotiations will resume and there will be some sort of agreement between the U.S. and China. It could be naive, but that seems to be an emerging consensus within the market.""
The United States late Tuesday threatened to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China said on Thursday the two countries have not been in touch about restarting talks and while it does not want a trade war, it would fight if necessary.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), among the hardest hit by the trade dispute, rose more than 1 percent each on Thursday, boosting the Dow.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 224.44 points, or 0.91 percent, to 24,924.89, the S&P 500 gained 24.27 points, or 0.87 percent, to 2,798.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.31 points, or 1.39 percent, to 7,823.92.
The stock market value of Microsoft, which jumped 2.2 percent to $104.19, also rose above $800 billion for the first time, joining Apple, Amazon and Alphabet in that $800 billion club and putting it in line as a contender to be the first U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market cap. 
Earnings will take center stage Friday, when some big Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), report results. S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post second-quarter profit growth of around 21 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) rose 1.8 percent, and lifted other airline stocks, after the carrier's quarterly profit topped estimates on higher average fares.
In a sign that labor market conditions remained robust in early July, weekly jobless claims hit a two-month low last week, the Labor Department said.
The consumer price index barely rose in June, but the underlying trend continued to point to a steady buildup of inflation pressure that could keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradual interest rate increases.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.75-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 101 new highs and 43 new lows. 
About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.9 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>","A decade on, pre-crisis mortgages linger for big banks, homeowners","By Elizabeth Dilts
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A decade on big U.S. banks are still running down and selling off crisis-era mortgages, a process executives point to as weighing on loan growth.
Eager to see a turning point in loan books, analysts count these portfolios as one factor, along with home equity loan runoff and new mortgage demand, to watch for when deciphering the true loan growth picture as U.S. second-quarter bank earnings start on Friday.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executives have flagged portfolios from prior to the 2008-2009 crisis era where banks are no longer originating similar new products when they are asked to predict a turning point in consumer loans.
""These are portfolios of a bygone era that were very, very painful for the banks,"" said Gerard Cassidy, bank analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ""They are not plain vanilla portfolios, which means they are more costly to manage. It may just not be worth the headache.""
Analysts have said higher loan growth is critical to driving bank's stock prices, but they anticipate only a modest acceleration year over year, driven primarily by commercial and industrial loans, not residential.
""Remember that there's a portion of that book that, again, is pre-crisis,"" Chief Executive Tim Sloan said about Wells Fargo's mortgage book at a May conference. He added the bank continues to examine the older portfolio's risk-return tradeoff and sells assets when the opportunity arises, factors ""that could have some impact"" on growth.
Wells Fargo owns around $23 billion of ""Pick-A-Pay loans it picked up by buying the floundering Wachovia bank at the height of the mortgage crisis, versus $115 billion 10 years ago. Those loans allowed borrowers to initially choose their monthly mortgage payment, even if it was not enough to reduce the debt. 
Bank of America at the end of 2017 had nearly $11 billion in credit-impaired mortgages left from buying Countrywide Financial, less than one-third of what it held at the end of 2009. 
""We're still running off some portfolios, believe it or not, 10 years after the crisis,"" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in April when asked about overall loan growth not picking up after the U.S. tax cuts passed by Congress late last year, noting 5 percent growth in core lending outpaced U.S. economic growth. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) still owns roughly $30.5 billion-worth of the $89 billion in bad loans took on from Washington Mutual in 2008. 
The pre-crisis loans do weigh somewhat, but the portfolios' small size mitigates the overall earnings impact, said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl.
""It's a runoff portfolio so there is some drag to growth,"" he said. 
Most of these mortgages may not be in foreclosure or delinquency. Bank of America said 88 percent of unpaid principal on Countrywide loans was current at end-2017. Runoff or sales can also take a small bite from revenue if the loans are higher yielding than the broader loan portfolio. 
SLOW MODIFICATIONS 
Some individual borrowers are still struggling to turn the page a decade later. 
The Mortgage Bankers Association said that of the 39 million outstanding U.S. mortgages it tracks, about 1.2 million are seriously delinquent loans issued in 2007 or earlier. The loans have not been paid in at least three months, and many are in foreclosure.
Charlena and Keith Kendrick said they recently filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy to avoid foreclosure on their suburban Indianapolis, Indiana home. They started struggling to pay their Wells Fargo Pick-a-Pay mortgage in 2012, Charlena Kendrick said. By this May, they owed around $100,000 on their mortgage and were behind $11,000 on monthly payments when they say the bank declined their fourth modification request. ""I feel like this bad paper to them,"" she said. ""I feel like they really just want to get rid of it."" Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said that the bank works ""hard to help customers avoid foreclosure."" Since 2009, Wells Fargo has forgiven $9 billion of mortgage principal, including $6 billion of Pick-a-Pay loans.

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Column: Beyond GE - U.S. workers own too much company stock in retirement plans,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The decision marked the end of an era: last month, the keepers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average removed  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, one of the original stocks included in the index when it was created in 1896.
The once-mighty GE had become the sixth-smallest member of the 30-component Dow by market value and carried the index’s lowest stock price.
The move by S&P Dow Jones Indices reflected the decline of an American industrial icon. But the company’s plunging stock highlights a problem that refuses to go away: too much concentration of employer stock in workplace retirement plans.
More than one-third of GE 401(k) plan assets were held in the company’s own shares in 2016, federal filings show.
Just 15 years ago, GE was the world’s most valuable public company. But it has struggled in several of its key industrial markets and suffered losses in the financial services business during the global financial meltdown of 2008.
GE stock has fallen nearly 80 percent from highs in 2000, serving up a reminder of the risk of holding your employer’s stock in a retirement account.
Changes in federal law have encouraged retirement plans to move away from company stock ownership, and a spate of lawsuits also have helped convince many plan sponsors to reduce or eliminate the practice.
Data from Vanguard points to an encouraging trend. In 2017, among all account-holders in defined contribution plans administered by the mutual fund giant, 90 percent had no investments in their employer’s shares, either because it was not offered (76 percent) or they chose not to invest in it (14 percent). Five percent had holdings ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent of their plan assets, and 5 percent had concentrated employee stock positions exceeding 20 percent. The industries still most likely to offer company stock were agriculture/mining and construction (13 percent offered), Vanguard data shows. 
THE ENRON EFFECT
The GE story belies a sharp improvement in diversification by many 401(k) plans over the past decade. As recently as 2007, nearly 25 percent of Vanguard-administered plans had employer stock concentration levels higher than 20 percent.
The more recent improvement stems in part from the spectacular 2001 collapse of Enron Corp, which blew away the life savings of thousands of employees holding the company’s stock. The ensuing Pension Protection Act of 2006 required defined contribution plan sponsors to allow participants to diversify holdings away from employer shares, and to notify them of their rights in this area. 
Most experts say employee retirement portfolios should not hold more than 10 or 15 percent of their employer’s stock.
""Since Enron, many employers have decided this isn’t a good thing for employees - that’s the good news,” said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, who recently reviewed federal filings of large retirement plans. (https://brook.gs/2m5dwUv)
“Unfortunately, quite a few companies have continued to not only allow this but essentially encourage it, because they make matching contributions with their own stock as a way to conserve cash,” he said. (GE employees are not required to take matching contributions in company stock, a GE spokeswoman said.)
Pozen has no problem with employee stock ownership outside a retirement plan, or stock options. But most employees should hold broadly diversified retirement portfolios, he said. Morningstar research has found that the stock of companies with high allocations of their own stock in a 401(k) plan tended to underperform their peers on a relative performance and risk-adjusted basis.
    Moreover, Vanguard research shows that concentrated stock positions tend to displace investments in diversified equity funds and other balanced funds. Overall equity allocations also tend to be higher.
Another problem is exposing workers to the double risk of potentially losing not only their savings but their jobs. And the GE story underscores the false sense of comfort that can arise among employee investors.
""Companies like GE have done very well over many decades, but there are very few that do really well over 30 or 40 years,""  Pozen said.
I asked GE if it has policies or programs in place encouraging diversification. Mary Kate Nevin, manager of financial and executive communications, pointed to language in an employee benefits handbook warning against the risk of having any more than 20 percent of retirement savings in any single company stock, or industry. She also noted that the 401(k) program held more than 250 education sessions with workers last year that also included messages about the importance of diversification. 
Pozen thinks more will be required. He argues U.S. Congress should take steps to reduce or eliminate this risk by limiting holdings of employer stock to 10 percent of plan assets - the same legal limit that defined benefit plans must follow in their investment portfolios.
“You could grandfather existing programs, and tell them that they can no longer increase the percentage of their own stock in the plan,” he said. “It wouldn’t be a dramatic thing, and it would be very positive for plan participants.”

1575,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Bank Earnings Will Dominate Early Headlines
It’s almost the middle of the month, but Friday will be when earnings season really gets underway with major banks reporting before the bell.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are all scheduled to issue numbers.
Analysts expect Citi to earn $1.57 a share on revenue of about $18.5 billion. JP Morgan is forecast to post $2.22 a share in earnings on revenue of about $27.5 billion. And Wells Fargo is expected to report a profit of $1.12 a share on revenue of about $21.7 billion.
Along with the headline numbers, investors will be looking closely at net interest margin – the measure of interest paid to lenders vs. the interest earned on interest-bearing assets – which is a key measure of the health of the big banks.
Analysts are already expecting that net interest margin will have been impacted by a flattening yield curve, which happens when the difference between short- and long-term interest rates narrows.
(See the difference in the slope of the yield curve charted at the Treasury Department website.)
In the case of the second quarter, the flattening has occurred as short-term yields on Treasuries have climbed. A strong labor market and inflation data have increased speculation for a more hawkish Fed. On Thursday, the consumer price index for June came in at a six-year high.
Overall, the financial sector earnings are expected to rise 18.5% for the three months ended June, according to Zacks. That’s below the 19.1% rise in earnings forecast for all stocks in the S&P 500.
2. Consumer Inflation Expectations Could Be Significant
The star of Friday’s economic indicators will be the University of Michigan’s initial measure of July consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). Economists expect that the index ticked down to 98.1 from 98.2 in June.
But the headline number is unlikely to be much of a market mover, given the acknowledgment of the market that consumers confidence is very strong. The Michigan index hasn’t dropped below 90 this year.
But Fed-watchers may be paying attention to the inflation expectations component of the survey, which arrived at 3% in June.
The Fed takes inflation expectations, as well as inflation data, into account when setting rate policy. Given consumer inflation hitting a six-year high in June, a spike in inflations expectations could raise some worries of more hawkish moves by the FOMC.
3. Will Oil Drop Below $70?
While financial stocks will likely call the market tune, investors will also be keeping an eye on energy shares.
After hitting levels not seen since late 2014, oil prices have retreated in the last few sessions. On Thursday, crude oil prices fell 5 cents to settle at $70.33 a barrel.
If oil prices push and stay below the $70 level, that could put pressure on energy stocks.
Oil prices are moving lower as supply outages in Canada and Libya are being resolved and Saudi Arabia is pushing to produce more barrels per day to make up for any shortfall from sanctions on Iranian oil.
But the International Energy Agency on Thursday said in its monthly report that “rising production from Middle East Gulf countries and Russia, welcome though it is, comes at the expense of the world's spare capacity cushion, which might be stretched to the limit.""
On Friday Baker Hughes will report its U.S. rig count at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT). Last week it reported a rise to 863 rigs, the first gain in three weeks."

""We review our memberships on an annual basis and this year have decided to discontinue our membership in ALEC,"" Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said.
ALEC, a coalition of state lawmakers and companies that proposes legislation, has been criticized for its stance on climate change, tort reform and gun control. In recent years, it has lost dozens of members, including  BP  (LON:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Group, Ford Motor (NYSE:F), and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group. 
The group said in a statement that member ""government relations strategies change over time,"" and lauded Exxon for its past work with the group on science, technology, engineering and math education issues.
Exxon's decision not to renew its membership followed a split with the lobby group last year over the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.

Ben Ratner, a senior director at the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-profit group focused on environmental issues, called Exxon's departure ""an important statement,"" noting the oil company recently joined BP, Shell and others supporting steps to reduce natural gas emissions from their operations.

1581,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Greek Bailout Payment Delayed by Germany on $33 Million VAT Hole,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany held up a final 15 billion-euro ($17.5 billion) aid payment to Greece after the government in Athens postponed a sales-tax increase, adding to signs that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has his work cut out to regain the trust of his euro-area creditors as he leads the country out of its bailout program next month.
Euro-area finance ministers on Thursday gave the green light for the loans to be disbursed to Greece once lawmakers sign off in Berlin. The last-minute snag came when Tsipras decided to push back a value-added tax hike on a handful of islands that have been hit hard by the influx of migrants.
The lost revenue at issue is just 28 million euros, but Germany insisted that Greece find savings elsewhere -- including its defense budget -- to fill the gap, according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. Tsipras, who faces a general election next year and is behind in the polls, announced the delayed VAT increase after agreeing to a request from Chancellor Angela Merkel to take back refugees from Germany.
“We all know that the amount is not very big,” said Klaus Regling, who heads the European Stability Mechanism, the euro-area bailout fund. The Greek government has pledged to raise the VAT rate at the end of the year, and to compensate for the lost revenue. “That was an important step that hopefully will enable also Germany” to approve the payment, he said.
Surveillance Regime
Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for economic affairs and taxation, told reporters in Brussels that the delay doesn’t threaten the payment, which will be made “in due time.” Greece will remain under a so-called enhanced surveillance regime, which includes quarterly reviews of its finances.
Delivering on promises to regain economic sovereignty may prove a challenge, as a potential showdown with creditors could complicate Greece’s tenuous access to bond markets. When asked if Tsipras could renegotiate pension cuts scheduled to kick at the end of the year, Regling said Greece must respect the commitments it made during its bailout program.
Even though Greece won’t escape close surveillance when its bailout expires, its banks won’t benefit from cheap financing lines extended by the European Central Bank. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure reiterated on Thursday that a waiver allowing junk-rated Greek banks to benefit for such funds will be lifted once the bailout expires."

The contract to replace its six ageing E-3D Sentry airborne early warning (AWACS) planes with a fleet of Boeing E-7 Wedgetail jets would, if confirmed, be worth over $1 billion.
But the decision, which could be announced in coming weeks, is likely to anger some U.K. lawmakers who have called for a full competition, and may also spark formal protests by European defense companies keen for the business.
Airbus, which is said to be teaming up with Sweden's Saab to offer an alternative, is anxious to try to prevent the deal being awarded without a competition and does not rule out mounting a legal challenge, a person close to the matter said.
A spokesman for Britain's defense ministry said, ""We tender contracts competitively wherever appropriate. It is too early to comment further at this time.""
Boeing and Airbus had no immediate comment.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>","U.S. senators want ban on China's ZTE, despite Trump action","By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. senators said on Thursday they want the government to reinstate penalties on ZTE Corp (HK:0763), despite a Trump administration agreement paving the way for an end of a ban on the Chinese telecommunications company.
Republican Senators Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton and Roy Blunt and Democrats Chris Van Hollen, Mark Warner and Bill Nelson told leaders of the armed services committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives that they strongly oppose the Commerce Department's deal with ZTE.
Many U.S. lawmakers, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, view ZTE as a national security threat, worrying that the use of its technology in the United States could make it easier for China to steal secrets.
Commerce on Wednesday said it signed an agreement with ZTE, China's No. 2 telecommunications maker, paving the way for it to resume operations after a nearly three-month ban on doing business with American suppliers.
The ban would be removed once the company deposits $400 million in an escrow account, Commerce said. The ban was imposed in April after ZTE broke an agreement it reached after pleading guilty in U.S. federal court last year for illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions, 
Leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies have said they are concerned that ZTE, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and some other Chinese companies are beholden to the Chinese government or Community Party, raising the risk of espionage.
They pushed for the inclusion of legislation to reinstate the ZTE ban in the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a must-pass defense policy bill.
The Senate approved a version of the NDAA with that amendment. But because it is not in the House version of the bill, lawmakers from the Senate and House armed services committees are currently negotiating a compromise.
The fate of the ZTE amendment is not clear. Despite bipartisan support for the measure among members of Congress, Republicans control both the Senate and House and party leaders break from Trump's policies rarely.
Additionally, Representative Mac Thornberry, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has said he does not want passage of the NDAA to be held up by the ZTE amendment, or anything that is not strictly a defense issue.
The House version of the defense bill would restrict government agencies from using equipment from ZTE or Huawei.
""We write to express our strong support for measures ... that would reinstate U.S. government penalties against ZTE, a Chinese state-directed telecommunications company, and modernize the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States,"" the senators wrote in the letter, which was sent on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc's surprise bid to buy software company CA Inc (NASDAQ:CA) for $18.9 billion wiped off the same amount from its market value on Thursday, with investors and analysts struggling to find a clear reason for the deal.
Citing an acquisition with no potential synergies, investors drove the company's shares down 19 percent to $197.50 - their worst day ever. CA rose 18.5 percent to $44.10.
Broadcom, which has mushroomed in value by buying out rivals in the past decade's surge in mobile phone production, agreed on Wednesday to buy mainframe software company CA for $44.50 per share in cash, months after President Donald Trump blocked its $117 billion mega-merger with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.
While some analysts said the shift in sectoral focus might prove another masterstroke by Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan, many raised concerns about a deal that lowers Broadcom's top line growth to 3 percent from 5 percent.
""It's the most bizarre, defocused, non-strategic acquisition of the last decade,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive of the Patriarch Organization, a Los Angeles-based private-equity firm.
At least two analysts downgraded the stock, while two other analysts cut their price targets. Brokerage B Riley was the most bearish with a price target cut of $63 to $245. 
""What the Hock?"" analysts from brokerage Evercore wrote in a note. ""We think investors will likely be disappointed at this deal, which seems more financial engineering/PE driven than due to any strategic rationale."" 
Broadcom's famously ambitious chief executive has built the company from a fledgling chipmaker to a global powerhouse through a series of big deals, and is widely respected by Wall Street for his business acumen.
""A new and unexpected infrastructure software initiative seems likely to create a multi-quarter share overhang,"" wrote analyst Craig Ellis from B Riley. 
Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said the foray into the software industry may have been driven by a lack of viable options in the semiconductor industry and increased regulatory scrutiny.
CA's main business is selling software for big, mainframe computers, in which it is second only to  IBM  (NYSE:IBM).
But while that business generates cash flow of $10 billion a year, its revenue growth has been flat as more customers choose cloud services over old-fashioned hardware.
""While CA is a departure from Broadcom's core semiconductor business, it is consistent with its track record of acquiring out-of-favor, market leaders with high cost structures,"" Jefferies analysts said.
""Importantly, AVGO has consistently demonstrated its ability to drive costs down and margins of its acquisitions up, often measured in 1,000s of basis points,"" they said.
Some analysts speculated that Broadcom's ability to rein in costs would help it use CA as a platform to build a business in the software sector that simply offsets the risks of the highly-competitive semiconductor business.
""Management is showing its ambition to move beyond silicon to be that of an Infrastructure Technology company,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.
After the deal, the combined company would have roughly 71 percent revenue from semiconductors and 28 percent from software.
""We think many investors may not like it - at least initially - but this does open the door for a new angle to the story and further improves AVGO's capital return potential (we model $10/shr dividend in F19) in the meantime,"" UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The escalating trade war between the United States and China may prompt U.S. companies to shift money they had earmarked for capital expenditures into stock buybacks instead, pushing record levels of corporate share repurchases even higher.
Such a move away from capital reinvestment would also undercut one goal of the Trump administration's signature $1.5-trillion tax cut, which supporters said was intended to unleash a wave of new investments in factories and workers at home. 
Instead, fund managers say, the reality of tit-for-tat U.S. and Chinese tariffs on more than $34 billion worth of goods - and the U.S. threat to slap additional tariffs on more than $200 billion worth of Chinese products - may undermine business confidence, freezing corporate investment plans. 
""The actual economic impact of the tariffs is pretty small. But I feel fairly confident that if we look at corporate behavior there will be some delay on making capital expenditures and investments due to lack of certainty in the market"" about the costs of importing and exporting goods, said Putri Pascualy, portfolio manager and senior credit strategist at Pacific Alternative Asset Management Co.
As a result, she said, companies flush with cash from the tax cut will spend their windfalls on either buybacks or acquisitions, both of which should push earnings per share higher either through revenue growth or reducing the number of available shares. Corporations that announce that they will start buying back their own shares also tend to see a boost in their share price by introducing another dedicated buyer into the market. 
This year, however, companies are seeing little pop. The S&P 500 Buyback Index, which measures the 100 companies in the index with the highest buyback ratios, is up 3.2 percent since the start of January, slightly behind the 3.9 percent gain in the broad market. 
""Corporates are aware that they're not seeing their stock price go up to the same amount for their buybacks as they did three years ago, and they could respond by saying we should stop doing it, or we're not getting as much bang for the buck so we will do more. I think they will do the latter, especially because they have the money"" from the tax cut, Pascualy said. 
Companies in the benchmark S&P 500 announced a record $436.6 billion in buybacks in the second quarter, nearly doubling the previous record of $242.1 billion announced during the quarter before, according to TrimTabs. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  announced a $100-billion buyback on May 1, the largest share repurchase ever by a U.S. company. Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO), meanwhile, announced a buyback of $25 billion, while  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) announced a plan to repurchase $15 billion worth of its shares. Overall, 63 companies announced buybacks of at least $1 billion last quarter, TrimTabs noted.
SLOWING CAPEX
There are already signs that capital expenditures are slowing. Capital investment by companies in the S&P 500 is expected to grow 10.2 percent in the third quarter compared with the same time last year, compared with the 18.8-percent year-over-year jump in capital spending in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, meanwhile, are expected to grow just 1.7 percent from the year before. 
Among small-cap companies, which saw the greatest proportional benefit from the tax cut passed in December, capital spending is expected to grow by less than double digits in the second and third quarters and post a 11.7-percent decline in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.
""It's a confidence issue. Tariffs cut into business confidence because you don't know where it's going and you don't know what the other guy is going to do,"" said David Ellison, a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.
Capital expenditures will likely continue to decline and buybacks will increase even if tensions between the United States and its trading partners cool off, said Brian Levitt, senior investment strategist at OppenheimerFunds. 
""I'm of the mind that expectations for business investment because of tax cuts were overstated,"" he said. ""This economic cycle is already quite long and businesses have been flush with cash for some time."" 
Instead, companies will watch the currency market for signs that trade tariffs are pushing the dollar higher, eating into earnings and profitability, he said.

""It doesn't necessarily take that much to change corporate behavior,"" Levitt said.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 12:56PM ET</span>",Finance industry tears into Britain's Brexit trading plans,"By Huw Jones and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's finance industry attacked the government on Thursday for ditching its blueprint for trade with the European Union after Brexit, saying this was a blow for Britain's biggest exporter.
The government's proposal for a new financial services arrangement post-Brexit will effectively make it more difficult for Britain's banks, insurers and asset managers to do business across the European Union.
The plan falls short of the current ""passporting"" rights that enable the country's financial services industry to trade freely with the EU.
The proposal, published in a White Paper, form part of Britain's negotiating position with Brussels over future trading relations.
""Today's Brexit white paper is a real blow for the UK's financial and related professional services sector,"" said Catherine McGuinness, City of London political leader.
The government has proposed expanding the EU's existing so-called ""equivalence"" regime, which currently covers access for non-EU partners like Japan and the United States to the region's financial services markets.
""As part of this, the existing autonomous frameworks for equivalence would need to be expanded, to reflect the fact that equivalence as it exists today is not sufficient in scope for the breadth of the interconnectedness of UK-EU financial services provision,"" the White Paper said.
The City of London financial district and TheCityUK, which promotes Britain as a financial center, had jointly proposed a more ambitious ""mutual recognition"" blueprint to replicate the free access provided by passporting.
Under this plan, Britain and the EU would accept each other's financial rules to offer broad two-way market access.
But EU officials have opposed the idea, saying it would take away the EU's autonomy in rulemaking.
TheCityUK Chief Executive Miles Celic said the overriding issue for financial services firms was the ability to continue serving customers and clients.
""Mutual recognition would have been the best way to achieve this. It’s therefore regrettable and frustrating that this approach has been dropped before even making it to the negotiating table.""
Banks and insurers in the City of London have been playing it safe by moving staff and opening hubs in the EU to make sure they still have access irrespective of the shape of Britain's new trading relationship with the bloc post Brexit.
The Investment Association, which represents fund mangers, said it was disappointing the government had ruled out mutual recognition as the preferred option.
A senior finance industry official said Britain was being pragmatic by putting the mutual recognition blueprint into language that Brussels was more familiar with to achieve a similar outcome.
But the official also said it would be a challenge to implement the plans before transition ends in 2020 given that the European Parliament goes to the polls and a new European Commission is appointed next year, which typically means months of legislative inactivity.
NO OUTSIDE LEGISLATORS
The City of London and TheCityUK have been lobbying the government for months to back their mutual recognition plan even though EU officials dismissed it because it offers the benefits of the single market without obligations or costs.
Only last month Treasury officials told senior financial sector executives that the government was planning to back their long favored plan.
The Treasury said: ""This proposal is the best option for getting a good deal for the City. It preserves the mutual benefits of integrated markets, protects financial stability, and preserves the City’s global reach.""
Britain has rejected the current EU equivalence regime because Brussels alone decides who gets access. Under the new arrangement, Britain proposes safeguards, such as a bilateral agreement to make the system ""stabler, transparent and predictable"".
Lorraine Johnston, a lawyer at law firm Ashurst, said Britain was proposing a form of equivalence which gives it what looks like a seat at the European regulatory table, even if they cannot order from the menu.
""This looks like the UK's attempt to become the tail that wags the dog,"" Johnston said.
EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said on Thursday that the European Commission had already proposed enhancements to the equivalence system.
Pierre Gramegna, finance minister for Luxembourg, home to many funds managed from London, backed ""enhanced"" equivalence, but German finance minister Olaf Scholz said the EU must take its own decisions in financial regulation.
""There cannot be additional legislators on the outside,"" Scholz said.
Reuters reported last month that the bloc was opposed to changing equivalence solely for Britain, and that any improvements to its so-called equivalence regime would apply to other countries too.
The equivalence regime is already being revised since Britain voted to leave the EU to toughen up rules for ""systemic"" foreign financial firms or activities, such as the clearing of euro-denominated assets, which London dominates.

Failure to obtain generous access to EU markets could prompt calls for Britain to row back on financial rules to boost the City of London's competitiveness, a step British regulators have warned against.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Linde  (DE:LING) and Praxair (N:PX) will win approval regulatory clearance for their planned $83 billion merger after pledging to sell Praxair's assets to boost a Japanese rival in Europe, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
German company Linde and U.S. rival Praxair announced their merger plan in June last year, with the aim of ousting French competitor  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) as global leader in gas distribution, but the European Commission opened a full-scale investigation in February.
The Commission warned that the deal could reduce competition in the supply of crucial gases such as oxygen, which has multiple uses, and helium, which is essential for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners.
The EU competition enforcer also worried that high investment costs could deter the entrance of new players in a sector with only four major companies globally.
But Praxair's offer this month to sell its European assets to  Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp  (T:4091) for 5 billion euros will be sufficient to address the European Commission's concerns, the two sources said.
The assets include Praxair's industrial gases businesses in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Britain, and include approximately 2,500 employees.
Both the Commission, which is scheduled to rule on the deal by Aug. 24, and Linde declined to comment.

The companies are also planning to divest assets to a consortium of German gases company Messer Group and funds advised by CVC (CVC.UL) to secure regulatory clearance in the United States and elsewhere.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Glencore shares under cloud after U.S demands Congo documents in probe,"By Zandi Shabalala
LONDON (Reuters) - A U.S. demand for documents related to Glencore's (L:GLEN) assets in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as part of a corruption probe has rattled investors and is likely to weigh on the miner's performance until there is more clarity on the case.
 Glencore  said it had received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice dated July 2 requesting documents for its Congo business over compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and rules against money laundering.
The Switzerland-based company, which said documents for Venezuela and Nigeria were also requested, provided few details, although it said it would cooperate with the authorities.
News of the subpoena led to the biggest one-day drop in the firm's share price for two years. Glencore is now down about 20 percent so far this year, trading around 314 pence on Thursday.
By comparison, shares in London-listed mining rivals  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO),  Anglo American  (L:AAL) and BHP (L:BLT) are up between 2 and 9 percent.
Glencore declined to comment when asked about the impact on the share price from the subpoena issue.
(GRAPHIC: Glencore versus mining peers - https://reut.rs/2KXsKWA)
Operations in Venezuela and Nigeria are relatively small, but Congo accounts for 26 percent of Glencore's net present value, the second biggest contributor behind Australia, according to BMO Capital Markets. 
NPV is the difference between the present or discounted value of cash inflows and outflows over future years and is used as a measure of the profitability of investment in a project.
(GRAPHIC: Glencore NPV - https://reut.rs/2NAkgpW)
Congo also contributes $2 billion to Glencore's annual core earnings or EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), or about 14 percent.
Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina said the United States had a reputation for imposing hefty fines on companies found to have violated its laws in dealings abroad, although he said Glencore had not faced any charges. 
""Until this matter is resolved, investors are likely to assume Glencore will have to pay a large fine, and Glencore's cost of capital will increase,"" he said.
Adding to concerns, Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is preparing to open a formal investigation into Glencore's activities in Congo, Bloomberg reported in May.
The SFO says it will not comment on the issue. Glencore declined to comment.
""Until some clarity is provided around the potential U.S./UK government investigations, it is difficult to see the company fully recovering from relative underperformance,"" said Investec analyst Hunter Hillcoat. 
After releasing news of the U.S. subpoena, Glencore announced a buyback to bolster its share price, offering a brief bounce. But its shares are now back near their one-year low.
The buyback would still leave Glencore trailing Rio in terms of shareholder returns, according to the BMO estimate. But it would be ahead of Anglo American and BHP.
(GRAPHIC: Shareholder returns from miners - https://reut.rs/2J74oYq)
The U.S. investigation could be related to Glencore's settling of a mining row with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, who has been under U.S. sanctions since last year, some analysts say. The firm agreed to pay royalties in euros.
""Investors are more sensitive to these things these days,"" said one institutional investor in Glencore, asking not to be identified. ""Some will say maybe this is the start of something and it might get worse before it gets better.""
Gertler's Ventora Development Sasu had been seeking $695 million in unpaid and future royalties from Mutanda Mining and $2.28 billion from Kamoto Copper Co (KCC), both subsidiaries of Glencore. The Swiss firm disputes the amounts.
The probes are not expected to lead to production cutbacks, but analysts see risks from Glencore's exposure to Congo.
Glencore mines about a quarter of the world's cobalt, with most of its output coming from Congo. The metal is a key ingredient for batteries that power electric vehicles.
The company plans to ramp up total production of cobalt, mostly from the Katanga and Mutanda mines, to 39,000 tonnes in 2018 and 65,000 tonnes in 2019, the company said in December. 
The miner also produced 1.3 million tonnes in copper in 2017, amounting to about 5 percent of world supplies. About 15 percent of Glencore's copper output comes from Congo.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>","Trader Cargill's profits soar on meat, animal feed demand","By P.J. Huffstutter
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cargill Inc's (CARG.UL) fourth-quarter profit more than doubled, it said on Thursday, as global demand for meat and animal feed soared and commodity market volatility eased a squeeze on the company's trading unit.
For its 2018 fiscal year, commodities trader Cargill had the highest year-end net earnings and adjusted operating earnings in its 153-year history, excluding earnings from its investment in fertilizer producer The  Mosaic Company  (NYSE:MOS), which it exited in fiscal 2011.
For the full year, adjusted operating earnings reached $3.2 billion, up 6 percent from fiscal 2017. 
The privately-held company said its animal nutrition and protein unit - which includes beef and feed - was the largest contributor to its earnings in the quarter ended May 31.
The Minnesota-based company - the world's largest ground-beef supplier - bet heavily on protein. Analysts say that has given the company an edge over its grain rivals such Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) and  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG), and helped it offset the wide swings in global grain pricing. 
But Cargill's origination and processing division - which includes its grain trading business - also had a turn-around. It exceeded last year's annual results, and had its best fourth quarter in seven years.
Market volatility after a drought in Argentina began to influence global flows of corn, soybeans and related products. Trade tensions between the United States and several of its top export markets, including China and Mexico, added to it. 
Cargill and its rivals make money buying, selling, storing and processing crops. With networks of elevators, mills and processing plants around the world, the companies have been able to capitalize on shortages in some geographies and surpluses in others.
The company said it also broke ground on a new biodiesel facility in Kansas, and is expanding its soy crush capacity in Brazil and the U.S.
But Cargill officials have been critical in recent weeks of the escalating trade fight, and tit-for-tat tariffs, between China and the U.S.
""Our strong results show we are creating the connections the world needs for vibrant food and agriculture both today and tomorrow,"" Cargill Chairman David MacLennan said in a statement. ""We are standing up for inclusive global trade that lets food move freely."" 
Cargill's net income rose to $711 million in the fourth quarter ended May 31, from $347 million a year earlier.

Adjusted operating earnings jumped 76 percent to $809 million in the reported quarter. Revenue rose 7 percent to $30.4 billion.

Browder, who leads a campaign against Russian officials he blames for the 2009 death of his Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky while investigating fraud, said on Twitter that he had filed a complaint with the Danish law enforcement authorities.
Danske Bank declined to comment. It has admitted to flaws in its anti money-laundering controls in Estonia and launched its own investigation into the case. 
In June, Latvian authorities said they were examining an allegation that a failed bank handled money from a Russian fraud uncovered by Browder.
Denmark's State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime will still have to decide whether to pursue an investigation. The prosecutor was not immediately reachable for comment when contacted by Reuters.
The criminal complaint was also sent to Denmark's business minister Rasmus Jarlov, a picture of the letter on Browder's Twitter profile showed. 
Last week, Jarlov said a newspaper report alleging Danske Bank laundered up to $8.3 billion through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 could prompt the Danish financial watchdog to open a new investigation. 

Shares in Danske Bank have fallen more than 20 percent over the last four months, as the money laundering scandal has unraveled.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 11:07AM ET</span>",Sky shares leap as Comcast and Fox lock horns in bid battle,"By Kate Holton and Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (L:SKYB) shares leapt to an 18-year high on Thursday as investors bet a transatlantic battle for the European pay-TV group had further to run, after Comcast's $34 billion bid trumped an offer from Rupert Murdoch made just hours earlier.
Comcast (O:CMCSA), the world's biggest entertainment group, said on Wednesday it had the backing of Sky's independent directors for a 14.75 pounds-per-share offer that came just 16 hours after Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (O:FOXA) bid 14 pounds. 
The speed with which Comcast's Brian Roberts counterbid shows how determined he is to buy Britain's Sky, a broadcaster of sports, films and TV shows to 23 million homes across Europe.
Sky's shares rose to as high as 15.41 pounds on Thursday and were trading at 15.37 pounds in late afternoon, valuing it at 26.4 billion pounds - or $35 billion - as investors bet the bidders would have to pay more to secure victory. 
""You need a finale at the end of a great bull market and I think Sky is going to be that finale,"" said Crispin Odey, a top 20 Sky shareholder, noting the share's rapid ascent.
""It's got legs,"" he added.
Sky's shares are up 95 percent since Fox made its first bid in 2016, and have risen 55 percent in the last year. 
The fight is part of a bigger battle being waged in the entertainment industry as the growth of Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN) force the world's traditional media giants to spend tens of billions of dollars to keep pace. 
Comcast and Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) are locked in a separate $70 billion-plus battle to buy most of Fox's assets, including Sky, and Disney is backing Murdoch in his pursuit of the UK firm. 
Murdoch owns 39 percent of Sky, which he helped to launch. 
The standoff pits the industry's biggest names against each other, with Roberts, the Murdoch family and Disney's Bob Iger engaged in a multibillion-dollar game of chess to reshape the global entertainment business. 
The three are at a tech conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. They have history, after Roberts' Comcast tried and failed to buy Iger's Disney in 2004.
WINNER TAKES ALL? 
Analysts are divided as to who will emerge triumphant. 
Jeff Wlodarczak at Pivotal Research Group said Comcast may succeed in winning Sky but lose out on Fox to Disney. 
Richard Greenfield at BTIG said, however, he thought Disney needed to buy Sky to secure a direct relationship with customers in Europe so it could sell them its vast range of programming. 
""Is Disney willing to let Sky go? Or will they crush Comcast on both continents?"" Greenfield said in a note. 
""We continue to believe that if Comcast really wants to own Sky, their best way to do it is by acquiring the Fox assets – winner takes-all was always the scenario that appeared most likely to us.""
Fox investors vote on Disney's $71 billion bid on July 27. 
Comcast, which made a $65 billion all-cash offer for the Fox assets last month only for Disney to raise its bid, would need to return before that date if it wants to try again. 
That means the next installment of this drama is likely to move to the United States.
""It's not clear to me that Disney would allow Comcast to get Sky at 14.75 pounds in order to definitively get hold of Fox when they are really in the driving seat,"" a London-based hedge fund manager with shares in Fox and Sky told Reuters.
A second fund manager invested in Sky questioned whether Comcast was seeking to force Fox and Disney to do a side deal and sell it some Fox assets in order to end the bidding war. 
""For Comcast bidding for the whole of Fox it's now too expensive, so they're focusing their bidding efforts on Sky,"" the fund manager said on the condition of anonymity. 
""And because Murdoch and Disney are determined to take control of Sky, they will have to reach an agreement with Comcast in relation to other Fox assets.""
MORE TO COME
Analysts at Jefferies said they thought Comcast, if required, could yet offer more. Comcast said the offer values Sky on a price to earnings multiple of 22.9 times 2017 earnings. 
Jefferies see this multiple falling rapidly as Sky's earnings improve, helped by lower Premier League soccer costs from 2019. When factoring in synergies, it says the offer equates to around 12.57 pounds to Comcast, implying a multiple of 15.3 times Sky's forecast 2020 earnings, and falling thereafter. 
Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research, said he believed Comcast could bid up to 16.00 pounds per share for Sky, and assumes Comcast will go this high if pushed.
""Of all the assets in the Fox portfolio, they probably view Sky as the most strategically important,"" Chaplin wrote. 
In Britain, a 60-day timetable is set in motion once the second of the two bidders has published its offer document. If there are still two live competing bids by day 46 of the timetable, the Panel can run an auction process. 
For now, investors are waiting to see what Murdoch will do next. Fox released a terse statement late on Wednesday saying it noted Comcast's offer. It received UK regulatory approval to buy Sky on Thursday - almost 20 months after it requested it. 
The government had repeatedly delayed its approval for fears that Murdoch, the owner of two of the biggest selling newspapers in Britain, would control too much of the media. 
Murdoch helped to launch Sky in 1989, building it up to be Britain's dominant pay-TV provider through its ownership of Premier League soccer, U.S. drama and films. It now offers satellite TV in Ireland, Austria, Italy and Germany, and streaming services in Spain.
His son James is CEO of Fox and chairman of Sky.
""There is the question of whether Disney and Comcast are paying over the odds for Sky,"" said senior analyst Laith Khalaf at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""However, Sky investors won't worry too much about that."" ($1 = 0.7571 pounds)

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Former Barclays trader found guilty of rigging interest rate,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A French former trader with  Barclays  (L:BARC), tried in his absence by a London court, has been convicted of helping to mastermind a five-year plot to rig global interest rates after an 11-week trial.
Philippe Moryoussef, a 50-year-old former senior derivatives trader, was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor - or Euro interbank offered rate - between January 2005 and December 2009.
The jury at Southwark Crown Court acquitted German Achim Kraemer, a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGN) manager still employed by the bank.
Reporting restrictions were lifted on Thursday after the jury failed to reach a verdict on three former Barclays co-defendants Carlo Palombo, an Italian-born former junior trader, Sisse Bohart, a Danish former junior trader and rate submitter and her British former boss, Colin Bermingham.
A sixth defendant, 46-year-old former Deutsche Bank star trader Christian Bittar, a Frenchman who investigators said was once one of the world's best-paid traders, pleaded guilty before the trial began. He is already in custody.
The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which prosecuted the case, said it would decide within seven days whether to seek a retrial of Palombo, Bohart and Bermingham.
A conspiracy to defraud conviction carries a jail sentence of up to 10 years.
The SFO alleged bankers deliberately disregarded rules that Euribor should not be set with an eye on commercial gain, that they dishonestly plotted for rates to be false or misleading and risked prejudicing the economic interest of others.
Brussels-based Euribor is a benchmark for interest rates on around $150 trillion to $180 trillion of financial contracts and consumer loans worldwide.
SENTENCING NEXT WEEK
The judge penciled in July 20 for sentencing Moroccan-born Moryoussef and Bittar, who was born in Senegal. But as Moryoussef is not in the country, it is unclear whether or when he will serve time in jail. 
The former trader left for France after Bittar's guilty plea was made public and had no defending counsel in court. His Paris-based lawyer, Francois De Casto, said his client was under the protection of French law.
""Philippe Moryoussef will eventually refer this case to the European Court of Human Rights,"" he said.
While global authorities have fined leading banks and brokerages around $9 billion and charged about 30 people over rate-rigging allegations, the latest SFO prosecution is the first to focus on Euribor, the Brussels-based equivalent of Libor (London interbank offered rate). 
Prosecutors cast Bittar and Moryoussef, old friends who cut their teeth in banking at France's  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), as the ringleaders of an international, inter-bank scam to deliberately flout rules by asking rate submitters to nudge rates up or down to bolster trading books in a ""zero sum game"".
Vast derivatives profits could ride on a basis point, or 0.01 percent, change in Euribor rates, which are set over various time frames.
""GOOD LUCK""
In messages read out in court, Moryoussef emailed Palombo on October 1, 2006, saying: ""My mobile won't be connected on Monday. Two things, ask Sisse to put a high 6 month (Euribor)... and Christian as well ... we have 2 billion on that date. We definitely have to make one  BP  (LON:BP) (basis point) on that fixing. Good luck, bye.""
The defendants denied dishonesty, said they had learned their trade on the job and that they believed there was nothing wrong with requesting or accommodating preferential trades. 
Rate requests were made openly and fell within a range of equally valid rates, they said. 
Defence lawyers also said there was no evidence their clients had financially benefited from the alleged scam.

In a statement read out to the jury during the trial, Moryoussef said trader requests were an established practice at Barclays when he joined in 2005 and that he believed submitters would choose a correct rate from a permitted range of estimates.

The U.S. State Department overnight repeated a warning to Western firms involved in the deal for the pipeline from Russia under the Baltic Sea, saying the project could divide Europe and they were at risk of sanctions.
""Threats of U.S. sanctions against European companies invested in Nord Stream 2 encroach on European energy policy,"" the chairman of the German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations (Ostausschuss), Wolfgang Buechele, told Reuters.
He said that Trump's remarks and sanctions against Russia that also target foreign companies there were ""an assault on business relations between German and European countries and Russia"".
The $11-billion project, led by Gazprom (MM:GAZP), aims to double capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline from next year, bypassing traditional routes through Ukraine.
Germany's Uniper (DE:UN01) and Wintershall (DE:BASFn) are among western partners, that also include Anglo-Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Austria's OMV (VIE:OMVV).
The German committee groups 350 members active in 29 countries in eastern Europe accounting for about a fifth of Germany's total foreign trade, which is more sizeable than bilateral trades Germany conducts with the U.S. and China individually.
Buechele said it was not up to Washington to identify which countries German companies were allowed to trade with.
The energy partnership with Russia had stretched over decades with mutual benefits, and gas imports from Russia were a competitively priced and reliable energy source for private consumers and industry, he said.
Chancellor Angela Merkel insists the project is a private commercial venture.
Buechele also said that to claim Russia would be able to control gas markets was ""factually wrong and politically absurd.""
A spokesman for Uniper declined comment on the latest exchanges but offered a wider statement by chief executive Klaus Schaefer saying that he wished for a de-escalation of the sanctions spiral.
""We are holding on to our contractual obligations regarding Nord Stream 2, of whose value for Germany and Europe we are convinced, given the background of declining gas production in Europe,"" Schaefer said.
""This is a project for coming decades and thus partially independent of short-term developments.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors will be watching Europe's exporters like hawks this earnings season, picking over results for signs that escalating protectionism worldwide has started to dent companies' investment plans and outlook. 
Much hangs in the balance for Europe's second-quarter earnings season. While expected to deliver better profits growth than the Jan-March quarter, it may also herald more volatility for trade-sensitive sectors such as autos and industrials. 
So far this year, investors have pulled $29.4 billion from European equity funds, while U.S. equities have held up better, with $18.2 billion outflows, EPFR data shows. 
That's been attributed to sputtering economic data and the return of political risk after the 2017 ""Euroboom"". U.S. companies, in contrast, are delivering stellar earnings, turbo-charged by tax cuts. 
The upcoming season hence is crucial for Europe - the hope is stronger earnings will coax money back into the region where equity valuations look relatively attractive.
But the complication is trade war. 
Europe's sensitivity to higher U.S. tariffs is second only to Asia's, with the auto sector particularly in the firing line.
Overall exports to the United States accounted for 2.6 percent of the European Union's GDP in 2017, and a supply chain analysis by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) found 3.5 percent of euro area value added is linked to car demand.
Germany, home to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), is the most at risk with 6.9 percent of GDP derived from cars.
Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of 20 percent on European cars coming into the United States, while Beijing has proposed a 25 percent tax on U.S. car factory exports, which would overwhelmingly hurt German carmakers. 
The full impact of any new trade tariffs should only show up in earnings later this year, but companies could begin to change their outlook accordingly - and this is where investors' eyes will be trained. 
""The earnings season will be somewhat in the shadow of trade war. Equity markets are dominated by the outlook and we know the outlook is clouded by the trade issue,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.
Evidence of a clear impact on companies' confidence in the future could cause sharp share selloffs - if Daimler's recent profit warning was anything to go by.
Mention of the word 'tariff' in earnings calls increased during the last quarter to levels not seen in the last decade, according to data compiled by CB Insight. It is likely to rise further this quarter.
Investors dialing into conference calls will listen out for changes to capital expenditure plans and earnings outlook. 
""It feels to me at the moment we are going into an earnings season with more uncertainty than we've had for some time,"" Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. 
(GRAPHIC: European vs U.S. earnings growth - https://reut.rs/2JdjJXH)
AUTO IMMUNE
Europe's auto sector, clearly in Trump's crosshairs, has unsurprisingly been the worst-performing this year and Societe Generale's global head of flow strategy Kokou Agbo-Bloua said investors were buying derivatives protection against further share price falls.
That means the stocks will be more volatile than usual on the day they post results - options markets point to Daimler shares swinging 2.75 percent on results day, Volkswagen 2.52 percent and BMW 1.73 percent, Agbo-Bloua told Reuters.
Other areas likely to show strain from tariff threats are companies exposed to a potential tariff-driven slowdown in China, primarily in the industrials and capital goods sectors though luxury stocks are also exposed.
Artur Baluszynski, head of research at asset manager Henderson Rowe, said he would be watching forklift and warehouse technology provider Kion (DE:KGX) closely for any comment from management on tariffs.
""They might start signaling things aren't looking good for pipeline going forward because of this uncertainty,"" he said.
Wider market damage may, however, be limited as many a bottom line will have been bolstered by a weaker euro and a higher oil price.
""At the headline level European earnings should actually have some reasonable numbers relative to Q1 because of one massive overriding thing: currency,"" Campling said.
The euro lost more than 5 percent against the dollar in the second quarter, providing some relief for euro zone exporters whose revenues had been hurt by five consecutive quarters of currency strengthening.
The devaluation has helped boost expectations for euro zone earnings growth to 4 percent year-on-year for the second quarter, up from 1.6 percent in Q1, according to Thomson Reuters figures. The figure for the pan-European index is 8.1 percent.
Earnings-per-share for Q2 has been revised up 1.5 percentage points ahead of the season - a good omen because this is the main gauge of a company's profitability. 
The downside though is that revisions are lopsided, concentrated in the oil sector. The top performers this year after Brent crude's 11 percent year-to-date gain, energy shares should deliver a scintillating 30 percent earnings growth, according to Thomson Reuters forecasts.
But even here some investors are preparing for the inevitable comedown.
""Since the general rule this year is that no market trend will endure, we are taking profits in the best-performing sector,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux strategist Christopher Potts who recently went underweight energy stocks. 
ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN
The turnaround in economic expectations from last year's optimistic picture is partly to blame for the investor sentiment U-turn. While the euro zone should still grow 2.1 percent this year, business sentiment surveys as well as hard data point to a stalling recovery. 
""The level is still positive for growth and still should mean we're on track for earnings expansion but the market seems to be underwhelmed by the story,"" said Donough Kilmurray, Goldman Sachs' EMEA head of the investment strategy group for private wealth management. 
The European Commission cut its forecasts for economic growth on Thursday, citing trade tensions with the U.S. as among the top causes for its revision.
Investors willing to swallow slower growth are finding attractively priced opportunities, with European stocks at their biggest discount to the S&P 500 in more than 18 years. 
And those preparing to parse company results are also wary of companies using trade to explain away underperformance. Northern Trust's Campling dubbed it this season's ""excuse du jour"".
No tariffs have actually kicked in yet on European exports, with the exception of metals where U.S. import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum are in place.
""It seems a bit circumstantial and too easy to give trade tariffs as an excuse for the moment, except in affected sectors such as steel,"" said Sylvain Goyon, head of equity strategy at ODDO BHF.

The USB union, which represents only a small number of workers, called a strike at Fiat Chrysler's Melfi plant in southern Italy after Italian champions Juventus agreed to pay Real Madrid 100 million euros ($117 million) to secure the Portuguese striker for four years.
Both Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Juventus are controlled by Exor (MI:EXOR), the investment holding of Italy's Agnelli family, which owns nearly 30 percent of the carmaker and 64 percent of the soccer team. However, the two are completely separate entities, each managing their own finances and operations.
USB was protesting over the fact that tens of millions of euros were spent to hire Ronaldo while workers at FCA were being asked to make sacrifices.
The strike was called for late Sunday to early Tuesday.
The bigger unions criticized USB's move as ""mere advertising"", saying it was ""incredible that in such a delicate phase for the FCA group... someone is calling for a strike on a matter that has nothing to do with work and with workers"".
Thousands of FCA plant workers across Italy have been on state-sponsored temporary layoff schemes for years due to lack of new models.
However, the company has launched a new investment strategy to 2022 which it says should allow all employees in Italy to return to work over the next four years.
FCA, whose plants churn out Jeep SUVs, sporty Alfa Romeos, luxury Maseratis and tiny Fiats, had promised to bring all employees in Italy back to work by the end of 2018, but that goal slipped as investments and product launches were delayed.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. and Europe clash over global supersonic jet noise standards,"By Allison Lampert and Jamie Freed
MONTREAL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A U.S. push for new global standards to kickstart its fledgling supersonic jet industry is facing resistance by European nations that want tough rules on noise, according to documents and people familiar with the situation.     
Fifteen years after Concorde's last flight, U.S. regulators are weighing rule changes to allow testing of early-stage supersonic jets, amid plans for American-made business and small passenger jets due in service by the mid-2020s. But the new industry could face delays at the United Nations aviation agency where the United States and European countries - including France, Germany and Britain - are squaring off over new noise rules needed for the jets to fly, five sources told Reuters, speaking about confidential talks on condition of anonymity.
The previously unreported dispute follows a 1990s clash on noise standards, when the European Union wanted to ban noisy older U.S.-made jets like the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 727 from its airports and Washington threatened to retaliate by banning the Anglo-French Concorde. 
This latest round pits U.S. ambitions for an American-led revival of supersonic jets by start-ups Aerion Supersonic, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace against European fears of disruptive noise from the planes. Aerion, backed by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and GE, is considered by industry sources as the most advanced of the supersonic projects. 
Boom will be making its first appearance at the Farnborough Airshow next week as it looks to cement the revival of the supersonic industry, which is struggling to design jets that meet current subsonic noise standards due to engine constraints. 
""The politics are that Europe is way more worried about noise (around airports),"" said an industry source familiar with the matter. ""Europe has a problem but they have no reason to solve (it) because they have no industry pushing for this."" 
That's a reversal of disputes which delayed the beginning of Concorde's transatlantic services in the 1970s, as first the U.S. Congress and then the New York Port Authority banned it due to noise. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned supersonic flights over U.S. land since 1973.
For now, the new jets plan to stick to over-water routes, though the FAA will eventually decide whether to allow overland flights after analyzing data from NASA in a study by 2025. An FAA spokesman couldn't immediately comment.
GLOBAL STANDARDS 
Both Boeing and Airbus have mapped out futuristic visions for ultra-fast air travel. 
But since the demise of Boeing's planned near-supersonic Sonic Cruiser in 2002, the world's two largest planemakers have focused on slower, fuel-efficient planes that allow airlines to lower ticket prices. 
Now, U.S. startups are working to develop quieter and more fuel-efficient supersonic planes than Concorde, aimed at business travelers. They claim these can be economically viable with the right engine. They also pledge to dampen the famous sonic boom which depressed Concorde's sales and restricted its operations until it was grounded for economic reasons in 2003.
The United Nations' Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which sets many global standards, has started looking at supersonic jets by seeking technical information from planemakers.
ICAO will then be in a better position to assess options for standards on noise and emissions, and ""how long the process should take,"" a spokesman said. 
The European countries think current noise limits should be used as ""guidelines"" for developing landing and take-off rules, according to a document presented to a recent ICAO committee meeting and seen by Reuters. 
The United States, echoing industry's demand, has called for new standards that reflect ""fundamental differences"" between subsonic and supersonic jets, according to a second document. 
""Supersonic aircraft are different from subsonic aircraft and need to be treated as such,"" said Mike Hinderberger, Aerion senior vice president of aircraft development at an industry conference last month. ""You can't try to shoehorn a supersonic aircraft into a subsonic standard.""
Aerion declined to comment further. 
It's not yet clear how other countries see supersonics or whether ICAO could craft a compromise. 
CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM 
Lengthy delays by ICAO would likely force planemakers to hold off, or risk investing millions in a design that ""no one will certify,"" said a U.S. industry source. 
""It's a chicken and egg argument,"" added the first industry source. ""How can you bring a plane to market if you don't have the standards to meet?"" The United States has urged ICAO to ""move forward expeditiously"" on new standards, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.
""The sooner the agencies finalize guidelines and standards, the sooner we can ensure our design meets those requirements,"" said Vik Kachoria, CEO of Boston-based Spike Aerospace, which hopes to select an engine for its jet early next year.
The European nations, however, are seeking robust data. In a separate document on emissions, they said they do not expect new standards ""before 2025 or later"" because of insufficient data.
Boom CEO Blake Scholl said he had faith that the international community would ultimate reach agreement on supersonic noise standards, due in part to customer demand to get to destinations faster.

""Supersonic flight will be a critical driver of human progress, and we believe Europe's citizens will embrace it,"" he said. ""We know noise is a sensitive issue, and we are designing with that in mind.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Many Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) products sold in Canada - from Febreze candles to Gillette shaving foam - will be affected by retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made goods after Canadian authorities rejected a request for exemptions, a P&G spokesman said on Wednesday.
P&G said Bounty paper towels, Charmin toilet tissue and Puffs facial tissue - made in a facility in Mehoopany, Pennsylvania - would be taxed, as would Cascade automatic dish washing detergent, Febreze aerosols, Pantene hair sprays and Olay body wash and more.
""The vast majority of our Canadian products are imported from the U.S.,"" P&G spokesman Damon Jones told Reuters.
Jones said P&G had unsuccessfully petitioned the International Trade Policy Division of Canada's Department of Finance for exemptions on its products.
A spokesman for Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau - whose department is responsible for granting such exemptions - was not immediately available for comment.
This month, Canada struck back at the Trump administration over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, imposing taxes on C$16.6 billion of U.S. packaged goods, steel and aluminum products.
It levied a 10 percent surtax on a wide range of consumer goods from soup and whiskey to hair-care and manicure products, according to a list by the Department of Finance. (https://tinyurl.com/y8w5g895)
P&G, the second-largest packaged goods company in the world after Nestle SA (S:NESN), said Canada accounted for about 3 percent of its total revenue of $65.1 billion last year. This amounts to just under $2 billion in sales from Canada, according to Reuters calculations.
Nestle had no immediate comment on how tariffs would affect its business, while Anglo-Dutch rival  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) declined to comment
Like other global consumer companies, P&G is already under pressure to boost sales as consumers flock to fresher products and newer brands. Profits in the industry have also taken a hit from rising commodities and freight costs, and as big retailers keep prices down to compete with Amazon.com (O:AMZN).
""We believe in free trade, putting us and our international competitors, wherever they are, on an equal playing ground. Tariffs create a barrier to that,"" Jones said.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Rising fares push Delta past profit estimates,"By Arunima Banerjee
(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) topped estimates for quarterly profit and operating revenue Thursday as a rise in average fares trumped an almost 40 percent surge in fuel costs, pushing shares higher.
Delta said it flew 3.2 percent more paying customers in the quarter and both average fares and adjusted total unit revenue - a closely-watched industry measure which compares sales with flight capacity - increased 4.6 percent.
Given the additional fuel costs, however, the airline also said that it planned to cut less profitable flights in its new schedule for the second half of this year.
""With strong revenue momentum, an improving cost trajectory, and a reduction of 50-100 bps (basis points) of underperforming capacity from our fall schedule, we have positioned Delta to return to margin expansion by year end,"" Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said. 
As developing middle classes in the world's big emerging economies including China and India fly more, global air passenger traffic has risen every month this year.
While that has bolstered airlines across the board, they are also facing the fallout of a more than doubling of crude oil prices since early 2016. 
The Atlanta-based airline reiterated it expected its fuel bill for the year to rise by $2 billion after a 38.8 percent jump in fuel costs in the second quarter. 
Those costs prompted Delta to cut its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $5.35 to $5.70 per share from $6.35 to $6.70 per share, months after bigger rival  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) also cut its full-year outlook.
Delta expects unit revenue to grow 3.5-5.5 percent in the third quarter. The company's board approved a 15 percent hike in dividend for the third quarter to 35 cents.
On an adjusted basis, Delta earned $1.77 per share in the second quarter, beating an estimate of $1.72, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Delta's total operating revenue rose 9.6 percent to $11.78 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' estimate of $11.72 billion.

Up to Wednesday's close, the company's stock had fallen 11 percent this year.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>","As Trump amps up trade war, China plays nice with foreign investors","By Michael Martina
BEIJING (Reuters) - Long accused of protectionist tactics that make it a difficult place for foreign firms to operate, China is trying to reverse that narrative amid an escalating trade war with the United States, green-lighting huge investments and portraying itself as a champion of openness.
But critics argue that despite its attempt to claim the moral high ground as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to apply more tariffs on Chinese imports, Beijing's recent moves to make it easier for foreign businesses to set up operations also effectively acknowledges that it has had discriminatory market barriers. 
This week, China agreed to a $10 billion petrochemicals project by Germany's BASF (DE:BASFn) that will be the first such plant in China that is wholly foreign-owned, not a joint venture.
It also approved a huge new wholly-owned Shanghai factory for U.S. electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), and a $2.3 billion joint venture organic light-emitting diode (OLED) plant to be built by South Korea's  LG Display  Co Ltd (KS:034220).
Responding to the Trump administration's latest plan to slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, Assistant Commerce Minister Li Chenggang said on Wednesday that China would not close itself to U.S. business. 
""I want to stress that the Chinese government's attitude to support business cooperation between the two countries will not change, its determination to push forward reforms and improve the business environment will not change, and its stance of opposing unilateralism and supporting multilateralism will not change,"" Li said at a business forum in Beijing on Wednesday.
“They go low, we go high,"" he said, in an apparent jab at Trump as he borrowed a phrase used by former U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama in the 2016 U.S. election campaign.
The recent investment announcements came as Premier Li Keqiang this week visited Germany. The two countries signed commercial accords worth 20 billion euros ($23.5 billion), including the BASF agreement. 
Chinese state media framed such cooperation in the context of the increasingly bitter trade dispute with Washington.
""The trade war should push China and the EU to cherish mutual cooperation, because this increasingly scarce cooperation is becoming more valuable,"" China's nationalist tabloid, the Global Times, said in an editorial on Wednesday.
'PROMISE FATIGUE'
As the threats in the trade dispute have increased, so too have signals from Beijing that it means to follow through on reforms. Chinese officials insist there is no link, and that it will open up at its own pace. Rising costs are also frustrating to foreign manufacturers in China. 
In recent weeks, China has issued a shorter list of areas closed to foreign investment, and committed to easing or eliminating foreign equity caps in sectors that include banking, insurance, securities, the auto industry, as well as in shipbuilding and aerospace. 
But the string of announcements come at a time when there has been slowing foreign investment into China and more vociferous complaints about Beijing's market barriers and the difficulty of doing business in the world's second-largest economy.
And Beijing is still holding up at least one major takeover involving foreign companies - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc's (O:QCOM) deal to buy Netherlands-based  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) . That has been waiting approval from China's antitrust regulator for months, leading to speculation among investors that the deal is being held hostage to the trade dispute with Washington.
Years of lackluster follow-through by China on its reform pledges has left what many in the foreign business community call ""promise fatigue"". 
Business leaders have been warning that if China didn't take real measures to address a lack of reciprocal market openness, it would sow retaliatory sentiment among its largest trading partners. And trade hardliners, particularly in the United States, had argued that Beijing would not make good on its pledges until other countries began imposing costs upon Beijing. 
European Union Chamber of Commerce in China President Mats Harborn on Tuesday called Trump's tariffs the ""sledgehammer approach"", but said the root cause of what China has termed the ""largest-scale trade war"" in economic history began in China. 
""The reason we are where we are is because the Chinese leadership did not proceed as quickly as we wanted as a trade community,"" Harborn told a news briefing. 
Some in the U.S. business community, while rueing the damage caused by Trump's tariffs, privately say Beijing's recent emphasis on accelerating reforms may not be a coincidence.
""Tariffs are biting. The Chinese are less confident internally than externally. They have never been tested this way,"" a U.S. industry source told Reuters, asking to not be named given the sensitivity of the matter.
Beijing has begun downplaying Made in China 2025, the state-backed industrial policy that has provoked alarm in the West and is core to Washington's complaints about the country's unfair trade practices. 
Propaganda authorities have also issued unusually strict rules limiting local media coverage of the trade war because of worries that unrestrained reporting could set off panic and roil its already jittery financial markets, sources within Chinese state media have said.
And European officials have said Beijing is trying to woo the EU with market access in return for standing with China against Trump's trade measures, though the Europeans, who share U.S. criticism of China but disapprove of Trump's tariffs, have largely refrained from taking sides. 
""By committing themselves to further openness. I think China hopes it can minimize the departure out of China of multinational firms,"" said Louis Kuijs, Hong Kong-based head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs (N:GS), the world's top cablemaker  Prysmian  (MI:PRY),  Nexans  (PA:NEXS) and eight other cable companies on Thursday lost their challenge against a 302 million euros ($352.6 million) EU cartel fine.
The companies had appealed to the General Court, Europe's second-highest court, asking for the European Commission's 2014 decision to be thrown out and their fines reduced.
The EU antitrust enforcer said the group ran a power cable cartel for almost 10 years from 1999, sharing markets and allocating customers between themselves. ABB (S:ABBN) escaped a 33 million euro sanction by alerting the authorities.
The court rejected their appeals.
""The General Court confirms the fines of over 300 million euros that the Commission imposed on the main European and Asian producers of (extra) high voltage power cables for their participation in a worldwide cartel,"" judges said.
Prysmian was hit with the biggest fine at 104.6 million euros, which included a joint fine of 37.3 million euros with Goldman Sachs. The bank acquired the Italian company via one of its private equity funds in 2005 but has since sold its holding.
Other cartel members were Japanese cable firms Exsym Corporation, J-Power Systems Corporation and Viscas Corporation, Korean peer LS Cable & System and General Cable Corp via its subsidiary Silec.
Fines were also given to Danish company NKT Holding (CO:NKT), South Korean firm Taihan Electric Wire (KS:001440), Mitsubishi Cable Industries [MTCBL.UL], Sumitomo Electric Industries (T:5802) and  Hitachi Metals Ltd  (T:5486). Sumitomo and Hitachi were J-Power Systems' previous owners.
Antitrust enforcers in Japan, South Korea and Australia have already levied million-dollar fines against cable companies for anti-competitive practices.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A month after Cyril Ramaphosa took the helm of South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) in December, he called an urgent meeting with then-President Jacob Zuma and senior ministers to save state power firm Eskom.
Ramaphosa understood sweeping changes were needed at the struggling utility company. He persuaded Zuma to replace Eskom's board and name a new chief executive to appease investors such as the World Bank, according to an official at the meeting.
It was Ramaphosa's first major policy intervention since becoming ANC leader and signaled a determination to reform Eskom, a company nearing breaking point after a string of corruption scandals during Zuma's nine years in office.
Eskom is critical to South Africa. It supplies more than 90 percent of the country's power, has 220 billion rand ($17 billion) of state-guaranteed debt and is often cited as a threat to South Africa's credit ratings, which are near junk status.
""If Eskom were to collapse, it would be a catastrophe for generations to come,"" said the official, who declined to be named. ""Ramaphosa explained to Zuma that it was time to act.""
Ramaphosa still faces a battle keeping Eskom afloat: new instances of fraud under the firm's previous management are still being uncovered, a sluggish economy means demand for power is tepid and powerful labor unions are likely to resist change.
But what may help Ramaphosa is a realization in the upper echelons of the ANC that Eskom is no longer untouchable, sources in the ruling party said.
Since replacing Zuma as president in February, Ramaphosa has pressed on with reform, surprising many with the speed at which he is addressing problems at Eskom that have festered for years.
Ramaphosa appointed respected former finance minister Pravin Gordhan to guide turnaround efforts, directed new executives to produce a plan to stabilize the company's finances and halted a nuclear deal supported by Zuma that could have saddled Eskom with billions of dollars of additional debt.
Asked for comment about Ramaphosa's role in efforts to reform Eskom, his spokeswoman Khusela Diko said the president met regularly with Gordhan to discuss Eskom and that revamping the company was a priority.
A spokesman for Zuma was not available for comment.
'NO OTHER OPTION'
Eskom also employs 47,000 people and has powerful labor unions, some allied with the ANC and others more militant, that have said they will resist attempts to cut the workforce and fight moves to privatize the company.
However, ANC sources say Ramaphosa has secured the backing of senior figures in the ruling party for a radical overhaul of Eskom, one which will involve attracting greater private investment into the electricity supply industry.
""From an ideological standpoint, Eskom presents a real challenge for the ANC,"" said a source in the ANC executive close to Ramaphosa. ""Greater private sector involvement does not sit well with some in the party, but there is no other option.""
The official involved in the meeting with Zuma, who holds a senior position in the ANC, said there had been a discussion about which assets should be considered ""non-core"" and sold.
The idea that outside investors may be needed to save the company is a dramatic shift for a political party that has rejected any form of privatization of Eskom for years.
The desire for change is partly driven by a realization that Eskom is more fragile than many believed. The situation came to a head in November when the World Bank held a flurry of meetings with senior government officials.
Eskom had less than 10 billion rand of cash, commercial banks had suspended lending and government officials feared the World Bank might do the same at a time when South Africa's last investment-grade credit ratings were hanging by a thread.
Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the World Bank expressed ""concerns on progress made on a specific project"" at a meeting with Eskom executives and also raised governance concerns but had not told the company it planned to withdraw funding.
A senior World Bank official said Eskom, which has borrowed $3 billion from the bank for projects including the Medupi coal-fired plant and renewables ventures, had not defaulted on World Bank loans and the lender did not threaten to suspend lending.

'NEW DUSK'
While commercial banks resumed lending when Zuma stepped down and the company finally published long-delayed financial results, Ramaphosa has since faced more Eskom challenges.
Workers went on strike in June over pay, forcing the utility to cut power supplies over three days for the first time since 2015, when rolling blackouts cost the economy billions of dollars a month.
As South Africans huddled around candles again, commentators joked that Ramaphosa's pledge to usher in a ""New Dawn"" after a decade of stagnation had turned into a ""New Dusk"".
Eskom had proposed a wage freeze due to financial constraints, even though inflation is running at about 5 percent. The unions were holding out for an increase of at least 15 percent in an increasingly acrimonious dispute.
Ramaphosa used his close ties to South Africa's largest union federation COSATU (Congress of South African Trade Unions) to make headway and in what was seen by unions as an unusual move, Gordhan intervened personally.
Gordhan called COSATU to a meeting last month and promised that Eskom would rethink its refusal to raise wages, setting the stage for a deal of about 7 percent that is being ironed out.
""It was unprecedented that Minister Gordhan met us to unlock the dispute,"" said Sdumo Dlamini, president of COSATU, which has more than 10,000 members at Eskom via its National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) affiliate. ""The talks were constructive, and we agreed to meet again to discuss Eskom.""
Ramaphosa formerly held a senior position in NUM and COSATU supported his bid to become ANC leader.
'WAR ROOM'
While Ramaphosa's resolve to fix Eskom doesn't seem in doubt, most analysts believe it will still take time.
""After the maladministration and corruption under the previous management, the new board is a step in the right direction,"" said Ronald Chauke, energy portfolio manager at South Africa's Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse.
""But it will take five to 10 years to restructure Eskom properly. Ramaphosa will need a war room to fix the rot.""
Attempts to sell off parts of Eskom will be vehemently opposed by some labor unions and conservative sections of the ANC wary of relinquishing control over parts of the power grid.
The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), a militant group with several thousand Eskom workers, has called for a meeting with Gordhan, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene and other unions to discuss Eskom.
""We are vigilant about plans to restructure state firms because that usually leads to job losses,"" NUMSA general secretary Irvin Jim said. ""We reject privatizing Eskom with the contempt it deserves.""
Analysts say any cuts to Eskom's bloated workforce are likely to be delayed until after next year's national election, where high unemployment will be a hot-button issue.
But Ramaphosa, who played a key role in talks to end white minority rule more than two decades ago, has a reputation for making headway in difficult negotiations.
Ramaphosa could also reduce Eskom's debt without incurring the wrath of opponents of privatization by converting debt held by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which invests government employees' pension money, into equity, said analysts.
The state-run PIC held more than 80 billion rand of Eskom debt last year.
""Ramaphosa won't make quick progress with the radical restructuring needed to shore up Eskom's balance sheet as he balances divergent interests in the ANC before the election,"" said Darias Jonker, director for Africa at Eurasia Group.
""But he will get there eventually.""
