(Reuters) - U.S. luxury department-store chain Barneys New York Inc has reached an agreement to sell its assets to brand developer Authentic Brands Group and investment bank B. Riley Financial Inc (O:RILY), a court document showed.
The deal comes as a ""stalking horse purchase agreement"", with the price estimated to be about $271.4 million in cash, according to the court filing on Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Poughkeepsie.
A ""stalking horse"" bid is used as a starting bid or minimally accepted offer that other interested bidders must surpass if they want to buy the company.
Any further bids must be received before a deadline on Oct. 22, according to the filing. In the absence of further bids by the deadline, the company will go ahead with the deal with Authentic Brands and B. Riley.
If it receives a bid before the deadline, Barneys may conduct an auction until Oct. 24.
Reuters reported on Monday that Barneys, which filed for bankruptcy protection in August citing rent hikes as a factor, was nearing a deal with Authentic Brands that could lead to Barneys shops opening in Saks Fifth Avenue stores.
Barneys is encouraged by the agreement but is also ""actively pursuing"" additional options, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing a company spokeswoman.
Authentic Brands could possibly keep some Barneys stores open based on talks with landlords, the Journal reported, citing a source.
A group led by fashion executive Sam Ben-Avraham has explored a bid for Barneys and was continuing to work on a potential deal that envisions keeping many of the retailer's current stores open, a source told Reuters on Monday.
Barneys is one of the most high-profile victims of the downturn in retail, and underscores how even luxury department stores are not immune from fierce competition with e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ), Toys ""R"" Us Inc and Gymboree Group Inc have also filed for bankruptcy in the last two years.
Without an offer, Barneys faced winding down its business entirely.
The company made its name in the 1930s by placing women dressed in barrels outside beer halls in New York City, where they handed out matchbooks advertising the store, according to the retailer's website.

The store, now known for exclusive apparel made by designers such as  Burberry  Group Plc (L:BRBY), began as a destination for middle-class families. It transitioned to luxury fashion in the 1960s.

(Reuters) - A year after Canada legalized use of recreational marijuana cannabis stocks have lost half their market value, and investors betting that the launch of higher-margin pot-infused drinks and other products will quickly lift shares may be in for a bumpy ride. 
So-called cannabis 2.0 - legalization of marijuana derivatives including edibles, beverages, extracts and vape pens - takes effect on Thursday, with sales seen beginning in mid-December. While that is expected to help sagging share prices, the crucial factor for a turnaround is a significant increase in the number of stores selling the products, investors, companies and analysts said. 
Share prices in the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF have slumped as companies' revenues missed expectations. Cannabis producers, investors and analysts have blamed Canadian regulations that have slowed the opening of new retail outlets, strangled sales and imposed higher costs. 
Investment bank and advisory firm Seaport Global figures Canada needs about 1,055 stores to realize the cannabis market's true potential.
About half that number currently exist, with about 300 of those stores in Alberta, which has looser regulations than the rest of the country, while the most populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec have lagged far behind. 
""We would probably give the first year a C minus,"" said Seaport Global analyst Brett Hundley, giving the industry performance a barely passing grade. The slow roll-out of stores ""creates a real problem for Canadian licensed producers, because they've expanded rapidly with cultivation and production facilities and have nowhere to go,"" he added. Lackluster results from cannabis producers ""will continue and potentially worsen,"" Hundley cautioned. 
Canada's biggest cannabis companies including Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis reported larger-than-expected losses in the latest quarter and pushed back their timelines to profitability, blaming their woes on the need for more stores to sell their wares. 
Regulations for the new marijuana products market, which include restricting each package to 10 milligrams of THC - the psychoactive compound in cannabis - will add to companies' costs, said Ryan Greer, co-chairman of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce's National Cannabis Working Group, which is made up of Canadian marijuana companies. 
With each province responsible for its own retail rules and taxes, the fragmented approach to regulating the industry will continue to raise costs and create distortions in the market, Greer said. 
INVESTORS SPOOKED
One such distortion is evident in prices, with consumer paying far higher prices for legal weed, according to industry experts.
""Too high a level of taxation at the inception of a legal consumer system can be a disincentive for consumers to make that move from black market to legal market,"" said Aurora Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley. 
Challenges facing the industry and disappointing financial results have spooked investors who had piled into the sector amid initial euphoria in the run-up to legalization of recreational cannabis last Oct. 17. 
""Now, this year these companies are coming more under the microscope by investors and people are saying, 'hey, when are you going to start making money?'"" said Andrew Kessner, analyst at William O'Neill & Co. 
The current investor attitude reflects the search for clarity on the real long-term value of these companies. 
""With any emerging industry/market, you'll see incredible exuberance around it, and sometimes irrational pricing,"" said Emily Paxhia, co-founder of Poseidon Asset Management, which focuses on cannabis investments. ""Future capital is going to expect a more prudent approach."" 
An investment in excess of $4 billion in Canopy led brewer Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) to report a quarterly loss this month. But Canopy Chief Executive Mark Zekulin remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for the industry. 
""It takes a lot of capital money, a lot of operating money, bringing these large facilities up to scale,"" Zekulin told Reuters.

""But at the end of the day,"" he said, ""the multi-100-billion-dollar cannabis opportunity that existed yesterday still exists today.""

Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing considers the self-ruled island a wayward province and part of ""one China"".
The incident involving the map occurred during a presentation Dior was making about its boutique network at Zhejiang Gongshang University in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, posts on China's Weibo social media platform showed.
A staff member at the university's careers office told Reuters that Dior had held a recruitment event on Wednesday and there had been an issue with the maps it had shown.

The transport ministry suspended Asiana Airlines' once-daily U.S. bound flight as a penalty linked to its deadly plane crash in San Francisco in 2013. Asiana had sought a court injunction against the measure.
The Supreme Court said insufficient staff training was the main cause of the crash and the government's punishment was legitimate.
The flight ban will be implemented before the end of February, the transport ministry said in a statement. 
Asiana would discuss the exact timing of the suspension with authorities, a company spokesman said, adding the punishment would cost about 11 billion won ($9.3 million) in lost sales. 
Asiana Airlines flight 214 crashed in San Francisco in 2013 when the plane's tail struck a seawall short of the runway, killing three teenage passengers from China and injuring more than 180 out of about 300 people on board.
The airline is struggling with falling travel demand to Japan amid diplomatic tension between Seoul and Tokyo.

Its top shareholder is also looking for a buyer to run the carrier.

(Reuters) - Five drugmakers and distributors are offering $22 billion in cash as well as drugs and services they value at $28 billion to resolve lawsuits alleging the industry fueled the U.S. opioid crisis, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The drug industry faces roughly 2,600 lawsuits brought by state and local governments, hospitals and other entities seeking to hold drugmakers and distributors responsible for the toll of opioid abuse. Local governments seek funds to cover costs of services in their communities.
Distributors McKesson Corp (N:MCK), AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) and  Cardinal Health  (N:CAH) have offered to pay $18 billion in cash over 18 years, while drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) would pay $4 billion in cash, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) has offered to give away medications it values at $15 billion as part of the deal and provide distribution services it values in the billions, one of the people said.
Both said that Teva's proposed agreement would run over 10 years and had a total estimated value of around $28 billion. However, it is not clear how the valuation was reached, and one source said some states are asking whether Teva should pay cash as well.
The negotiations are being led by the attorneys general for Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, one person said.
Teva and the three distributors are all defendants in a landmark trial set to begin in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday. U.S. District Judge Dan Polster, who has long pushed for a global settlement of the litigation, will preside over the trial.
The distributors, accused of failing to halt and report suspicious drug orders, are pushing for a settlement to be agreed to before the trial begins on Monday, one source said. The second source added that a sticking point was compensation for lawyers who typically are paid a percentage of settlements and represent many of the state and local plaintiffs.
The sources cautioned that there was no guarantee a deal would be struck. One source said lawyers for the thousands of cities and counties with cases pending in federal court have not yet agreed to back the proposal the states are negotiating.
In a joint statement late on Wednesday, the lead attorneys for the cities and counties pursuing federal lawsuits - Joe Rice, Paul Farrell and Paul Hanly - called media reports that they were tentatively supporting the settlement proposal ""inaccurate.""
""We await the fine print of the settlement framework so that we can work alongside the 2,600 communities we represent to determine the best path forward,"" they said.
Jury selection went ahead on Wednesday in anticipation of opening statements on Monday. Other defendants in the trial are Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) and  Henry Schein  Inc (O:HSIC).
Opioid addiction claimed roughly 400,000 lives in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The companies did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. J&J had said on Tuesday it was open to a settlement.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday for a new four-year labor deal, moving closer to ending a costly month-long strike that shut down GM's most profitable factories in a test of wills over the future of U.S. auto industry jobs.
Neither the UAW nor GM released details of the deal, which is subject to ratification by UAW members, a process that could last up to two weeks. A new contract is expected to include commitments by the automaker to invest billions in U.S. vehicle factories to build new generations of electric vehicles, as well as U.S. electric vehicle battery plants. Union leaders worry that a shift to electric vehicles could cost thousands of jobs at engine and transmission factories.
The longest nationwide strike against a Detroit automaker since 1970 became a political event. Democratic presidential candidates joined UAW picket lines, eager to win union votes in Midwest swing states. For his part, U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on GM Chief Executive Mary Barra before the strike to preserve jobs at a car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that she had targeted for closure.
Trump spoke individually with Barra and UAW President Gary Jones on Wednesday, spokesmen for GM and the union confirmed. The White House declined to comment on the discussions.
Details of GM's last offer emerged over the weekend and Reuters had reported that the company boosted the amount it plans to invest in the United States to about $9 billion from its previous offer of $7 billion. That figure is unchanged in the final agreement, a person briefed on the matter said. 
The deal also would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a ""substantial"" number of which will be new, the source said. GM in September said its initial offer would support 5,400 jobs - and a majority of those would be new jobs.
If the contract is ratified, UAW workers who have been living on $250 a week in strike pay are expected to get one-time signing bonuses, as well as increases to base pay. The union had also pushed for temporary workers at GM plants who earned less than permanent UAW employees to get an easier path to full-time wages and benefits.
GM shares closed 1.1% higher at $36.65 on Wednesday after rising as much as 2.6% during the day. Shares of some auto parts suppliers also rose after the UAW announced the tentative deal. The cost of the strike - and how quickly those costs can be recovered - will be a focus for investors as the automaker and its major suppliers report quarterly results over the next several days. 
Analysts have estimated the strike cost GM more than $2 billion in lost production, though some of that could be made up through overtime work. The strike halted production of GM's large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles - key drivers of the company's global profit. 
POLITICAL EVENT
The deal is not done yet. The union's national GM council will decide whether to accept the agreement during a meeting on Thursday. Then UAW members at GM will vote on the agreement. The strike continues at least until Thursday's meeting, the UAW said in a statement.
The strike began on Sept. 16, with about 48,000 hourly workers of the UAW union at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close, and the use of temporary workers.
GM's revised offer that emerged over the weekend also included an increase of its proposed ratification bonus by $1,000 to $9,000. GM also proposed 3% pay raises in the second and fourth year of the four-year-contract and 3% and 4% lump sum payments in the first and fourth year respectively. It agreed to make temporary workers with three years of service permanent and give those workers a $3,000 ratification bonus.
The final agreement is similar to that offer on pay and bonuses, but includes some enhancements, the person briefed on the matter said.
The automaker said during the talks that it had offered ""solutions"" for the Lordstown assembly plant and a large assembly plant in Detroit-Hamtramck that were targeted for closure. A group affiliated with electric truck maker Workhorse Group had proposed acquiring the Lordstown plant. GM also said it had proposed a ""union represented battery cell manufacturing site in the U.S.""
GM was considering using the Detroit-Hamtramck factory to build a new line of electric trucks, sources said. 
These proposals could have changed or been dropped in the final days of the talks.
If the deal is approved by the workers, the union will next begin negotiations with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA), covering many of the same issues. The UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM.
A successful ratification is not a sure thing as workers during the 2015 talks initially rejected a deal with FCA before eventually approving a revised offer.
SHARING THE REWARDS 
This year's talks have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union. 
For GM and the UAW, the bargaining came at a time of industry uncertainty following nine years of strong sales and robust profit, fueled by the trucks and SUVs built by UAW workers. GM's Barra and President Mark Reuss joined the bargaining on Tuesday, indicating a deal was close.
Union leaders said the rewards of GM's recovery from its 2009 bankruptcy had not been shared fairly. Inflation-adjusted wages for all U.S. auto workers have fallen 16% since 2010, and UAW workers at the Detroit Three have received only two base wage increases of 3% in the past nine years, according to CAR.

GM management, on the other hand, sees UAW wages as 26% higher than the average for non-union auto factories in the Southern (NYSE:SO) United States. High absenteeism and rich health benefits add to the cost burdens at a time when U.S. vehicle sales are projected to decline and automakers are funding investments in electric vehicles.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) added slightly more paying subscribers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter, a relief to investors who had worried the company might fall short just as  Disney  and Apple prepare to ramp up the streaming video wars.
The results for July through September represented a rebound from the previous quarter when Netflix lost U.S. streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for overseas subscribers. Shares of Netflix rose 9.2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $312.69.
That performance, combined with concerns about new competitors, had weighed on Netflix shares, which had fallen 21% from the last earnings report through regular trading on Wednesday.
For the third quarter, Netflix was boosted by new seasons of shows such as ""Stranger Things"" and ""13 Reasons Why."" The company added 6.77 million paid customers around the globe, topping the nearly 6.7 million average expectation of analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Netflix said it was on track to achieve full-year operating margins of 13% and was targeting another 300 basis point expansion in 2020.
Its total subscriber count topped 158 million.
Still, the company faces challenges.
""Netflix results were good enough that they assuaged concerns about price sensitivity and penetration levels in the domestic markets,"" said Fitch director Patrice Cucinello. ""A caveat is that competition hasn’t hit yet.""
The company projected it would pick up 7.6 million customers in the last three months of 2019. Analysts had expected a forecast of 9.4 million. The company will release a new installment of ""The Crown"" and Martin Scorsese film ""The Irishman"" during that time.
But it will face new competition starting in November from Disney+, a streaming service from Walt Disney Co (N:DIS) that will be stocked with movies and TV shows from Disney's popular Marvel, ""Star Wars,"" animation and other properties.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) also will debut a much smaller streaming video service with original programming in November. AT&T Inc's (N:T) HBO Max, and a new offering from Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), are expected to enter the market next year.
Netflix argued that the new services would increase interest in the streaming video market broadly.
""In our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment,"" the company wrote in a letter to investors.
Netflix acknowledged, however, that it was still taking a hit from price increases earlier this year in the United States. ""Retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower U.S. membership growth,"" it said.
The most popular Netflix plan in the United States costs $13, nearly double the $7-per-month cost for Disney+. Apple TV+ will debut at $5 per month.
Netflix said its additional revenue would allow it to continue to invest ""to further strengthen our value proposition.""
For the third quarter, Netflix's net income rose to $665 million, or $1.47 per share, from $403 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. That topped Wall Street's concensus target of $1.04.
Total revenue rose to $5.25 billion from about $4 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.52 billion.
The debt that Netflix has amassed has sparked concern among some investors. The company said in the earnings report that it expected free cash flow to improve in 2020 and annually beyond that. In the meantime, Netflix will continue to tap the high-yield market as needed, it said.
In the next earnings report, Netflix will begin disclosing revenue and membership by regions - Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East/Africa, Latin America and the United States, the company said."

HO CHI MINH CITY/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Just next to Ho Chi Minh City's financial district, two dozen street vendors' stalls display colorful adverts for e-wallets backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, ride-hailing firm Grab and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, among others.
Between them, the stalls - selling everything from crab soup to Vietnamese Banh My sandwiches - accept payment from most of Vietnam's 28 different e-wallets, which also allow users to make cash transfers through their mobile phones.
The wallets, which hope to take advantage of Vietnam's plan to become a cashless economy by 2027, compete fiercely to gain many users to help them to turn a profit, a battle for market share replicated across Southeast Asia.
Not all of them will survive. Already, the region's crowded mobile payments sector is starting to shrink, with each national market expected to support only two mass e-wallets, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman.
""The e-wallets spend a lot of money on attracting customers and retaining them, getting them to use the wallet in their daily life,"" said Duncan Woods, head of Oliver Wyman's Asia Pacific retail and business banking practice.
""When you've got so many of them out there, it's about who's got the deepest pockets,"" he said.
Southeast Asia has at least 150 e-wallet license holders, and firms including Grab, Go-Jek, Tencent Holdings, Ant Financial, Singapore Telecom, AirAsia and dozens of fintech firms are fighting for dominance.
Many have the cash. Grab plans to invest $500 million in its Vietnam business, with payments a focus area. Softbank's Vision Fund and GIC invested $300 million in e-wallet VNPAY's parent company in July, and e-wallet Momo raised $100 million from Warburg Pincus in January, according to news publication DealStreetAsia.
Some are using the cash to build scale, others to buy it, as they race to secure a dominant position in a mobile payments market estimated by Nomura to grow seven-fold to $109 billion by 2025.
MERGER MANIA
Softbank-backed Grab is in talks to merge its Indonesian digital payments firm, OVO, and Ant Financial-backed Dana, both of which are among Indonesia's top five e-wallets, to bulk up and power ahead of rival Gojek, sources said.
In Vietnam, e-wallet Vimo merged with payment processer mPOS and rebranded as NextPay in June - and kicked off a $30 million fundraising round and an ambitious growth plan.
""We expect to be present across Vietnam and win 50% of the market with 300,000 acceptance points by 2023 from 60,000 merchants now,"" NextPay's CEO Nguyen Huu Tuat said, while noting that getting customers to change their habits was a challenge.
Street sellers in Ho Chi Minh City echoed this view, despite government efforts to change behavior.
Some wallets, including the partnership between local firm Moca and Grab, offer buyers discounts of up to 30% if they use their wallet, stallholders said.
""I want to comply with the government's cashless plan although I'm not very fond of it, so I offer 'morning cash, afternoon card'"" one merchant, Huong, said when Reuters visited her noodle stall.
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES
Attracting users is essential as a tipping point looms.
""E-wallet consolidation at a regional and local level is highly likely as products mature and consumers migrate to those who offer the most services,"" said Phil Pomford, an APAC general manager at fintech firm FIS.
""One likely play would involve one of the big global and/or regional super apps consolidating services across South East Asia.""
The region's largest players, including ride hailing-turned super apps Grab and Go-Jek, are betting that becoming the main payment method will bind consumers into their networks and offer them higher margin services — a model that  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent pioneered in China.
""One of the reasons our payments business has seen such success is because we've had a very intentional strategy of developing the largest merchant network, whether it's offline, it's online or whether it's on-demand,"" Grab's president, Ming Maa told Reuters.
Others have looked to use an e-wallet as an add-on to their existing businesses. Users of AirAsia's BigPay wallet can earn AirAsia travel rewards by using the wallet, which they also hope can become a mainstream payment method.
Tencent and Alibaba and its affiliates have primarily focused on Chinese tourists using their wallets in Southeast Asia and have also each invested in wallets in almost every market in the region.
Grab says it is the only digital payments provider in Southeast Asia with access to e-money licenses in six major economies, making it the furthest on with a regional approach.
Some observers are still skeptical however.
""Many e-wallets' business model seems to be: 1) gain a lot of customers and their data. 2) question mark. 3) be very profitable,"" said Dmitry Levit a partner at VC firm Cento, which has invested into several payment-processing companies, but stayed away from wallets.
Go-Jek is not worried about competition from other wallets or incumbents, said Aldi Haryopratomo, CEO of Go-Pay, the company's payment platform.
""By being the payments provider that connects the driver to the bank, we are able to make sufficient margin. And if you always think about competition and threat from the banks, then you are thinking that the pie is fixed,"" said Haryopratomo.
""But in Indonesia, the pie is actually getting bigger."""

 IBM , which wrapped up its acquisition of Linux maker Red Hat Inc (NYSE:RHT) earlier this year, has faced years of revenue decline amid its shift to the cloud from its traditional businesses, including mainframe servers.
Sales from global technology services, IBM's biggest unit that caters to some of the world's largest data centers, were weighed down by lower client business volumes, mainly in the UK and Germany, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said on a post-earnings call.
After a down-cycle, the company expects mainframe business to return to a normal product cycle in the fourth quarter, Kavanaugh told Reuters.
Revenue from IBM's cloud services rose 11% to $5 billion, helping the company beat profit expectations for the quarter.
Total revenue fell 3.9% to $18.03 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $18.22 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue dropped 0.6%.
IBM's global technology services unit reported a 5.6% drop in revenue to $6.70 billion.
CLOUD FOCUS
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, who has led IBM for more than seven years, is betting on subscription-based software offerings with the Red Hat deal, the company's biggest acquisition so far.
However, IBM has said that it would report only a portion of Red Hat's actual revenue for some quarters, while recording all its expenses as required by U.S. accounting standards.
The cloud and cognitive software unit, which includes Red Hat, reported a 6.4% rise in revenue to $5.28 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30.
Net income fell to $1.67 billion, or $1.87 per share, from $2.69 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding special items, the company earned $2.68 per share, 1 cent above analysts' estimate.

The Dow component's shares, which have gained about 25% this year, were down 5.4% at $134.44 in extended trading.

16,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 06:04PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Economic Data Deluge Due
With weaker retail sales data reported Wednesday raising some concern that the consumer may not be able to continue to keep the U.S. economy afloat, traders will turn attention to a slew of data on housing, manufacturing and industrial production for further insight into the economic backdrop. 
The Commerce Department will report on housing starts and building permits for September at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that housing starts fell 8.6% to an annual rate of 1.320 million last month.
Building permits, an indication of future demand, are predicted to show a decline of 5.6% to 1.340 million.
On the heels of the housing data, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank will release its measure of manufacturing activity in the region. The Philly Fed index is expected to have fallen to a reading of 7.3 from 12.0 last month, as manufacturing activity has been dogged by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.
The Labor Department, meanwhile, releases its weekly count of people who filed for unemployment insurance last week. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims rose to 212,000 from 210,000 previously.
Elsewhere, U.S. industrial production activity for September due at 9:15 AM ET (13:15 GMT) is expected to have declined 0.1%.
2. Crude Oil Set for Fifth-Straight Weekly Build?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, will likely prove a timely distraction as the uncertainty around the US-China trade deal has done little to ease investors concerns about falling demand amid a slowing global economy.
The EIA is expected to report a build in crude stockpiles of 2.88 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 11. Domestic crude inventories have increased for four-straight weeks.
Crude oil futures rose 1% to settle at $59.34 a barrel on Wednesday amid hopes that OPEC and its allies will decide to cut output further at a meeting in December; 
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data - which often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels - that showed weekly crude stockpiles rose by 10.5 million barrels last week, compared with an estimate of about 2.9-million-barrel build.
Oil prices moved lower in response.
3. Netflix Earnings Cheer; IBM Results Do Not
After Wednesday's close, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares moved up more than 8% after the streaming media giant reported earnings that beat estimates. Netflix reported 6.8 million new subscribers. Its estimate of 7.6 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter was lower than the expectation for 9.5 million new subscribers.
The upside is that the lower estimate wasn't as bad as feared. Netflix faces a host of new video streaming competition from the likes of Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and others.
Netflix) said a fee increase has enabled the company to maintain a stable revenue stream and that's expected to continue. 
  IBM   (NYSE:IBM), meanwhile, reported $2.68 a share in earnings that beat the Investing.com estimate of $2.67. Revenue was a tad lighter than expected.
Shares fell about 4.5% after hours.  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) has been slowly building up its cloud-computing offerings and reducing its concentration in its traditional mainframe business."

Benchmark prices at the AECO hub, which plunged close to zero in June, have already rebounded to $1.77 per million British thermal unit. Nieboer expects prices to strengthen in coming months.
Meanwhile, gas explorer Paramount Resources Ltd. and service provider CES Energy Solutions Corp. are looking at acquisitions if the price is right, according to CFOs Bernard Lee and Tony Aulicino. For CES, any deal would have to meet its goal to keep generating healthy cash flow, Aulicino said.
For all of Canada’s pipeline woes, Aulicino is optimistic about the finances of oil-sands companies.
The major players in Canada’s oil sands are “some of the best capitalized,” he said. “There are a lot of reasons to like that business.”
Ontario’s Phillips Open to Diversifying Debt: Canada Bond Update (14:40)
Ontario is open to diversifying its borrowing base, though most of its 30% foreign allocation will remain in U.S. dollars, Finance Minister Rod Phillips said.
The world’s biggest sub-sovereign borrower has issued about C$20.4 billion of its targeted C$36 billion ($27.3 billion) borrowing program for 2019-20. The majority of that has been Canadian debt, followed by the U.S. and a small slice of Australian bonds.
Phillips said Canada’s most populous province is committed to its pledge of balancing the budget by 2023-24 and to getting a handle on debt to create attractive conditions for investors.“We’re really focused on a very prudent plan,” so are keeping to that time horizon, Phillips said at Bloomberg’s Canadian Fixed Income conference in New York Wednesday.
National Bank CEO Open to Wealth Takeovers (1:25 p.m.)
National Bank of Canada’s Chief Executive Officer Louis Vachon says he’s not a fan of acquisitions, yet he’d still consider a deal to expand the Montreal-based lender’s wealth management division domestically.
“Essentially all of our acquisitions in the last 12 years in Canada have been in the wealth management space,” Vachon said Wednesday at the Bloomberg Canada Fixed Income Conference in New York. “So on the wealth management space we continue to be interested -- but they have to make sense from a financial standpoint and from a cultural standpoint.”
Vachon reiterated that he isn’t looking to do further international acquisitions, after doing C$625 million ($475 million) of investments in African and Asian lenders in the past five years, including a takeover of Cambodia’s Advanced Bank of Asia Ltd. National Bank is focusing on expanding the Cambodian lender as well as its U.S. specialty finance division, Credigy, while looking to sell its African investments, Vachon said.
Despite his deal-making during his 12-year tenure, Vachon said he’s “very skeptical” of acquisitions and prefers building from within.
“I don’t like acquisitions: I feel they’re risky, they really take a lot of time and attention, sometimes out of proportion to the financial impact they can potentially have,” Vachon said. “Our team knows that when they bring an acquisition thing to me it has to be a pretty damn good thing, because my first thing I’ll say is, ‘No, don’t bother me.’”
“I want my team to focus on organic growth, and capital management,” Vachon said.
WeWork Co-Working Model Here to Stay (12:18 p.m.)
Co-working is here to stay despite the troubles faced by WeWork, which popularized the movement, Oxford Properties Group’s chief financial officer said.
“The success of the organization just highlighted a need and a customer base that probably wasn’t being served as well as it could have been,” Allison Wolfe said at Bloomberg’s Canadian Fixed Income Conference on Wednesday.
Still co-working is unlikely to take a major share of the Canadian market, according to Cecilia Williams (NYSE:WMB), chief financial officer at Allied Properties REIT.
When it entered the market maybe five years ago WeWork was looking for tenant improvements but weren’t willing to offer a guarantee or provide a covenant, Williams said. “And it just really didn’t make sense for owners of assets in the city to engage in a transaction with those terms given the strength of the market.”
Last month, New York-based WeWork was a seemingly unstoppable force. It was the fastest-growing co-working firm in the world with billions invested by SoftBank Group Corp. plus a highly anticipated initial public offering that would unlock even more cash for growth. Now, its IPO has collapsed, its controversial co-founder Adam Neumann has stepped down as CEO and it’s racing to get new financing before running out of cash as early as end of November.
Trudeau Leads In Election But Not by Much (12 p.m.)
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s party leads his top rival in safe districts ahead of Canada’s election next week, but is bleeding support to smaller parties while many races remain too close to call, polling shows.
Seat projections by Nanos Research, unveiled Wednesday at Bloomberg’s Canadian Fixed Income Conference in New York, showed Trudeau’s Liberals are on pace to win at least 127 of the parliament’s 338 seats, with the Conservatives next with at least 84 seats. Another 95 seats remain too close to call in the Oct. 21 vote, while smaller parties are on the rise.
The Liberals’ vote is more efficient than the Conservatives’ and translates more easily to gaining districts, Nanos said. More than one in four remain toss-ups, with the election set to be decided in Toronto’s suburbs, known by their 905 area code, and on the Pacific Coast, he said. None of the parties currently has enough support to win a majority, he said.
“It’s battleground 905 and also British Columbia,” Nanos said. The Conservatives are at 33% support nationally, compared with 32% for the Liberals, Nanos polling shows. “In Ontario, the Liberals are still doing well but watch the 905 because the Conservatives need to do better in the 905 in order to do well in the election.”
Infrastructure Investment Getting Harder: Tanyeri (11 a.m.)
Investing in infrastructure across Canada has become increasingly difficult for investors on the private side, pushing many companies into the U.S., according to John Tanyeri, head of infrastructure and project finance at MetLife (NYSE:MET) Investment Management.
“In 2019, it’s been very hard to invest not only because there’s been less opportunity but also as a natural U.S. liability company, we have to swap everything back to U.S. dollars so given that most of the 3Ps trade relatively tight, when you swap back to USD, it’s made it very difficult for us to match liabilities,” Tanyeri said at Bloomberg’s Canadian Fixed Income Conference in New York on Wednesday.
Canada is also a much smaller market in comparison, making it harder to find investments compared to its southern neighbor, which has a broader scope.
“If we want to grow, our growth has to come from the U.S. -- that’s the natural step for most Canadian firms,” said George Theodoropoulos, managing partner at Fengate Asset Management. In the U.S.
To be sure, Canada still has some attractive infrastructure investment opportunities and its strong underlying credit provides investors more security, according to Ruth McMorrow, president of enterprises at Parsons Corp.
“The cost of bidding on a deal in the Canadian market is substantially less than bidding in the U.S,” McMorrow said. In the U.S., “It’s a more litigious society so you have a lot more lawyers involved. But the Canadian market for us really provides great opportunity.”
Still, Canada has some challenges moving forward, Tanyeri said. “When you look at the infrastructure gap, it’s probably anywhere from C$200 to C$300 billion currently,” he added.
Quebec Finance Minister Sees Stronger Growth (10:30 a.m.)
Quebec Finance Minister Eric Girard said the province will raise its 2019 GDP forecast when it releases its economic update on Nov. 7.
The economy is on track to expand by 2.5% or more in 2019, according to economists at Laurentian Bank Securities in Montreal, making the 1.8% estimate in the March budget appear conservative.
“All I commit to say is that it will be higher,” Girard said. All components of the economy, including consumption, labor markets and investments are “very solid.”
Long one of Canada’s fiscal laggards, Quebec has turned into a poster child of budget discipline. Girard is planning to balance the budget for a fifth straight year, allowing the province to set aside hefty reserves to weather a downturn while reducing a debt burden that’s still the second-highest among provinces.
Girard said Quebec aims to raise potential gross domestic product to 2% and the province has the tools to stimulate the economy in case of a slowdown.
A June report showed the preliminary surplus for the last fiscal year was higher than expected, giving the government even more room for maneuver.
The commitment to lower debt has helped Quebec’s borrowing costs slip below those of Ontario, which doesn’t plan to eliminate its budget shortfall until fiscal 2023-2024.
Rosenberg Sees BoC Cutting Rates Four Times (10 a.m.)
The Bank of Canada will have to cut interest rates four times with the Canadian economy facing an 80% chance of recession in the next 12 months, according to David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc.
Canada’s economy has little going for it except crude, cannabis and condos, and will be dragged into a global slowdown, Rosenberg said at Bloomberg’s Canadian Fixed Income Conference in New York on Wednesday.
“The global economy is cooling off substantially. We are in a growth recession, and with a lag that’s going to come back and it’s going to hit the Canadian economy,” Rosenberg said. “It’s going to swamp the fiscal stimulus that we’re going to see.”
Rosenberg’s view wasn’t shared by National Bank of Canada Chief Economist Stefane Marion, who sees no rate cut from the Bank of Canada with inflation doggedly around the target. Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, sees the central bank beginning to cut in 2020.
So far, the Bank of Canada is bucking global trends and showing no signs that it will cut rates with inflation coming in at 1.9% for September, around its 2% target. And the markets aren’t expecting one either, pricing in a 12% probability for a rate cut by the end of the year.
The consensus view is that slower growth is on the horizon with economists expecting Canadian gross domestic product to decelerate to 1.5% from 1.9% last year. That’s compared with 2.3% forecast in 2019 for the U.S. from 2.9% in the prior year.
“The drivers of the economy continue to be our old friends of housing in particular coming back, but in terms of investment and trade we don’t have a huge amount of optimism surrounding those sectors,” Caranci said during the discussion.
Still, the Canadian economy has remained fairly resilient in the face of global weakness. The labor market continues to be a bright spot with low unemployment, steady job gains and rising wages. The housing market has begun to rebound and Canada reported better-than-expected output in the second quarter.
“The Bank of Canada should be hiking rates, not lowering rates,” Marion said, adding that the fundamentals that underpin the Canadian economy are still quite strong.
While Rosenberg sees a big chance of recession in Canada, Marion sees it at 30% and Caranci sees a 30% to 40% chance."
19,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Netflix Rallies After Overseas Growth Eases Investor Worries,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). gave investors just enough good news Wednesday to let them to breathe a sigh of relief.
The shares rallied after the company posted slightly better-than-expected subscriber growth overseas in the third quarter, making up for a far smaller gain at home. Earnings also topped Wall Street estimates, helping investors look past a tepid forecast for the final quarter of the year.
After a disappointing quarter three months ago, investors came in with lower expectations this time around. And Netflix cleared that bar, sending the shares up as much as 11% in late trading.
“We’re making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress,” Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.
The world’s largest paid online TV network signed up 6.3 million new users outside the U.S., beating forecasts. Even though domestic subscriptions missed analysts, they at least rebounded from a decline in the previous quarter. Netflix expects to sign 7 million more international customers during the current three months.
International markets account for almost all of Netflix’s growth -- and most of its total customers. Gains in the U.S. last quarter amounted to just 520,000 new accounts. A new season of “La Casa de Papel,” a Spanish heist series, boosted interest abroad, especially in Latin America and Europe.
“Stranger Things,” meanwhile, was viewed by 64 million people in its first four weeks, the most-watched series to date. The teen science-fiction show, now in its third season, is the service’s biggest hit at home.
Netflix expects to add a total of 7.6 million more customers in the fourth quarter -- fewer than analysts expected. While the final three months of the year are typically among the strongest, the company will face new competition from the Disney+ and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ streaming services.
Netflix shares rose as high as $318.79 in extended trading. The stock has taken a beating since July, dropping 21% since last quarter’s miss. It closed at $286.28 in regular trading on Wednesday.
U.S. Woes
Third-quarter revenue grew 31% to $5.24 billion, just shy of Wall Street projections. Profit increased to $1.47 a share, easily beating analysts’ estimates of $1.05.
This quarter, the company forecasts profit of 51 cents a share on revenue of $5.44 billion. Both are below Wall Street estimates.
In the U.S., there wasn’t much to cheer about. The company is going to post its weakest growth at home in years, adding just 2.7 million customers this year. A recent price increase contributed to the slowdown, Netflix said.
The company also is bracing for fresh competition this quarter.
“The launch of these new services will be noisy,” Netflix said in its letter. “There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long term, though, we expect we’ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.”

“The economy is working with an almost-closed output gap,” he told a New York audience in response to questions at an event on Wednesday. “Why would you spend money when you are operating at full capacity?”
Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, has near record-low unemployment but is probably now in recession as trade tensions hit exports and a manufacturing slump spreads to the services sector. Yet the government is running a budget surplus and insists it will continue to balance its books. The European Central Bank, where Weidmann sits on the decision-making Governing Council, has repeatedly called on nations with such fiscal space to use it.
There are signs the mood is shifting. Lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat-led group, among the key opponents of finance ministry plans to respond to any economic hit, are starting to soften their stance, according to two people familiar with party discussions.
Read more: Biggest Opponents of German Fiscal Stimulus Are Coming Round
Weidmann, a longstanding opponent of much of the ECB’s monetary stimulus, said there’s no need to rush into fiscal stimulus as automatic stabilizers such as unemployment benefits will in any case pick up.
“In the short term, some additional fiscal spending might be possible,” he said in his speech. “However, with respect to macroeconomic stabilization, any further stimulus appears unnecessary, unless a perceptible deterioration in the economic outlook becomes apparent. Germany’s output gap is about to close and forecasts don’t foresee a marked deterioration.”"
21,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 05:18PM ET</span>","South Africa Faces Second Day of Rolling Blackouts, Eskom Says","(Bloomberg) -- South Africa’s struggling state-owned power utility said it expects to implement a second day of controlled blackouts to prevent a total collapse of the electricity grid amid a shortage of capacity.
Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which provides about 95% of the nation’s electricity, is still experiencing “severe generation capacity challenges,” it said in a statement late Wednesday. The cuts are “a measure of last resort,” it said.
South Africa’s rand weakened Wednesday after the utility announced that it would cut 2,000 megawatts from the grid due to unplanned breakdowns at its plants. Eskom last implemented the controlled outages it calls “loadshedding” more than six months ago.
The troubled utility, seen as the biggest threat to the economy, has amassed 450 billion rand ($30 billion) of debt and relies on state bailouts to remain solvent. It’s battled to meet demand for electricity because most of its plants are old and have been poorly maintained.
The government has said it will announce plans by the end of the month to restructure Eskom into three operating units and reorganize its debt. A master plan that will determine the country’s electricity generation mix until 2030 has been approved by the Cabinet, Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe said Wednesday."
22,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 05:09PM ET</span>","Stocks – S&P Drifts Lower on Weak Retail Sales, China Worries","Investing.com - Stocks drifted lower Wednesday on a weaker-than-expected report on retail sales and growing fears about how firm the Chinese trade deal really is.
The trade worries helped push energy stocks lower and weighed on tech stocks.
The S&P 500 was off 0.2%, with the Dow Jones industrials down 0.08%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indices dropped 0.3% each, in part because Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) moved 0.4% and 0.8% lower, respectively.
The retail sales report for September showed a 0.3% decline when most economists expected a gain. The decline -- the first since February -- boosted fears that a slowing global economy is affecting U.S. consumers.
At the same time, worries grew about the Chinese trade deal announced last week. President Donald Trump said it meant China would be buying $50 billion to $60 billion in U.S. farm products ""in less than two years."" But some analysts told The Wall Street Journal that that's way beyond what China has bought in any one year.
The deal ultimately could hinge on the U.S. suspending imposition of new 15% tariffs on $156 billion in Chinese imports. The tariffs are supposed to take effect Dec. 15. China may balk at the farm purchases if the tariffs aren't suspended.
The uncertainty weighed on futures trading for corn and soybeans, with both moving lower. Both commodities depend on exports.

The company issued guidance that fell short of expectations after the bell, but said margin growth would be sustained, allaying worries that rising competition would force the streaming giant to slash prices.
The company is projecting it will add 7.6 million net subscribers during the fourth quarter, below the 9.5 million net ads expected by analysts, but still showing growth from the most recent period.
Total paid net adds of 6.8 million increased 12% year over year and was an all-time third-quarter record, with International paid net additions rising 23% year on year to 6.3 million in the quarter, above estimates of 6.2 million. In the U.S., paid net adds rose by 500,000 in the quarter, below estimates of 800,000.
The stock rose 8% in after-hours trading.
Netflix reported earnings of $1.47 a share, beating estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $1.03 per share, while revenue of $5.25 billion was in line with estimates.
Faced with the threat of nearing peak subscriber growth in the U.S., the streaming giant has been stepping up efforts to scoop up more international subscribers.
Despite weaker-than-expected guidance on subscriber growth and an expected ramp-up in competition, Netflix continued to tout margin expansion, allaying fears that it would be forced to consider price cuts, with rivals Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) set to launch less-expensive streaming services next month.
""We’re on track to achieve our full year 2019 operating margin goal of 13%. In 2020, we’ll be targeting another 300 basis points in operating margin expansion, consistent with the annual margin improvement we’ve delivered each year since 2017,"" the company said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jean Boustani, a lead salesman for a Lebanese shipbuilding company, was the ""mastermind"" of a conspiracy to defraud U.S. investors involving $2 billion in loans for Mozambican government projects, a U.S. prosecutor told jurors at the opening of his trial on Wednesday.
Michael Schachter, a lawyer for Boustani, said his client never communicated with investors and had no U.S. ties, suggesting the case did not belong in the Brooklyn federal courtroom.
""The United States is not the world's policeman,"" he said.
The statements kicked off what is expected to be a five-week trial that could shed light on a corruption scandal that contributed to Mozambique's debt default in 2016.
The case revolves around three contracts awarded by Mozambique to Boustani's employer, Privinvest, to build a coastal defense system, a tuna fishing fleet and a shipyard. The projects were financed with nearly $2 billion in loans from  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) and Russian lender VTB (MM:VTBR).
Assistant U.S. Attorney Margaret Moeser told jurors that Boustani paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to Mozambican officials and Credit Suisse bankers to secure the contracts and loans.
Credit Suisse went on to sell parts of those loans to investors, including some in the United States, who were falsely told that all the money was being used for the legitimate government projects, Moeser said. While Privinvest did deliver ships and equipment to Mozambique, she said, their value was grossly inflated.
Eventually, she said, the loans defaulted and investors lost their money.
Schachter did not dispute that Boustani, a Lebanese citizen, paid officials, which he called the ""cost of doing business"" in Mozambique. But he said that did not violate any U.S. laws.
In fact, Schachter said, Boustani had no role in selling the loans to investors and never communicated with anyone in the United States.
""He's not a banker,"" Schachter said. ""He's a boat salesman.""
Three Credit Suisse bankers previously pleaded guilty in the case. One of them, Andrew Pearse, is the prosecutors' first witness in the trial.
Former Mozambique Finance Minister Manuel Chang was also charged in the case. Prosecutors said Chang, who is fighting extradition in South Africa, secretly had the country's government guarantee the loans in exchange for bribes.
When the loan guarantees became public in 2016, foreign donors to cut off support and Mozambique defaulted on its sovereign debt. It remains among the world's most indebted countries."

Air Canada, which has 24 737 MAX aircraft in its fleet, is the first North American airline to extend the cancellation till February, as the grounding drags on longer than expected.
The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since mid-March following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The nation's top housing regulator said on Wednesday that he hopes to hire an outside financial adviser by next month to help the government devise a plan to remove mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie from government conservatorship.
Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said he expects the adviser to help the regulator assess plans to overhaul Fannie and Freddie's capital structure and raise billions of dollars in new cash.
He added that he also expects Fannie and Freddie to hire their own advisers ahead of potentially massive initial public offerings or other capital raisings that could prove to be a big payday for Wall Street firms that win the mandate.
""Fannie and Freddie will be the ones raising capital, but how do we allow them to set that path and how do we make sure that what they come up with as suggestions to raise capital are doable?"" said Calabria at an event in Washington. ""My expectation is that Fannie and Freddie are going to be able to get their own financial advisers, and we can start to work.""
The FHFA earlier this month posted a solicitation for an outsider adviser, and applications were due Wednesday. Calabria said the adviser will help the regulator assess capital plans put forward by Fannie and Freddie.
The pair, which guarantee more than half of the nation's mortgages, have operated under a government conservatorship since being bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. The Trump administration has renewed efforts to release the pair from government control, issuing a report in September calling for them to be recapitalized and released.
Calabria on Wednesday emphasized that the pair will not be allowed to escape government control without raising a significant amount of capital. To that end, Calabria said he expects to announce in the coming weeks whether the FHFA will re-propose a rule outlining capital requirements for the pair. Analysts expect that regulation must be finalized before the pair could realistically exit.
""If Fannie and Freddie aren’t able to leave, then they don’t leave. Quite simply they have to be ready to get out,"" said Calabria."

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told employees he was ""fully supportive"" of the board's decision to split his chairman and CEO roles, allowing him to focus on running the world's largest planemaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
A Boeing spokesman did not provide an immediate comment.
Muilenburg said the ""division of labor"" was the latest action taken by the board and senior company leaders to ""strengthen Boeing's governance and safety management processes"" as it struggles to get its fastest-selling 737 MAX jetliner back into the air following deadly crashes.
""I'm accountable to you, our customers, the flying public and all of our stakeholders for delivering on this - and each of us carries our share of the responsibility,"" Muilenburg said in the memo sent after the board's decision was announced on Friday.
Boeing said the board had stripped Muilenburg of his chairmanship title, in an unexpected strategy shift after months of pressure capped by a global aviation task force report that criticized development of the 737 MAX.
Lead Director David Calhoun, a senior managing director at Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group, will take over as non-executive chairman, Boeing said. It added that the board had ""full confidence"" in Muilenburg, who will retain the CEO and president titles and remain on the board.
""I'm fully supportive of this division of labor and look forward to continuing my close partnership with Dave,"" Muilenburg told employees in the memo.
The decision came some six months after Muilenburg survived a shareholder motion to split his chairman and CEO roles, part of the intense pressure he has faced during the worst crisis of his four years at the helm.
Muilenburg is set to testify before a U.S. House panel later this month and lawmakers have raised questions about Boeing's actions prior to the 737 MAX certification.
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Transportation Department Inspector General and several blue-ribbon panels are also investigating the plane's approval."

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The sale of some 120 billion reais ($29 billion) worth of shares owned by Brazilian development bank BNDES has snagged on a dispute among the bank's executives, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
On Friday, BNDES director Andre Laloni requested a temporary leave after clashing with staff over a share offering of state-controlled bank Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3) set for Thursday, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
BNDES did not respond to a request for comment. Laloni declined to comment.
The dispute within BNDES adds to doubts about how quickly Brazil can follow through on the bold privatization plans of Economy Minister Paulo Guedes as he tries to reverse more than a decade of government investments in ""national champions.""
Laloni got the BNDES job in July after managing the sale of around $3 billion in assets owned by Brazilian state lender Caixa Economica Federal.
At BNDES, the former UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) banker was tasked with managing sale of stakes owned by the bank in firms such as meatpacker JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) (SA:PETR4) and miner Vale SA (SA:VALE3).
For the Banco do Brasil shares, staffers resisted the sale of stakes managed by BNDES through a follow-on offering, arguing that such a transaction generates fees for investment banks and would result in a discount to listed prices, the sources said.
The BNDES staffers pushed to sell the stakes through the bank's own equity desk in Rio de Janeiro, according to sources. In a presentation to the board, Laloni defended the use of follow-on offerings, citing data from recent stake sales suggesting better returns even after fees and discounting.
Laloni also faced resistance in trying to scrap an internal BNDES rule that equity stakes should be sold at a valuation based on discounted cash flow, even when a company is listed on the stock exchange. The rule has complicated major transactions such as the sale of 50 billion reais worth of Petrobras.
The plans to sell Banco do Brasil shares managed by BNDES fell apart last week after Laloni clashed in a meeting with the development bank's general counsel, according to sources.
BNDES Chief Executive Gustavo Montezano decided the sale should be approved by all directors. Laloni asked for a leave of absence.
It is unclear whether Laloni will return to his post at the bank or if the government intends to change the internal rules, the sources added.
Montezano did not reply to a request for comment sent through BNDES press representatives.
Although BNDES staffers and prior chief executives have said publicly that much of its equity portfolio is ""mature"" and should be sold, former CEOs Joaquim Levy and Maria Silvia Marques did no managed to sell significant stakes."

The FTC had accused the three companies, the three largest U.S. full-service distributors of supplies ranging from chairs to cement to gloves, of violating antitrust law in February 2018.
Judge Michael Chappell said in a decision dated Tuesday that ""complaint Counsel (FTC) has shown that there was an agreement between Benco and Patterson to refuse to offer discounted prices or otherwise negotiate with buying groups.

Credit Suisse raised its price target on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $2,400 from $2,225. Amazon rose nearly 1%.
Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju highlighted a number of supportive factors for the sunnier outlook, including e-commerce operating margin expansion, faster-than-expected free cash-flow growth related to its advertising segment and upward bias on Amazon Web Service revenue forecasts (AWS).
Amazon Web Services has been the company’s golden goose for many a quarter, but saw growth slow last quarter as the company offered price concessions to attract larger enterprise clients, who typically sign longer-duration contracts.
In the second quarter, AWS growth fell to its lowest level since the segment began reporting separate results, up 37% from a year ago, well below the 49% growth from a year earlier.
The slowdown in AWS revenue growth will likely continue into the third quarter, with Credit Suisse forecasting growth to decelerate to 36% for the quarter, but lead to more sustained growth for the company. 
The cloud segment accounts for just 13% of Amazon’s overall revenue, but about 70% of the company’s overall operating income. 
“Despite the short-term dip in operating profit, we fully expect Amazon to grow into the higher OpEx base as unit economics recover,” Credit Suisse said. 
The upgrade comes just a week ahead of Amazon’s quarterly results due Oct. 24. But not everyone on Wall Street shares  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) optimism.
Earlier this week, Jefferies warned investors not to buy Amazon on weakness ahead the earnings report on worries that many are expecting too much from the e-commerce giant.
""Fourth-quarter consensus operating income may prove to be a stretch"" and this ""could weigh on Amazon shares if guidance once again falls short of street numbers,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said."

""It speaks to the uncertainty. Potential customers have asked lots of questions about cover,"" Peter Gibbons, head of individual and small groups at Allianz Care, said. 
AXA Global Healthcare and Expatriate Group also report a rise in enquiries, by phone, email or live chat.
And in Italy, Jeremy Morgan, vice chairman of expatriate organization British in Europe, is also seeing concern.
""We're suggesting people voluntarily join the local health service here, or they take out some kind of insurance.""
In Spain, Sophie Goode was hired by Polifani in 2017 following queries from Britons, who had previously made hardly any enquiries to the insurance broker. 
Goode now receives four to six requests for information daily and gives advice about healthcare after Brexit at weekly meetings for expatriates at campsites in Benidorm. 
Of every 10 consultations, Goode wins eight clients, including people who qualify for state-backed arrangements.
COUNTING THE COSTS
However, many potential customers are concerned about the cost and are holding off buying health insurance policies until they're sure they need to, brokers and insurers say.
""We are saying - at this stage, do not worry,"" said Guy Jones, director of broker BD Global Medical.
The British government last month said 180,000 people already living in the EU who have their healthcare funded by the UK, including pensioners and students, would have their costs covered in the case of a no-deal Brexit. 
However, the offer only applies for six months.
Britain and Spain have a further arrangement giving people living in each country continued access to local healthcare until at least the end of 2020. Britons working and paying social security in Spain should keep the same access as now.
The issue could be less pressing if there is a Brexit deal, as Britain and the EU are expected to be covered by transitional arrangements for more than a year, although there remains a lack of clarity over what would happen after this. 
Britain and Brussels are in 11th hour talks to try to reach a deal ahead of an EU summit beginning on Thursday.
Britons in Europe also worry health insurance will not cover them for pre-existing conditions.
""I could never afford private healthcare here, as I understand it would be about 8,000 euros a year and exclude my cancer care,"" Beryl Roberts said. 
Brokers agreed insurance would likely cost several thousand euros a year, and rates usually increase with age.
Health insurance premiums have also tended to rise sharply in recent years due to increases in medical costs, which Mercer Marsh Benefits said was 9.7% globally in 2018.
Broader international medical insurance policies are more likely than domestic insurance to include pre-existing conditions, offer documents and even online doctors in a variety of languages, and be portable across countries, insurers said.
But such policies are more expensive, brokers say.
Retired policeman Terry Roberts, 64, lives near Alicante in southern Spain and receives treatment from the Spanish state health system for diabetes and pancreatitis. He is worried he might have to start paying.

""At the moment it's making me more ill than I was before. I have to have medication to keep me alive.""

41,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 12:13PM ET</span>",Bank of America puts investments over cost cuts as 'operating leverage' fades,"By Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For the first time in nearly five years, Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) did not rely on cost cuts to amplify profits – the latest sign of big U.S. banks prioritizing investments in their businesses over short-term gains.
On Tuesday, Bank of America reported better-than-expected quarterly results, helped by loan growth, higher equities trading revenue and bigger fees from dealmaking and wealth management.
But overall, the bank's net revenue was nearly flat, as were core expenses. The difference between those two figures, known as operating leverage, is watched closely on Wall Street as a barometer of how well a bank manages costs.
That metric had been positive at Bank of America for eighteen straight quarters, until the most recent one.
Instead of slashing expenses, the Charlotte, N.C.-based lender spent more on marketing, technology, real estate, equipment and compensation during the quarter.
Its U.S.-centric consumer business opened 20 new locations, renovated another 117 and paid retail employees more after a pledge to boost minimum wages to $15 an hour. Bank of America also opened a new Paris office, hired more customer-facing staff and spent on digital tools across its operation.
Such investments are necessary to keep businesses healthy and growing, executives said, while asserting they have a good handle on expenses. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan pledged to keep annual costs at around $53 billion.
""We've been able to operate at that [level] despite increased investments in technology and infrastructure, buildings and people,"" he said.
Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets, does not stand alone in prioritizing business investments over cost cuts.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), for instance, has been spending heavily on its burgeoning consumer business even as its revenue has slumped. Executives defended the strategy on Tuesday when discussing quarterly results.
Similarly,  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) partially explained its outlook for higher expenses in a presentation by saying ""we don't want to forgo revenue to manage to an expense target."" Costs at the San Francisco based bank have also been elevated as the bank hired more risk and compliance professionals to help it work through its regulatory issues.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) management also faced questions about winnowing operating leverage. The bank, which reduced headcount by 7,000 over the past year, has been keeping a close eye on travel expenses while avoiding what its finance chief called ""non-critical hires.""
But CEO Michael Corbat also sounded a cautious note about not ""sacrificing the investments that we need to make to either maintain or continue to attempt to build competitive advantages.""
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) was the only one to report positive operating leverage for the third quarter as well as year-to-date.
Spending in the face of revenue pressure is a sharp reversal for the U.S. banking industry after years of cost cuts following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. For Bank of America, it also marks a new chapter for CEO Brian Moynihan.
His tenure was defined first by spending billions of dollars to settle costly legal disputes, and then cutting billions of dollars from Bank of America's expense line through an initiative he dubbed ""Project New BAC.""
From when Moynihan first developed the cost-cutting plan in 2011 through last year, the bank's annual expenses have fallen by more than one-third and its payroll is down by more than 70,000 workers.
On Wednesday, Moynihan predicted recent investments will pay off through productivity gains and that the bank will find more savings by doing things like reducing paper use.
""We have a good track record of generating operational savings,"" he said."
42,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>",HSBC France to leave its Champs Elysees headquarters,"PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) France said on Wednesday its teams will leave a prestigious headquarters on Paris' Champs Elysees avenue by 2020 in an emblematic move ahead of the planned sale of its retail business in the country. 
The exit and planned sale, following a strategic review of the group's French retail activities, are part of a broader cost-cutting effort under interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn.
""HSBC France has a project of moving its headquarters by 2020 to 38 av Kleber, 500 meters away from its actual headquarters that was sold in 2010,"" the bank said in a statement.
The building would be fit for 1,200 employees working mostly in corporate and investment banking and wealth management.
Another 500 employees will be moved to HSBC's hub in La Defense business district which now houses 4,000 of the bank's employees and to branches close to the Champs Elysees building.
HSBC France sold its headquarters at 103 avenue Champs Elysees, and a building in front of it at 15 rue Vernet, to Qatari investors and has rented them since then. 
The move is necessitated because the owner wants to regain control of the buildings and also because HSBC needs to save money, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Office rents in Paris are rising to levels not seen since at least 2003, according to Immostat data, as vacancy rates are at record lows.
HSBC inherited the historic headquarters when it bought the French retail operations of Crédit Commercial de France (CCF) in 2000.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the building was a hotel where World War One spy and exotic dancer Mata Hari was arrested.
 HSBC Holdings  has hired U.S. investment bank  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) to sell its French retail business, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
Quinn is expected to unveil the first details of his strategic overhaul of the bank when it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 28.
Quinn is auditioning for the full-time CEO job and insiders said he is under pressure to take decisive action after Chairman Mark Tucker indicated his predecessor John Flint had not moved quickly enough to turn around the lender's performance.

Reuters first reported news of HSBC's planned exit earlier on Wednesday, citing sources.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Signify (AS:LIGHT), the Dutch-based lighting company, has agreed to buy U.S. firm Cooper Lighting Solutions from  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Corp. [EATO.UL] for $1.4 billion in cash to boost its presence in North America.
Signify shares rose 4.6% to 25.00 euros in early trading in Amsterdam after the company said the deal would add to earnings per share in the first year and lead to cost savings of $60 million annually within three years.
The acquisition is the largest by Signify, the world's largest lighting maker that was formerly known as Philips Lighting, since it was spun off from Philips in 2016.
The deal aims to boost Signify's position in the global professional lighting market, where it is the No.2 player, and in North America, where it suffers from a lack of scale and competes with rivals like  Acuity Brands Inc . (N:AYI), CFO Stephane Rougeot said.
""The rationale from a strategy standpoint is to get a much stronger market position in North America in professional,"" he said in a telephone interview.
""With Cooper we are getting a very large player in North America professional. They have great market positions, they have a large agent network, they have very deep customer relationships, they have great brands over there.""
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 pending regulatory approvals.
Peachtree City, Ga.-based Cooper Lighting Solutionst sells professional lighting and controls under the Corelite, Halo, McGraw-Edison and Metalux brands.
It reported 2018 sales of $1.7 billion and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $187 million.
ING analyst Marc Hesselink, who rates Signify shares at ""hold"", said the deal was a ""good strategic fit for Signify and price paid seems reasonable.""
Still, Cooper would not add technology or new capabilities to Signify's portfolio and the deal would not really change the growth or margin profile of the company, he said.
Signify said it intends to keep dividends steady or increase them after the acquisition, but its main focus will be to reduce debt of the combined company from two times net debt to EBITDA to one time in the next three years.
During that time Signify will make further merger and acquisition activity less of a priority, Rougeot said.
Lazard advised Signify on the deal. Eaton was advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors continued the largest retreat from the U.S. stock market since at least 2013 by pulling nearly $10.9 billion from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold domestic equities last week, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.
The withdrawals pushed the total losses from stock funds to $36.6 billion over the last 3 weeks, the first time in ICI records going back to 2013 that investors had pulled $10 billion or more from U.S. stock funds over three consecutive weeks.
Weak manufacturing data and concerns that the trade war between the U.S. and China could lead to a global economic recession have weighed heavily on investor sentiment, leaving the benchmark S&P 500 trading in a relatively narrow range. The index is up slightly more than 19% for the year to date, largely due to expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue its series of equity-friendly interest rate cuts.
Investors continued to seek the perceived safety of bonds, sending slightly more than $5.8 billion into taxable and municipal debt funds. For the year to date, the category has brought in nearly $333.2 billion in new assets, compared with a nearly $114 billion in withdrawals from U.S. stock funds.
World stock funds, meanwhile, notched a five-week losing streak by dropping another $660 million in outflows. Investors have pulled slightly more than $40.5 billion from the category since the beginning of the year."

VIENNA (Reuters) - Airline Swiss expects to resume mostly normal service with its fleet of Airbus A220 jets on Thursday after temporarily grounding the jets for safety checks of their engines, it said on Wednesday.
The inspections of Pratt & Whitney engines came after a Geneva-bound Swiss jet had to divert to Paris on Tuesday.
French air crash investigators classified the engine problem, which disrupted the Swiss flight shortly after departure from London Heathrow, as a ""serious incident"" and said it would be investigated by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.
The carrier said that 20 of the aircraft had been inspected on Tuesday afternoon and overnight. ""The engines are in impeccable condition, so these 20 aircraft have returned to regular flight operations,"" it added in a statement. 
""We continue to assume that flight operations can be largely resumed on Thursday,"" added the airline, which is owned by Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).
The Airbus (PA:AIR) A220 single-aisle airliner was formerly known as the Bombardier C Series.
In Seoul,  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) said it had launched inspections on its fleet of 10 A220 planes after a request from U.S. engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.
Tuesday's engine incident was the third involving the same airline and model of jet in as many months and resulted in a small amount of debris being scattered as the aircraft landed at Paris Charles de Gaulle, an airport source told Reuters.
It came just hours after France's BEA aviation safety agency launched an unusual appeal for 150 volunteers to scour an uninhabited wood in eastern France for a titanium engine part dating from the first blowout in July, which affected a Geneva-London flight.
A second incident in September caused a Swiss A220 to divert to Geneva, but on that occasion the engine's housing contained fragments torn loose from the engine, the BEA said.
Swiss said this week's inspections had forced it to cancel more than 100 flights, affecting around 10,000 passengers.
The Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation said it had not ordered the grounding for engine checks.
Tuesday's incident highlighted scrutiny of the performance of new-generation Geared Turbofan engines developed by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).
A spokesman for the engine maker said it was recommending additional checks for versions of the engine that power the Airbus A220 - an engine known as the PW1500G - and a rival Brazilian jet, the Embraer 190/195-E2.

A similar engine for the larger A320neo family, Airbus' most-sold aircraft, was not affected.

47,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>","Bank of America beats profit estimates on surge in advisory, lending","By Anirban Sen and Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday as it earned more in advisory fees and its loan book expanded, easing concerns that lower interest rates would crimp growth at the second-largest U.S. bank.
The lender's shares rose 3% as consumer banking, BofA's biggest business, showed strength in the face of worries over slowing economic growth and added to signs from JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  (N:C) that U.S. household finances remained healthy.
""In a moderately growing economy, we focused on driving those things that are controllable,"" Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said. ""Across nearly every line of business, we were seeing strong customer activity.""
On a conference call with analysts, BofA's top executives warned about challenges from lower interest rates and expectations of further cuts, but remained confident about meeting its earlier forecast of 1% growth in full-year net interest income.
Since 2015, Wall Street's marquee banks have benefited from higher interest rates, as they could afford to charge more interest on loans, without having to significantly raise payouts on deposits.
However, this year, markets have been buffeted trade tensions and a weakening global economy, forcing the Federal Reserve to cut rates twice this quarter.
Bank of America is the most vulnerable among the big U.S. banks to fluctuations in interest rates because of its large deposit stock and rate-sensitive mortgage securities.
BofA took a small hit on its spread and reported a 4 basis-point decrease in its interest margin to 2.41% for the third quarter. But a 5% growth in overall loans helped it overcome the impact of lower rates.
Along with that, strong performance in investment banking and equities trading boosted total revenue past Wall Street expectations.
Revenue from investment banking fees jumped 40%, while consumer banking revenue rose 3%. The bank's equity trading business outperformed its peers with a 13% jump.
Net interest income also came in higher at $12.34 billion and accounted for more than half of its total revenue.
Net income applicable to common shareholders fell 21% to $5.27 billion, or 56 cents per share, hit by a $2 billion impairment charge. Excluding the charge, the bank earned 75 cents per share.
Revenue, net of interest expense, rose slightly to $22.96 billion.

Analysts were expecting a profit of 51 cents per share and revenue of $22.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 11:04AM ET</span>",Fund managers waiting out high-profile unicorn IPOs after string of flops,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A deep disconnect between private market valuations of companies and the prices their shares fetch on the open market is pushing more mutual fund managers to the sidelines during high profile IPOs, anticipating the newly listed stocks will inevitably fall. 
The war over what a company is worth comes as a generation of Silicon Valley darlings exit the insulated world of venture capital, where investors are more focused on a company's growth and potential, and enter the public markets, where fund managers and analysts put a premium on meeting each quarter's revenue and profit expectations. 
 Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), for instance, is down about 30% from its May initial public offering price, leaving it with a market cap about $23.1 billion less than its last private market funding round. Peloton Interactive (O:PTON) , meanwhile, is down 22% from its IPO in late September, chopping more than $1 billion off of its market cap. 
As a result, fund managers from firms including Osterweis Capital Management, Firsthand Funds and Federated Investors say that they are becoming more cautious about buying companies that have come to market with multi-billion dollar IPOs, so-called unicorns. 
""You're seeing a lot of companies come out with valuations at $8 billion when they really should be $4 billion companies, and the public market is where a lot of the rationality around valuations happens, and it takes the air out of these really well-known unicorns,"" said Jim Callinan, portfolio manager of the Osterweis Emerging Opportunities fund. 
Callinan is now shifting his strategy to wait until at least after the 180-day lock-up period, following which company insiders are allowed to start selling their shares, before making any positions in a newly public company. 
The most attractive price for newly public companies will most likely be at least a year after they go public because large venture capital funds, like Japan's SoftBank Group Corp's $100 billion Vision Fund, have distorted private market valuations and let companies focus on building market share rather than outlining a path to profits, he said.
SoftBank was a major investor in WeWork owner The We Company, which pulled its IPO after it failed to get any investor traction at a valuation between $10 billion and $12 billion, a steep drop from the $47 billion valuation it reached in the private market in January. 
“You have really big money that's inflationary, so it's not until a company has been public for a few quarters that the real valuation can be found,” he said. 
IPO SLOWDOWN
Disappointing performances of well-hyped IPOs like  SmileDirectClub Inc  (O:SDC), which is now down nearly 60% from its initial pricing of $23 in early September, are contributing to a slump in the IPO market overall, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs.
(GRAPHIC - IPO flops of 2019: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-FUNDS-IPOS/0H001QXD48XH/eikon.png) 
SmileDirect stock continued to tumble despite thumbs up from the banks that led its IPO, with most Wall Street analysts assigning price targets below the IPO price.
The Renaissance IPO ETF (P:IPO), which tracks the performances of newly public companies, is down 12 percentage points over the last 3 months, while the broad S&P 500 index is up nearly 3% over the same time. The ETF fell alnother 1.3% Wednesday. 
""Public market investors are boycotting the IPO market because pure and simple they're not getting the returns they want,"" she said. ""You're now getting these very large private companies that had valuations pushed up to ridiculous levels and public investors are pushing back."" 
The reticence on the part of public investors to buy into highly valued IPOs will likely start to eat into how private market investors gauge companies, she said. Overall, there were a record 180 private U.S. companies valued at more than $1 billion as of Sept 1, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Private companies have raised approximately $83 billion in venture funding this year, which is on pace to fall below the $117 billion in funding raised last year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Companies going public have raised approximately $41 billion from public market investors this year, according to data from Renaissance Capital. 
""Capital gets sloppy when it's prolific and a lot of bad ideas get funded,"" Smith said, noting that the largest discrepancies in valuations have occurred among well known technology companies while less hyped companies like  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) have doubled from their IPO price. ""WeWork is so obvious that it was a bad idea, but it could end up that  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) is a bad idea and SmileDirect is a bad idea."" 
Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who invests in both private and public companies, said that the string of disappointing IPOs will likely continue as private market investors focus more on the search for the next big company than its eventual share price performance. 

""It's a great thought exercise to look at a successful private company and ask if it were public how it would trade. A lot of private investors aren't thinking that way because they're trying to expand and not thinking about what this would be if it were a stock,"" he said. ""They want to find that one great idea where they can declare themselves geniuses for finding it so early.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Companies are stepping up purchases of insurance to protect themselves against insolvencies in Britain, industry sources say, in part due to concerns about the impact of Brexit.
The UK economy is feeling the pinch from the political uncertainty, which has hit consumer spending and led to a drop in the value of the pound.
This has contributed to high-profile company collapses like that of travel firm Thomas Cook, which also suffered under the weight of its debt pile.
UK insolvencies rose by 12% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to government figures, bringing insolvencies to their highest level in five years.
This has fueled interest in trade credit insurance. Companies buy such insurance if they supply goods or services to other businesses on credit, to protect against the risk they will not get paid, or will be paid very late.
An example could be a Dutch flower seller supplying a British supermarket chain, buying insurance in case of non-payment.
""The demand for credit insurance is incredibly high,"" said Graham Bristow, managing director in credit solutions for insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON), one of the largest firms arranging such deals. ""There is no doubt Brexit is one theme, people are nervous.”
   The insurance broker has seen double-digit percentage growth in demand for trade credit insurance compared with 2018, and a similar increase in enquiries on top of that, Bristow added.
Richard Marriage, managing director in trade credit at insurer Nexus, said the firm had seen a 10% rise in enquiries this year, with the prospect of Britain failing to reach a negotiated withdrawal from the European Union - a so-called no-deal Brexit - one factor in the increased interest.
EU exporters to Britain were interested in the insurance, in addition to UK buyers, Marriage said.
Insurer Atradius has seen a 5.5% rise in its customers this year, and credit periods have shortened in Britain. The demand for quicker payment is another sign of the concern about Brexit, said Stuart Ramsden, Atradius' head of UK & Ireland Commercial.
PREMIUMS RISING
There were 14,000 trade credit policies in place last year, the most since the 2008 financial crisis, the Association of British Insurers said. The number of claims rose 60% from 2017.
Bristow and Marriage said premiums were rising, but declined to give a figure.
Another insurance source said rates were up by single digit percentages, helped by a broader trend for rising insurance premiums. There were double-digit price rises in sectors such as retail, the source said.
In addition to sterling's fall, which has pushed up the cost of imports, a switch to online shopping and food delivery and high business rates have brought pain to British retailers such as Debenhams and restaurant owners such as Jamie Oliver.
Agriculture was another area of concern, with Brexit likely to lead to the removal of farming subsidies currently provided by the EU.
""Some politicians have said 'we will replace them', but when and how?” Bristow asked.
Other industry sources pointed to construction, logistics such as delivery firms, the auto industry and food wholesalers as also at risk.
If there is a no-deal Brexit, supply chains are likely to be disrupted, risking more insolvencies. Alexis Garatti, head of macroeconomic research at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, predicts UK insolvencies could rise by 15% next year under a no-deal Brexit. He put the probability of a no-deal Brexit at 40%.
British insolvencies, seen by Euler Hermes as rising by 11% in 2019, are running ahead of the global average of an 8% increase, Garatti said.
Despite the risk, small businesses find it hard to buy trade credit insurance because of the cost, industry sources say, as they often have to insure the whole of their order book.
Lack of insurance could hit small business growth, according to Nimbla, which insures individual invoices against default.
A survey by Nimbla showed more than half of UK small and medium-sized firms turned down new business because they were worried about its credit quality."

LONDON (Reuters) - Once one of Britain's most celebrated money managers and idolized by a legion of investor devotees, the collapse of Neil Woodford's business has been swift and brutal.
The 59-year-old moved quickly to call time on his eponymous asset management company late on Tuesday, hours after being sacked as manager of the firm's flagship fund by its administrator, Link Fund Solutions.
The move followed four months of efforts to sell out of a number of unlisted and little traded stocks - some 20% of the fund's portfolio according to Britain's regulator - and raise cash to pay off investors irked by weak returns.
With bad news swirling, attempts to raise enough cash were hampered further after some of his biggest investments - including healthcare technology firm BenevolentAI - were revalued at much lower levels.
Woodford's team had initially been given until December to execute on their plan and had hired bankers PJT Partners to aid their efforts. The team also traveled the length and breadth of Britain to persuade advisers and investors to keep the faith.
But on Monday, Link pulled the plug.
In a letter to investors on Tuesday, Link said it was closing the fund as it did not believe the repositioning of the portfolio would be completed by December, potentially leading to a need to suspend again, to the detriment of investors.
In announcing the closure of the firm late on Tuesday, Woodford said he deeply regretted the impact on investors. A spokesman for Woodford was not immediately available for further comment on Wednesday.
A spokesman for Link told Reuters on Wednesday it had always acted in the best interest of shareholders - of which almost 300,000 came from Britain's biggest online investment platform  Hargreaves  Lansdown (L:HRGV). Hargreaves customers accounted for less than half the investments in the fund.
Woodford was initially surprised and then dismayed by the decision, a company source with direct knowledge of the meeting told Reuters.
""There was no indication of their intentions before that at all ... So this was a real surprise,"" the source told Reuters.
Dozens of investors equally stunned by the action posted angry messages on Woodford's website, with many also questioning both Link's decision and the role of regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
""You made some very strange decisions in my time invested here Sir,"" said one former investor on Woodford's website. ""I’m just relieved I reassessed my decision in early 2018 and made my redemption when I did, it saved me a fortune.""
As a 'value' investor, Woodford made his name during a storied 26-year career at U.S. firm Invesco (N:IVZ) by buying shares in companies on which the market had become too pessimistic, hoping to chalk up outsize profits as good news eventually came through and was reflected in the share price.
That style served him particularly well at two junctures: the tech bubble at the turn of the century and during the great financial crisis of 2008-2009. In both cases, he suffered periods of underperformance only to come good in market-beating fashion as many rivals faced meltdown.
Woodford's reputation as an active manager, in a world where investors are increasingly turning to index tracking funds, helped him to grow his assets to more than $30 billion before he struck out on his own with the launch of Woodford Investment Management in 2014.
Once the starting gun was fired, that name spurred investors to invest in first the Equity Income fund, then the listed  Woodford Patient Capital Trust  (L:WPCT) and, in 2017, the smaller LF Woodford Income Focus fund.
Yet as far back as Invesco, the seeds of Woodford's demise could be seen in his desire to invest a small proportion of his fund in riskier, less liquid investments.
Freed from the more restrictive corporate shackles of Invesco, Woodford became a major backer of technology start-ups, many of them spinning out of Britain's top universities and with the potential to change the world in sectors such as healthcare.
His more conventional yet contrarian take on public market stocks had also led him to double-down on deeply unloved sectors such as UK housebuilders - hit by uncertainty around the impact of Britain's exit from the European Union.
As such, from late 2017 he started to seriously underperform his peer group, triggering outflows of client cash and forcing an almost continual restructuring of the portfolio as he sought to make sure he had enough money on hand to pay off investors.
While that worked for a while, a crunch point was hit in June, when he ran out of money after the pension fund of public sector workers in the county of Kent in southern England, asked to withdraw its cash, triggering the suspension.
Some, though, feel Woodford deserved more time.
""I would much prefer Woodford to sort things out as he has skin in the fund both financially and in terms of saving his reputation,"" investor Julian Thornett said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial services industry, the country's biggest tax earner, risks being cut adrift from its main export market - the European Union - after Brexit.
Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain currently have free rein in seeking customers, investors and markets across the EU, helping to maintain London's standing as a top global financial center.
But with Brexit potentially only two weeks away, it is not clear exactly how much EU access Britain's financial sector will be able to retain.
Britain and the EU are locked in talks on a divorce settlement they hope to conclude at an EU summit on Thursday.
Britain's parliament, due to hold a special session on Saturday, would have to endorse any deal. 
These are the scenarios faced by financiers as the clock ticks down to Brexit Day on October 31:
THIRD EXTENSION
Britain has already extended its Brexit deadline twice to October 31. Another extension would allow the finance industry in Britain to maintain full access to the EU until a new Brexit date.
Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he would rather ""die in a ditch"" than ask for another extension. But parliament has passed a law requiring Britain to make a request for an extension if no deal is agreed.
More than 300 banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain have already opened new EU hubs to ensure continuity of service with European customers whatever form Brexit takes.
The two Brexit extensions have slowed down the relocation of jobs and activities, such as share trading, from London to new bases in the EU, despite pressure from EU regulators for Britain's financial firms to put more boots on the ground.
Another lengthy extension would be likely to put the brakes on the shifting of more business from London to EU centers such as Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Dublin.
A DEAL
A divorce settlement between Britain and the EU would mean business as usual for the financial sector during a fixed transition period.
An earlier draft withdrawal agreement included a transition phase until the end of 2020 to allow time for new trading arrangements between Britain and the EU to be slotted into place.
After this transition period, the EU has said that market access for Britain's financial sector would be based on the bloc's ""equivalence"" regime.
Under this system, Brussels grants direct access to EU markets if it deems that Britain's financial rules are aligned closely enough with those in the EU.
The process, which is also used by financial firms in Japan, Singapore and the United States, can be long and complex.
The EU has said that if there is a Brexit deal it could fast-track approval of UK equivalence in 2020 to avoid a gap in trading terms after the transition period ends.
But equivalence offers only patchy and unpredictable direct access, which is why so many UK-based firms have set up in the EU. And this has raised questions about how beneficial equivalence will be in practice.
Equivalence would also require Britain to stay aligned to EU rules when UK financial regulators do not want their hands tied.
British regulators do not want to become ""rule takers"", unable to diverge from EU regulations to tackle new risks that might develop in the UK's financial sector.
NO-DEAL
Failure to reach a Brexit deal this week, or a refusal to request an extension would potentially mean Britain crashes out of the EU, causing turmoil in financial markets.
There will not be a regulatory vacuum for banks, asset managers and insurers in Britain in a no-deal scenario because the government has put all existing EU rules into UK law.
But no deal would mean only limited direct access to the EU, and then largely via temporary measures, fragmenting markets and relationships built up over decades and raising costs for investors.
And a no-deal Brexit could delay equivalence decisions by Brussels, leaving Britain's financial sector more isolated from the EU.
Britain, the EU and EU member states have agreed that some cross-border financial activities like asset management and futures trading could continue for a time if there is no deal.
Britain will allow EU banks already operating in the UK to continue on a temporary basis until they obtain permanent authorization. But the EU has not reciprocated for UK banks operating in the bloc, meaning the lenders could face an overnight rupture in EU business.
Swapping personal data cross-border could be disrupted because the EU has yet to deem that standards in Britain for protecting privacy are ""adequate"".
Without this, it could be illegal for an EU firm to do business with a UK counterpart if a customer's personal data is involved.
London is the main center for clearing financial instruments known as interest rate swaps denominated in euros, but under a no-deal Brexit this would end for EU customers in March 2020.
After March next year, customers would then have to shift trillions of euros in contracts from London unless the EU agreed to a clearing extension.
Swathes of trading in euro-denominated shares in London could move to new platforms that have set up in Amsterdam and Paris to ensure continued EU access.

European government bond trading has already moved, but London would retain its dominance in spot currency trading because this market is not regulated.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Lázaro de Mello Brandão, the former chairman of Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4) died on Wednesday at 93, after decades of building the bank into Brazil's second-largest private-sector lender.
Brandão had stepped down two years ago after a 75-year career at the bank. He joined Bradesco in 1942 and worked alongside founder Amador Aguiar. The bank confirmed in a statement that he had passed away at a hospital in Sao Paulo. 
Brandão long kept a tight grip on the lender, serving as chief executive from 1981 to 1999 and chairman from 1990 to 2017. Even after leaving his job as chairman, Brandão was seen almost daily at his desk in the bank's head office.
""He had an intense and vigorous working rhythm, which was contagious for all of us,"" Bradesco CEO Octavio de Lazari Junior said in a statement. ""He used to be one of the first ones to arrive at our headquarters every day.""
Under Brandão's leadership, Bradesco acquired more than 20 financial institutions, including the Brazilian unit of  HSBC Holdings  (L:HSBA) in 2015. The bank held 1.41 trillion reais ($338 billion) in assets in June, behind only Itau Unibanco Holdings (SA:ITUB4) among private-sector banks in Brazil.
""The Brazilian financial system lost one of its best-known executives,"" Bradesco Chairman Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi said in a statement.
Brandão championed the idea that Bradesco should open its branches to Brazilians of all classes, even as some rivals focused on upscale clients and cities to improve profitability.
""Brandão was a key man not only for building one of the world's largest banks, but also for helping Brazil's economic development in the recent decades,"" Itau CEO Candido Bracher said in a statement.

Sergio Rial, CEO of  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA (SA:SANB11), said Brandao ""led the Brazilian financial industry for a long time and left a valuable legacy.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) declined to appear on Wednesday at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing on issues relating to the ride-hailing industry, a congressional committee said.
The two ride-hailing companies had been asked to appear as part of a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee inquiry on safety and labor practices as lawmakers seek to prepare legislation that will impact the industry.
""Their failure to appear at this hearing is a telling sign that they would rather suffer a public lashing than answer questions on the record about their operations,"" the head of the panel, U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, said in his prepared remarks.
DeFazio added that the hearing ""should also serve also a wake-up call to the companies that have flooded our roadways with disruptive technologies and investor capital that their days of operating with little public policy and regulatory oversight in the transportation space are coming to an end.""
He raised a number of issues, from safety to congestion to wages of drivers.
""Perhaps they don’t want to talk about what their model is doing to drive down wages and turn our transportation workforce from a skilled, trained pool of workers earning living wages to another casualty of the gig economy,"" DeFazio said.
Earlier this week, he urged the companies' chief executives in a letter to participate in the inquiry even as Uber and Lyft directed lawmakers to third-party industry associations. 
DeFazio added ""the tenuous existence of Uber and Lyft is literally fueled by millions of independent contractors who see their take home pay reduced drastically – below minimum wage in some states - as they are made to pay fees collected by the company, self-employment taxes, and costs associated with operating and maintaining their vehicles.""
He said the companies, which have reported substantial losses, ""don’t make information about their process for deactivating dangerous drivers public. They don’t share data on the prevalence of assaults on their platforms. They don’t reveal details on how drivers are paid. What we do know is that both these companies are struggling since going public... Clearly, this business model is not sustainable.
Uber on Monday confirmed it had received DeFazio's request.
Lyft said this week it would work with lawmakers and said the committee is reviewing ""important topics that we take very seriously. We look forward to future discussions.""

""With the substantial increase in plaintiff advertising this year, we expect to see a significant surge in the number of plaintiff filings over the third quarter,"" the company said in a written statement.
Bayer, which acquired Roundup and other glyphosate-based weed killers as part of its $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year, faces potentially heavy litigation costs as plaintiffs claim Roundup causes cancer, something Bayer disputes.
Bayer's shares have lost about 30% of their value since last August when a California jury in the first such lawsuit found Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks.
The drugmaker said in July that the number of U.S. plaintiffs in the litigation had risen to 18,400 and it is due to provide an update on Oct. 30, along with quarterly earnings.
Analysts at JP Morgan, citing an analysis of Missouri court data, said in an Oct. 9 research note that the total number of glyphosate cases could rise to more than 45,000.
However, several lawsuits have been delayed recently as mediator Ken Feinberg tries to negotiate a settlement.
The increase ""may reflect a campaign by plaintiffs' lawyers and lead generators to increase the volume of plaintiffs as quickly as possible in connection with that process,"" Bayer said, adding that the number of plaintiffs was not an indication of the merits of these cases.
Bayer has previously said that cases where lawyers expect to win the highest damages tend to be filed first.
The head of Bayer's Crop Science unit, Liam Condon, already flagged a likely increase in the number of cases in a newspaper interview earlier this month, citing the prospect of a settlement and lawyers' efforts to recruit new plaintiffs via media campaigns.
Bayer, which says regulators and extensive research have found glyphosate to be safe, has previously said it was banking on U.S. appeals courts to reverse or tone down three initial court rulings that have so far awarded tens of millions of dollars to each plaintiff."
61,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 09:09AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Veteran Refuses to Buy ‘Insane’ Negative-Yield Bonds,"(Bloomberg) -- Lots of investors chafe at the idea of buying negative-yield bonds. Few are as repelled by the prospect as William Eigen.
The JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management fund manager says he’d retire before buying sub-zero securities, even as some of his peers profit from the trade amid mounting fears of a global recession. He predicts negative-yielding bonds will eventually lead to “devastating” losses and has parked almost half of his fund in cash that will be insulated from a market sell-off.
“The whole concept of negative yields, of people paying for the privilege of lending money, is insane behavior to me,” Eigen, a 29-year industry veteran who oversees the $12.5 billion JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, said in an interview from Boston. “I do not pay to lend money. That’s not fixed-income investing, that’s fixed-loss investing.”
Eigen says investors will ultimately face a train wreck in a market distorted by vast amounts of negative-yielding debt spurred by years of ultra-loose monetary policy from Europe to Japan. Some $13.4 trillion of securities now trade with sub-zero yields as several European central banks and Japan slashed rates to below zero after the financial crisis in a bid to spur growth.
The measures, including the European Central Bank’s enormous bond-buying program, were meant to be temporary, but Europe’s benchmark rate has persistently stayed below zero since 2014. The value of negative-yielding bonds has surged 61% this year, triggered in part by fears of a prolonged U.S.-China trade war.
Eigen said he’s shunning the debt even as he predicts a recession in Europe and a “pretty rough” slowdown in the U.S., which would normally be a good time to buy bonds.
He gave three reasons: bonds are already pricing in bad times. And you can only make a capital gain from negative-yielding debt “if someone crazier than you is willing to come in to pay more for the privilege of lending money to an over-levered government or a company.”
‘Devastating’ Losses
But most importantly, nothing about the current bond market is sustainable, according to Eigen. Sooner or later, it’s going to crash, and he wants to be there with dry powder when it happens.
“What I’m saying is that you print this much money, you put trillions of dollars of securities on your balance sheet, at some point something’s going to break,” Eigen said. “I’m not saying it’s going to be in the short term, but man, when this thing breaks, the losses fixed-income investors will be facing will be devastating, and it’s my job in that environment to post positive returns.”
Eigen’s fund, which aims to outperform cash, has returned 3.2% in 2019, above the effective Federal Funds rate of 1.75% to 2%. But he’s also trailing behind peers who buy low or negative-yielding bonds: the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global-Aggregate Total Return Index has gained 6.2% this year.
He’s not alone as bond bears have underperformed this year, with even heavy hitters such as Dan Ivascyn’s Pimco Income Fund and Ray Dalio’s flagship investment losing out amid a global rally.
It’s not just sub-zero rates in Europe that are raising Eigen’s wariness. An automotive enthusiast with a penchant for fast Italian motorcycles, he takes his cues on the economy from customers at two commercial garages that he partly owns in central Massachusetts. Eigen’s not liking what he’s hearing as the 2020 presidential election draws near.
Nervous Customers
“I see some of our bigger buyers and the bigger customers getting really nervous,” he said. Elections “have become so polarized here in the U.S. that that can’t be good for confidence, and confidence drives the economy.”
The cocktail of risks is prompting Eigen to favor cash and highly liquid assets. His strategy, which can invest in or bet against almost anything in the fixed-income universe, has 21% parked in investment-grade corporate debt. He also favors non-agency mortgages.
Junk bonds now make up less than 5% of the fund from as high as 70% three years ago. While Eigen profited last year from shorting five-year German government debt, he’s not willing to repeat the wager today.
“My feeling is that rates can probably get a bit lower here in the U.S. and German rates will probably follow,” he said.
Even predictions of a further rally in U.S. Treasuries aren’t enough to whet his appetite. His portfolio is “about as defensively positioned as it’s ever been” and he’s building a war-chest of cash to deploy when bond markets sell off.

“I won’t engage in that,” he said. “The day I buy a negative-yielding security is when I’m retired. I don’t do that for investors. If people want to lock in losses they can do it all by themselves.”"

It is the first investment by Etihad in another airline since its 'equity alliance' strategy, which once saw it hold stakes in as many as eight other carriers, unravelled.
Air Arabia Abu Dhabi will be an independent joint venture based at Abu Dhabi International, the hub of Abu Dhabi state-owned Etihad, the two carriers said in a statement.
It will be the capital's first budget carrier.
Further details such as when the airline would start flying or ownership structure were not disclosed. An Etihad spokeswoman said more information would be given in the near future.
""This exciting partnership supports our transformation program and will offer our guests a new option for low-cost travel to and from Abu Dhabi, supplementing our own services. We look forward to the launch of the new airline in due course,"" said Etihad Group CEO Tony Douglas.
Etihad has been pursuing a turnaround strategy since 2017 that has seen it downsize its operations, including cancelling dozens of Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) orders.
Under Douglas, who joined in 2018, Etihad has refocused on becoming a mid-sized carrier, while stepping away from its investments in some of the airlines it holds stakes in.
Etihad, which has lost nearly $5 billion in the past three years, spent billions of dollars buying minority stakes in other airlines including insolvent Air Berlin, and Jet Airways.
Earlier this month, a senior executive said Etihad expected to be profitable again by 2023.
Air Arabia Abu Dhabi will be the UAE's fifth airline. Others include Emirates, one of the world's largest airlines, and Dubai discount carrier flydubai.
Air Arabia, the UAE's only listed airline, has its main hub at UAE's Sharjah airport and also has operating bases in Egypt, Morocco, and UAE's Ras Al Khaimah.
The Egyptian and Moroccan operations are joint ventures."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's Halkbank said on Wednesday that U.S. charges against it amount to an escalation of Washington's sanctions on Ankara over its military incursion in Syria, while President Tayyip Erdogan called them an ""unlawful, ugly"" step.
U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday charged the state-owned lender with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. In response, Halkbank's shares plunged as much as 7% on Wednesday despite a new ban on short selling. 
The indictment came a day after the United States imposed sanctions on Turkish officials, hiked tariffs and halted trade talks in an effort to persuade Turkey to stop attacks against the Kurdish YPG militia in northeastern Syria.
The indictment in a U.S. district court in New York, which further strains ties between the NATO allies, alleges Turkey's second-largest state bank conducted fraud, money laundering, and other sanctions offences.
While the U.S. district attorney did not tie the charges to sanctions over Syria, Halkbank did.
""These were filed as part of the sanctions introduced against our country by the U.S. government in response to Operation Peace Spring, heroically launched by the Turkish army to secure our borders and establish peace in the region,"" the bank said of the incursion now in its eighth day.
Halkbank (IS:HALKB) said it did not engage in sanctions violations as alleged and falls outside of the U.S. Justice Department's jurisdiction since it has no branches or employees in the United States.
""Therefore the decision to indict is an unprecedented legal overreach,"" it said.
The case against Halkbank follows from a previous criminal case that came to light in 2016 against Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who was accused of playing a central role in the sanctions evasion scheme.
Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a former Halkbank deputy general manager, was arrested in New York the following year and was later sentenced to 32 months in prison. He returned to Turkey in July after serving out his sentence.
Zarrab pleaded guilty and testified for U.S. prosecutors. He said Iran, with the help of Halkbank and Turkish government officials including the president, used a web of shell companies and sham transactions in gold, food and medicine to sidestep U.S. sanctions.
Turkey cast that case as a political plot against Erdogan's government and said it was an extension of a 2013 domestic corruption investigation, which Ankara says was launched by the network of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric.
Erdogan told reporters in Ankara the Halkbank issue was ""supposedly closed. But now they have taken an unlawful, ugly step with the southern New York prosecutors opening it again.""
""We will see the decision they will take, and we will (respond) accordingly,"" he added. 
'POLITICAL LEVERAGE'
Before Turkish markets opened, authorities banned short selling on seven large Turkish bank stocks including Halkbank. Selling shares in the banks only to buy them later in the session was also banned.
State banks - which have sold dollars to defend the lira since the Syria incursion began last week - were on Wednesday squeezing funding in an offshore FX swaps market to cushion the blow from the Halkbank indictment, a bond trader said.
Halkbank stock nonetheless fell as much as 7.2% at the open and was down 5.2% at 1137 GMT.
The main banking index (XBANK), which has fallen more than 16% this month on fears of U.S. repercussions, was down 2.4% while Turkey's broader stock index was off 1.3%.
Turkey's incursion into northeast Syria has tested its ties with the United States and could imperil its economy's recovery from last year's currency crisis. It came after President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the area.
The Kurdish YPG, which spearheaded the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, was a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State.
Turkey's lira  has declined some 10% against the dollar this year, due largely to worries over fraying U.S.-Turkish ties.
But the currency has firmed this week since the U.S. sanctions were announced and deemed lighter than expected. After the Halkbank indictment, the lira was up 0.3% at 5.9015 against the dollar.
A banking analyst who declined to be named said the Halkbank case ""has always been on the table as political leverage."" 
On Tuesday U.S. prosecutors said: ""This is one of the most serious Iran sanctions violations we have seen, and no business should profit from evading our laws or risking our national security."" 
Following the charges, the Borsa Istanbul temporarily banned short selling in banking shares within the top BIST-30 Index (XU030). The Capital Markets Board said it would protect investors and promote market stability.
Sadrettin Bagci, another bank analyst, at Deniz Yatirim, said Halkbank had the ability to absorb a possible fine of between $1.3-2.3 billion, depending on the capital measurement.
The U.S. sanctions and increased tariffs risk slowing Turkey's recovery from recession after last year's crisis chopped nearly 30% off the value of the lira. The crisis was set off by concerns over deteriorating U.S.-Turkey ties and political interference in monetary policy. 
State banks stepped in to sell dollars in March when the lira briefly tumbled, and traders said they intervened again in the last two weeks.

The Turkish stocks covered by the short selling ban are:  Akbank  (IS:AKBNK), Garanti Bank (IS:GARAN), Halkbank, Is Bank (IS:ISCTR), TSKB (IS:TSKB), VAKIFBANK (IS:VAKBN) and Yapi Kredi Bank (IS:YKBNK).

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania has been ordered by a World Bank arbitration court to pay $185 million to the Hong Kong subsidiary of  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) for breaching an energy contract.
The court's ruling, which was released on Tuesday, adds to pressure on the East African nation, which faces at least two other multi-million claims from international investors.
The case stems from a legal battle between the Tanzanian government and privately-owned independent power producer IPTL, which led to the dismissal of several cabinet ministers in 2014.
The award by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is less than the $352.5 million sought by Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong, which was not immediately available for comment.
The government of Tanzania denied any responsibility and said it was not planning to pay the damages.
""Neither the government nor (state power company) TANESCO, have a legal liability in these cases,"" Tanzania government spokesman Hassan Abbasi said on Twitter on Wednesday.
Tanzania's attorney general Adelardus Kilangi said that IPTL, not the government, would have to pay Standard Chartered.
""When the award says that the Tanzanian government should pay Standard Chartered Bank, the actual meaning is that the government should supervise IPTL to make the payment,"" he told Reuters.
IPTL did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tanzania faces at least two other cases at the World Bank tribunal.
U.S. firm Symbion Power said in 2017 it was seeking $561 million from TANESCO at the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce's International Court of Arbitration for breach of contract.
In 2017, a Canadian construction firm seized one of Tanzania’s new Q400 turbo-prop planes in Canada over a $38 million lawsuit related to a compensation ruling by the International Court of Arbitration.
Aviation sources said Tanzania reached a settlement to secure the aircraft, which was released in March 2018."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies on Wednesday launched a new generation of 5G mobile antennae, anticipating an acceleration in the pace of network upgrades led by the three operators in its vast Chinese home market.
Shenzhen-based Huawei has pioneered the development of so-called Massive MIMO - or multiple input and multiple output - antennae that feature arrays of transmitters and receivers to run fifth-generation mobile services.
These can achieve ultra-fast data speeds by directly tracking nearby smartphone users, unlike earlier 'passive' antennae that communicate in a more general - and less efficient - way with their environment.
Huawei's third generation of Massive MIMO antennae, unveiled at a client event in Zurich, double bandwidth to 400 Megahertz and boost power output to 320 Watts, making it possible to expand coverage in the mid-band frequencies that many countries have earmarked for 5G services.
They will also weigh less and use less power than their predecessors, Huawei's wireless business chief Edward Deng said in a keynote presentation.""It will eliminate the barriers to global deployment across all scenarios, and become a new standard to drive large-scale 5G deployment,"" said Deng. The antennae pack 7 nanometre chips - putting them at the leading edge of semiconductor technology.
Huawei is bundling the new 5G antennae into its Blade AAU base station, a space-saving package that includes a passive antenna. That will allow operators to save space and run all of their networks from a single site.
Huawei, the leading network vendor with a market share estimated at 28%, says its Massive MIMO technology is more advanced than that offered by its competitors led by Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA).
It has shipped 400,000 base stations this year as operators start to roll out 5G networks around the world. It estimates that 56 carriers have deployed the new networks, of which 40 are now up and running.
The telecoms industry hopes that 5G will run innovative applications, with Huawei signaling its interest in futuristic autonomous vehicles by teaming up with China Mobile (HK:0941) to run self-driving trucks at an open-cast mining project.
Huawei, also the world's No.2 smartphone maker, earlier announced a 27% jump in third-quarter revenues driven by a surge in shipments of phones launched before a trade blacklisting by the United States.
CHINA KICKS IN
Deng forecast that Huawei would ship a total of 600,000 base stations this year, with that figure set to grow in 2020 as China's three main operators accelerate construction of their own 5G networks.
Huawei will hold two rounds of tenders to lease base stations to the Chinese operators, with the first taking place before the end of this year, to help them manage the huge logistical and financial challenge of connecting the market of 1.4 billion people.
""We are trying to facilitate the Chinese carriers with their 5G process,"" Deng told a separate news briefing."

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling came off five-month highs and stocks traded sideways on Wednesday as the European Union and Britain sought to avert a disorderly Brexit before an EU summit on Thursday. 
Hopes of a breakthrough lifted markets on Tuesday, but investors turned more cautious after looking for a deal during the night that never came.
Conflicting reports about the ongoing talks triggered a series of sharp moves on the pound. Reports that Germany might use emergency measures to counter any market panic from a hard Brexit, such as banning bets on falling share prices, also weighed on morale. 
""Most of the good news that could have been anticipated has been priced in, and now there's caution it seems on whether we get a deal today or not,"" said Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg. 
Sterling was  down 0.4% against the dollar with investors trading volatility levels not seen since the 2016 June Brexit referendum. 
The pound had strengthened by close to 5% over the past week as investors rushed to reprice the prospect of a last-minute Brexit deal before the Oct. 31 deadline.
Euro zone government bonds were also volatile on Wednesday as investors watched the eleventh-hour talks. 
German 10-year government bond yields (DE10YT=RR) were last flat at -0.42%, after reaching an 11-week high of -0.397% as Bunds extended a sell-off that began on Tuesday.
British government 10-year bond yields were down 2.7 basis points at 0.67%, unaffected by data showing inflation in September reached 1.7% year-on-year, below market expectations.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) retreated 0.1%, but Britain's domestically focused midcaps (FTMC), a gauge of Brexit anxiety, fell 0.8%. Ireland's ISEQ (ISEQ), another vulnerable index, lost 0.6%. 
Earlier, shares rose in Asia. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) gained 0.5%. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) was flat. 
""Even though we are most optimistic that a deal does happen, we don't think the most likely outcome is that it happens by October 31, so you would be looking at some form of extension and potentially elections,"" said, Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
Third-quarter earnings are expected to show an overall decline in earnings, which could also weigh on morale, Sheets said. Morgan Stanley had a below-consensus view on how companies would fare this quarter, he said. 
Europe's companies are struggling with uncertainties ranging from Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war to Germany's manufacturing recession.
Companies listed on the STOXX 600 (STOXX) index are now expected to report a decline in third-quarter earnings of as much as 3.7%, worse than the 3% expected a week ago, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

The U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday. 
Global gross domestic product is now expected grow 3% in 2019, the IMF said its latest World Economic Outlook projections, down from 3.2% in a July forecast, largely because of global trade friction.
U.S. stocks, which typically track the ups and downs of the trade war, were set to open in the red. S&P 500 futures (ESc1) and Nasdaq futures (NQc1) were both down 0.3%.
In commodities, Brent crude (LCOc1) shed about 0.1 cent to $58.66 a barrel. U.S. crude (CLc1) rose 10 cents to $52.91 after falling the day before over fears the trade war would keep squeezing the global economy. 

In emerging markets, Turkey's Halkbank (IS:HALKB) saw its shares and bonds plunge after U.S. prosecutors charged the state-owned lender with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. A day earlier, Washington had imposed sanctions on Turkish officials, raised tariffs and halted trade talks after Turkey invaded northeastern Syria in a campaign again Kurdish fighters. Before Turkish markets opened, authorities banned short selling on seven large Turkish bank stocks, including Halkbank. Selling shares in the banks only to buy them later in the session was also banned, authorities said.

SHENZHEN, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's third-quarter revenue jumped 27%, driven by a surge in shipments of smartphones launched before a trade blacklisting by the United States expected to hammer its business.
Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecom network equipment and the No. 2 manufacturer of smartphones, was all but banned by the United States in May from doing business with American companies, significantly disrupting its ability to source key parts. 
The company has been granted a reprieve until November, meaning it will lose access to some technology next month. Huawei has so far mainly sold smartphones that were launched before the ban. 
Its newest Mate 30 smartphone - which lacks access to a licensed version of Google's (O:GOOGL) Android operating system - started sales last month.
Huawei in August said the curbs would hurt less than initially feared, but could still push its smartphone unit's revenue lower by about $10 billion this year. 
The tech giant did not break down third-quarter figures but said on Wednesday revenue for the first three quarters of the year grew 24.4% to 610.8 billion yuan.
Revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to 165.29 billion yuan ($23.28 billion) according to Reuters calculations based on previous statements from Huawei. 
""Huawei's overseas shipments bounced back quickly in the third quarter although they are yet to return to pre-US ban levels,"" said Nicole Peng, vice president for mobility at consultancy Canalys. 
""The Q3 result is truly impressive given the tremendous pressure the company is facing. But it is worth noting that strong shipments were driven by devices launched pre-US ban, and the long-term outlook is still dim,"" she added.
""STRONG PERFORMANCE""
The company said it has shipped 185 million smartphones so far this year. Based on the company's previous statements and estimates from market research firm Strategy Analytics, that indicates a 29% surge in third-quarter smartphone shipments.
Still, growth in the third quarter slowed from the 39% increase the company reported in the first quarter. Huawei did not break out figures for the second quarter either, but has said revenue rose 23.2% in the first half of the year.
""Our continued strong performance in Q3 shows our customers' trust in Huawei, our technology and services, despite the actions and unfounded allegations against us by some national governments,"" Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly told Reuters.
The U.S. government alleges Huawei is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy. Huawei has repeatedly denied its products pose a security threat.
The company, which is now trying to reduce its reliance on foreign technology, said last month that it has started making 5G base stations without U.S. components. 
It is also developing its own mobile operating system as the curbs cut its access to Google's Android operating system, though analysts are skeptical that Huawei's Harmony system is yet a viable alternative. 

Still, promotions and patriotic purchases have driven Huawei's smartphone sales in China - surging by a nearly a third compared to a record high in the June quarter - helping it more than offset a shipments slump in the global market.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (O:AVGO) has been ordered to halt exclusivity deals with six TV and modem makers for up to three years while EU antitrust enforcers investigate whether these agreements are aimed at thwarting rivals.
The move by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager suggests she may be more willing to take temporary but rapid action against tech giants deemed to be abusing their dominance rather than wait for investigations to be finalised.
Google (O:GOOGL) critics have for years urged Vestager to target the Alphabet Inc. subsidiary with such interim measures during its 10-year battle with EU antitrust regulators.
""It doesn't necessarily say that now we have all cases lined up where interim measures will be used but it means that the tool is on the table,"" Vestager told a news conference.
""And if we find cases that live up to the two things that have to be fulfilled at the same time, yes, we will indeed use interim measures more often,"" she said.
This is the first such order in 18 years.
Broadcom said it would comply with the order but would launch an appeal in the European courts, disputing the commission's assessment of provisions in its contracts.
""We do not believe that these provisions have a meaningful effect on whether the customers choose to purchase Broadcom products,"" the company said, adding that the order would not have a material impact on its set-top box and modem businesses.
The European Commission had in June warned Broadcom of a possible interim measure. The company, whose chips power smartphones, computers and networking equipment, is a major supplier to Apple (O:AAPL).
The Commission said Broadcom has 30 days to comply with the order, which is valid for up to three years, an estimate of how long the EU investigation will take.
The EU regulator said certain provisions in the deals with six of its major customers are likely to cause serious and irreparable harm to the competition as well as affect future tenders related to the introduction of WiFi 6 standard for modems and TV set-top boxes.
The competition enforcer's concerns center on Broadcom's deals with six TV set-top box and modem makers which result in the companies buying various chips exclusively or almost exclusively from the company.

Contentious practices include tying rebates or other benefits to exclusive or minimum-purchase requirements. Reuters reported on Oct. 4 that the Commission would order Broadcom to suspend these practices.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",Factbox: How are businesses preparing for a 'no-deal Brexit'?,"LONDON (Reuters) - Leaving the European Union without a deal at the end of this month will force businesses to navigate an unprecedented set of challenges from potential blockages at ports to the introduction of paperwork and tariffs. 
More than 10,000 trucks a day pass through the port of Dover, Britain's most important gateway to Europe, carrying 119 billion pounds ($150 billion) worth of trade a year. The potential for gridlock has forced companies to use alternative ports, reserve air cargo capacity and stockpile parts. 
This is what companies have said about the threat and actions taken to mitigate the impact:
TRANSPORT/FREIGHT:
Dover is as prepared as it can be but there are uncertainties over the extent to which freight operators are ready for new declarations and whether France will keep goods moving, the port's chief executive said. Doug Bannister expects potential problems to be felt from the week of Nov. 4, noting that traffic should be lighter on Friday Nov. 1 as it as a French public holiday. 
Getlink, the operator of the Eurotunnel service moving cars and lorries under the Channel, has created two ""pit stop"" control areas -- one on the English and one on the French side -- to help speed the processing of documents for truck drivers.
It has also added https://press.getlinkgroup.com/news/brexit-eurotunnel-is-ready-for-brexit-a-quarter-of-all-goods-traded-between-the-uk-and-the-eu-pass-through-the-channel-tunnel-bf60-0791e.html a control zone at its French terminal with nine inspection bays and 100 parking spaces to allow authorities to check goods from the UK without halting other traffic, and a 240-space parking zone for lorries heading to Britain.
RETAILERS:
For British retailers, Oct. 31 is about the worst possible timing for Brexit, coming just before the Christmas trading period which means warehouses are already packed with products.
    Although supermarket groups, such as  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), can build up stocks of non-perishable items, in reality there is limited capacity in supply chains to make that possible.
A hard Brexit will affect suppliers of some fresh foods, such as lettuces, tomatoes, citrus and soft fruits which come from southern Europe. Shortages and price inflation could ensue.
While the British government has set a temporary tariff regime that will make 88% of total imports by value eligible for levy free access, goods such as ceramics, cheese and clothing will face some tariffs. 
CARMAKERS
Britain's car industry, the country's biggest exporter of goods, faces tariffs on vehicles, engines and components, new bureaucracy and delays at ports which could halt output at factories reliant on just-in-time delivery of parts. BMW (DE:BMWG), Toyota (T:7203) and Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO) will close factories for up to a week on or after Oct. 31 in case of any disruption.
The interconnected nature of the industry means the impact would be felt across the continent including at the likes of Ford's (N:F) Cologne factory in Germany where roughly one in three cars is exported to Britain. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has increased stockpiles of cars in Britain.. The German group is the market leader in Britain, Europe's second-largest car market, notching up nearly half a million sales, almost all of which are imported.
Many automakers use British facilities as export hubs to the rest of the continent and do not make the same models at other factories in the EU, meaning they cannot quickly source or move output elsewhere. In the longer-term, no-deal Brexit tariffs of 10% on vehicles would be unsustainable for Nissan (T:7201) in Europe, where it runs Britain's biggest car factory.
""We are asking not to have tariffs being applied in a no-deal scenario because otherwise the tariffs won't be sustainable for us,"" the firm's European Chairman Gianluca de Ficchy said, referring to possible World Trade Organization tariffs.
PHARMACEUTICALS
The risk of drug shortages has been among the biggest worries associated with a disorderly Brexit, with 45 million patient packs going from the United Kingdom to other European countries each month, while another 37 million flow in the opposite direction, industry figures show.
Major drugmakers such as Bayer (DE:BAYGn),  Novartis  (S:NOVN), AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and GSK (L:GSK) have all taken contingency steps to secure their supply. 
 Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and Sanofi (PA:SASY), Europe's largest diabetes drug companies, for instance, have spent millions of pounds stockpiling insulin in Britain and are building new shipping and air freight routes.
Some drugs, such as Bayer's radiopharmaceutical Xofigo against prostate cancer, would perish if stockpiled. Bayer is working on simplified customs arrangements with the British authorities.
The government has also signed deals with ferry companies worth 86.6 million pounds to ensure the continued supply of medicines, and created a ""Support Unit"" to help suppliers of medical goods prepare and have customs paperwork in place. 
AIRLINES:
Britain and the EU have put measures in place to ensure that flights can continue in any exit scenario.
Airlines will also have to adjust to rules that mean those not majority owned by EU nationals face the threat of losing their right to fly within the bloc. Most major European airlines say they either comply with the rules or will curb the voting rights of non-EU shareholders in order to remain aloft.
FARMING
The National Farmers Union has described a no-deal Brexit as ""catastrophic for British farming"". The EU is set to impose tariffs which could cripple trade in some products. A 46% tariff on lamb, for example, would make British exports uncompetitive in key markets such as France. Delays at the border could also make trade in perishable goods such as fresh produce unviable.
FISHING:

If Britain leaves the EU without a deal it becomes an independent coastal state. This means it will regain control over its waters but policing will be difficult given there will only be a few vessels patrolling a space several times the size of the surface area of the United Kingdom. Some seafood exports to the EU will also face tariffs while there is concern about the impact of customs checks given many products are perishable.

Lidl and rival Aldi have changed the shape of the UK grocery sector, stealing market share from industry leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW) by offering cut-throat prices in no-frills stores.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.6%. Chief Executive Carrie Lam is set to present her annual policy address later in the morning. 
Her speech is expected to receive some attention as the city’s political crisis has put its economy on the brink of recession.
“I’m sure you agree that the most important livelihood issue that a chief executive should address would be housing and land supply,” Lam said on Tuesday.
Overnight, the U.S. House passed four measures, including the “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act”, on Tuesday in unanimous voice votes. 
The bill gave support to pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong as it provides sanctions against officials “responsible for undermining fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong.”

Investing.com -- The U.K.’s Brexit negotiators might be stuck in a ‘tunnel’, but ASOS PLC (LON:ASOS), fallen angel of the fast-fashion world, looks like it’s coming out of one.
Shares in the online clothing retailer rose 16% in early trading on Wednesday after a set of earnings for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 that were remarkable mainly for the absence of any new shoes dropping. Another thing conspicuous for its absence was the lack of any numerical guidance for the coming fiscal year, with chief financial officer Mat Dunn only giving away a Capex target of 150 million pounds ($190 million) on a call with analysts.
It was a torrid year for a company that had been a stock market darling for much of the last decade: profits fell 68% as the new, highly-automated warehouses in both the U.S. and Europe, which were supposed to help it become a global player, suffered a succession of problems. Sales in the booming U.S. market grew only 9%.
CEO Nick Beighton admitted on an analyst call that the company hadn’t had the “bandwidth” to manage such a large project, but said the worst was now behind it.
“Having identified the root causes of our operational issues, we have made substantial progress over the last few months in resolving them. Whilst there remains lots of work to be done to get the business back on track, we are now in a more positive position to start the new financial year,” Beighton said.
He told analysts that the company’s investments mean it has now increased its throughput capacity to 10 million units a weeks – a fivefold increase from 2016. The focus now switches to squeezing the most out of those investments.
Crucially, the investments have helped Asos diversify its sales away from a U.K. market overshadowed by Brexit. Over 60% of its sales now come from abroad.
Even after its surge on Wednesday morning, Asos shares are still down by nearly half from 12 months ago, and the company trades at less than one year’s sales. By comparison, rival Boohoo trades at nearly three times that multiple – albeit Boohoo’s management has arguably deserved the premium having done a better job of managing the upscaling process.
Elsewhere Wednesday, Europe’s stocks were largely on the retreat, as traders tempered their hopes for a deal to stop the U.K. crashing out of the EU at the end of the month amid reports of dissent from U.K. Conservative Euroskeptic backbench lawmakers, and from the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.3% at 392.70 by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), having hit its highest level since late July on Tuesday. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.2% while the more U.K.-focused FTSE 250 was the worst performer in the region, losing 1.0%.

The CBOE Volatility Index slid a fifth straight day Tuesday to 13.54, the lowest since July 29. In the three times this year Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge dropped below 14 after spending a few weeks above it, shares rallied further twice, according to Sundial Capital Research Inc. founder Jason Goepfert.
“Historically, it has been more of a positive than a negative,” he wrote Tuesday about the VIX’s move. “It’s not so low that it has proven to be a sign of complacency.”
Looking back further, among about 30 instances since 1990 when the VIX declined below 14 for the first time in more than three weeks, only one of the signals preceded a loss over the next six to 12 months, he said.
After a relatively calm September, investors were whipsawed at the start of October as U.S.-China trade tensions resurfaced and global economic data weakened. The S&P 500 Index has moved at least 1% on six occasions this month, versus only two 1%-plus moves in the whole of September.
For Schaeffer’s Investment Research, the drop in the gauge of equity swings is also a signal of upside for stocks.
“The ‘all clear’ signal for a near-term decline in volatility triggered as of Friday’s close, as the VIX closed below its 200-day moving average,” said senior vice president of research Todd Salamone, in a note Monday."

The oil giant is set to pay between $350 million and $450 million to a group of more than 20 banks working on its initial public offering, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The payment would represent a fee of about 1% on the $40 billion Aramco is seeking to raise -- relatively low compared to other markets.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are expected to be paid the most, the people said. The final amount paid to banks will depend on how much Aramco raises, they said. A representative for Aramco declined to comment.
Investment bankers from around the world have been pitching for years to win a coveted role on Aramco’s IPO. Many firms have been investing heavily into the kingdom on expectations of a fee bonanza as the country diversifies away from oil. Many have been left disappointed though as deals have been delayed or failed to materialize.
Falling Short
Even though Aramco’s would be one of the biggest fee pools for investment banks, it would still fall short of the $535 million Softbank Group Corp. paid when it raised $21 billion by selling shares in its Japanese telecommunications business last year.
Still, perhaps bankers shouldn’t complain too much. When Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank raised $6 billion in its 2014 IPO, advisers including HSBC and Gulf International Bank were paid just 0.1% of the offering value.
Aramco’s board is planning to meet with its advisers on the IPO around Oct. 17 to give final approval for the share sale, according to other people familiar with the matter. Aramco is speeding up preparations for the IPO with an aim of listing on the Saudi bourse as soon as November, Bloomberg News has reported.
The draw of working on what’s set to be the world’s biggest IPO -- even for relatively low compensation -- has attracted some of the top Wall Street names. Aramco appointed nine global co-coordinators, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. There are also 15 book runners and three financial advisers.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. paid $300 million to banks when it raised $25 billion in the biggest IPO to date."
89,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 04:20AM ET</span>",Undercover entrepreneurs: fearful Mexican tech startups shun spotlight,"By Julia Love and Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - In Mexico's burgeoning startup scene, publicity is the last thing many entrepreneurs want.
Unlike plenty of their P.R.-hungry counterparts in Silicon Valley, Mexican startup founders often decline media interviews, avoid public announcements and suppress details of financial success.
One big reason: they do not want to attract criminals.
""You are getting yourself in a position where you could be subject to ransom,"" entrepreneur Ulises Vazquez said of the drug-fueled violence and kidnappings that have scarred society.
""You want to have a low profile to be able to continue with your freedom,"" he added. Vazquez twice kept quiet on major startup milestones: when he sold a stake in his advertising agency Ergos in 2010, and when the acquiring firm, Matomy (TA:MTMY), went public in 2014.
Though understandable, the low-profile approach is holding back Mexico's technology industry, investors and experts say, making it harder to attract talent and money, especially from abroad.
Mexico's tech sector last year drew only $175 million in venture capital, according to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America. That was dwarfed by Brazil, the region's powerhouse, which received $1.3 billion, but also trailed Colombia, which drew $334 million in venture capital though its economy is worth about a quarter of Mexico's.
Reuters spoke with two dozen investors and startup founders who acknowledged that security concerns were widespread in the tech community and had even pushed some entrepreneurs abroad.
Illustrating the concern, most declined to speak on the record. 
Without publicity, entrepreneurs struggle to recruit the best, bring in money and inspire the next generation, said Daniel Green, a partner at Silicon Valley law firm Gunderson Dettmer who advises startups across Latin America. 
""It certainly stunts the growth,"" he said.
""LIVING AT RISK""
To be sure, violence is rampant elsewhere in Latin America, from drug-torn Colombia to crime-ridden Brazil.
But the issue is especially acute in Mexico due to an escalation of violence from over a decade ago when the government sent armed forces into the streets to crack down on the cartels. Around the same time, drug gangs began branching into extortion.  
A string of high-profile kidnappings and murders, including the death of an executive at broadcaster Televisa killed on his bike during a shootout in 2017, rattled the elite. 
That has generated business for executive protection firms, who provide bullet-proof vehicles, GPS trackers, armed bodyguards and real-time monitoring.
For startups, the fears may be more perception than reality: there are no known cases of tech entrepreneurs being attacked after sharing their company's success.
And some do still announce their deals.
Bismarck Lepe, chief executive of software company Wizeline, believes his peers are being over-cautious, despite the horrors Mexico has suffered.
""Communicating more about your success helps the community, helps the company, helps the investors,"" said Lepe, who divides his time between Silicon Valley and Mexico.
""As long as you are not involved in the drug trade, nothing is going to happen to you.""
Mexican entrepreneur Domingo Guerra, who founded cybersecurity startup Appthority in California, said he is not generally worried about safety when he returns home. But he did feel uncomfortable after announcing a funding round.
""Folks were asking how I was going to spend the money, what I was going to buy first,"" said Guerra, now a senior director at cybersecurity giant Symantec (O:SYMC) after the acquisition of his company in 2018. ""I spent a lot of time explaining that really none of that money was for the founders.""
One startup founder, assigned a U.S. Army veteran trained in anti-kidnapping maneuvers by a firm acquiring his company, became fed up of having to take a different route home every day and eventually relocated with his family to the United States.
Another who founded his startup in the San Francisco area said American colleagues were frustrated by his quiet approach due to fears for his relatives back in Mexico.
""There's an unofficial tax for operating and living in Mexico - and that tax is living at risk,"" he said. 
FROM SCOOTER TO SUV
Some entrepreneurs have simply faded from public view.
Adolfo Babatz, the chief executive of Mexican payments company Clip, was once a staple of the local business press. In 2018, he gave at least five published interviews and graced the cover of business magazine Expansion beside the headline: ""Think big.""
He took a different tack this year after SoftBank (T:9984) pumped about $20 million into his company, making him among the first Mexican entrepreneurs to win the Japanese conglomerate's stamp of approval. Babatz did not announce the deal and appears to have given few interviews so far in 2019.
SoftBank, which plans to pour $5 billion into Latin America, declined to comment.
Some entrepreneurs advocate workarounds. 
Gabriel Leon, who recently launched fintech company Oyster Financial in Mexico, plans to disclose company funding rounds on an online database, rather than via the media.
""We never talk about money,"" he said. ""We talk about the product we're building, the opportunity in the market, our competitors. That's how you get attention from investors."" 
Some entrepreneurs say the political climate, with leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador frequently crusading against the elites, has made it an additionally awkward time to tout multi-million deals in a culture that frowns on bragging.
Mexico's Economy Ministry did not respond to Reuters requests to discuss the startup sector's security concerns.
Sergio Romo, chief executive of Mexican scooter startup Grin, followed a similar trajectory to Babatz after a $45.7 million funding round last year.
Earlier this year, Romo, who was known for tooling around the capital in his company's neon green scooters, left a meeting with Mexico City regulators in a large SUV with tinted windows, according to someone who participated in the meeting.
Romo told Reuters that was unusual and he still uses scooters, but acknowledged keeping a low profile was advisable.
""People outside the startup world tend to think that founders who raise a lot of money become rich themselves, but sometimes that's not the case,"" he said.
""We are just founders trying to make it happen.""

  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS   (OTC:THBIY), as the lender is officially known, dropped as much as 7.4%, the biggest intraday decline since March 27, even after the exchange imposed a short-selling ban on shares in seven banks. The stock was 3.7% lower as of 10:43 a.m. in Istanbul.
Halkbank’s slump underscores the increasing pressure on the Turkish economy and lira assets as the row with NATO ally the U.S. over Ankara’s decision to send troops across its borders into Syria deepens. The indictment against Halkbank was filed Tuesday in a Manhattan federal court and overlaps with increasing calls from U.S. lawmakers from both parties for President Donald Trump to punish Turkey severely for its military offensive.
Wednesday’s market reaction extended beyond the lender’s stock. The yield on Halkbank’s July 2021 dollar surged more than 450 basis points on Wednesday to 13.9%. That’s about double the yield on the similar-dated debt of some of its peers, a sign that investors are beginning to price in financial distress.
The bank last sold bonds overseas in July 2016 and last raised a syndicated loan from international lenders in December 2015.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The date of entry into service of Boeing Co's ultra-long-range 777-8 wide-body airliner will depend partly on customer demand, an executive said, with the planemaker hoping to win an order from Qantas Airways Ltd to supply the plane for Sydney-London flights. 
Qantas (AX:QAN) has said it could order Boeing's (N:BA) 777-8 or the rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350-1000 for the longest commercial flights in history by the end of this year, with hopes of delivery from late 2022.
The airline on Friday plans a near 20-hour test flight non-stop from New York to Sydney, another proposed route for the planes, with a limited number of passengers on board a 787 as it conducts research into well-being on such long journeys.
Qantas has said the plane order remains subject to a favorable business case and reaching agreements with the pilot's union and Australia's aviation regulator for unprecedented crew duty times.
Boeing and Airbus are vying for the prestigious order, which stretches the limits of their longest-range planes.
Boeing said in August it had pushed back the entry into service of the 777-8 beyond its earlier plan for 2022. The larger 777-9, due to enter service first with a shorter range, has faced engine-related delays. 
""Our timetable on the 777-8 obviously is still under consideration for when it actually enters service,"" Darren Hulst, a senior marketing executive at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told reporters in a telephone briefing from Sydney on Wednesday.
""But it is really more of when (we have) the combination of the demand from our customers and how it aligns with the design and production for the 777X as a program.""
He declined to comment on whether an order from Qantas would accelerate Boeing's plans for the 777-8. To date, Emirates and Qatar Airways are Boeing's only customers for the plane, having ordered 35 and 10 respectively. 
Emirates President Tim Clark has said some 777X orders could be switched to 787s. Emirates and Qatar Airways did not respond to previous requests for comment on their 777-8 orders.
Boeing has put forward a ""compelling offer"" to deal with any delays to the 777-8 in its contest against Airbus for planes for Sydney-London flights, Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in August, without providing further details.
The Australian and International Pilots Association, which represents Qantas pilots, said on Wednesday it would help gather data on fatigue on three planned research flights, starting with the New York-Sydney journey on Friday. A London-Sydney flight is planned next month.

The union cautioned the flights would not replicate real-world conditions.

The year-on-year increase was largely due to the low sales volumes recorded in September 2018, when registrations fell ""significantly"" following the introduction of WLTP emission standards, European car industry association ACEA said.

But Jayesh Mehta, a veteran trader at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) is a rare bull in Mumbai’s fixed-income world. He thinks fresh gains are just around the corner.
Sovereign debt sold off in the past two months on fears Prime Minister Narendra Modi will expand the record 7.1 trillion rupees ($100 billion) in borrowings to support a slowing economy. The rout diminished the impact of Asia’s most aggressive monetary-policy easing and a banking system that’s flushed with liquidity.
“Bond traders are pricing in fiscal slippage and higher borrowings,” but “our view is that the government will meet its deficit targets,” said Mehta, BofAML’s country treasurer. ‘Right now, market is skeptical but I reckon it will eventually change and see the 10-year yield dip below 6% by end of March.”
The yield on notes due in January 2029 was little changed at 6.66% at 9:23 a.m. in Mumbai after falling by seven basis points in the previous two sessions.
Bonds will benefit from as much as 75 basis points of rate cuts, ample liquidity in the banking system and a clarification from the government on extra borrowings, according to Mehta.
I am “bullish on bonds,” he said, adding the RBI will focus on supporting growth even if inflation inches higher.
For Mehta, the 30-year bond veteran, going against the crowd and winning has become the norm. Early this year he correctly predicted the central bank would ease; he got the call right in 2017, too. Last August, he forecast a drop in yields.
Debt Support
His forecast now for yields to drop below 6% compares with a consensus forecast of 6.45% by end of the fiscal year in March. And his estimate of as much as 75 basis points of RBI rate reductions is more aggressive than the median for 25 points in a Bloomberg survey.
Mehta is also predicting the RBI can take a leaf from the Federal Reserve and the European Central bank and help curtail the budget deficit by buying government debt through its open-market operations, a move that will that will also support yields.
The central bank could buy $15 billion of bonds in the next six months, according to estimates of BofAML’s India economists. The authority in August already approved a record 1.76 trillion-rupee ($24.4 billion) payout to the government.
“The central bank can monetize the fiscal deficit by buying bonds,” said Mehta. “The U.S. Fed and other Central banks are doing it, so it’s likely the RBI may also do the same.”

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's Supreme Court has ordered the Bank of Chile to allow tax authorities to examine the local accounts of Uber (N:UBER), rejecting an appeal by the ride-sharing company, according to a judgment seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
The bank was ordered to provide the Internal Revenue Service (SII) with details of payments into and out of two bank accounts controlled by Uber´s local entity between January 1 2015 and May 30 2017, along with information about other bank accounts it previously opened then closed, within 10 days of the ruling.
It is the latest in a series of legal disputes globally involving Uber and its drivers over issues such as employment terms, regulation and taxation which could impinge on its operations and profitability.
The court document said Uber Chile SPA received significant payments from its parent company in the Netherlands.
The tax authorities singled out payments from Uber in the Netherlands labeled Driver Payment Chile of more than 500 million Chilean pesos ($697,600) for the 2016 tax year and 60 billion pesos for the 2017 tax year, according to the court ruling.
Uber had appealed against an order by the Tax and Customs Court in Santiago and Chile´s Appeal Court that bank secrecy be lifted for the inspection by the tax authorities.
""The law authorizes SII to request judicial authorization for the correct exercise of its supervisory powers in order to obtain essential background to verify the veracity and integrity of tax returns,"" the Supreme Court judgment said.
Uber did not respond to Reuters´ request for comment on the finding.
The Internal Revenue Service said in a statement that ""all taxpayers who develop a lucrative activity in the country, legal or natural persons, Chilean or foreign, must comply with the obligations established by the tax regulations.""
An Uber spokesman told Reuters in March that it encouraged drivers to declare their incomes to the tax authorities as self-employed workers.
""Uber is present across all regions of Chile, more than 85,000 drivers use our platform to earn an income and support their families, and more than 2.2 million people rely on Uber to move around their cities,"" it said.
Uber and other ride-sharing digital applications remain technically illegal in Chile where legislation to govern them has been delayed amid representations by traditional taxi firms and unions.
Last week, Uber announced it would seek to buy a majority share in the Santiago-based grocery delivery application Cornershop to provide Uber customers with ""the operating system for your everyday life""."

Unizo stock rose as much as 5.6% to 4,965 yen in early Tokyo trade after Blackstone announced its offer the previous day, doubling down on its $1.6 billion offer after the proposal was rebuffed by the hotelier.
The Japanese firm said in a statement it had not decided how to respond to the tender offer and would consult with a special committee on how to proceed.
It said it had learned about the offer from a press release issued through PR Times but had not been contacted by Blackstone.
Unizo was little known until travel services provider  H.I.S. Co Ltd  (T:9603) launched a tender offer for it in July. Unizo ultimately rejected the bid but attracted the attention of other suitors who see the company as vastly undervalued.
But Unizo has played hard to get: Last week it rejected a proposal from Blackstone as well as one from an unidentified ""locally renowned"" fund.
Before that, Unizo withdrew support for a white-knight bid from Fortress Investment Group, an asset manager backed by SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).

Its biggest shareholder Elliot Management last week asked Unizo's board to address its concerns about disclosure in relation to its withdrawal of support for the Fortress bid.

(Reuters) - A Michigan judge on Tuesday blocked the state's ban on flavored e-cigarettes about two weeks after it took effect and hours after a wrongful death lawsuit was filed against Juul Labs Inc in the first such case against an e-cigarette firm.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer had ordered the state ban in September, declaring that teenagers' use of e-cigarettes, known as vaping, was a public health emergency.
Judge Cynthia Diane Stephens of the Michigan Court of Common Claims said that vaping was a public health concern, but agreed with the retailers that there was likely no basis for the governor to use her emergency powers.
""There is no serious dispute with respect to whether a vaping-use crisis exists among youth,"" the judge wrote.
However, she said, the data cited by the governor in ordering the ban had been available since at least February, undercutting the claim that it was emergency.
Stephens' ruling is a preliminary injunction, meaning it will remain in effect while the retailers and the state continue to litigate the dispute.
Whitmer's office had no immediate comment.
Michigan is one of several states, including Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island, that have moved to restrict sales of flavored e-cigarettes on the grounds that they pose a health risk to teenagers. A New York court earlier this month blocked that state's ban from taking effect.
Also on Tuesday, Juul was sued in federal court in San Francisco by a Florida woman who said her son, Daniel Wakefield, died in his sleep at age 18 as a result of Juul use. The mother, Lisa Vail, is seeking unspecified damages.
Vail's lawsuit is the first wrongful death case to be brought against Juul, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company already faces a growing number of lawsuits by young adults and parents of teenagers against Juul and, in some cases, its parent company, Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO).

Most of the lawsuits say only that users became addicted to nicotine as a result of using Juul, but some allege serious health consequences.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc is seeking permission from the Federal Reserve to boost its stake in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) above the 10% level, according to an application document provided by the Fed on Tuesday.
Bloomberg first reported the application on Tuesday. Shares of BofA gained 3% after the report came out, dipping slightly to close at 2.02%.
Berkshire, which has a 9.96% stake in BofA, filed an application with the Fed this month, assuring the regulator that it will passively invest in the bank and will not try to force a change in strategy or corporate structure.
""Berkshire routinely assesses market conditions and may decide to purchase additional shares of common stock of Bank of America based on its evaluation of the investment opportunity presented by such purchases,"" the application reads. 
""Berkshire anticipates that any such purchases would be on the open market at prevailing market prices.""
Ownership above the 10% level attracts increased regulatory scrutiny and the Federal Reserve only allows investors to take double-digit stakes on the assurance the buyer would not try to force a controlling influence.

(Reuters) - MGM Resorts International (N:MGM) said on Tuesday it would sell its Bellagio and Circus Circus resorts in Las Vegas in separate deals valued at about $5 billion, as the U.S. casino operator seeks to monetize its real estate assets and bolster its balance sheet.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Real Estate Income Trust will acquire the Bellagio for $4.25 billion through a 95-5 joint venture with MGM and will lease it back to a unit of the casino company for an initial annual rent of $245 million. 
MGM said it would sell Circus Circus Las Vegas to an affiliate of Treasure Island owner Phil Ruffin for $825 million.
The divestment come nine months after MGM, which had a long-term debt of $15 billion as of December 2018, formed a committee to evaluate its real estate portfolio amid its move to an asset-light model.
MGM Chief Executive Officer Jim Murren said the company would use the proceeds from both the deals to ""build a fortress balance sheet"" and return capital to shareholders.
Both deals are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019.
MGM's other assets include MGM Grand and MGM pringfield and it also holds stakes in CityCenter and MGM Growth Properties LLC.
In January, MGM announced plans to cut costs and boost growth, proposing to increase annualized adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by $300 million by the end of 2021. (https://reut.rs/33A19ng)

BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments on Tuesday said it was reviewing its relationship with money manager Ken Fisher while Philadelphia's board of pensions terminated its business with his firm after he allegedly made disparaging remarks about women last week.
Known to investors through frequent television ads for his investment advice, Fisher had already lost business with Michigan's retirement system last week and faces scrutiny from other similar funds, including in Florida, even as he and his firm try to make amends.
Fisher's setbacks come in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has exposed widespread sexual harassment or abuse of women in multiple spheres of American life and ended the careers of dozens of powerful men in media, politics, entertainment and business.
Philadelphia's board of pensions terminated Fisher Investments as an investment manager because of ""inappropriate statements"" made at a conference last week, a city spokesman said on Tuesday. The city's retirement system had roughly $54 million under management with Fisher, the spokesman said. 
Fidelity Investments criticized the money manager over the remarks, saying it was reviewing the $500 million Fisher's firm manages for the mutual fund giant.
""We are very concerned about the highly inappropriate comments by Kenneth Fisher. The views he expressed do not align in any way with our company's values,"" Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said. ""We do not tolerate these types of comments at our company.""
In addition a spokesman for the Florida State Board of Administration, for which Fisher manages $175 million in assets, said the retirement system is reviewing his role.
In a memo to his firm's employees sent to Reuters by a spokesman, Fisher said ""It pains me to know that my comments have caused you grief, concern, and indignation. I sincerely apologize.""
In a separate employee memo, Fisher Investments Chief Executive Damian Ornani wrote that ""Ken's comments were wrong,"" and said the firm is launching a task force to address diversity and inclusion at the firm itself.
Fisher Investments manages money within the $8 billion Fidelity Strategic Advisers Small-Mid Cap Fund (O:FSCFX). His firm manages more than $100 billion, including at top U.S. public pension funds.
Fidelity Chairman Abigail Johnson, who is one of the few female leaders among large financial service firms, told staff two years ago the company had no tolerance for any type of harassment after the dismissal of a well-known money manager who had been accused of misconduct.[ https://reut.rs/2BgoHBe ]
Alex Chalekian, chief executive of a financial advisory firm, called attention to the comments Fisher made at a financial conference last week in a video posted Oct. 9 on Twitter. 
He said Fisher had made derogatory comments about genitalia, picking up girls and financier Jeffrey Epstein, among other topics. Epstein committed suicide in August while being held in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Charles Roame, managing partner of conference organizer Tiburon Strategic Advisors, said in a note on the firm's website that comments made at the Oct. 8 conference ""lacked the dignity & respect that should be expected by any Tiburon CEO summit speaker or attendee."" 
Although he did not name Fisher, Roame praised Chalekian for going public ""with his views of offensive behavior."" 
Michigan's $70 billion retirement system dropped Fisher Investments over the remarks on Thursday, according to a letter sent to the state's investment board. Fisher had managed $600 million for the retirement system, money that will now be managed internally.
Fisher Investments is also a sub-adviser on the $600 million Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Multi-Manager Global Equity Fund.  Goldman Sachs spokesman Patrick Scanlan declined to comment.
Teir Jenkins, investment officer for the city of Oakland, California, said retirement officials there had decided to replace Fisher Investments as manager of about $17 million in July. He said Fisher's comments last week may move up the schedule.

""This kind of lights a fire under us. We are working to expedite the transition,"" Jenkins said.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian loss-making airline Alitalia won a commitment from toll-road operator  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) and state railways Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) on Tuesday to come to its rescue provided a number of conditions were met.
The green light will avert the threat of liquidation hanging over the ailing carrier as an Oct. 15 deadline set by the industry ministry for a deal expires.
Two sources close to the matter said the Industry Ministry was expected to extend the deadline to give the sides time to iron out certain issues. It was not possible to obtain an immediate comment from the ministry.
Several hurdles still must be overcome before the third turnaround attempt in Alitalia's history can be launched.
The state-driven plan involves setting up a new company to hold the good assets of Alitalia and receive a cash injection expected to be around 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) from the rescuers.
In two separate statements on Tuesday Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, and FS said they would proceed with binding offers for the airline as long as a leading carrier was also willing to invest in the flagship carrier.
Atlantia and FS have been in talks since July with Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) but on Tuesday mentioned neither the U.S. carrier nor German carrier Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) which has recently said it could be interested.
The two Italian investors said they were each ready to take a minority stake in the new Alitalia but added more work was needed to find a deal on a business plan and a governance structure.
An investment by Atlantia in the airline could help mend fences with Rome following threats by the ruling coalition 5-Star Movement to revoke the group's motorway concessions after a bridge collapse last year that killed 43 people.
Atlantia runs half of Italy’s 6,000 kilometers of toll roads through its ASPI unit which generates one-third of core profit.
In their statements on Tuesday, Atlantia and FS asked for European Union clearance for financing provided to Alitalia by the state since 2017, which amounts to 900 million euros ($992.8 million) so far.
Sources have said the airline might need more cash to survive until the rescue plan kicks in.
The two companies also asked for further help from the government for possible job cuts relating to the turnaround of Alitalia.
Alitalia has been run by special administrators since May 2017 after going through two previous unsuccessful rescue attempts in 2009 and 2014."

The Nevada Gaming Control Board lodged a complaint on Monday with the state's Gaming Commission, saying Wynn was ""unsuitable to be associated with a gaming enterprise or the gaming industry."" 
""He failed to exercise discretion and sound judgment to prevent incidents, which negatively reflected on the repute of the State of Nevada and acted as a detriment to the development of the gaming industry,"" the filing noted. 
The U.S. casino mogul resigned as CEO of his company Wynn Resorts early last year following claims he subjected women co-workers to unwanted advances, becoming one of the most prominent business leaders to quit over sexual misconduct allegations in recent months. He has denied the accusations. 
Nevada's gaming control board said it had undertaken its own investigation on Wynn's conduct after the company failed to monitor and investigate the same, and has found numerous ""potential instances of unwelcome sexual conduct.""
Earlier this year, Wynn Resorts said it had agreed to an undisclosed settlement in response to a disciplinary complaint filed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board following the sexual misconduct claims.
The casino company, which has operations in Las Vegas and Macau, and Wynn's lawyer could not be reached for a comment. 
Wynn's departure from his company came as the ""MeToo"" movement galvanized women to publicly air their experiences.

Massachusetts gaming regulators in April fined Wynn Resorts $35 million for not disclosing sexual misconduct allegations against its founder.

(Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) on Tuesday topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit, boosted by higher fares and lower fuel costs, and lifted its 2019 profit target despite the continued grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.
Chicago-based United is one of three U.S. airlines that have each had to cancel more than 2,000 monthly flights through the end of the year as Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX remains grounded following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
The flight cancellations have weighed on airline profits and costs, but strong travel demand, despite concerns of a global economic slowdown, continued to offset MAX headwinds and disruption in Hong Kong and China.
As a result, United raised its 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to $11.25-$12.25 versus $10.50-$12.00 previously.
United shares, which closed up 1% at $87.88 before the earnings release, were about 1% higher in after-hours trading.
Total operating revenue rose 3.4% to $11.38 billion, underpinned by the airline's three-year strategy to build up flight connections through its main U.S. hubs. 
But closely watched unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing expenses, a concern for investors, rose 2.1%.
The airline, which is in talks with Boeing over 737 MAX compensation, did not provide any details on the estimated financial impact of the grounding.
Adjusted net income rose to $1.05 billion, or $4.07 per share, in the third quarter, from $834 million or $3.05 per share a year earlier.
Analysts on average had forecast $3.95 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
United management will host a conference call to discuss results on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT).
Fellow U.S. MAX operators Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and American Airlines (O:AAL), which have both warned of a pretax profit hit from the MAX grounding, are due to report quarterly results next week.

United, Southwest and American are all scheduling without the MAX until early January.

113,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 05:21PM ET</span>",Day Ahead : Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. Netflix and IBM Get Big Tech Earnings Underway
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) roll out earnings tomorrow after the closing bell.
With the streaming wars gathering pace, analysts are keen to get a sense of whether Netflix can revive its subscriber growth following weaker-than-expected numbers in the second quarter.
For the third quarter, Netflix said it expected to add 7 million subscribers, above the 6.1 million reported a year earlier, with 800,000 net new subscribers in the U.S.
Netflix is expected to report earnings of $1.03 per share on revenue of $5.25 billion.
As well as earnings and subscriber numbers, guidance will also come under added scrutiny, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) set to release their streaming services next month.
Against the backdrop of rising competition, Wedbush said it expects upside to total subscriber guidance “appears likely given the solid slate of new content that debuted in Q3, which should help dampen domestic churn.”
The competition question has definitely hurt the stock. It was up 33.2% in the first quarter but lost almost all of that gain a big third-quarter slump. It's now up 6.2% on the year.
 IBM  (NYSE:IBM) is expected to report earnings of $2.67 a share on revenue of $18.23 billion.
To step up its shift into the higher-margined cloud computing sector, IBM acquired open-source software giant Red Hat in July. Many on Wall Street are now eagerly awaiting the report to gauge the impact of the acquisition.
The aggressive M&A activity, however, has kept a lid on free cash flow and profit growth and will likely continue to do so, according to Wedbush.
""We believe IBM’s results will continue to be impacted by structural headwinds taking place at the company’s services and software segments, as well as by weak free cash flow generation and profitability given the company’s aggressive M&A activity,"" Wedbush said in a note.
IBM shares are up nearly 26% this year, with most of the gain coming in the first quarter as stocks recovered from 2018 end-of-year slump.
2. Bank of America Earnings Due
Before the bell on Wednesday, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) brings the curtain down on earnings for big Wall Street banks following reports from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) and   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC).
Like that of its peers, Bank of America’s earnings will likely reflect the bittersweet impact of Fed rate cuts, which has tended to hurt interest income growth while boosting loan growth.
Bank of America is expected to report earnings of 55 cents on revenue of $22.6 billion. Shares are up 20.7% this year.
3. Retail Sales, Beige Book Eyed 
Retail sales data will give traders another opportunity to gauge the strength of the U.S. consumer, one of key drivers keeping the U.S economy from succumbing to the slowdown in global growth. 
The Commerce Department will release the numbers for September at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that retail sales rose 0.3% last month, down from a 0.4% rise the month before, while core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose 0.2% from flat the previous month.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report, due at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT), will also come under the spotlight ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day rate meeting at the end of the month.
The report is an anecdotal description of the state of the domestic economy compiled by staffs at the 12 Federal Reserve Banks."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors in New York on Tuesday charged Turkey's Halkbank (IS:HALKB) with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.
The charges against the majority state-owned bank mirror those against one of its former executives, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was found guilty and sentenced to prison after a trial in Manhattan federal court last year.
A U.S. lawyer for Halkbank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors said that between 2012 and 2016, Halkbank helped run a scheme that allowed Iran to spend proceeds from sales of its oil and gas on international markets, in violation of U.S. sanctions, using a complex web of front companies.
The scheme ran with the protection of high-ranking officials in Iran and Turkey, some of whom received tens of millions of dollars in bribes, the prosecutors said."
115,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 04:52PM ET</span>",Private market gives WeWork shares the cold shoulder,"By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trading in shares of WeWork in the private over-the-counter (OTC) market has almost ground to a halt, underscoring a loss of investor confidence in the office-sharing company and providing further evidence of its recent huge loss in value.
New York-based WeWork two weeks ago abandoned plans for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2019, after potential investors raised concerns about its ballooning losses, whether its business model was sustainable, and the way the company has been managed.
Without an IPO, investors and employees looking to cash out would need to turn to the private market, which is less liquid and more opaque than public markets. Outside of company sanctioned share sales, WeWork shares are not directly tradable because of the terms under which they were issued. However, that has not stopped synthetic versions from being created for the OTC market where they would be expected to trade at a modest discount to the estimated price of the actual stock.
That synthetic WeWork stock would currently fetch $20 or less per share, according to one investor who is active in the private market.
That would value the company at around $7 billion based on the 338.4 million shares on issue, an extraordinary decline from the $47 billion valuation it had in January when SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) last invested through its Vision Fund and from the private market value of $30 billion that one source said was prevailing in June.
But deals even at the much lower price are far from assured.
""We've seen zero interest in trading on the secondary market for WeWork. Our understanding is that there has been little, if any, trading in the name more broadly,"" said Jane Leung, chief investment officer at Scenic Advisement, a boutique investment bank specializing in private share sales.
Leung said WeWork share trading slowed after the company's IPO announcement in August and more so after it became clear the IPO was in trouble.
""Where there is interest, it is mostly institutional investors looking to reduce their positions,"" she said.
As well as its major shareholder, Japan's SoftBank, owners of WeWork stock include many leaders from the venture capital and investment worlds, such as Benchmark Capital, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), Harvard Management Co and Fidelity Management & Research, according to the Pitchbook database.
WeWork declined to comment on the trading activity of its shares in the private market.
STRUGGLING TO SELL
Estimates of WeWork's value had fallen to as low as $10 billion to $12 billion around the time that it decided to abandon the IPO, Reuters reported last month.
Now, though, a number of current investors in the office-sharing startup are struggling to sell shares, according to two investors who are active in private markets.
One investor was looking to sell shares in the company at a valuation of $8.5 billion but last week lowered it to $7.5 billion, according to one of the private market sources.
The lack of interest in WeWork stock is a further indication of how confidence in WeWork has cratered in the space of a few weeks, the private market sources said.
WeWork could itself acknowledge that its valuation has fallen below $10 billion based on any agreement it makes for a new financing lifeline, according to two people familiar with the matter. SoftBank is in talks for a multi-billion dollar rescue deal that could lead to it taking control of WeWork, while JPMorgan has been in negotiations over a competing debt package, these people said.
WeWork's IPO failure, as well as the sinking stock prices post-IPO of some major companies, such as  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), have had a chilling impact on the private over-the-counter market in shares. Investors are particularly wary of any companies that have high valuations and no immediate route to profitability.
""There's just a greater level of scrutiny overall in terms of transactions in the private market,"" Leung said."

(NYSE:BRKa) is seeking permission from the Federal Reserve to potentially increase its stake in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). to more than 10%, a level that often triggers a regulatory review.
Berkshire, which disclosed in July that it had hit that threshold, filed an application with the Fed in recent weeks making a variety of assurances to show that it will passively invest in the bank, according to a copy of the application provided by the regulator.
Berkshire “may decide to purchase additional shares of common stock of Bank of America based on its evaluation of the investment opportunity presented by such purchases,” the conglomerate wrote in the filing signed by Buffett, without specifying how many shares it might look to purchase."
121,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 04:02PM ET</span>",Michael Hasenstab Fund Loses $3 Billion in a Miserable Quarter,"(Bloomberg) -- Franklin Templeton’s flagship Global Bond Fund lost $3 billion in the third quarter as two of its biggest investments soured.
Total net assets in the fund managed by star investor Michael Hasenstab dropped from $33 billion to $30 billion in the three months through September, according to public filings.
The fund was heavily invested in Argentinian local-currency bonds which defaulted in August. It was also holding a huge short position on U.S. Treasuries as yields dropped to a three-year low.
It’s not the first time Hasenstab, who oversees more than $100 billion and made his name staking large sums on contrarian trades, has been wrong-footed. But he’s rarely been caught in two poorly-performing bets at the same time. Morningstar Inc. said in August it would stick to its top analyst rating for his fund despite the barrage of bad news because of its track record of picking winners in the long term.
The fund has returned 2.4% in the past three years, Bloomberg data show.
Hasenstab has consistently argued that economic strength in the U.S. will make today’s low-yielding bonds less attractive, especially if consumer prices start to rise. He also predicted -- like many other investors -- that former Argentinian President Mauricio Macri would win re-election this year and continue to pursue policies aimed at curbing the budget deficit and stabilizing the currency.
Templeton’s Global Bond Fund has underperformed more than 80% of peers this year, losing 1% compared with a return of about 7% from Treasuries.
Average duration in the fund, a measure of sensitivity to shifts in rates, increased to minus 1.39 years as of the end of September, the filings show. At the end of June it was a record low of minus 2.82 years.
A spokesman for Franklin Templeton didn’t immediately comment when contacted by Bloomberg."
122,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 04:01PM ET</span>",JPMorgan Felt Barred From Calming Repo Market by Regulations,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. had the cash and willingness to calm short-term funding markets when they went haywire in mid-September, but the banking giant said regulations held it back.
The firm has what Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon on Tuesday called a checking account at the Federal Reserve. When rates on repurchase agreements spiked to around 10% a month ago -- roughly four times more than what JPMorgan earns at the Fed -- the bank could’ve profited by shifting the money into repo.
It didn’t. The bank, Dimon told analysts following JPMorgan’s third-quarter earnings release, needed to keep that money put so it could fulfill its liquidity requirements mandated by regulators.
“We could not redeploy it into the repo market. We’d have been happy to do it,” Dimon said Tuesday. “It’s up to the regulators to decide if they want to recalibrate the kind of liquidity they expect us to keep in that account.”
This couldn’t be more different than year-end 2018. Back then, JPMorgan deployed excess cash to the repo market when rates surged above 6% as other lenders retreated as a way of tidying up their balance sheets for regulatory purposes. JPMorgan drew down its deposits with the Fed and increased its allocations to the repo market by more than $100 billion, according to its fourth-quarter earnings statement.
“Last year, we had more cash than needed for regulatory requirements,” Dimon said. So shifting into repo “obviously made sense, you make more money,” the CEO added.
To get the market back under control, a month ago the Fed began daily liquidity injections into repo as market forces alone weren’t able to right the ship. Repo rates have since returned to more normal levels, though many experts fear volatility will return by the end of the year. Last week, the Fed announced it will buy $60 billion of Treasury bills a month, another move intended to give the central bank greater control over benchmark rates.
“We have to get used to the Fed’s presence in the repo market for a while,” said Priya Misra, head of rates strategy at TD Securities. “I don’t think we’ll be at adequate reserves at least until the second quarter of next year.”"
123,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 04:01PM ET</span>",JPMorgan Wields Edge on Rivals in Months Jarred by Market Tumult,"(Bloomberg) -- Months of market turmoil are pushing JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. even further ahead of the Wall Street pack.
The firm led by Jamie Dimon, which has built up its dominance in recent years, widened its edge on a variety of fronts in the third quarter, sending its shares to an all-time high Tuesday. The bank posted its biggest increase in revenue from fixed-income trading in almost three years, maintaining a more-than $1 billion lead on competitors across markets. It also announced a surprise jump in fees from investment banking, scoring its biggest advantage over  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). in more than a year in the high-stakes business.
“JPMorgan stacks up very well relative to its competitors in the U.S, particularly in the capital-markets area,” Fred Cannon, an analyst at KBW, said on Bloomberg Television.
Analysts had predicted industry results that would match a particularly tough quarter for Wall Street’s main businesses -- wracked by volatility in fixed-income markets, global trade tensions that weighed on cross-border deals and investor jitters that tripped up some of the year’s most highly anticipated public stock offerings. But JPMorgan and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). leaned on debt underwriting units for fees. And Goldman Sachs found relief in stock trading, where it surpassed expectations.
Two more giant firms -- Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) -- report their results on Wednesday and Thursday.
Powerhouse Status
In the meantime, JPMorgan’s shares are climbing, up 3.5% at 2:42 p.m. in New York, the biggest jump since April.
The New York-based bank has long been known as a fixed-income powerhouse on both the trading and underwriting fronts, which helped establish it as the top Wall Street company by revenue after the financial crisis. Its strength in fixed-income in the quarter was offset by a surprise 5% decline in equity-trading revenue, which the bank blamed on derivatives. Analysts had been expecting a 5% increase.
In recent years, JPMorgan has been investing in technology and sharpening its focus on trade execution, trying to unseat Morgan Stanley as Wall Street’s top stock-trading shop. And as the pool of trading revenue has shrunk across the industry, Dimon has poured his attention into investment banking. His bank has hired dealmakers in key geographic regions and industries. The goal is to rank No. 1 anywhere the bank doesn’t already claim the top spot while defending its position in debt capital markets.
In the third quarter, JPMorgan also generated the highest profit from its consumer unit in more than five years as mortgage fees climbed and loan charge-offs fell from the second quarter.
Here are the main takeaways as four of the six biggest U.S. banks reported results:
Goldman Sachs
The firm’s trading rebound was overshadowed by a bigger slide in banking fees than analysts had projected and a $267 million hit on public equity investments such as ride-hailing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., Avantor Inc. and Tradeweb Markets Inc. The firm’s shares rose 0.7%.
Citigroup
Citi’s efforts to rein in costs -- including cutting almost 400 trading jobs -- haven’t borne fruit yet, as expenses ticked up 1.5% to exceed analysts’ estimates. Still, Citigroup’s shares climbed 2.2% as its investment bankers posted a surprise increase in revenue, led by a 7% jump in debt underwriting.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)
Wells Fargo & Co. took another chunky legal charge as it addresses recent scandals before the arrival of new Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf next week. The $1.6 billion litigation expense dragged down earnings, along with a bigger-than-expected drop in net interest income as the lender felt the sting of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Revenue, at least, surpassed analysts’ estimates, and the lender attracted more deposits. Shares climbed 2.5%."
124,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 03:57PM ET</span>",Big banks say U.S. consumers sturdy as businesses quiver with growth fears,"By Imani Moise and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Quarterly results from four of the largest U.S. banks on Tuesday showed that American consumers are helping to prop up the economy, even as recession fears have led businesses to pull back on spending and borrowing.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) posted strength across all but one of its segments, and executives offered optimistic comments about the financial health of individuals.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) beat estimates thanks to its global consumer business.
And while profits at  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) were hurt by costs related to its long-running sales scandal, the bank reported positive results in community banking, with growth in home, auto and card lending.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc's (N:GS) fledgling consumer bank also saw strength in loans and deposits.
""The consumer is not under strain. The consumer is doing fine,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on a call with journalists.
He noted that geopolitical tensions - especially the U.S.-China trade dispute - have dissuaded businesses from investing in their operations, therefore pressuring job growth. However, he was not convinced that the decline in business confidence would lead to higher unemployment.
Job growth ""is still positive and it may very well not go negative at this point,"" Dimon said. ""We'll just have to wait and see.""
Comments from Dimon and other bank executives come after a quarter in which recession fears sent markets careening, causing the U.S. Federal Reserve to slash its key rate target twice. A key manufacturing index recently showed activity falling dramatically, hurting U.S. job growth and wages, even though the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low.
As the largest U.S. bank by assets with significant operations in Europe and Asia, JPMorgan is viewed by many investors as a benchmark for how the global economy is doing.
Its consumer division reported a 7% rise in net revenue and a 5% gain in profit in the third quarter, compared with the same period in 2018. Its margins also expanded, showing the bank was able to widen the gap between what it pays for deposits and what it charges for loans as interest rates fell during the period.
CONSUMER BANKING POWERS CITIGROUP
At Citigroup, global consumer banking was the main driver of profit growth.
Citi operates one of the largest global credit-card businesses and one of the top retail banks in Mexico. The bank posted a 4% rise in revenue from consumer banking in North America and internationally, when adjusting for currency fluctuations and one-time gains, and a 17% increase in profit before taxes.
Chief Executive Michael Corbat characterized the economy as in good shape, and said his bank's plans to grow deposits and boost card lending remain on track.
Wells Fargo's results were clouded by a $1.6 billion litigation accrual, a $1.1 billion one-time gain and a CEO transition scheduled to happen next week.
The bank missed Wall Street's profit expectations, but behind the headline numbers its consumer business remained relatively robust, with growth in loans and deposits.
Goldman's consumer business, called Marcus, is just a few years old and is tiny relative to banking rivals and its other major income streams. Of the $100 billion worth of loans on its balance sheet, just $6 billion are owed by individuals.
But the bank's new CEO, David Solomon, has staked a lot on retail banking. He has promised investors that the business will help transform Goldman Sachs from a trading and investment banking operation into a full-service lender.
Goldman has been investing heavily in the business by hiring staff, advertising its savings accounts and launching a new credit card with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) during the quarter. The $55 billion worth of consumer deposits Marcus has gathered now represents the largest source of deposit funding for Goldman Sachs.
The main specter hovering over big banks' quarterly results was the outcome of global trade tensions and cross-border political issues that have made business leaders wary.
JPMorgan reported declines of 3% and 14%, respectively, in revenue and profit for commercial banking, while Citigroup experienced a 6% drop in adjusted revenue from corporate lending. Wells Fargo's revenue from wholesale banking fell 5%.
In addition to uncertainty around U.S.-China trade talks, big companies are worried about the lack of certainty about how Brexit will affect Britain's standing with the rest of Europe, plus violent protests in Hong Kong and more recent threats from the White House about sanctions against Turkey for its invasion of Syria.
Goldman Sachs also listed Argentina, which is facing a fiscal crisis and political upheaval, oil price volatility, and changes to central bank policies as ""macro"" factors affecting global markets.
""The environment is highly unpredictable given how much of it is at the mercy of political machinations,"" Citigroup's Corbat said on a conference call.
Investors were impressed by most of the big bank results. Shares of JPMorgan were up 3.9% at $121 in late-morning trading, while Citigroup rose 1.9% to $71.59 and Wells Fargo gained 1.2% at $49.86. Goldman Sachs shares fell 1% at $203.96."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street jumped on Tuesday as third-quarter reporting season kicked into high gear with a spate of upbeat earnings reports that brought buyers back to the equities market.
All three major U.S. stock indexes touched three-week highs, gaining more than 1% in a broad-based rally.
""It's all going to be about earnings for the next couple of weeks and that's a good thing,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. ""These early beats are a very positive sign.""
Even so, Pursche warned that global headwinds persist.
""We're likely to see corporate earnings and monetary policy helping to lift stocks, while geopolitical events will put pressure on stocks,"" Pursche said. ""As such, we'll probably be in this trading range for some time.""
On the geopolitical front, investors welcomed news that Britain and the European Union could reach a deal in time for a leaders' summit this week.
Major financial firms JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) all posted results, as did healthcare giants Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH).
Among the big banks, JPMorgan Chase stock hit a record high after it handily beat estimates on bond trading and underwriting strength. Its shares were last up 3.6%.
Citigroup rose 2.0% following its profit beat.
Wells Fargo results were less upbeat, as its profit slid 26% due to sinking mortgage income and legal costs. Goldman Sachs' profit miss was attributed to weak underwriting. Wells Fargo rose 2.8%, while Goldman gained 1.0%.
Prescription drug sales helped drive Johnson & Johnson's upside surprise, while UnitedHealth raised its 2019 guidance on pharmacy benefit growth. Their shares were up 1.9% and 8.2%, respectively.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 292.98 points, or 1.09%, to 27,080.34, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 35.49 points, or 1.20%, to 3,001.64 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 114.98 points, or 1.43%, to 8,163.63.
Among the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, eight were in the black, with healthcare (SPXHC), communications services (SPLRCL) and financials (SPSY) enjoying the largest percentage gains.
Blackrock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, beat analyst estimates on strong inflows into its fixed income and cash management business, sending its stock up 2.7%.
In other news, shares of  Roku  Inc (O:ROKU) surged 10.8% after the announcing Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) TV app was available on its platform and Apple TV+ would be available after it was launched.
Bank of America (N:BAC), expected to post results on Wednesday, rose 2.8% after a Bloomberg report that Warren Buffett' Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) was seeking permission from the Federal Reserve to boost his stake in the bank above 10%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.92-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

In its post-earnings call,  Wells Fargo  guided net interest income growth to mid-to-single digits in 2020, compared with a 6% drop this year. That offset some of the gloom that had followed the bank’s mixed results. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) rose nearly 4% early in the day and was up 2.8% at 2:08 p.m. ET (18:08 GMT).
The bank reported earnings of 92 cents a share on revenue of $22.01 billion, with lower-than-expected net interest income, a key driver of the bank’s profits, coming under pressure as the banking company's net interest margin dropped to 2.66% from 2.94% in the quarter from a year earlier. In the 2018 third quarter,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) earned $1.13 a share on revenue of $21.84 billion.
The mixed earnings comes as the bank continued to fork out legal payments after it let employees create millions of fake bank accounts to meet sales quotas. 
The company booked a $1.6 billion charge for legal costs related to its long-running sales-practices problems. It also had a $1.1 billion gain related to the sale of a business.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) and the United Auto Workers union were near a deal on Tuesday to end a 30-day strike that has cost the automaker about $2 billion after Chief Executive Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss took part in contract talks, according to two people briefed on the matter.
While a final agreement has not been announced, the No. 1 U.S. automaker and the union have agreed to terms on most issues but were finalizing the wording on some matters, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks were ongoing. A deal will likely be announced on Wednesday.
GM declined to comment on the involvement of its top two executives in the negotiations. A UAW spokesman declined to comment.
Shares were up about 2.4% in afternoon trading.
On Monday, the UAW scheduled a meeting for Thursday morning to update local union representatives on the status of the talks, sources previously said.
Barra had met with UAW President Gary Jones and the union's lead GM negotiator, Terry Dittes, on Oct. 9 to push for a swift resolution to the strike. Prior to that, UAW officials had been urging Barra to get involved in the negotiations.
The strike began on Sept. 16, with about 48,000 hourly workers of the UAW union at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues on the table included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close, and the use of temporary workers.
After GM angered UAW negotiators last week by appealing directly to workers and revealing details of the Detroit automaker's latest offer, the sides have continued talking. The UAW made a counter offer to GM on Friday.
Details of GM's revised offer emerged over the weekend and included an increase of its proposed ratification bonus by $1,000 to $9,000. GM also proposed 3% pay raises in the second and fourth year of the four-year-contract and 3% and 4% lump sum payments in the first and fourth year respectively. It agreed to make temporary workers with three years of service permanent and give those workers a $3,000 ratification bonus.
The Center for Automotive Research in Michigan has estimated the strike's weekly costs to GM and the UAW strike fund at $450 million and $12 million, respectively.
President Donald Trump and many lawmakers have weighed in on the talks between the UAW and GM, urging the automaker to build more vehicles in the United States and shift work from Mexico.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Senate aims to pass a first raft of bills to regulate fees for financial services by the end of October, said Ricardo Monreal, Senate leader of the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party.
Last November, shortly before President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office, MORENA lawmakers presented a bill to limit bank fees, sparking an investor backlash that pummeled the peso , Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC stock index and banking shares.
The bill, which is sponsored by Monreal, has since then been wrapped up in negotiations with Mexico's central bank, the finance ministry and Mexico's banking association (ABM).
In ""two weeks (we'll) pass an initial package of initiatives,"" Monreal said in an interview with Reuters on Monday. ""We're going step by step,"" he added, saying the first group of bills would change 32 articles and three laws.
If approved by the Senate, the package would pass to the lower house. MORENA and its allies hold big majorities in both.
The planned changes mostly relate to transparency and including more Mexicans in the banking system, which is in banks' interest, Monreal said.
""There is resistance,"" he added. ""But I think (banks) have understood ... they must reduce these sorts of charges,"" a reference to fees in general.
His plan includes a proposal that banks exempt accounts smaller than 18,700 pesos ($970) from certain fees, as well as free up such accounts from other charges.
A study by financial products watchdog Condusef said 30% of Mexican banks' revenue on average comes from their fees, which Monreal called ""among the highest in the world.""
The ABM represents banks such as BBVA (MC:BBVA), Santander (MC:SAN), the Mexican unit of  Citigroup  (N:C), Grupo  Financiero Banorte  (MX:GFNORTEO), and billionaire Carlos Slim's  Grupo Financiero Inbursa  (MX:GFINBURO).
Separately, Monreal, a 59-year-old veteran of Mexican politics, said Congress will by Oct. 20 approve a proposal to apply a value-added tax on digital businesses. The VAT rate at Mexico currently stands at 16%.    Under the initiative, companies such as Amazon (O:AMZN), Uber (N:UBER) or Google (O:GOOGL), will be responsible for paying the tax, the senator said.
""They have to pay without hitting the consumer. From what they make now,"" he said. ""It would be very easy to charge the consumer for it. They have to absorb it as part of their costs.""
The initiative also obliges platforms such as Netflix (O:NFLX) to produce at least 30% worth of their Mexico programing within the country, said Monreal."

(Reuters) - Hedge fund D.E. Shaw on Tuesday increased the pressure on Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Electric Co by publicly urging a breakup of the U.S. industrial conglomerate, a move it says could unlock more than $20 billion worth of shareholder value.
The New York-based hedge fund, which owns a more than 1% stake in the Ferguson, Missouri-based company, wants it to split into a pure play industrial automation business and a climate technology-focused firm, D.E. Shaw wrote to the board.
It also wants the company, which keeps a fleet of eight corporate jets and a helicopter, to cut costs and update its governance structure under which its directors are elected to three-year terms while the industry standard is for one-year terms.
The hedge fund expressed concern that only one Emerson director out of 10 has bought stock with his own money in the last years, which could suggest that board members are not appropriately invested in the company's performance, a person familiar with D.E. Shaw's thinking said.
The hedge fund also wants Emerson to change how it pays management. 
""To create maximum and enduring value for its shareholders, Emerson needs to change,"" the letter said.
""We believe the right set of actions could result in over 50% upside to Emerson’s share price,"" it added.
The company in a statement on Tuesday said it would look at what D.E. Shaw is suggesting. ""We will carefully evaluate D.E. Shaw’s proposals as we continue to assess value-creation opportunities,"" Emerson said.
Emerson's stock price climbed 1.5% on Tuesday, but it has lost 12.6% in the last year and has underperformed its peers by 45% over the past five years.
D.E. Shaw has owned Emerson stock for years and has quietly spoken with management about ways to improve efficiencies.
Emerson previously pledged to review its ""operational, capital allocation and portfolio issues,"" but the hedge fund wants to see more accountability and a quicker pace of change.
""Put simply, creating two separate, leaner, more focused organizations would ensure that Emerson’s businesses remain forces to be reckoned with, far into the future,"" the letter said. 
A spokesman for the hedge fund on Tuesday declined to comment beyond the letter. 
D.E. Shaw stopped short of calling for long-term Emerson Chief Executive David Farr to step down, something a number of activist hedge funds have requested in previous campaigns. Farr has suggested that he will likely retire in the next 18 months.
The hedge fund wants fresh blood in the boardroom and could nominate its own director candidates before the Nov. 6 deadline, potentially adding to the pressure on the company to take action by giving other shareholders a way to express concerns.

The letter comes more than two weeks after Reuters reported that D.E. Shaw was building a stake in the company and was planning to push for changes.

French air accident investigators classified the problem that disrupted the Swiss flight shortly after departure from London Heathrow as a ""serious incident"" and said it would be investigated by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.
Swiss, owned by Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), said it had grounded its fleet of 29 Airbus A220 jets for a review of their engines.
""Only after a comprehensive inspection will the aircraft return to regular flight operations,"" it said in a statement, adding ""numerous flights"" would have to be canceled.
The diversion was the latest in a series of technical glitches involving new-generation Geared Turbofan engines from Pratt & Whitney, part of United Technologies (N:UTX).
A spokesman for the engine maker said it was recommending additional fleet-wide checks for versions of the engine that power the Airbus A220 - an engine known as the PW1500G - and the upgraded Embraer 190/195-E2.
A similar engine for the larger A320neo family, Airbus's most-sold aircraft, was not affected.
""Pratt & Whitney and our airframe OEMs (manufacturers), working in coordination with the regulatory authorities, have recommended additional inspections of the low-pressure compressor for PW1500G and PW1900G engines to keep the fleet operational,"" a spokesman said.
""The engines continue to meet all criteria for continued airworthiness. We are working closely with our customers to minimize disruption to their operations.""
The spokesman did not say when the recommendation had been made or what deadline existed for the checks.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said its A220 jets were flying as normal.
Airbus said it was aware of Tuesday's incident involving the aircraft operated by Swiss and that it was working with Pratt & Whitney.
Airbus has delivered a total of 90 of the 110-130-seat A220 in operation, having bought the program from Canada's Bombardier last year.
Embraer did not respond to a request for comment.
The Brazilian company uses Pratt's PW1900G engine in larger versions of its upgraded 80-120-seat E2 jets.
It has delivered six E190-E2 planes split between Norwegian carrier Wideroe and lessor Aercap (N:AER), and one E195-E2, which is not yet in commercial service but has been delivered to Brazilian airline Azul SA."
138,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 01:02PM ET</span>","Goldman profit slammed by souring WeWork, Uber bets","By Anirban Sen and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday as it took heavy losses from high-profile investments in WeWork and Uber Technologies and faced up to a weakening global economy.
The bank's shares slipped nearly 3% as revenue at three of its four major businesses fell, including a 15% drop in investment banking revenue because of lower advisory and underwriting fees.
Net revenue at Goldman's investing and lending division slumped 40% as it swallowed a loss of about $80 million on its stake in WeWork owner The We Company and took hits from other investments.
Chief Operating Officer Stephen Scherr blamed the bank's investments in ride-hailing company Uber (N:UBER), medical device maker  Avantor Inc  (N:AVTR) and trading platform Tradeweb (O:TW) for the $267 million markdown in the quarter.
Scherr said those investments comprise 40% of the bank's $2.3 billion invested in public companies, and they ""were the largest contributors to the downdraft.""
Office-sharing startup WeWork's valuation plummeted from a peak of $47 billion in January to as low as $10-12 billion, Reuters reported last month, forcing it to pull its IPO. Uber's shares are down 24% since the company debuted earlier this year.
MIXED RESULTS
The only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for more than a third of its overall revenue, but a 6% growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in its other major businesses.
""Overall, GS posted mixed results this quarter. While the top line beat to us was a positive, it was driven by more trading which tends to be less persistent and investment banking results were weak,"" analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note to clients on Tuesday.
Bond trading revenue was up 8%, while equities rose 5%. JPMorgan (N:JPM) also reported a surge in bond trading.
Wall Street's biggest banks are facing several challenges in growing their revenue, largely as concerns of slowing growth have deterred companies from tapping public markets for funds, but Chief Executive David Solomon sounded optimistic on a call with analysts.
""The IPO process is alive and well in the United States,"" he said.
Under Solomon, Goldman has undertaken a major shift in strategy from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets.
Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.
Solomon has pushed his top lieutenants to bring in at least $5 billion of new revenue from those businesses by 2020, while simultaneously conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a number of new efficiency initiatives and a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.
The bank's net earnings applicable to common shareholders fell 27% to $1.79 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.45 billion a year ago. Earnings per share fell to $4.79 from $6.28 a year earlier.
Total net revenue fell 6% to $8.32 billion.
Analysts on average had expected earnings of $4.81 per share and revenue of $8.31 billion, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.
Expectations from most brokerages tracking the investment bank were generally muted as macroeconomic conditions have been weighing on investor sentiment.
Goldman's main rival  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) is expected to report quarterly results on Thursday."

CWU said more than 97% of a ballot of roughly 110,000 British postal workers were in favor of going on strike. Some 76% of its members working in Royal Mail voted in the ballot, the union said.
""The prospect of the first national postal strike in a decade now looms large,"" CWU said in a statement.
Royal Mail, which has 142,000 employees in Britain, said it was disappointed that union chose to ballot for industrial action and that it was still in mediation with the union.
Royal Mail last year reached a deal with the union over pensions, pay, a shorter working week, culture and operational changes, after nearly 10 months of negotiations. (https://reut.rs/35DHVio)
""Today the new RMG leadership are breaking that agreement,"" said Terry Pullinger, Deputy General Secretary (Postal) at CWU.
""We would urge Royal Mail Group to now enter serious negotiations with this union,"" said Dave Ward, General Secretary at CWU.
The company was not immediately available to comment on Pullinger's comments. The run-up to Christmas is its busiest time of the year.
Royal Mail, privatized four years ago, is one of the few big British firms still to have a defined-benefit pension scheme, which pays out a proportion of a member's final salary depending on how long employees have paid in to the scheme.
By contrast, a defined contribution scheme is a retirement plan in which the employer and employee contribute to an investment fund that is used to buy a pension on retirement.
Under a collective scheme, contributions are pooled, instead of being held in an individual account, helping to share risk."

143,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 12:46PM ET</span>",Britain delays reform of company audits until early 2020,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will wait until early next year before implementing root-and-branch reform of auditing, a government minister said on Tuesday, dismissing claims of ""drift"".
The collapse of retailer BHS and construction company Carillion prompted two reviews into the quality of audits in Britain.
The first from John Kingman proposed a new accounting regulator to replace the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) that currently oversees the industry.
A second from the Competition and Markets Authority proposed that big companies hire two auditors instead of one.
Since then the collapse of travel company Thomas Cook has highlighted that no change has taken place since the two reviews were published in December 2018, lawmakers said on Tuesday.
A third review, chaired by British businessman Donald Brydon into the purpose of audit, will report back later this year.
""It's certainly my intention that we take forward this work in the first quarter of next year to ensure we maximize all the learning points,"" business minister Andrea Leadsom told parliament's business committee on Tuesday.
By that time, the government would have the benefit of the ""full suite"" of advice from all three reviews, Leadsom said. It is the first indication that the government is looking at a package, rather than piecemeal changes.
Legislation is needed to implement core reforms proposed by Kingman and the CMA, but this was absent from the government's list of upcoming bills announced on Monday.
In a letter to parliament's business committee on Tuesday, Kingman said the government clearly had many competing priorities, a reference to parliament's overwhelming focus on Britain's departure from the European Union.
""But given the unequivocal consensus around the need for change, I am concerned about the risks of letting the FRC drift on, half-reformed and lacking the teeth that only legislation can give it,"" Kingman said.
Leadsom said that many of the Kingman reforms could and were being implemented without legislation. A new FRC chair and chief executive took up the reins this month and launched a drive to recruit 80 more staff to beef up enforcement.
The CMA proposed joint audits for most big listed companies, meaning two auditors must be hired, with one not from the ranks of EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC, the ""Big Four"" that dominate the sector.
The government has yet to say whether it wants to implement joint audits, a reform that been met with scepticism even from the FRC's new chair Simon Dingemans.
Industry officials believe the government may opt for less radical shared audits, whereby a non Big Four auditor only takes on a portion of a company audit."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss took part in contract talks with the United Auto Workers union on Tuesday, in a sign that a 30-day strike of 48,000 U.S. hourly workers could be nearing an end, two people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.
On Monday, the UAW scheduled a meeting for Thursday morning to update local union representatives on the status of the talks, sources have previously said. The sides have not reached a tentative agreement that would end the strike, but progress has been made.
GM declined to comment on the involvement of the No. 1 U.S. automaker's top two executives in the negotiations. A UAW spokesman declined to comment.
Shares were up 2% in midday trading.
Barra met with UAW President Gary Jones and the union's lead GM negotiator, Terry Dittes, on Oct. 9 to push for a swift resolution to the strike. Prior to that, UAW officials had been urging Barra to get involved in the negotiations.
The UAW strike began on Sept. 16, with the union's members at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM has indicated could close, and the use of temporary workers.
After GM angered UAW negotiators last week by appealing directly to workers and revealing details of the Detroit automaker's latest offer, the sides have continued talking. The UAW made a counter offer to GM on Friday.
The Center for Automotive Research in Michigan has estimated the strike's weekly costs to GM and the UAW strike fund at $450 million and $12 million, respectively.
President Donald Trump and many lawmakers have weighed in on the talks between the UAW and GM, urging the automaker to build more vehicles in the United States and shift work from Mexico.
The UAW's membership is largely in the Midwest, in states that could be critical to both sides in the 2020 presidential election.
Twelve candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination are scheduled to meet for a debate on Tuesday night in Ohio."

LONDON (Reuters) - A former senior  Barclays  (L:BARC) executive was ""panicking"" about the risk of a state bailout during the credit crisis in 2008 because he feared government scrutiny of his multi-million pound remuneration, a London criminal trial heard on Tuesday.
Roger Jenkins, the bank's former rainmaker in the Middle East who negotiated two emergency capital calls over a decade ago, told colleagues at the time that the government ""wouldn't look kindly on compensation over a million dollars"".
Prosecutors in the high-profile Serious Fraud Office (SFO) trial, which turns on undisclosed fees paid to Qatar as Barclays struggled to raise around 11 billion pounds in emergency capital calls in 2008, painted a picture of stricken lenders and jittery markets as the financial crisis deepened that October.
Jenkins and two former senior colleagues, Richard Boath and Tom Kalaris, are charged with fraud by false representation and conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.
They deny the charges.
Reading out extracts of a telephone call between Jenkins, Boath and a third colleague that Oct. 8, prosecutor Edward Brown quoted Jenkins as telling his colleagues he had been up at 2am fretting about nationalization.
""...the way the UK works, they're going to say we want the top ten or twenty earners and we want to review them...,"" Jenkins was quoted as telling his colleagues in a conversation in which he also joked that his own remuneration ""was nothing"".
Jenkins was paid 39.5 million pounds ($50 million) in salary and incentive plans in 2007. He was also recommended a payment of 25 million pounds for his role in two capital raisings, the jury at London's Old Bailey criminal court was told.
Kalaris, the former CEO of the bank's wealth management business, received 13 million in 2007 and 7.7 million in 2008. Boath, the investment bank division's head of corporate finance for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was paid 2.87 million in 2007 and 1.87 million in 2008, the prosecutor said.
Prosecutors allege that Barclays paid Qatar 322 million pounds in extra, secret fees for participating in two fundraisings in June and October 2008, which were disguised as ""bogus"" advisory service agreements (ASA).
Jenkins told colleagues in the same recorded telephone conversation that Qatar would be paid a fee for investing in the bank in comments that looked like a ""complete acceptance"" of core allegations against him, Brown alleged.
""Here was Roger Jenkins, at the time, not suggesting that the ASA was anything about genuine advisory services of value at all. It was nothing more than a fee for investing and Mr Jenkins said so,"" Brown said.
Jenkins is the only defendant charged over the October 2008 fundraising as well as the June 2008 capital call.
Qatar, which invested around 4.0 billion pounds in Barclays over 2008, has not been accused of wrongdoing.
The trial, expected to last around five months, continues."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Freedom Holding Corp (O:FRHC), a financial services firm focussed on East Europe and Central Asia, is considering a Moscow listing, after its shares began trading on New York's Nasdaq.
Shares in Freedom Holding Corp initially climbed more than 2% before easing back to trade flat on its Nasdaq debut on Tuesday at $14.15, its closing price on the OTCQX exchange where it was listed since July 2018.
Timur Turlov, Freedom Holding Corp's 31-year-old founder and chief executive, told Reuters his company was considering a rouble-denominated listing on the Moscow Exchange. ""I hope it will happen this year,"" he said in his Moscow office.
Turlov said the company had taken five years to prepare for the Nasdaq listing to broaden its investor base.
""We are getting on the radar of a large group of investors who do not work with a company that is not listed,"" he said.
A Moscow listing would put the firm's shares in Russia's small-cap indexes Russel 2000 or 3000, putting the company ""into the sight of investors who are looking at our region,"" he said.
The firm's Kazakh unit, Freedom Finance, is one of the biggest and most active brokerages in Kazakhstan.
The company also became a major investor in Kazakh mobile operator Kcell (KZ:KCEL) last year, building up a stake of more than 10% through open market purchases.
It halved that investment to about 5% before the Nasdaq listing. Turlov said the shares were sold at a profit.

Freedom Finance is now setting up a subsidiary in Kazakhstan's Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC). It has also been active in neighboring Uzbekistan.

LONDON (Reuters) - A growing number of private equity firms are taking advantage of Europe's buoyant bond market to extract money from companies they hold by loading them with debt, prompting some investors to warn the fixed income rally is nearing its peak.
Several private equity-backed companies have issued bonds backing ""dividend recapitalizations"" in recent weeks -- a term that refers to the contentious practice of a companies issuing debt to pay dividends to the owner.
Britain's Pinewood Studios, owned by Aermont Capital, and Spanish gaming company Cirsa, owned by Blackstone (NYSE:BX), both issued debt to undertake dividend recaps in September, raising 500 million pounds ($625.4 million) and 375 million euros ($413.1 million) respectively.
Elsewhere, Switzerland's Salt and Greece's Wind Hellas issued debt which included language allowing for the proceeds to be used for dividend payments.
There has been 3.33 billion euros of dividend recap-related issuance this year so far, according to data provider 9fin, over three times the 2018 figure.
(GRAPHIC - ""Dividend recapitalisation"" issuance builds up again: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7396/7327/divi%20recaps.png)
The deal structure has courted controversy in the past, with critics accusing private equity firms of piling debt onto their subsidiaries for personal gain and making them more vulnerable in the future.
The 2014 collapse of British high street retail firm Phones4U was blamed partly on the company issuing 200 million pounds of debt to pay a dividend to owner BC Partners just a year earlier.
Private equity executives say that as a structure it is no different to any company paying a dividend rather than investing in the business.
But portfolio managers who cover this market said the return of these deals has left them uneasy, with one high-yield bond fund manager saying he has been switching out of bonds in recent weeks.
""It is a controversial structure that usually means the bond market has peaked,"" he said.
The jump in debt-funded dividend recapitalizations offer warnings that the fixed income cycle might be about to turn.
Firstly, investors are turning to such risky instruments because yield is so hard to find elsewhere. However, the fact that yields have been squeezed so much -- in some cases into negative territory -- is a sign that the next move may be downward for fixed income prices, which move inversely with yields.
Such a warning light flashed in the run-up to the financial crisis. In 2007 dividend recaps were booming - with more than 20 billion euros worth in Europe that year, mainly issued through loans, according to S&P Global Intelligence.
A year later the crisis exploded and the structure lost traction, slowing re-emerging only in 2011.
There are also more recent examples of a rise in dividend recaps in European bond markets followed by a sell-off.
In late 2017, there was 4.69 billion euros of dividend recap issuance in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2017 alone, according to 9fin.
This proved to be the top of that particular run in European junk bonds, with the average yield on Markit's iBoxx euro-denominated high-yield bond index rising over 70 basis points in the last six weeks of 2017, and continuing to climb all the way through 2018.
(GRAPHIC - European junk bond yields: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7397/7328/dividend%20recaps.png)
Charles Diebel, head of fixed income strategy at Mediolanum Asset Management, agreed an uptick in deals such as dividend recaps is usually a sign of a bond market peak.
""Whether it's right to call a widening of spreads now, I'm not sure, but we are clearly entering a period where the risk of idiosyncratic factors triggering a negative turn in markets is high,"" he said.
HIGH PRICES, LOW SENTIMENT
The bond market has rallied across the board and yields have dropped to unprecedented levels in 2019, as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank ramp up stimulus in the face of a potential economic slowdown.
With over a third of the European corporate bond market now in negative-yielding territory, according to Tradeweb, dividend recap deals have stepped up.
However, those central bank actions to shore up the economy highlight another factor that is pushing interest in dividend recaps -- that despite soaring fixed income valuations, underlying market sentiment is still very shaky.
""There is clearly a continued major concern for stressed and distressed credits and lack of willingness (from banks) to underwrite there,"" said Fraser Lundie, head of credit at Hermes.
""In this type of environment if you're coming across a repeat issuer where you've done the work, you already know the management, the decision to invest is an easy one,"" he said.
A credit analyst who works for a firm that bought Cirsa's bond said knowledge of the company helped in their decision, but acknowledged that it didn't mean she wasn't worried about the structure in general.
""People are worried at the moment, so it's not 'oh, everything will be great', but these sillinesses happen because they can't find yield,"" she said.
A Blackstone spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Private equity firms also show interest in dividend recapitalizations in anticipation of future fundraising pitches to their own investors, says Tanneguy De Carne, head of financial sponsor coverage UK, Nordics & Benelux at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""They need to demonstrate they can monetise investments. For them a recapitalization is a demonstration that their investment thesis is correct; they can take money off the table without damaging value,"" he said."

Whirlpool said in May that production of high-end washing machines in Naples was no longer profitable and that it intended to sell the factory, which employs 450 workers in a region with some of the highest unemployment levels in Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli held a last ditch meeting with company managers on Tuesday but failed to win any concessions.
""The talks were not positive ... the company continues to offer as a single solution: a sale of the business branch,"" Patuanelli said after the meeting in Rome.
Metalworkers union FIOM-CGIL called for a two hour strike at the company's six plants in Italy and some 300 workers blocked a highway outside Naples in protest at the decision.
Whirlpool, which employs around 5,500 people in Italy, said it had failed to make any progress in months of negotiations about a reorganization of the site and confirmed the plant would be shut down at the start of next month.
In June, the Italian government threatened to scrap all incentives it had granted to the company to keep investing in Italy, estimated at some 50 million euros since 2014."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) needs to be careful when deciding whether to deepen negative rates, the head of Mizuho Bank said, adding the contentious issue of charging account maintenance fees should be seen as separate from monetary policy.
Like its rivals, the main unit of Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411), Japan's third-largest lender by assets, has struggled with years of near-zero rates, a dwindling population and a dearth of corporate fund demand.
""I want the BOJ to be wary when deciding whether it will deepen negative interest rates,"" Koji Fujiwara, Mizuho Bank's president, told Reuters in an interview last week that was embargoed for release on Wednesday.
Such a move could ultimately be damaging to Japan's ""economic lifeblood"" if it hinders financial firms, he said.
The central bank will hold next policy meeting on Oct. 30-31. On Tuesday, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank would not hesitate to take additional easing steps if risks to the economy grow and threaten momentum towards its 2% inflation target. There has been speculation that Japan's banks might start charging fees for account holders if the central bank deepens negative interest rates and puts more pressure on banks' profits. Fujiwara, however, said that the idea should not be directly linked with monetary policy.
While nothing had been decided about the fees, he said, the bank was as a stage where it should develop its pricing strategy ""as a whole"". That comes after the bank recently said it would raise transfer fees from March 2020 for customers using ATMs and telephone.
As the domestic market is expected to shrink, Mizuho's bigger competitors such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (T:8306) and  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group (T:8316) have aggressively tapped into Asia by investing in local commercial banks.
While Mizuho looks at the growing market, it will possibly consider another approach: business tie-ups with non-financial firms. Earlier this year, Mizuho agreed with Japanese messaging app operator Line Corp (T:3938) to establish a new bank, aiming to take in Line's vast platform which has more than 80 million monthly active users.
""When it comes to expanding business into Asia, it has often meant acquiring a financial firm. But in the future, a business partnership with non-financial company will be one of our options,"" said Fujiwara."

156,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 11:06AM ET</span>","Experience, not nationality, key for new CEO at France's Renault: minister","PARIS (Reuters) - Experience in overhauling a company and a track record in industry will be more important than nationality when carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) chooses a new chief executive, France's junior economy minister said on Tuesday.
Renault, in which the French government owns a 15% stake, last week kicked off the search for a new leader after ousting CEO Thierry Bollore, hoping new blood will help it repair relations and strengthen a partnership with Japan's Nissan (T:7201), which has also switched top managers.
The French state, with a boardroom vote on Bollore's successor, is open to casting the net wide, junior minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told Reuters.
""When we had to find the best profile for someone to lead Air France, we got someone who is not French - very well,"" said Pannier-Runacher, referring to ex-Air Canada boss Ben Smith's appointment last year at the airline, in which Paris also holds a stake.
""It's the best profile that counts here, someone that is able to carry Renault and to play their role in the alliance (with Nissan) at a time of major changes.""
Car companies globally are grappling with slowing auto markets and challenging European emissions regulations, and need to invest in costly new technologies.
Renault hired Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard earlier this year from tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), after former Nissan-Renault alliance supremo Carlos Ghosn's arrest in Tokyo on financial misconduct allegations, which he denies.
Senard now has a mandate to get the strained partnership back on track.
Internal Renault candidates with a real shot at the CEO job are likely to be scarce, according to a source close to the recruitment process.
""The successor will probably be an external candidate, as Ghosn did not prepare anything and left scorched earth behind,"" the source said.
Another person familiar with the process said Renault had some promising people in their 50s at management committee level, but few with enough experience in top executive circles.
ALIGNING TEAMS
Bollore, who was one of Ghosn's few protegees propelled to a senior job, hit out last week at his dismissal, calling it a ""coup de force"" in a newspaper interview.
Pannier-Runacher backed Senard's bid to renew Renault's management, however.
""You've got a new boss who comes on board, who readjusts and aligns his team, it's a very basic step and it's a good thing,"" Pannier-Runacher said. ""(Senard) is doing his job, full stop.""
The junior minister also said Paris was not against a potential revival of a failed deal to pair Renault up with  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), which withdrew a merger offer earlier this year.
""Everything is open. (But) in the order of things, we're very clear, we want an industrial project and a reinforced alliance that is serving that industrial project,"" she said.
Reducing the government's Renault stake in order to smooth things over with Nissan was not a priority, Pannier-Runacher added.
""You have to start with the industrial logic, and then you can potentially draw knock-on conclusions for stakeholders,"" she said."

The reorganization plan by Italy's top commercial broadcaster aims to create the new entity - called MediaforEurope - to pursue pan-European tie-ups to take on increasing competition in the industry and stalling growth in its domestic market.
But Vivendi, Mediaset's second largest shareholder, is challenging the plan in courts as it includes a governance structure that would help Fininvest, the holding company of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, to tighten its grip over the broadcaster.
A hearing on Vivendi's summary proceedings in Italy against Mediaset's plan is scheduled on Oct. 30 in Milan, Mediaset said in a statement.
Mediaset also confirmed on Tuesday that the French group has dropped summary proceedings filed in an Amsterdam court against the plan.
Vivendi has been a hostile Mediaset shareholder since the tycoons who control the two companies, Vincent Bollore and Berlusconi, fell out in 2016 over an aborted pay-TV deal. They have been in a legal war ever since.
In Italy, Mediaset's merger plan was approved at a shareholder meeting where Vivendi was allowed to vote only with the 9.6% Mediaset stake it owns directly.
Vivendi, which is also Telecom Italia's (MI:TLIT) top investor, was forced by the Italian communication watchdog AGCOM to transfer two-thirds of its 29% stake in Mediaset to an arms-length trust which Mediaset prevented from participating in the meeting.
Vivendi has appealed against the ruling by AGCOM and is currently awaiting a decision by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Mediaset said Vivendi had requested the Milan court to suspend Mediaset's reorganization plan pending the ECJ decision.
Last week a Spanish court granted Vivendi, which in the summer built a 1% stake in Mediaset's Spanish unit (MC:TL5), a preliminary suspension of the plan."

Shares in the payments group sank more than 20% and its euro-denominated bonds  expiring in 2024 fell 7.4 cents to 91.01 on the Financial Times report.
""Today's article by the Financial Times is a compilation of a number of false and misleading allegations... which were already fully refuted before,"" Wirecard said in a statement.
At 1349 GMT, the company's shares were down 14.1% after hitting their lowest since April 24, making them the biggest faller on Germany's DAX 30 (GDAXI) and on track for their worst day since early February.
The newspaper published documents including internal company spreadsheets and related correspondence between senior members of Wirecard's finance team, which, in an accompanying article, it said appeared to indicate an effort to inflate sales and profits at Wirecard's businesses in Dubai and Ireland, as well as to potentially mislead EY, its tier-one auditor.
Wirecard said it was regrettable that the Financial Times chose to publish ""such an irresponsible"" article. 
German markets regulator Bafin said it would include Tuesday's share price drop in a market manipulation investigation it started in April after earlier FT reports on the company sent the stock sliding.
""We are in very close coordination with Munich prosecutors,"" a Bafin spokeswoman told financial news website Boerse Online. 
Tuesday's FT report comes after the paper published a series of stories earlier this year alleging fraud and false accounting at Wirecard's Singapore office and that a key Middle East unit was not properly audited.

The company has already denied the FT's previous allegations, saying that although Dubai-based subsidiary Card Systems was not individually audited, its books had undergone higher-level ""full-scope"" scrutiny by auditor EY.

(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) has agreed to purchase a software business from Toronto-based Pivot Technology Solutions Inc (TO:PTG) for $27 million, the U.S. chipmaker said on Tuesday.
Intel said it would buy Smart Edge, a software that helps split up data and store it closer to users to make computing devices respond faster. 
The software is designed to run on Intel's chips, which are best known as the heart of most personal computers but which the company is aiming to sell into equipment for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks that is being rolled out starting this year.
According to Pivot's securities filings, Smart Edge did not generate significant revenue in the first six months of 2019, but made a loss of about $1 million before depreciation and amortization. Pivot, which has a market value of about $43 million, was issued a U.S. patent on Smart Edge's technology in July.
Intel, which expects to close the Smart Edge deal in the fourth quarter, views 5G as a chance to expand its sales beyond personal computers and data centers, its two largest business segments. 
In 5G networks, more data will be stored on computers scattered near cell towers and other network gear. Storing the data there, a practice called ""edge computing"" in the industry, is expected to help large files like videos show up more quickly on users' screens than if they were stored in centralized data centers.
""We plan to take full advantage of our combined technologies and teams to accelerate the development of the edge computing market,"" Dan Rodriguez, a general manager of the network compute division in Intel's data center group, said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global banks earned $1 billion from trading government-backed U.S. mortgage securities in the first half of 2019, data shows, a fivefold increase on last year for what industry sources say is the fastest growing revenue source in investment banking.
The shift this year to a more dovish interest rate policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve has sparked a surge in investor demand for packaged-up home loans issued by mortgage agencies Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Banks that trade these securities, known as agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), have profited both from increased commissions on trading them as well as holding them on their books as they appreciated in value.
The boom in trading comes just over a decade after the global financial crisis, caused in part by the collapse in value of much riskier bonds linked to U.S. home loans that banks packaged up and sold to unwitting investors.
Agency RMBS are considered far safer and higher quality than the subprime pools that sowed the seeds of the so-called subprime mortgage crisis in 2007.
The data from research house Coalition shows global banks made just $200 million in revenues in agency RMBS in the first half of 2018, compared with $1 billion this year.
""This is the fastest growing product across markets this year, for sure,"" one industry source told Reuters.
""This is probably the first year that the RMBS guys are looking at some big bonus figures. I think it's going to be good year,"" the source said.
WINNERS
JP Morgan (N:JPM), Citi (N:C), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) are seen among the biggest winners, with Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) also cashing in, the source added.
Average daily trading volumes in agency RMBS have risen to $251 billion in 2019 so far, data from SIFMA shows, an 11% increase on the same period a year ago.
The earnings boost for the Wall Street giants that dominate this business is likely to widen the gap with struggling European rivals, which have seen profits plunge in recent years amid constant restructuring and sluggish domestic trading markets.
JP Morgan is likely to make as much as $500 million from agency RMBS trading in 2019, after ramping up the balance sheet capacity it allocates to the market to between $20 billion and $30 billion, the source said.
JPMorgan declined to comment.
The U.S. lender saw a 31% increase in its holdings of all securities between June 2018 and June 2019, according to a Reuters calculation from regulatory filings, driven by a 37% increase in 'available for sale' products such as agency RMBS.
CHASING YIELD
Rate cuts typically drive demand in agency RMBS because they can change the time frames in which people repay or refinance the underlying mortgages.
This in turn changes the value of the securities, which yield-hungry investors seek to profit from.
The window of opportunity for banks to make money in agency RMBS trading is small and is not entirely without risk.
If the Fed suddenly changes its policy, as it did in 2013 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-2013-timeline/key-events-for-the-fed-in-2013-the-year-of-the-taper-tantrum-idUSKCN1P52A8 when a shift in its practice of buying bonds triggered a massive spike in U.S. Treasury yields, banks could be saddled with a hefty inventory of bonds which could plunge in value.
The Fed cut interest rates in July and at its subsequent September meeting to offset the impact to the U.S. economy from slowing global growth and the Trump administration's trade war with China, which has hurt U.S. manufacturing and cooled business investment.
The next meeting of the Fed's interest rate policy committee is on Oct. 29-30."

Citi, the most global of the U.S. banks, said revenue in its consumer unit rose 4% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, outpacing its institutional clients business where revenue grew 3%.
Consumer business was padded by more U.S. credit card customers beginning to pay interest as promotional periods wore off. North America branded card revenue jumped 11% in the third quarter. Expenses in the consumer business fell 2%.
Trading revenue fell 1% as a decline in equities offset stable revenue in fixed-income trading. JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) both reported a rise in revenue from bond trading.
Citi also reached a key efficiency target. The third-largest U.S. bank by assets hit a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 12.2%, above the goal of 12% it has promised investors for the year.
ROTCE is a widely watched measure of how well a bank uses shareholder money to generate profits.
Citi has been focused on building credibility with investors after missing targets in recent years. Estimates often hovered below the bank's stated goals, indicating Wall Street analysts were skeptical management could reach the targets it had set.
Net income applicable to the bank rose 6% to $4.9 billion, or $2.07 per share, in the third quarter from $4.6 billion, or $1.73 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding a tax benefit, the bank earned $1.97 per share.
Revenue was up about 1% at $18.57 billion.

Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.95 per share and revenue of $18.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The levy on domestic and intra-European flights would rise to 13.03 euros from 7.50 euros, the official said, while carbon charges on medium-haul flights could rise to 33.01 euros from 23.43 and for long-haul flights to 59.43 from 42.18 euros.
A draft law seen by Reuters showed that the government had planned smaller hikes as recently as earlier this month.
The German government, which consists of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats, agreed that short-haul flights, particularly heavy in CO2 emissions, should be taxed more heavily in proportion to underlying ticket prices than longer flights, the official said.
The finance ministry official said that Germany could expect an additional tax take of around 740 million euros once the new taxes come into force in April. The proceeds will mainly be used to finance tax relief on train tickets."

The Berlin-based company, whose customers are disproportionately women, said it was aiming for a balanced representation of women and men in its top six management levels by 2023 and was also paying attention to non-binary genders.
""During the past 11 years, we have been very focused on establishing and growing our business, and we didn’t put enough effort into countering structural imbalances that have evolved,"" co-Chief Executive Rubin Ritter said in a statement.
To help it reach the goal, Zalando said it would make changes to its decision-making bodies and committees, change hiring practices and work on succession planning.
Germany has long been a laggard in promoting women to senior positions in the business world: women account for only 9% of management board positions in the top 200 companies, according to the DIW Berlin economic institute.
Germany passed legislation in 2015 demanding that women hold 30% of the seats on supervisory boards of large companies. There is no quota for management boards, but some politicians have threatened to impose one here too if progress is not made soon.
""The fact that Zalando has recognized the importance of gender diversity in management and has set its own targets is very encouraging,"" said Katharina Wrohlich, head of the gender economics research group at DIW Berlin.
Jennifer Morgan became the first female head of a German blue-chip company last week as co-CEO of software company SAP (DE:SAPG). Ailing conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG), which has just been relegated from the benchmark DAX index, appointed Martina Merz as interim CEO last month.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Moscow Exchange (MM:MOEX) plans to channel all of its free cash flow into dividends and will also raise a dividend payout floor to 60% from 55% of net profit under a new dividend policy announced on Tuesday.
Russia's main stock exchange has also approved a new strategy for the five-years to 2024, including longer trading hours and an expanded range of products and services.   
The five-year plan, designed to ensure at least a 10% annual commission fee growth, will also improve the cyber stability of the exchange's key systems.   
""Our main goal is to maintain the reliability of our systems in line with the best industry standards and satisfy the needs of our customers,"" the head of Moscow Exchange Yury Denisov told reporters when presenting the new strategy.   
The Moscow Exchange plans to double its retail investor base from the current 3 million people in the next five years, said Denisov, who took over as CEO in May 2019.
The exchange said it would continue paying dividends on an annual basis.
This has disappointed hopes of some analysts', particularly VTB Capital, for interim dividends. BCS Brokerage also said earlier that an interim dividend payout would have a positive impact on the Moscow Exchange shares.   
""The new dividend policy has been designed to balance long-term growth and financial stability with the continued strengthening of the investment case,"" Oleg Vyugin, Chairman of Moscow Exchange's Supervisory Board said in a statement.
MOEX shares rose 1.9% on the day to 91.39 roubles each, their highest since Oct. 7, following the announcement on the new strategy.   
The bourse's free cash flow, seen as a measure of profitability in financial analysis, takes into account investments needed to maintain and expand its business, as well as regulatory requirements applicable to the Moscow Exchange and its subsidiaries.   
Retail investors have been attracted to the Moscow Exchange as its key rouble-denominated index MOEX (IMOEX) has climbed by about 15% so far this year and the average dividend yield of stocks traded on the exchange is at 7%, above an average deposit rate for banks, the Moscow Exchange said.

Shares of the company, which makes products ranging from prescription drugs to consumer goods such as Band-Aids, rose 2% to $133.48 in premarket trading. 
J&J shares have been under pressure this year, widely underperforming the S&P healthcare sector (SPXHC), as the company faces more than 13,000 lawsuits tied to antipsychotic drug Risperdal as well as a range of lawsuits involving its baby powder, opioids, medical devices and other products. 
J&J did not report litigation expenses for the third quarter and its legal costs over the nine-month period remained at $832 million, as was reported at the end of the second quarter.
JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said litigation risk remains a clear overhang on the shares, but added that the results will likely be well received and continue to believe that analysts' estimates remain too low. 
J&J's pharmaceuticals business has in recent years cushioned the impact of relatively slow growth in its other medical device and consumer units even as some of the company's older drugs face competition from cheaper versions.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 08:24AM ET</span>",How Amazon.com moved into the business of U.S. elections,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) cloud computing arm is making an aggressive push into one of the most sensitive technology sectors: U.S. elections.
The expansion by Amazon Web Services into state and local elections has quietly gathered pace since the 2016 U.S. presidential vote. More than 40 states now use one or more of Amazon's election offerings, according to a presentation given by an Amazon executive this year and seen by Reuters. 
So do America's two main political parties, the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and the U.S. federal body charged with administering and enforcing federal campaign finance laws.
While it does not handle voting on election day, AWS - along with a broad network of partners - now runs state and county election websites, stores voter registration rolls and ballot data, facilitates overseas voting by military personnel and helps provide live election-night results, according to company documents and interviews.
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/321GbNH
In the fullest public picture yet of Amazon's strategic move into U.S. election infrastructure, Reuters reviewed previously unreported company presentations and documents, and conducted more than two dozen interviews with lawmakers, election administrators, and heads of election security and technology in nearly a dozen states and counties that use Amazon's cloud.
Amazon pitches itself as a low-cost provider of secure election technology at a time when local officials and political campaigns are under intense pressure to prevent a repeat of 2016 presidential elections, which saw cyber-attacks on voting systems and election infrastructure.
""The fact that we have invested heavily in this area, it helps to attest to the fact that in over 40 states, the Amazon cloud is being trusted to power in some way, some aspect of elections,"" Michael Jackson, leader, Public Health & U.S. Elections at AWS, told prospective government clients in February via a presentation on a webinar, which was viewed by Reuters.
The company's efforts are welcomed by election administrators, who in interviews said they often struggle with keeping outdated systems up to date at the local level.
In Oregon, for example, the state's in-house servers that support election services shut down every time there is a power outage - an often occurrence as Oregon updates its electric grid, according to Peter Threlkel, chief information officer at the Oregon Secretary of State. A move to the cloud fixes that problem, and Oregon ran a pilot with AWS to move its voter registration system to the cloud, he said.
Some security experts like David O'Berry, co-founder, Precog Security, said moving to AWS is ""a good option for campaigns, who do not have the resources to protect themselves."" 
Still, Amazon's growing presence in the elections business could undermine what many officials view as a strength of the U.S. voting system: decentralization.
Most security experts Reuters spoke to said that while Amazon's cloud is likely much harder to hack than systems it is replacing, putting data from many jurisdictions on a single system raises the prospect that a single major breach could prove damaging.
""It makes Amazon a bigger target"" for hackers, ""and also increases the challenge of dealing with an insider attack,"" said Chris Vickery, director of cyber risk research at cybersecurity startup Upguard.
A recent hack into  Capital One  Financial Corp's (N:COF) data stored on Amazon's cloud service was perpetrated by a former Amazon employee. The breach affected more than 100 million customers, underscoring how rogue employees or untrained workers can create security risks even if the underlying systems are secure.
Amazon says its systems are reliable. ""Over time, states, counties, cities, and countries will leverage AWS services to ensure modernization of their elections for increased security, reliability, and analytics for an efficient and more effective use of taxpayer dollars,"" an AWS spokesperson told Reuters. 
Amazon's push into the election business comes as the company faces criticism from politicians, labor unions and privacy advocates over its business practices and growing influence. President Donald Trump has accused the company of competing unfairly and repeatedly attacked the Washington Post, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, for alleged bias, a charge Bezos and the paper deny.
Amazon is forging ahead. It now powers the websites for the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), according to a source and election security experts. 
The FEC, DNC and RNC declined comment. A person familiar with the DNC's plans said the committee has recently moved some data from AWS to Alphabet-owned Google (O:GOOGL) cloud but did not explain the reason for the shift.
Amazon has also won over major individual candidates, the executive leading the company's election push said earlier this year. 
""Some of the largest presidential, congressional and gubernatorial campaigns are also trusted to AWS,"" Amazon's Jackson told clients in the February webinar viewed by Reuters. 
For example, Democratic Presidential frontrunner Joe Biden's online fundraising operations rely on AWS, a source with knowledge of the matter said. The Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment. In the past, AWS powered the Obama for America campaign in 2012, the source added. 
Reuters could not verify what cloud service the Trump campaign is using. It had no comment. 
The privatization of voting infrastructure is part of a broader trend that has swept across nearly every aspect of government activities in America - from parking tickets to prisons - and continues under the Trump administration.
Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) Azure, the biggest rival to AWS, has a sizeable government business and offers some election services but it has not focused on them and lags Amazon, according to companies who partner with both firms for government contracts. Microsoft declined to comment.  
Amazon is also competing with traditional election technology vendors including Elections Systems & Software (ES&S) and Dominion Voting Systems Corp, which offer some similar services such as election night reporting and data storage, according to consultants.
An ES&S spokeswoman said the company has not seen any impact from Amazon's efforts. Dominion did not respond to requests for comment.
LESS THAN $100 TO SECURE ELECTION NIGHT
Voting itself does not happen via Amazon. Voting machines in most states are not connected to any cloud service.
But elections require a raft of other technologies to keep track of voters and provide information. Amazon often works with specialized partners, who actually do the bidding on government contracts and include Amazon as a preferred vendor.
North Carolina chose Amazon Web Services over Microsoft's Azure to deliver election night results reporting because it ""was simple to set up (and) very low in cost,"" the State Board of Elections said. Before it worked with Amazon, North Carolina spent ""thousands of dollars"" on a similar service. Amazon charged them less than $100 during elections in 2016 and 2018 for the same service, the State Board of Elections said.
California's Alameda County turned to Amazon's cloud to let citizens view results on election night. The cost is less than $100 a year, county officials said.
In his webinar to clients, Amazon's Jackson said these services help the company win bigger contracts. For example, Oklahoma has tied up with an Amazon partner and pays $26,000 for two services on Amazon's servers, Pam Slater, assistant secretary at the Oklahoma State Election board said. 
Amazon has three categories of election-related clients: election administrators in states and counties, political campaigns and election-related non-profits, the documents, presentations and interviews show. 
The company's expansion in the election arena reflects its broader dominance in the fast-growing cloud computing business. Amazon had 33% percent of the overall cloud market in the second quarter of 2019 followed by Microsoft, according to SRG Research. For a graphic on market share, click https://tmsnrt.rs/323b9Vw
AWS, officially launched in 2006, generated $25.7 billion in sales in 2018 and is the company's biggest profit-generator. It was not clear how big the election business is inside AWS and the company declined to provide any details.
IS IT BULLET PROOF?
One of the main security concerns with election systems involves voter registration data, which Russian hackers breached in at least Arizona and Illinois in 2016, according to the FBI. 
Such databases generally include voter ID information such as partial social security numbers, addresses, voting history, party affiliation, whether an early ballot was sent, early primary ballots for independent voters, provisional ballots, and hand-written signatures of voters and absentee ballots, according to an analysis of RFP's (request for proposal) from states looking to move such databases to the cloud.
Vickery, the director at Upguard, uncovered at least three instances where voter data on Amazon's cloud servers was exposed to the internet, which have been reported previously.

Amazon said the breaches were caused by customer errors, adding that while AWS secures the cloud infrastructure, customers are responsible for security of what goes in the cloud. 
Errors caused by customers could continue, experts said, as many employees of states and counties who use AWS services lack the skills and training to avoid such errors in the future.
Greg Miller, co-founder of the OSET Institute, which works with the Department of Homeland Security and Congress on election security, also noted many of Amazon's partners - such as technology companies also called managed service providers (MSP's) who are tasked with delivering AWS services to customers - do not have the credentials or experience needed in delivering and handling election services. 
Amazon did not comment on the issue.
None of these risks have failed to deter those that have signed up with AWS.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's steel sector fragmentation is worsening, an industry official said on Tuesday, citing unplanned new capacity at small mills undermining government efforts to restructure and merge companies in the huge industry.
Beijing has been trying to consolidate the world's largest steel market to curb excess capacity and pollution and has set a goal for its top 10 steelmakers to own 60% of production capacity by 2020.
However, Chinese Society for Metals (CSM) president Gan Yong said the trend is for less rather than more consolidation, saying unplanned capacity expansion at smaller mills was coming online while their big mostly state-owened rivals were struggling to do the same as quickly.
""There are some places using steel as a key contributor to economic growth as demand is robust,"" Gan told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry event, adding some regions in China were not managing overcapacity controls very strictly.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently warned that the sector is still having trouble with increasing illegal capacity, including new mills not approved by the government and those that were supposed to be shut in capacity swaps.
Gan warned of growing competition in high-end products too. ""There are signs of overcapacity in stainless steel, electrical steel and auto sheet steel,"" he said.
In the first eight months of 2019, the world's top steelmaker churned out 665 million tonnes of crude steel, up 9.1% on the year.
Production by members registered with the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA), mostly state-owned firms, grew at 5.9% year-on-year during that period. Production by non-members, mostly private firms, surged 19.4%, according to CISA.
China has eliminated 140 million tonnes of steel capacity at 700 small mills and 150 million tonnes of inefficient capacity at larger firms in the past four years as part of its environmental crackdown and supply-side reform."

182,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 07:43AM ET</span>",BofA Survey Shows Just How Bearish Investors Are Despite Rallies,"(Bloomberg) -- Fund managers are ignoring this year’s rally in equity and credit markets and are hiding in cash amid concerns about the state of the global economy, the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) survey shows.
Investors favor defensive assets, such as cash, real estate investment trusts and staple stocks over equities, according to a poll conducted from Oct. 4 through Oct. 10. Fund managers’ exposure to cash rose compared to September, signaling a buying opportunity for risk assets. However, it remains below the high reached in June.
Clouds continue to gather around growth expectations, with about a third of surveyed investors expecting the world economy to weaken over the next 12 months. This sentiment follows a stream of disappointing U.S. data releases at the start of October, which halted the September and year-to-date rally in risk assets and fueled a retreat in global equities as fund managers retreated to havens.
It also doesn’t help that the U.K.’s political risks remain elevated, with the Brexit deadline quickly approaching and major questions persisting in U.S.-China trade negotiations. Investors view the end of the trade spat as the most bullish factor for equity markets in the next six months, according to BofA.
“If trade war and Brexit fears are unrealized in the fourth quarter, then macro can beat expectations, validating our contrarian bullish view,” said BofA strategists led by Michael Hartnett.
The survey’s results are in line with the influx of $322 billion into money market funds over the past six months, which is the largest flight to safe assets since the 2008 financial crisis. The most popular long positions among the polled fund managers are U.S. Treasuries, U.S. tech and growth stocks, as well as investment-grade corporate bonds.
A total of 175 fund managers overseeing $507 billion participated in the global survey. Sentiment toward global equities improved significantly right after the poll was completed, fueling gains in risk assets. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC television Monday the U.S. and China made “substantial progress” last week in negotiations and he expected Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to finalize the accord at a summit in Chile next month."

The ten-year yield was down 8 bps at 1.675% (US10YT=RR) by 1045 GMT, after rising on Friday to a two-week high on the back of signs Beijing and Washington might reach a trade deal and newfound optimism over a Brexit agreement between Britain and the European Union.
Bond markets rallied on Monday however as caution crept in on both fronts and yields are broadly lower across the board on Tuesday.
Two-year Treasury yields too fell 7 bps to 1.543% (US10YT=RR).
U.S. Federal Reserve official James Bullard, who last month voted for a big half-point rate cut, said meanwhile in London he hoped the Fed's two recent rate cuts would have staved off a lengthy inversion of the 2-10-year bond yield curve, that has preluded U.S. recessions in the past.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 07:21AM ET</span>",Chocolate makers face ethical branding dilemma,"By Ange Aboa and Maytaal Angel
ABIDJAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Ivory Coast and Ghana's threat to possibly halt the cocoa industry's ethical branding schemes poses a major risk to chocolate makers operating in Western markets where consumer demand for sustainably sourced products is rising.
The West African nations, which together produce more than 60% of the world's cocoa, said last week they will re-examine the schemes because chocolate makers have been slow to pay them a ""living income"" premium for their beans.
In a bid to ease pervasive farmer poverty, Ivory Coast and Ghana introduced a $400 a tonne living income differential (LID) in July on cocoa sales for the 2020/21 season. The move was a major overhaul in how global cocoa is priced.
They have since sold around 150,000 tonnes of 2020/21 cocoa, trade and government sources said, versus about 450,000 tonnes this time last year.
There are still some 2.35 million tonnes left to sell, but while the current marketing campaign is still in its early stages, Ivory Coast and Ghana need faster, large-volume sales to chocolate makers for the LID to work.
""The two countries have resolved to make the (LID) work whatever it takes,"" said a source at Cocobod, Ghana's cocoa regulator. He said this included halting sustainability schemes, used for ethical branding, within the next few weeks if chocolate makers don't comply.
Under pressure from Western consumers for ethically sourced products, chocolate makers such as Mars Wrigley, Mondelez (O:MDLZ), Barry Callebaut (S:BARN), Hershey's (N:HSY) and Nestle (S:NESN) have spent millions on sustainability schemes.
The programmes, which include audits from certifiers such as Fair Trade, are key to chocolate makers' branding, which could be hit if they are seen as hesitant to part with cash ear-marked to alleviate poverty.
""A few weeks ago, we started buying some quantities of cocoa for 2020/2021,"" said a spokesperson for Nestlé.
Hershey's said it times its purchases based on commercial needs but will comply with the LID, while Mondelez said it recognised the urgent need to improve farmer livelihoods, but added longer term, price premiums need to be directly linked to measures to eradicate poverty and climate change.
""We have not changed our buying approach in any way. As our approach takes us into the 2020/2021 crop, we are absolutely committed to buy with the LID,"" said a Mars spokesman.
Barry Callebaut declined to comment.
NAMED AND SHAMED
Ivory Coast and Ghana plan to use the LID income to guarantee farmers 70% of a $2,600 a tonne target price. If global prices rise above $2,900, LID proceeds will be placed in a fund that would guarantee farmers the target price when market prices fall.
For the scheme to work, the two nations need money upfront. They have already raised the guaranteed price they will pay farmers for this season's crop.
""(Chocolate makers) are going to be named and shamed soon. Customers will read that they don't support farmers, their certification schemes have been suspended, etc,"" said a senior cocoa trader.
Commodity traders act as middlemen - buying cocoa, selling it to chocolate makers, and making money on the spread. They usually buy in advance from producers and hold the risk on their books until chocolate makers step in.
Their margins have plunged in recent years however.
Because they are also unable to hedge the LID, they say chocolate makers who have committed to ethical sourcing need to take on some of the risk by bringing forward their purchases.
This would require a sourcing strategy overhaul for chocolate makers. Moreover, they fear that if they pay the LID now and their competitors don't, they could lose out if the LID is later scrapped.
""This (LID) could work if Ivory Coast and Ghana had the money to stockpile (excess supply) but they (don't) so most of us think the plan will have to be adapted or maybe withdrawn,"" said a cocoa industry source.
The source added that halting sustainability schemes would hurt farmers, not just chocolate makers.
About 500,000 tonnes of Ivory Coast and Ghana cocoa are certified per year, according to industry sources. The cocoa can fetch farmers a premium of up to $200 per tonne.
The cocoa industry's efforts to source sustainably have been around for nearly two decades, though little has changed on the ground for farmers, with poverty widespread and West African forest cover all but decimated."

189,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Blackstone turns up heat on hotelier Unizo with tender offer,"By Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group (N:BX) said on Tuesday it would launch a tender offer for Unizo Holdings (T:3258) at 5,000 yen a share, doubling down on its $1.6 billion offer after the proposal was rebuffed by the Japanese hotel chain.
The potential bid from one of the world's largest buyout funds marks another twist in the takeover saga surrounding the once-obscure hotelier, now seen as a test case for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push for greater transparency and corporate disclosure.
Unizo last week rejected a buyout proposal from Blackstone as well as one from a ""locally renowned"" fund that it did not identify. Prior to that, Unizo withdrew support for a white-knight bid from SoftBank-backed (T:9984) Fortress Investment Group. It had earlier been a target for travel agent H.I.S. Co (T:9603) in a failed hostile bid.
Unizo had frustrated some investors by welcoming Fortress's bid and then back-tracking. 
Last week, Unizo's biggest shareholder, Elliot Management, went public for the first time to ask Unizo's board to address its concerns about disclosure in relation to Unizo's sudden withdrawal of support for the Fortress bid.
Blackstone said in a statement it would offer 5,000 yen a share for Unizo, valuing the hotel chain at around 171.1 billion yen ($1.6 billion). That represents a slight premium to Unizo's closing price of 4,700 yen and a sharp premium to Fortress's proposal of 4,000 yen.
Blackstone said it would consider ""any possible options"" including initiating the bid if Unizo would not agree with its proposals by Oct. 23.
A Unizo spokeswoman said the company had received the offer from Blackstone but it had not decided yet how to respond.
Unizo, which operates limited service hotels in Japan, has proved attractive to bidders because of perceptions that it is undervalued. UBS analysts have previously calculated Unizo's net asset value - a measure of an entity's net value - at more than 7,800 yen a share after taxes.
Unizo has spurned potential bidders and pulled its support for Fortress by citing their failure to deal with Unizo's concerns about employment. 
Blackstone has said it would maintain or improve employment conditions and provide benefits which most of Unizo employees have not received yet, such as owning Unizo stock and getting incentive payment systems.

Blackstone has opposed Unizo's plan to create a scheme where Unizo employees could exercise control over a new owner's ability to later exit.

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co (N:KKR) and its partners have canceled what was expected to be the biggest Australian IPO of the year, the listing of their lender Latitude Financial, two sources told Reuters.
In what was to be their second attempt at listing in just over a year, KKR,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Varde Partners, decided to cancel the expected A$1 billion ($676.20 million) offering on Tuesday, because a large proportion of demand for shares was coming from hedge funds rather than desired long-term investors, the sources said.
The sources had direct knowledge of the situation but asked not to be identified since they are not authorized to talk to the media. A Latitude spokesman declined to comment but said the company expected to make an announcement on Wednesday.
Latitude had filed a prospectus with the regulator last month valuing the finance company at between A$2 and A$2.25 per share but over the weekend decided to discount the offer price by up to 20.9% due to low demand, Reuters reported.
The firm, which offers easy-access loans and credit cards with minimal paperwork, and its bookrunners were due to finalize the raising on Wednesday and shares in the new company were due to begin trading Oct. 18.
But despite expectations that a lower price would give the newly listed shares a better chance of trading higher, the group decided to pull the IPO because it did not have a ""high certainty"" that would happen, the sources said.
Many investors that would have taken shares in the company were not large, long-term investors and the owners did not want to risk ""an adverse after-market outcome"", they added.
KKR, Deutsche Bank and Varde Partners founded Latitude in 2015 when they bought GE Capital's Australian and New Zealand consumer lending arm for A$8.2 billion.
Last year, Latitude deferred a planned IPO that would have valued the business at about A$5 billion due to market conditions and a management change, while the country's financial industry was also being scrutinized by a national misconduct inquiry."

The company, which manages $6.96 trillion in assets, attracted $84.25 billion in new money during the quarter, providing a peek into the risk appetite of investors amid fears of a slowing U.S. economy.
Investors preferred BlackRock's low-fee passive-investment products over its actively managed funds. BlackRock's iShares ETFs took in $41.5 billion of new money, up 15% from the prior quarter.
BlackRock is trying to become a bigger provider of technology used by Wall Street firms to combat competitive pricing pressures in the asset management business. The company's technology unit continued its robust growth with a 30% rise in revenue.
Net income fell to $1.12 billion, or $7.15 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.22 billion, or $7.54 per share, a year earlier.

Citi is currently in the process of completing its exit from a minority-owned securities joint venture in China, a process that one of the sources said is expected to be completed by end of this year.
The exit, which was first announced late last year, was seen as paving the way for the U.S. bank to set up its own brokerage in the world's second-largest economy.
Citi's plans to set up a wholly-owned securities business in China are in the early stages, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Bloomberg first reported the development.
""Citi continues to evaluate opportunities to further support its clients in China,"" a spokesman for the bank said in an emailed statement, declining to give details.
Global investment banks are currently able to own up to 51% of their China operations. That requires a joint venture with local Chinese partners. Beijing has pledged to ease foreign ownership limits in the financial sector over a period of time.
Last week, China announced a firm timetable for opening its futures, brokerage and mutual fund sectors fully to foreign investors next year, the latest step to deregulate the country's trillions of dollars worth of financial industry.
Limits on foreign ownership of securities firms will be removed on Dec. 1, 2020.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission will start taking in applications in the second quarter of 2020, and plans to give at least couple of licenses for wholly-owned securities business by end of the year, said a source with knowledge of the plans.
Citi, which has a large retail and corporate banking presence in China, will become one of the first foreign banks to set up a wholly-owned securities business in China, if the plans are finalised.
French lender  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) has also ditched a plan for a securities joint venture in China in favor of a wholly-owned subsidiary, a senior executive of the bank said over the weekend."

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Group said it plans to invest 41 trillion won ($35 billion) in mobility and other auto technologies by 2025, part of which will be directed to an ambitious effort to become more competitive in self-driving cars that has also received government backing.
The plan, which Hyundai said encompasses autonomous, connected and electric cars as well as technology for ride-sharing, comes after the automaker and two of its affiliates announced an investment of $1.6 billion in a venture with U.S. self-driving tech firm Aptiv (N:APTV).
South Korea's government is also onboard, unveiling more funding for autonomous vehicle technology with President Moon Jae-in declaring on Tuesday that he expected self-driving cars to account for half of new cars on the country's roads by 2030.
""The self-driving market is a golden market to revitalize the economy and create new jobs,"" Moon said in a speech at Hyundai Motor's (KS:005380) research center near Seoul.
The government intends to spend 1.7 trillion won between 2021 and 2027 on self-driving technology. It expects Hyundai to launch level 4, or fully autonomous, cars for fleet customers in 2024 and for the general public by 2027, an industry ministry official told Reuters. 
But some experts question whether targets set by the government and the automotive group, which also includes Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270), are realistic given the technological and cost challenges and the lack of home-grown technology.
In a 45-page report on future automotive technology, the government acknowledged South Korea lags in some key areas necessary for self-driving cars such artificial intelligence, sensors and logic chips.
""Hyundai has to buy technology from someone else because it lacks software technology. Even though it has a lot of cash, this could become a financial burden if its earnings deteriorate,"" Esther Yim, an analyst at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities, said.
Other analysts noted that the prospects for self-driving cars are quite murky.
General Motors Co’s (N:GM) self-driving unit, Cruise, said in July it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019 as tech firms and automakers acknowledge it will take more time and money than they had expected to make autonomous vehicles safe for unrestricted use on public roads.
South Korea's government said it would prepare a regulatory and legal framework for autonomous cars and the safety questions they pose by 2024.
It is also aiming to lay the technological and legal groundwork for demonstrations of flying cars by 2025. Hyundai Motor's executive vice chairman Euisun Chung said last month that the company is looking at developing flying cars.

Hyundai has also received much government backing for hydrogen fuel cell cars, with Moon calling hydrogen power the ""future bread and butter"" of Asia's No. 4 economy and declaring himself an ambassador for the technology.

Thomas Cook collapsed last month, stranding over a hundred thousand passengers as its UK business went into liquidation.
Appearing before a British parliamentary committee, Peter Fankhauser again apologized to customers, staff and suppliers for the firm's collapse but did not say if he would hand back any of his pay.
Asked about his salary, Fankhauser said he did not set his own pay or decide his bonus.
""I fully understand the sentiment in the public,"" he told the committee.
""However, what I can say to that is that I worked tirelessly for the success of this company and I'm deeply sorry that I was not able to secure the deal.""
He said that a 750,000 pound ($949,950) bonus he was paid in 2017 could theoretically be clawed back, but 30% was paid in shares which were now worthless.
Fankhauser said that his efforts to transform the company on his appointment in 2014 had been constrained by its debts, and that responsibility for the collapse was shared between multiple parties who tried, and failed, to agree a restructuring plan.
The firm collapsed after it became unable to service its debts and failed to convince banks to back a rescue plan in the face of changing customer habits and intense competition from low-cost airlines and internet companies."
203,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>","Traders Brush Off Turkey Sanctions, But Warn Worse Could Come","(Bloomberg) -- Investors in Turkish markets brushed off Monday night’s U.S. sanctions, though some warned that harsher penalties could still come.
The lira strengthened as much as 1% before paring gains to 0.2%, trading at 5.9142 per dollar as of 11:48 a.m. in Istanbul. Turkey’s main BIST 30 climbed 1.5%. Those moves only partially eroded losses that have made Turkish assets among the worst performers in emerging markets this month.
Since President Donald Trump warned on Oct. 7 that he could “obliterate” Turkey’s economy if Ankara did anything he considered “off limits” with its incursion into Syria, traders have braced for sanctions that would deal a severe blow to the Turkish financial system.
“It’s a short-term relief,” said Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London. “The risk that far more consequential and punitive measures could be used by the U.S. prevails as the military operation in northern Syria continues.”
For now, Washington is sanctioning three senior Turkish officials and increasing steel tariffs. The penalties may have little impact on the wider economy and are in line with measures adopted last year, which were subsequently removed as relations between the NATO allies improved.
Much depends on how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responds. On Monday, he said the offensive in Syria would continue no matter what.
“I fear that Erdogan will not be able to help himself, and we will see retaliation,” said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. “If they decide to respond, tit for tat, it could get ugly with a game of escalation between the two sides.”
The sell-off this month has created opportunities for investors brave enough to jump in. Real yields on Turkish local-currency government bonds have climbed to the highest level in a year. The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index of equities fell more than 5% on Monday and touched it’s lowest level since June."

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets marched higher Tuesday on renewed confidence in the “phase-1” trade deal announced by the U.S. and China, as well as fresh hopes of a deal averting a disorderly Brexit at the end of October.
China finally endorsed the U.S.’s account of the handshake agreement made last Friday, with newswires quoting Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang as corroborating Washington’s summary.

At the same time, the EU’s top Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters that a deal between the EU and U.K. at this weekend’s summit was still possible, although he stressed that work still needed to be done.

Additionally, the first big sentiment indicator of the month in Europe, Germany’s ZEW index, came in slightly higher than expected at -22.8 rather than the consensus forecast of -27. That was still a drop from September, while the ZEW current conditions sub-index fell to its lowest headline reading since 2010.

However, it wasn’t all good news: the U.K.’s job boom cooled as employment fell by 56,000 in the three months to August, while average earnings growth (including bonuses) also weakened to 3.8% from 4.0%.

With sterling still well supported in the foreign exchange markets, the U.K. FTSE 100 underperformed the rest of the continent, falling 0.2% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT). The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.3% at 390.72, while Germany’s DAX index was also up 0.3%.

The DAX’s gain would have been bigger had it not been for a thumping 18% drop in payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG) in the wake of new allegations of false accounting by the Financial Times.
 The FT and Wirecard have been at each other’s throats for months, with Wirecard alleging the newspaper colluded with short sellers to manipulate its share price. The FT said that the law firm it had hired to investigate Wirecard’s claims had found no evidence to support them. Wirecard had said much the same when it hired a law firm to investigate the FT’s allegations."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government is looking into whether hefty discounts offered on Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) during their online festive sales violate foreign investment rules, a commerce ministry official told Reuters.
India introduced new rules in February aimed at protecting the 130 million people dependent on small-scale retail by deterring big online discounts. The rules forced e-commerce firms to tweak their business structures and drew criticism from the United States, straining trade ties between New Delhi and Washington.
While Amazon and Flipkart say they've complied with the federal rules, local trader groups say the two companies are violating them by burning money to offer discounts - of more than 50% in some cases - during the ongoing festive sales.
Reuters reviewed emails and internal training material from Flipkart showing the company is in some cases offering to reduce, or forfeit, its sales commission from sellers that offer discounts.
The commerce ministry official told Reuters the government was reviewing complaints and evidence filed by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a group representing some 70 million brick-and-mortar retailers, alleging Amazon and Flipkart were violating the foreign investment rules.
The official declined to comment on possible action, but executives from Amazon and Flipkart were summoned to meet commerce ministry officials last week to discuss the matter.
Flipkart in a statement said it had a ""good meeting"" with government officials and it was ""deeply committed to doing business the right way in India"".
Amazon said it had an ""open & transparent discussion"" with officials and has a high bar for compliance.
Seeking to attract shoppers around the key Hindu festival of Diwali, both retailers have placed full-page advertisements in top national daily the Times of India to showcase discount offerings stretching from Samsung (KS:005930) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) phones to clothing and diapers.
""Customers are going online because of the unbelievable discounts. Because of this sales at offline businesses are down 30% to 40% this month,"" CAIT's secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said.
FLIPKART INCENTIVES
Two emails received by Flipkart sellers in September, just days ahead of the inaugural phase of the festive sales, showed it offering to partly fund discounts.
The company would ""burn"" 3% of the discount if a seller lowered a product price by 15%, or 9% if the seller discounted by 30%, said one of the emails.
In training material posted on Flipkart's restricted website for its sellers, seen by Reuters, the company asks them to prepare for the festive season by saying ""nothing is bigger than this"" and explaining how they can benefit by discounting products for Flipkart's premium customers.
""We want to ensure that you fetch as much profit from it as possible ... whatever the discount you are offering, half of that will be reimbursed to you by Flipkart,"" a post said.
A Flipkart source said the incentives were compliant with Indian regulations and were aimed at promoting sellers' earnings by effectively reducing the commission they pay.
All India Online Vendors Association, whose 3,500 members sell products on various online platforms including Flipkart, in a statement said fewer than 100 of its members benefited from Flipkart's partial discount funding, giving some sellers an unfair advantage."

Eighty percent of firms feared leaving the European Union would hurt their future prospects and nearly two-thirds said they would be unable to invest in their British operations, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) survey showed.
""Make no mistake, every day 'no deal' remains a possibility is another day of lost investment, another day that makes it harder to recover investor confidence in the UK,"" SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.
""As yet, the damage is not irreversible. But we need a deal. A deal that, in the short term, enables a 'business-as-usual' transition for as long as it takes to negotiate and implement the future trading relationship.""
In the longer term, the industry needed frictionless trade with the EU, he said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to take Britain out of the EU without an agreement on Oct. 31 if necessary, although lawmakers have passed legislation that they say will force him to seek a delay from Brussels.
The autos sector, Britain's biggest exporter of goods, is concerned that World Trade Organisation tariffs of 10% on vehicles alongside new customs checks and border delays could halt production if there is a disorderly Brexit.
Last week, Nissan (T:7201), which runs Britain's biggest car factory, said such tariffs would make its business unsustainable in Europe.
The SMMT said its survey was based on responses from 158 member companies polled in September."

208,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 04:19AM ET</span>",Neil Woodford sacked as flagship Equity Income Fund to be shut,"By Simon Jessop, Sinead Cruise and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Neil Woodford has been ousted as manager of his flagship LF Woodford Equity Income Fund, which will now be wound up to pay back investors trapped in the fund since June.
The fund's administrator, Link Fund Solutions (LFS), said on Tuesday that it had taken the decision to close the fund - which has been suspended - because Woodford's efforts to sell down his illiquid holdings and move into liquid stocks ahead of a planned December reopening of the fund had not gone to plan.
It is the latest blow to storied stockpicker Woodford, once a darling of retail investors, who has seen his reputation tarnished after a liquidity crisis forced him to stop clients leaving the 3.7 billion pound ($4.6 billion) Equity Income Fund in June.
Neil Woodford, in a separate statement, firmly rejected the move to shut the fund and oust him as manager.
""This was Link's decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors.""
Woodford will cease to be the investment manager of the fund with immediate effect and the fund's assets will be split into two portfolios managed by others, LFS said in a statement.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Advisors will take charge of selling the fund's listed assets while PJT Partners will continue with its previously agreed role in helping to sell the fund's highly illiquid assets, Link said.
Shares in Neil Woodford's separate listed fund  Woodford Patient Capital Trust  (WPCT) (L:WPCT), which shares some of the same holdings as the suspended fund, slid to a record low at the open, and by 0703 GMT were trading down 8% at 34.75 pence a share. 
The winding up of LF Woodford Equity Income Fund - which will be stripped of Woodford's name - will begin on Jan. 17, 2020, and will allow an initial payment to be made to investors.
At the heart of Woodford's troubles was the scale of his holdings in unlisted or illiquid assets, which are hard to sell quickly. 
LFS said the fund had risked being subjected to a further extension of its suspension and potentially unequal treatment of investors, particularly those who chose to remain invested in the fund.
""Whilst progress has been made in relation to repositioning the Fund's assets, this has unfortunately not been sufficient to allow reasonable certainty as to when the repositioning would be fully achieved and the Fund could be re-opened,"" Link said in a letter to investors.
""LFS has concluded that an orderly realization of the Fund’s assets allows the return of money through interim payments to investors more quickly than if the Fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time.""
In choosing BlackRock, LFS said the company, the world's biggest asset manager, was ""best placed to carry out this role due to its transition and investment management, trading and capital markets expertise and experience"".

Woodford Patient Capital Trust said it noted the decision by Link and was continuing to review its own management arrangements, with a further announcement in due course.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Plane parts maker FACC's (VI:FACC) operating profit fell 6% in the second quarter as it produced fewer components for the Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 and Boeing (N:BA) 737NG jets being phased out and start-up costs for new cabin interiors bit.
Chinese-owned FACC makes components for wings, tail assemblies and fuselages as well as engines and cabin interiors for all major planemakers.
So far 2019 has been a slow year for the commercial aerospace industry, beset by negative headlines on safety following two deadly plane crashes and the U.S.-China trade war.
FACC said in its half annual report on Tuesday that while production rates of all major aircraft types had stabilized at a high level, no significant increases were expected for 2020.
""We expect sustained growth in the aviation industry in the long run, but are currently observing a slight flattening of the growth curve,"" Chief Executive Robert Machtlinger said. ""This trend is reflected in our sales development, which shows a smaller increase than planned.""
However, operational measures to reduce costs were progressing and would lead to stable profitability from the second half of 2020, he said.
Its shares fell 2.6% in early trading.
Owned by China's Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC) (SZ:000768), the group reported earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 8.6 million euros ($9.5 million) on largely flat revenue of 179.7 million in the three months through end-August. New orders surpassed $800 million.
Around half of FACC's revenue comes from Airbus (PA:AIR), which reported a 13.5% rise in nine-month deliveries, well ahead of U.S. rival Boeing, whose deliveries nearly halved due to the grounding of the B737 MAX. FACC does not supply the new aircraft, which has been grounded following two deadly crashes.
A decision by the World Trade Organization, which formally authorized the United States on Monday to impose tariffs on Airbus aircraft, does not cover aircraft components ""and thus products of the FACC Group are not affected,"" the company said.
FACC also produces components for Chinese planemaker COMAC, which Machtlinger expects to become a fierce rival to Airbus and Boeing within 10 years. Revenues for COMAC's ARJ 21 regional jet and the narrow-body C919 increased in the first half and have become a major revenue driver at the cabin interior unit, FACC said.
FACC expects sales of around 600 million euros and an EBIT margin of close to 6% for its shortened March-December 2019 financial year. From 2020, the group will report per calendar year."

The debt package may include at least $2 billion of unsecured notes with a 15% coupon, Bloomberg reported.
The report said that WeWork preferred the JPMorgan package over a stake sale to SoftBank, which already owns around one-third of the company, because it would not dilute the stakes of top private shareholders.
The Bloomberg report cited people familiar with the matter.
SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment on the report. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reuters reported earlier in October that WeWork and JPMorgan were negotiating a debt deal after the company postponed last month's initial public offering as investor concerns grew about its valuation and its business model.
Reuters reported on Sunday, citing a source, that SoftBank had prepared a financing package that would significantly increase its one-third stake and further dilute the influence of co-founder Adam Neumann.
The Guardian newspaper reported early on Tuesday that WeWork is expected to sack at least 2,000 people as early as this week.
In recent weeks, the cash-strapped office-sharing company has seen its credit ratings being downgraded deeper into junk territory by global credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.
WeWork lost $1.9 billion in 2018 and burned through $2.36 billion in cash in the first half of this year, according to U.S. filings.
The company last month replaced Neumann as chief executive with insiders Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham taking on joint CEO roles."

216,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 02:22AM ET</span>",London retains global finance throne amid Brexit chaos,"By Andrew MacAskill, Sinead Cruise and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - From the pinnacle of the City of London's largest skyscraper, Stuart Lipton is wagering a $1.2 billion bet that the British capital remains a master of the international financial universe no matter what happens with Brexit.
The 76-year-old property developer is not alone. Bankrolled by a host of global investors, including France's  Axa  (PA:AXAF), his big-ticket gamble in London's financial district is - so far - on the money.
The cataclysmic warnings during the 2016 referendum that London would lose its financial throne if it voted to leave the European Union (EU) have, so far, been proven wrong. London is still the world's banker, only bigger by some measures.
""London is extraordinarily resilient and its future as a finance centre is secure because what we have here is unique,"" Lipton told Reuters on the 61st floor of 22 Bishopsgate, set to become western Europe's second tallest skyscraper when it opens next year.
In the year to June, London has attracted more cross border commercial real estate investment than any other city. It has overtaken New York as destination for fintech investment and it has increased its dominance of the world's $6.6 trillion daily foreign exchange market.
Since the vote to leave the EU, Britain has leapfrogged the United States to become the largest centre for trading interest rate swaps, despite calls by ex-French President Francois Hollande to end London's dominance in clearing euro-denominated derivatives. 
That London has expanded its influence as an international finance centre is one of the biggest riddles of the United Kingdom's tortuous three year Brexit crisis. 
The city's standing ensures the United Kingdom keeps one of its last big chips at the top table of world politics just as it splits from the EU.
It also means EU companies will still come to London to raise finance outside the bloc after Brexit, a fact not lost on Wall Street heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JP Morgan (N:JPM).
Just a mile away from 22 Bishopsgate, Goldman opened its new 1 million square foot European headquarters - complete with mothers' rooms and wildflowers on the roof - in July, three years on from the 2016 referendum.
Largely abandoned by the British government during Brexit talks, ten senior industry officials told Reuters London's financial services sector has grown since 2016 because there is no realistic competitor in its time zone. 
And high-rolling bankers are too attached to its Anglo-Saxon, work-hard, play-hard culture. 
The chief executive of the British division of one of Europe's largest banks said although some business will move to the EU, most senior bankers will be reluctant to leave London. He would consider taking a 20% pay cut to remain in the city.
""If you are an Italian banker, who moved out to London 20 years ago, and your kids go to private school around the corner then you are not going to move to Frankfurt,"" he said.
""MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE""
A global hub for trading, lending and investing, London is the largest net exporter of financial services in the world, with the EU accounting for a quarter of the business.
The 2016 referendum shocked many of the masters of London's financial universe, triggering the biggest one-day fall of the pound since the era of free-floating exchange rates was introduced in the early 1970s.
But so far, most major financial institutions have opted against moving large numbers of people and activities until the loss of access to the EU's lucrative single market is confirmed.
Banks, insurers and asset managers have shifted over a trillion euros of assets such as derivatives and bonds from London to the continent and opened new EU hubs as a hedge against London suddenly being cut off from the bloc if Britain exits the EU without a formal agreement.
The Bank of England estimates around 4,000 people may have moved by the time Britain has exited the EU. But the key decisions are still taken in London.
Reuters contacted JP Morgan and Goldman, and rivals Citi (N:C), Bank of America (N:BAC), UBS (S:UBSG),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), to seek details on how a 'no deal Brexit' might accelerate the transfer of resources and activities from London.
All banks said they were prepared for a no-deal Brexit, and had been since the first quarter.
Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James Gorman, said that he scarcely worried about Brexit. 
""That's not in my top 200 issues,"" he said.
British data shows the total number of people employed in the City between 2016 and 2018 overall rose by 31,000, though the total number of people employed specifically in banking and insurance is down 3,000 over the period. 
It is not clear how much of that drop is due to Brexit and how much is due to new regulations or structural changes, such as higher numbers of tech specialists at lenders while traditional banking jobs shrink.
Initial estimates of potential job losses ranged from about 30,000 roles within a year of Britain leaving the EU, estimated by the Brussels-based Bruegel research group, to up to 75,000 by 2025 by Oliver Wyman.
Oliver Wyman said they stand by their predictions because it is important to distinguish between job losses on the first day of Brexit and over the longer term. The final number will depend upon the level of market access, which is not clear yet.
Bruegel did not respond to a request for comment. 
GLACIAL MELT?
Financial capitals such as London have remarkable longevity and their rise and fall typically happens at a glacial pace, said Youssef Cassis, a professor of economic history who specialises in financial centres.
""There is no precedent for decoupling between a major economic power- in this case the European Union- and its financial centre, London,"" he said.
Some key activities have moved out of London ahead of Brexit. Euro zone government bond and repurchase agreements trading worth around 230 billion euros a day, along with clearing, switched to Amsterdam, Milan and Paris earlier this year.
London-based CBOE Europe, the EU's largest share trading venue, began trading euro shares at its new Amsterdam hub at the start of October.
Nicolas Mackel, who heads a body promoting Luxembourg's financial centre, said it would be a shift in activities and not jobs that will affect London most.
""It's not between now and Christmas you have to look, but on a five, 10, 15 and 20 year framework. It's a false comfort that you are providing by only focusing on jobs,"" Mackel said.
After Brexit the $15.9 trillion EU 27 economy will still be reliant on a financial capital outside its borders, which could be politically hard for Brussels to stomach indefinitely.
One European Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the EU had no intention of smothering Britain's financial sector to accelerate its own plans for an EU capital markets union. 
But there is scepticism in the market about the longevity of such pledges.
""Why should one expect the EU to give an economic answer to what is a political challenge?"" said Xavier Rolet, former head of London Stock Exchange and CEO of investment manager CQS.
""I would expect them to respond politically, even if those answers are not necessarily in the best economic interests of EU-based investors, corporates and banks.""
Rolet, who said in the aftermath of the referendum that half of all finance jobs in London may disappear if derivatives clearing left the capital, said it was too early to assess the implications of Brexit.
""I do stand by my statement,"" he said of the potential job losses.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 01:55AM ET</span>",Southwest pilots say 737 MAX return may be delayed beyond Boeing's fourth quarter goal,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) pilots predicted on Monday that the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airplane will return to the skies around February, weeks later than Boeing and airlines have projected. 
The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), the union for the airline's pilots, said it believes the aircraft, which was pulled from service in March after two fatal crashes, will likely resume flights in ""probably a February time frame."" 
Southwest, United Airlines and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) currently estimate the planes will be available to fly in early January.
Boeing said Monday it is ""working towards return to service in the fourth quarter."" A key step - a certification test flight by Boeing - is not expected until early November. 
Last week, SWAPA sued Boeing alleging that the planemaker “deliberately misled” the airline and pilots about the 737 MAX aircraft. The grounding of the 737 MAX in March forced more than 30,000 Southwest Airlines flight cancellations, causing over $100 million in lost wages for pilots, the union said.
Boeing said last week it believes the lawsuit ""is meritless and will vigorously defend against it.""
SWAPA said Monday the resumption of flights could be pushed beyond February.
The union noted that after the certification test flight, the European Joint Aviation Authorities Joint Operational Evaluation Board has to submit recommendations to the FAA's Flight Standards Board. 
""The timing here may be influenced by geopolitical disagreements and tensions; however, we are hearing some indications that those issues are being resolved,"" the union said, adding that several other steps must follow including publication of an airworthiness directive and a 15-day public comment period. 
Airlines will then submit proposed changes to the FAA Certificate Management Office and pilots must complete training.
Southwest is the largest operator of the MAX with 34 jetliners in its fleet when the aircraft was grounded worldwide following two crashes that together killed 346 people. 
Southwest said Monday it was relying on information from Boeing and the FAA and ""does not currently have a target date that we are working toward. We ... currently do not have MAX-related capacity in our schedule through Jan. 5, 2020.”
Boeing is under pressure to deliver updated software and training to regulators for the aircraft to fly again, and the company has been negotiating compensation with customers like Southwest over the financial hit from the grounding.

Southwest, with around 10,000 pilots represented by SWAPA, had 41 more MAX jets on order for this year alone.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks and the pound gained on Tuesday as investors held out hope that Britain still had a chance of avoiding a messy exit from the European Union at key negotiations this week.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.1%. Australian shares (AXJO) were up 0.17%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) was up 1.86%.
The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) rose 0.23%, German DAX futures (FDXc1) were 0.16% higher, while FTSE futures (FFIc1) were up 0.12%.
The pound rose against the dollar and the euro, reflecting the cautious optimism about talks between Britain and the EU.
Capping broader gains in equities, however, was a perceived lack of progress coming out of U.S.-China trade negotiations.
Reports of a ""Phase 1"" trade deal between the United States and China last week had earlier cheered markets but the dearth of details around the agreement has since curbed this enthusiasm with oil prices extending declines, Chinese stocks weaker and the safe-haven yen holding gains versus dollar.
The focus has now shifted to Europe where officials from Britain and the EU will meet at a make-or-break summit on Thursday and Friday that will determine whether or not Britain is headed for a so-called no-deal Brexit.
""Given the parliamentary intervention, I would say the chance of a no-deal Brexit is around 10% to 20%,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney.
""If there is a deal, sterling would rally and risk assets would rally, but the reaction could be limited to a day.""
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) rose 0.27% on Tuesday in Asia after the S&P 500 ended 0.14% lower.
Traders, however, cautioned that sentiment remains fragile because the outcome of Brexit talks is far from certain and the U.S.-China trade war remains a risk to global growth.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to strike an exit deal at an EU summit on Thursday and Friday to allow an orderly departure on Oct. 31.
The main sticking point remains the border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which belongs to the UK. Some EU politicians have expressed guarded optimism that a deal can be reached.
However, diplomats from the EU have indicated they are pessimistic about Johnson's proposed solution for the border and want more concessions.
In the currency market, sterling rose 0.17% to $1.2632, approaching a three-month high of $1.2708. The pound (EURGBP=D3) also rose around 0.18% to 87.34 pence per euro.
The yen , often considered a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty, held steady at 108.33 versus the dollar.

A perceived lack of progress in resolving a prolonged trade row between the United States and China also weighed on investor confidence.
Chinese stocks (CSI300) fell 0.44% on Tuesday, led by declines in the technology sector. In the onshore market, the yuan traded at 7.0740 per dollar, pulling back from a two-month high reached on Monday.
The United States agreed to delay an Oct. 15 increase in tariffs on Chinese goods while Beijing said it would buy as much as $50 billion of U.S. agricultural products after tense negotiations last week.
However, Washington has left in place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.
Trade experts and China market analysts say chances are high that Washington and Beijing will fail to agree on any specifics - as happened in May - in time for a mid-November meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
U.S. crude (CLc1) fell 0.71% to $53.21 per barrel following a 2% decline overnight due to worries that global energy demand will remain weak.
Brent crude (LCOc1) also fell 0.78% to $58.89 per barrel.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday that utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co should be held accountable for mismanaging last week's widespread power shutoffs and urged the company to provide credits or rebates to affected customers.
Separately, the California Public Utility Commission ordered corrective steps by PG&E, the state's largest investor-owned utility, while summoning eight of its top executives to an emergency meeting on Friday.
The utility, a unit of PG&E Corp (N:PCG), cut off electricity to more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California last week in a bid to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy, dry weather.
The precautionary shutdown, unprecedented in its scope, has been widely criticized as being haphazardly conducted on too large a scale, with insufficient advance notice to affected customers.
On Thursday, the governor said the power outage followed years of mismanagement by the utility and branded its handling as ""unacceptable.""
Chief Executive Bill Johnson publicly acknowledged that day that PG&E had fallen short in its preparations for the outage.
In response to state officials' latest moves, Johnson again acknowledged room for improvement while defending the broad-scale power cutoff as ""the right decision.""
He added that there ""were no catastrophic wildfires started"" last week in the utility's service areas.
Newsom said he had sent a letter to Public Utilities Commission President Marybel Batjer confirming that the agency will conduct a comprehensive inquiry and review of PG&E's planning, implementation and decision-making process failures. (https:// ""Californians should not pay the price for decades of PG&E's greed and neglect,"" Newsom said. ""We will continue to hold PG&E accountable to make radical changes – prioritizing the safety of Californians and modernizing its equipment."" Newsom also urged the company to provide affected customers an automatic credit or rebate of $100 per residential customer and $250 per small business as compensation. Separately, Batjer sent PG&E executives an eight-page letter on Monday directing the utility outlining seven ""major areas where immediate corrective actions are required,"" the commission said in a statement. ""Failures in execution, combined with the magnitude of this (power shutdown) event, created an unacceptable situation that should never be repeated,"" Batjer wrote. ""Loss of power is not a mere inconvenience - it endangers lives and property, especially those individuals who are reliant on power for medical reasons."" Several of the corrective actions ordered by the commission dealt with website crashes and an overwhelming surge in call center activity the utility experienced during the shutdown.  
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 11:56PM ET</span>",Australian banks to be asked to hold more capital against their NZ units: regulator,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking regulator on Tuesday said it plans to ask lenders to meet higher capital levels domestically to offset their exposure to large overseas units - a move that comes in response to plans by New Zealand to hike capital ratios for the sector.
Australia's Big Four banks own the largest lenders in New Zealand, which has proposed new capital ratios that would require the banks to raise NZ$20 billion ($12.6 billion) over the next five years.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) said in a consultation paper it is proposing to limit the amount of exposure to a unit, which also includes domestic units, that a bank can leverage to 10% of common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio.
Current rules allow the banks to leverage their investments in units, which may on average overstate their CET1 ratios by 100 basis points, APRA said. It argued the rule change was necessary to reduce the risk that Australian banks may not have sufficient capital to protect Australian depositors.
Some lenders may need to raise capital but there were also other options, it said.
""In relation to New Zealand, there are a number of options available to the banks. If they decide to fund any higher capital requirements by retaining local profits, they are unlikely to require additional capital domestically, APRA said in a statement.
Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) said on Tuesday that applying APRA's proposed approach would reduce its level 1 CET1 capital ratio by about 40 basis points while the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) said it estimated a reduction in the same ratio of about 30 basis points.
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), which owns New Zealand's largest lender and therefore is likely to be hardest hit by the proposed changes, said it was reviewing the APRA paper and would provide an update after further analysis.
National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) said it expected a minimal impact on its capital levels.
""This is a complicated proposal and is likely to take time for the market to fully digest,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) banking analysts told clients in a note. ""It is a net-negative for the sector ...(but) we acknowledge there are some offsetting measures that may mean the impact is less than the 100bp headline.""
The proposals are open to submissions from the lenders and interested parties until Jan. 31. The regulator intends to finalize the changes in early 2020 with the new requirements expected to come into force from Jan. 1, 2021.
APRA is also proposing a reduction in the capital that banks must hold to offset exposure to smaller banking or insurance units."
222,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 11:25PM ET</span>","Paytm Nears SoftBank, Ant Fundraising at a $16 Billion Valuation","(Bloomberg) -- Paytm is close to scoring $2 billion of new financing from investors including Jack Ma’s Ant Financial and SoftBank Group Corp., a person familiar with the matter said, describing a mega-deal that will raise the temperature in India’s increasingly heated financial payments arena.
Rob Citrone’s Discovery Capital Management is also in discussions to join a funding round that values the country’s top online financial services firm at $16 billion, the person said, asking not to be identified talking about a private deal. The funding will be split evenly between equity and debt and is aimed at helping Paytm fend off an influx of rivals, the person said. Talks are in their final stages but the terms could still change, the person added.
If a deal is finalized, Paytm could outstrip fellow high-profile Asian startups such as Grab and Gojek in valuation. Billionaire Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma is raising capital to protect the startup’s share of a potentially $1 trillion Indian payments market from newer entrants  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.-owned Flipkart’s PhonePe. Over the past year, a string of new apps have made payments increasingly easy, bringing discounts and cash bonuses to young, smartphone-savvy users.
Paytm remains the leader for now. The firm has in a decade become India’s biggest digital payments brand, attracting big names in investing from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) co-founder Ma and SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son to Warren Buffett. Sharma got a huge boost in 2016 after India’s government moved to eliminate most of the nation’s paper money in circulation in a bid to curb corruption. His startup, a pioneer in the country’s nascent field, saw tens of millions of consumers and hundreds of thousands of businesses sign up for digital services in a matter of months.
“India is a large market,” said Kunal Pande, head of financial services risk consulting at KPMG. “Digital payments adoption is growing quickly, yet there is room for massive growth as users get comfortable transacting digitally. The large business opportunity makes it attractive for both domestic startups and large global players.”

Paytm, which is also backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., declined to comment in response to emailed questions. Ant had no immediate comment when contacted, while Discovery Capital and SoftBank declined to comment.
Sharma is now extending his online empire into e-commerce and banking, even as others encroach on his turf. The Indian payments market remains a chaotic field where the rules are hazy on what players can offer, yet its promise has lured a string of competitors including Indian banks, its postal service and its richest man, Mukesh Ambani.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG now estimates that the Indian digital payments market will touch $1 trillion by 2023 from about $200 billion currently. It’s a market with huge potential: Cash still accounts for 70% of all Indian transactions by value, according to Credit Suisse, and neighboring China is far more advanced with a mobile payments market worth more than $5 trillion.
Ant Financial, China’s largest provider of internet financial services and one of Paytm’s earliest backers, has said it will continue investing in mobile-payment providers around the world to boost offshore revenue and buttress itself against rising competition and tighter regulation at home.
It’s not clear how much SoftBank would contribute, but the Japanese company is going through a rocky stretch.

Latitude’s offering would be Australia’s biggest this year, surpassing Magellan High Conviction Trust’s A$862 million IPO priced in August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies have raised A$5.5 billion via first-time share sales in Australia so far in 2019, compared to A$7.5 billion raised for the same period last year, the data shows.
The company is expected to wrap up gauging demand of institutional investors by the end of Tuesday, with trading scheduled to start on Friday.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., Macquarie Group Ltd. and UBS Group AG are lead managers of the deal."

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.6% and 1.0% respectively by 10:20 PM ET (02:20 GMT).
Stocks pulled back today after concerns emerged that the U.S.-China trade deal announced Friday might not be as solid as first thought.
U.S. President Donald Trump said late last week that the two nations reached a “very substantial phase one” agreement. However, a Bloomberg report said overnight that there are still a number of points not yet resolved.
China now wants to hold more negotiations this month before agreeing to signing the deal, the reports said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Not resolved were the key issues of access to Chinese markets and how to crack down on technology theft. China also wants Trump to scrap a planned tariff hike in December in addition to the hike scheduled for this week, according to the report.
On the data front, China’s producer price index fell 0.8% from a year earlier. Consumer price index rose 3% year-on-year during the month.

The sides have not reached a tentative agreement that would end the strike, but progress has been made and the United Auto Workers leadership will give an update at 10:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks continue. The meeting will take place in the Detroit building where GM is based, the people said.
""It's time to have a conversation one way or the other,"" one person said.
UAW and GM representatives said talks are scheduled again for Tuesday but declined further comment.
The UAW strike began on Sept. 16, with the union's members at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits.
After GM angered the UAW negotiators last week by appealing directly to workers and revealing details of the No. 1 U.S. automaker's latest offer, the sides have continued talking. The UAW made a counter offer to GM on Friday.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note on Monday that investors with whom he has spoken are ""comfortable"" with an extended strike and potential upfront multibillion-dollar impact as long as GM preserves its long-term financial and strategic flexibility. 

While a prolonged strike could trigger a credit rating agency downgrade on the company's debt, Jonas said most investors he has spoken with would accept that if the company retained an investment-grade rating.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 09:26PM ET</span>","Barneys nears bankruptcy deal with Authentic Brands, Saks owner: sources","By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. luxury department-store chain Barneys New York Inc is nearing a roughly $270 million deal with brand developer Authentic Brands Group that could lead to Barneys shops opening in Saks Fifth Avenue stores, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Without an offer from Authentic Brands, Barneys faced winding down its business entirely. It filed for bankruptcy protection in August, citing rent hikes as a factor in its decision.
Authentic Brands' offer for Barneys calls for a handful of its storied brick-and-mortar outposts to remain open, potentially including its flagship Madison Avenue store in Manhattan and its Beverly Hills, California, location, the sources said. 
Whether the existing retail locations remain open will depend on negotiations with landlords, they said. Barneys currently has seven physical retail locations remaining.
As part of the Authentic Brands deal, it will license the Barneys name to Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC), the owner of luxury department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, the sources said. The agreement would also allow Hudson's Bay to operate the Barneys website, one of the sources said. 
The expected deal with Authentic Brands sets a floor for bids in a bankruptcy-court auction scheduled for later this month, should any arise. A group led by fashion executive Sam Ben-Avraham has explored a bid for Barneys and is continuing to work an a potential deal that envisions keeping many of the retailer's current stores open, one of the sources said. 
Ben-Avraham did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. 
“We are encouraged by the strong buyer interest and recognition of the value in the Barneys assets and brand name,"" Barneys Chief Executive Officer Daniella Vitale said in a statement. 
""We continue to work diligently on the sale process with the goal of maximizing value and ensuring a long and successful future for the benefit of our employees, customers, vendors and other business partners.” 
Authentic Brands did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hudson's Bay declined to comment. The sources spoke on the condition they not be identified because the discussions are confidential. 
Authentic Brands is a prolific acquirer of labels, including Nine West. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on the value of Authentic Brands' bid for Barneys and its partnership with Hudson's Bay earlier on Monday.
Barneys is one of the most high-profile victims of the downturn in retail, and underscores how even luxury department stores are not immune from fierce competition with e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ), Toys “R” Us Inc and Gymboree Group Inc have also filed for bankruptcy in the last two years.
In addition to its upscale department stores and Freds restaurants, Barneys operates Barneys Warehouse outlets. The nearly 100-year-old retailer's most prominent locations include Beverly Hills, California; Chicago; Seattle; Boston; San Francisco; and Las Vegas.
Barneys made its name in the 1930s by placing women dressed in barrels outside beer halls in New York City, where they would hand out matchbooks advertising the store, according to the retailer’s website.

The store, now known for exclusive apparel made by designers such as  Burberry  Group Plc (L:BRBY), began as a destination for middle-class families. It transitioned to luxury fashion in the 1960s.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank will invest in Mexican used car platform Kavak, the group's chief operating officer Marcelo Claure said on Monday, adding to SoftBank's growing portfolio in Latin America.
""We are proud to join with and invest in Kavak Mexico,"" Claure, who oversees SoftBank Group Corp's Latin America investments, wrote on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD). ""The company is truly transforming the use of mobile devices in the automotive market in Mexico.""
Reuters reported in August that SoftBank was in advanced talks to invest in the three-year-old startup, after announcing earlier in the year a $5 billion fund to focus on Latin America.
Kavak Chief Executive Carlos Garcia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Kavak is SoftBank's second known investment in Mexico, after the conglomerate invested about $20 million in payments firm Clip.
Kavak is poised to complement SoftBank's other investments.
SoftBank led a roughly $17.6 million funding round in Brazilian used-car platform Volanty in August with Argentina's Kaszek Ventures, which is also an investor in Kavak.
SoftBank has also pumped $1.5 billion into China's Chehaoduo Group, which owns a leading used-car site."
230,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 05:39PM ET</span>","In new headache, WeWork says it found cancer-causing chemical in its phone booths","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cash-strapped WeWork, the office-sharing company that is trying to negotiate a financial lifeline, has a new problem that may prove costly. It has closed about 2,300 phone booths at some of its 223 sites in the United States and Canada after it says it discovered elevated levels of formaldehyde.
The company, which abandoned plans for an initial public offering last month after investors questioned its mounting losses and the way it was being run, said in an email to its tenants on Monday that the chemical could pose a cancer-risk if there is long-term exposure.
After a tenant complained of odor and eye irritation, WeWork began testing and based on the results took 1,600 phone booths out of service, the company said in the email to tenants, which it calls members.
An additional 700 booths are closed while more testing is conducted, it said. All the phone booths closed were installed over the past several months, WeWork said.
""The safety and well-being of our members is our top priority and we are working to remedy this situation as quickly as possible,"" WeWork said in a statement.
More costs are the last thing needed at the company, which some analysts say is fast running out of cash. WeWork declined to comment on the cost of testing and replacing the booths.
It is currently in talks for a multi-billion dollar rescue deal that could lead to its largest shareholder, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), taking control, two people familiar with the matter said. WeWork is also talking to JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) over a possible debt package, they said.
WeWork declined to identify the manufacturer of the phone booths.
""Long-term exposure to formaldehyde, such as that experienced by workers in jobs who experience high concentrations over many years, has been associated with certain types of cancers,"" WeWork told tenants in the email.
In 1987, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen under conditions of unusually high or prolonged exposure. Some studies since then suggested that formaldehyde exposure is associated with certain types of cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.
A tenant, who did not wish to be identified, said she was worried about the risk of cancer as she had spent hundreds of hours inside phone booths at a San Francisco WeWork that has the problem.
Phone booths are popular in WeWork's open-plan offices as they provide privacy and noise reduction, the tenant said.

232,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 05:14PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Big Banks Roll out Earnings 
Wall Street banks get the third-quarter earnings season underway in earnest on Tuesday, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) and   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) due to report. 
The plethora of earnings come amid a challenging environment for banks, with their net interest margin – the difference between the rates they charge on loans and the rates they pay on deposits and borrowings – coming under pressure amid recent Fed rate cuts.
Declining rates, however, have led to an increase in mortgage applications, which will likely prove a boon the banks’ mortgage portfolios.
JPMorgan is expected to report earnings of $2.45 per share on revenue of $28.5 billion, Citi earnings of $1.95 a share on revenue of $18.5 billion, Goldman Sachs earnings of $4.86 per share on revenue of $8.3 billion and Wells Fargo earnings of $1.22 a share on revenue of $21 billion. 
2. Fed Speak on Watch
There’s little top-tier the data on the economic calendar on Tuesday, but Federal Reserve speakers are on the agenda.
With the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting just weeks away, speeches from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic due at 9:00 AM ET (1300 GMT), Kansas City Fed President Esther George at 12:45 PM ET (16:45 GMT) and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly at 3:30 PM ET (19:30 GMT) will be parsed for clues on monetary policy.
The odds of an October rate cut stand at about 71%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
3. United Airlines Flies in Q3 Report
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) is set to report its third-quarter earnings results on Tuesday after the market closes. 
Ahead of the earnings print, the grounding of Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 Max aircraft has proved bittersweet for carriers like United that fly the much-maligned jets, which were involved in two deadly crashes. Carriers have had to fork out millions of dollars to maintain grounded planes. At the same time, they've seen capacity fall sharply, while the percentage of seats filled on flights globally rising sharply. 
United confirmed that the 737 Max would be removed from its schedule until Jan. 6.
United is expected to report earnings of $3.96 per share on revenue of $11.41 billion, up from $3.07 a share and $10.96 billion in revenue a year ago."
233,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>","Industrial earnings take center stage in third quarter with trade, economy in focus","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Profit reports from big manufacturers and other industrial firms arriving this week will provide investors with a crucial corporate gauge of the U.S. economy's health and the fallout from trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.
Third-quarter industrial sector earnings follow a closely watched survey earlier this month that showed U.S. manufacturing activity tumbled to a more than 10-year low in September. Industrial companies also are among those most at risk from the lingering trade dispute between the United States and China.
""This third quarter earnings season is going to be really important for industrials,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
""The industrial sector is really going to be watched closely for signs the overall economy is really slipping, and slipping enough to matter to stocks,"" Carlson said.
While the industrial sector (SPLRCI) represents slightly less than 10% of the overall S&P 500 (SPX) stock index, it can provide an outsized perspective on the economy. It includes major multi-national manufacturers as well as transportation companies whose results offer a barometer of economic activity.
The industrial stock sector has climbed over 19% this year, slightly ahead of the 18.5% gain for the overall S&P 500 (SPX). But while the broader market has hit all-time highs this year, the industrial sector has yet to breach its record peak from early 2018 and currently trades about 5% below it.
Industrial results start pouring in this week, including from diversified manufacturers Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) and  Textron Inc  (N:TXT), railroads  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) and CSX Corp (O:CSX), and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL).
Third-quarter earnings overall for industrial companies are expected to rise by just 0.7% from a year earlier, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. That would represent a better performance than for the full S&P 500 (SPX), for which earnings are expected to fall by 3.2%. 
Profit declines are expected for the tech (SPLRCT), energy (SPNY) and materials (SPLRCM) sectors, while companies overall are facing tough comparisons with results from a year ago, when they benefited from a big corporate tax cut.
'TOUGH TO BE AN INDUSTRIAL COMPANY RIGHT NOW'
Investors will also be keenly watching for financial forecasts for the fourth quarter and next year. Earnings in 2020 in the industrials sector are forecast to jump 16.2%, while the overall S&P 500 is seen rising 11.1%, according to Refinitiv.
Expectations for a sharp increase in overall earnings next year rests in part on the economy avoiding a recession, said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of equities and multi-asset strategies at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Investment Management in San Francisco.
For industrial companies, Aguilar said, a critical factor is whether they ramp up capital spending, which could depend on U.S.-China trade tensions yielding a clearer picture of the business environment. 
“The majority of these companies stopped their capital expenditures as a result of uncertainties because of the U.S.-China negotiations,"" Aguilar said. A rebound in capital spending could help restore earnings growth, he added.
U.S. and Chinese officials culminated talks in Washington last week with U.S. President Donald Trump outlining the first phase of a deal to end their trade war, including suspending a threatened tariff hike.
But officials on both sides said much more work was still needed to reach a final comprehensive agreement, and Trump left tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in place.
Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer with Abbot Downing in Minneapolis, said that Friday’s developments show some movement in the U.S.-China trade tensions, but uncertainty remains for companies.
As the industrial companies hold their quarterly conference calls, Schleif said she will be listening for commentary about the impact that has already been felt from the trade war, including whether companies have pulled shipments in to get ahead of tariffs, or if have they deferred capital spending or employment.
“Companies are being forced to reassess their supply chains, and that takes time. To the extent companies are making progress on diversifying that, it might lead to a muddy couple of quarters,” Schleif said. ""You have a lot of pieces at play that make it tough to be an industrial company right now.""

President Donald Trump announced a ""very substantial phase one"" agreement, but nothing was in writing yet. Bloomberg News reported Monday there are still a number of points not yet resolved.
The S&P 500 fell 0.14%, and the Dow Jones industrials slipped 0.11%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.10%.
While the Nasdaq managed to hold above 8,000 for a second day in a row, the S&P 500 finished under 3,000 for a 17th-straight day and is 2% below its July peak of 3,027.98. The Dow is 2.2% below its peak of 27,399. The Nasdaq is 3.5% below its all-time high.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) hit new highs. Apple briefly was the world's most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), but fell back into a tie by the close. Both ended down slightly with market caps of $1.066 trillion.
The wariness that pervaded the markets resulted in fewer stocks hitting new highs, compared with stocks hitting new lows.
Materials, consumer staples stocks and utilities were the weakest S&P 500 sectors. Real estate and financials were higher.
The third-quarter-earnings season begins Tuesday with reports from a host of financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). There are worries that slowing global growth will cut into profit growth.
Markets in U.S. government bonds were on hold Monday for Columbus Day.
Oil prices fell on the trade worries. West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.11 to $53.59 a barrel. Brent crude fell $1.16 to $1.6388. Gold moved up as some investors wanted safety.
Stocks had rallied strongly last week as Chinese and U.S. negotiators met in Washington, D.C. and Trump had Vice Premier Liu He, the leader of the Chinese team, to a White House meeting on Friday afternoon.
But a 507-point gain for the Dow on Friday was cut by nearly 40% in the last half hour of trading as investors sold the news of the projected deal. It included some relief on tariffs set to be imposed this week and a Chinese agreement to buy $40 billion to $60 billion in U.S. farm products, especially pork and and soybeans.
Not resolved were the key issues of access to Chinese markets and how to crack down on technology theft. And China wants a tariff imposition, set for December, canceled.
Trump Administration officials said they were hopeful the issues could be resolved soon.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) were among the top S&P 500 performers on the day. 
Fiber-laser make IPG Photonics (NASDAQ:IPGP) and fertilizer makers CF Industries (NYSE:CF) and Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers. "

(Reuters) - ProPetro Holding Corp (N:PUMP) this month cut about 150 workers, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, the latest sign of growing trouble in the oilfield services sector as U.S. shale producers reduce drilling.
The job cuts reflect slowing shale activity due to weak prices for oil and gas, and producers exhausting their spending budgets for the year, one of the people said.
Midland, Texas-based ProPetro said last week it would cut the number of hydraulic fracturing fleets operated this quarter by as much as 28%, far surpassing analysts' expectations. The fleets send water, sand and chemicals at high pressures underground to release trapped oil and gas.
The layoffs represent a roughly 9.5% reduction in staff, based on the company's latest annual filing.
The job cuts came amid a board committee's fact-finding review of past accounting practices, which has prompted a shake-up of top management and required senior executives to reimburse the company roughly $370,000.
No senior executives were affected by the job cuts, which were unrelated to the accounting probe, the person said.
 Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) said last week it was cutting about 650 jobs in Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and North Dakota as oilfield activity slowed. Most of the affected Halliburton employees were offered a chance to relocate to areas with stronger anticipated activity.
Shares of ProPetro were off 0.8% at $9.35 shortly before the close of trading. The company has lost nearly 25% of its market value so far this year."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork has opened almost as many new locations in the last 3-1/2 months as it did in the whole first half of this year, likely accelerating the speed with which the office-sharing company is burning through cash as increasingly hard-nosed investors scrutinize its prospects for going public.
According to a Reuters analysis of information on the company's website, WeWork had 622 sites open in 123 cities on Oct. 10. That compares with its footprint of 528 locations in 111 cities on June 30 that was outlined in the prospectus for its abandoned IPO.
The website also identifies 89 sites as ""coming soon"" and 117 sites as ""just announced"" - all new locations that are yet to open.
Altogether, WeWork says on the website that it will soon have 845 locations in 125 cities, but it is unclear whether all those will still open. A WeWork spokesman declined to comment on its plans. 
The quickening pace of new office openings adds to the risks for WeWork, a company that has created a global brand for its shared workspace concept but was forced to halt plans to go public on Sept. 30 because of investor concerns about how it was valued and whether its business model is sustainable.
The company is now cutting back, including laying off some employees and closing or selling entities that are not essential to its core operations as it seeks to avoid running out of cash. On Friday, WeWork said it will shut down its WeGrow private school in New York City as it pares peripheral operations.
The 97 new locations WeWork added in the first half of this year on average cost $2.63 million each in design and construction costs, up 38% from the average $1.91 million that 82 openings each cost in the first half of 2018, according to the IPO document. It added 94 new locations between the start of July and Oct. 10, according to its website.
Whether the average size of a new location in the latest burst of openings is similar to those in the first half of this year is unclear. A WeWork spokesman declined to comment.
""Investors don't want to invest in a company with such a high cash-burn rate,"" said Gina Szymanski, a portfolio manager at real estate-focused AEW Capital Management LP in Boston. ""They have got to slow their growth down and focus a little bit more on profitability.""
BLEEDING CASH
WeWork has only about $2.5 billion of cash on hand as of June 30, according to the prospectus that was issued in August. 
It will run out of money in the second quarter of next year if the company's current trajectory doesn't change, according to research by AllianceBernstein. Some media reports in recent days said it may run out of cash before the end of the year without a new lifeline.
As well as substantial costs for opening new sites, WeWork's current operations are also still big loss makers. In the year to June 30, its expenses were $2.9 billion and revenue just $1.54 billion.
WeWork has been locked in negotiations since last week with its largest shareholder, Softbank Group Corp (T:9984), over a new $1 billion investment to help the company go through a major restructuring, according to sources familiar with discussions.
SoftBank has prepared a financing package that would give it control over WeWork and dilute the influence of co-founder Adam Neumann, said a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified.
IFR reported banking sources as saying on Friday that WeWork is in talks with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) to seek $1.75 billion in bank financing that would provide it with enough liquidity to see it through to the end of the year. Chase is in talks with other banks to syndicate the letter of credit, it said.
In addition, WeWork is in discussions with banks to issue $3.25 billion in secured and unsecured bonds with warrants, IFR added.
WeWork has certainly slowed new leasing in response to investor feedback, said Szymanski, citing AEW's analysis of WeWork's market presence.
The leases for many of the recently opened sites would likely have been signed before August, which was when the company first became a punching bag for investors and analysts critical of how it was being valued and run.

WeWork owner, The We Company, said in the IPO document that it has mitigated expenses by refining its design and construction processes, which included investments in new technology to help WeWork quickly and efficiently develop a workspace. The new technology wasn't defined and the company declined to comment.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 01:56PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Deutsche Bank took years to flag suspect Danske money flows - source,"By Tom Sims and John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT/TALLINN (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  did not disclose more than one million suspect money transfers with  Danske Bank  until February, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, about five years after a whistleblower flagged suspicious transactions at Danske.
Deutsche (DE:DBKGn) sent alerts about the suspect money flows involving the Danish bank to Germany's money laundering data authority and state prosecutors, the person said, prompting investigators to seek more information from Deutsche.
Prosecutors are now investigating whether staff or management at Deutsche sanctioned the transactions, and whether they subsequently tried to cover them up, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Deutsche did not comment on the time taken to flag the transactions to authorities, which has previously not been reported, but said it ended its relationship with Danske in 2015 and had strengthened its anti-money laundering controls.
Danske Bank (CO:DANSKE) was ejected from Estonia this year after admitting 200 billion euros ($220 billion) of suspicious money flowed through its branch there between 2007 and 2015.
Deutsche was dragged into the scandal because it processed the bulk of the transactions for the Danish bank, leading German prosecutors to visit Deutsche's headquarters last month with police and a search warrant.
Asked about the case, Deutsche said in an emailed statement that it ""remains committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations.""
""We have considerably increased staff numbers in Anti-Financial Crime and more than tripled our staff since 2015. We invested since 2016 700 million euros in upgrading our key control functions there.""
Following the information from Deutsche, German prosecutors visited their counterparts in Estonia in recent weeks to investigate the suspect money flows further, the person said.
Prosecutors are now investigating a small fraction of the 1.1 million transfers flagged by Deutsche, involving Russia and former Soviet states in 2014 and 2015, the person added.
If investigators find that Deutsche staff or management sanctioned and covered up its involvement in the suspicious transactions, those bankers or the group itself could face criminal prosecution, the person said.
That would deal another blow to Deutsche's reputation and a setback to Chief Executive Christian Sewing's drive to turn around Germany's biggest lender.
INVESTIGATIONS
Once Germany's flagship bank on Wall Street, Deutsche has been shrinking to try to return to sustainable profitability and has been hit by a string of penalties, including a $7.2 billion fine in 2017 for selling toxic U.S. mortgages before the financial crash.
Now, it faces a series of investigations, including one over sham trades to move hundreds of billions of roubles out of Russia, as it struggles to regain the trust of investors, staff and politicians in Germany.
Deutsche is one of a number of large international banks to become embroiled in a money laundering scandal in the Baltics, former Soviet satellite states on the edge of Europe that often acted as a staging post for money leaving Russia for the west.
A spokesman for Deutsche said it ended the relationship with Danske in 2015 after identifying ""an increase in suspicious transactions from Danske clients over an extended period of time.""
But it is unclear why Deutsche did not report the suspicious fund transfers until earlier this year.
Germany's Financial Intelligence Unit, which gathers the so-called suspicious activity reports, declined to comment.
A person familiar with the matter said the time taken to report the transactions was unlikely to lead to a penalty from German financial regulator BaFin because Deutsche's role as a so-called correspondent bank was secondary to Danske."
240,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 01:39PM ET</span>","CannTrust to destroy C$77 million worth of plants, inventory to regain compliance","(Reuters) - Cannabis producer  CannTrust  Holdings Inc (TO:TRST) (N:CTST) said on Monday it would destroy about C$12 million ($9 million) worth of plants and about C$65 million worth of inventory, as the company's new management seeks to regain full regulatory compliance.
The company's U.S.-listed shares rose 24% after the announcement.
Health Canada had frozen over half of CannTrust's stock of marijuana and the company had earlier estimated its inventory and assets impacted by regulatory issues to be about C$51 million.
The Canadian health regulator canceled CannTrust's license to produce and sell cannabis in September, months after it found the company was illegally cultivating pot.
Since the company was found to be growing illegal pot back in July, it has fired its chief executive officer, disclosed a regulatory investigation, and said its results may have to be restated.
The company said on Monday it would not challenge the regulator's suspension order.
The Ontario-based company said its plan to regain regulatory compliance includes measures to recover cannabis that was not authorized by CannTrust's license and improve its inventory tracking.
CannTrust will provide a detailed plan to Health Canada on or before Oct. 21.

Wong said that while chip stocks will continue to face headwinds, shares of Xilinx, which makes programmable chips known as Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, reflect the cautious outlook in the industry after its recent plunge. 
“We believe that many risks remain for U.S. semiconductor companies including uncertainties related to U.S./China trade issues and U.S. action against specific Chinese companies such as Huawei,” Wong wrote in a note to clients. “However, in our view, Xilinx’s stock price and estimates have, in recent months, adjusted to reflect these risks.”
The U.S., however, temporarily lifted the ban on U.S. companies, allowing them to work with Huawei until August. The ban was then extended to November.
The chip company’s continued growth in the face of these headwinds was also cited as a supportive factor.

Addressing reporters in his first news conference since the U.S. abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal last year, Rouhani said officials in Tehran had seen footage of the incident and it was likely that several rockets were aimed at the tanker. He stopped short of assigning blame, but the vessel was sailing near the Saudi port of Jeddah at the time of the attack.
“This wasn’t a terrorist move, nor was it carried out by an individual. It was carried out by a government,” Rouhani said, adding that officials were also assessing rocket fragments.
Iranian Oil Tanker Attacked as Middle East Tensions Remain High
The Gulf has seen a surge in tit-for-tat attacks on oil facilities, drones and shipping traffic since Donald Trump’s administration tightened sanctions on Iran’s oil exports earlier this year. The measures are part of Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy aimed at forcing Iran to curb its ballistic missile program and support for proxy militia around the Middle East, but have been met with defiance by the Iranian government, which has, instead, rolled back its own compliance with the nuclear accord.
Although all sides have said they want to avoid war, repeated incidents pose a growing risk to supplies from the world’s most important oil-producing region.
The attack on the Sabiti tanker came weeks after a drone strike on a major Saudi oil facility which the kingdom blamed on Iran. Iranian officials have said they weren’t involved in the attack, which rattled global oil markets, and was claimed by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen."

251,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>",Turkey says Kurdish forces emptied Islamic State prison in northeast Syria,"By Ali Kucukgocmen
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Monday Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters had emptied a jail holding Islamic State prisoners in a part of Syria where Ankara is mounting an offensive, and that the prisoners there had been abducted.
Turkey launched a cross-border operation against the YPG militia in northeastern Syria last week, after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to withdraw forces from two posts in the area in a move that drew strong international criticism.
The Turkish assault has prompted alarm that it could allow Islamic State (IS) militants to escape Kurdish-run prisons in northern Syria and regroup. Ankara has dismissed those concerns.
Turkey's stated objective is to clear its southern frontier region of the YPG, which it views as a terrorist organization, and form a ""safe zone"" 30 km (20 miles) into Syrian territory where it wants to settle millions of Syrian refugees. Ankara also pledged to take responsibility for IS militants within the ""safe zone"", but said it would not be accountable for others.
Speaking to reporters in Ankara on Monday, Akar said the YPG had emptied the only Islamic State prison that Turkish forces had so far reached in the envisaged ""safe zone"" area, and that the inmates had already been removed.
""As you know, there is a prison issue on this Daesh (Islamic State) topic. We are determined to show the utmost effort on these prisons. However, there was only one prison in our region, a Daesh prison,"" Akar said.
""When we went there, we saw that it had been emptied by the YPG and the Islamic State militants there had been abducted. We determined this through photographs and film, talked to our counterpart, and will continue to do so,"" he added.
Akar did not say how many prisoners were believed to have been taken from the jail, nor did he elaborate on who had taken the prisoners and where. There was no immediate YPG comment.
Trump, providing no evidence, tweeted on Monday that Kurdish forces might be freeing IS prisoners deliberately to lure U.S. troops back into the region. Escaped fighters could be ""easily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly"", Trump said.
Later on Monday, Turkish media broadcast footage of what it said was the prison emptied by the YPG in central Tel Abyad, along the Turkish border. The footage showed Turkish soldiers roaming through an empty building with jail cells built inside.
The fighting has raised Western concerns that the Kurds, holding large tracts of northern Syria previously controlled by Islamic State, would be unable to keep thousands of jihadists in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.
The region's Kurdish-led administration said 785 IS-affiliated foreigners escaped a camp at Ain Issa at the weekend. The UK-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing sources in the camp, said around 100 people had escaped.
President Tayyip Erdogan dismissed the reports on Sunday, saying that accounts of escapes by Islamic State prisoners were ""disinformation"" aimed at provoking the West.

More than half of UK companies reported a year-on-year decline in the number of analysts covering them and 38% said there had been a fall in the quality of research, Citigate Dewe Rogerson's annual survey of nearly 500 investor relations officers at global companies.
The EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) implemented in January 2018 forced banks and brokers to charge investors for equity research, which has meant asset managers are unwilling to pay as much for research.
Market regulators in the UK and France have raised concerns over the past year about the impact of a subsequent decline in research coverage and trading liquidity for smaller firms.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) concluded last month that the reforms have cut the cost of stock and bond research, saving millions of pounds for investors without materially affecting coverage of smaller firms.
The impact was less pronounced in Europe, according to the financial communications' survey.
Almost 40% of investor relations managers of European companies, excluding the UK, said there was a decline in the number of analysts covering their companies but only half of these managers said the coverage deteriorated year on year."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF and Saudi Arabia's SALIC have signed an agreement to team up in searching for investment projects in the Russian agricultural sector, RDIF said in a statement on Monday.
President Vladimir Putin visited Riyadh on Monday for the first time in over a decade, seeking to capitalize on growing influence borne of military advances in Syria, strong ties with regional rivals and cooperation on energy policy.
SALIC - Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Co - and RDIF will jointly search for investment projects in the Russian agricultural and livestock industries, RDIF said.
""I am confident we will begin working on our first joint projects in the near future,"" Kirill Dmitriev, RDIF chief executive, said in the statement.
SALIC, formed in 2011 to secure food supplies for the kingdom through mass production and foreign investments, has been looking at expanding in Russia and Ukraine, both major Black Sea grain producers and exporters, for several years.
SALIC is considering investing in Russian agriculture projects near the Black Sea, the RIA news agency quoted SALIC Managing Director Khaled al-Aboodi as saying.
""We believe that the Black Sea region of Russia is a very important region, and we want to invest there,"" he said.
In RDIF's statement, al-Aboodi said that ""RDIF is the natural partner of SALIC in entering the Russian market"".
A year ago, SALIC agreed to buy Ukrainian farming company Mriya, which defaulted on its debts in 2014 and then went through a debt restructuring.
In 2017, Russian conglomerate Sistema (MM:AFKS) said SALIC would consider investing in RZ Agro, a Russian grain producer owned by Sistema and members of the Louis-Dreyfus family, but the deal has not yet happened.
""There is a lot of politics in their deals, while the improvement in our relationship is relatively new,"" Dmitry Rylko, head of agriculture consultancy IKAR, said when asked why SALIC had not yet bought anything in Russia.
The cooperation agreement between RDIF and SALIC comes less than two months after the kingdom agreed to relax specifications for wheat imports, opening the door to Black Sea imports.
Russia, the world's largest wheat exporter, had long been seeking access to the Saudi market.
Russia also wants Saudi Arabia to open its market to Russian meat, Interfax news agency quoted Russian agriculture minister Dmitry Patrushev as saying on Monday.
Russia and Saudi Arabia also signed a memorandum on expansion of mutual food exports on Monday, the Kremlin said.

254,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 10:31AM ET</span>","Renova Energia CFO out after Light divestiture, failure to sell Brazil wind farms","By Tatiana Bautzer and Gabriela Mello
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The CFO of Brazilian renewable energy firm Renova Energia SA (SA:RNEW11) resigned and a key shareholder gave up its stake after failed talks to sell heavily indebted wind farm projects.
Renova Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Corrêa de Barros will temporarily assume the responsibilities of outgoing Chief Financial Officer Claudio Ribeiro, the company said on Monday.
Separately on Monday, Renova shareholder Light SA (SA:LIGT3) said it had sold its 17.17% stake in the firm to an investment fund for a symbolic value of 1 real.
The exits of Light and Ribeiro follow years of unsuccessful talks to sell Renova's wind farm projects, which have racked up debt and raised concerns about their timely completion.
Negotiations to sell the projects to  AES Tiete Energia SA  (SA:TIET11), a subsidiary of AES Corp (N:AES), broke down last week after six months of discussions.
Renova has been trying to sell some of its wind projects for more than two years. Before AES, the company was in talks with Canada's  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc (TO:BAMa), which ended with no agreement in July 2018.
BTG Pactual analysts said ""construction related risks"" seemed to be the reason for AES Tiete to walk away from the deal, citing meetings with executives.
The result is negative for Light and state-controlled power holding company Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais (SA:CMIG4) (Cemig), said the analysts led by BTG Pactual's Joao Pimentel in a note to clients written before Light sold its stake.
Cemig had a debt exposure of 768 million reais ($186 million) to Renova. Light had 253 million reais. Analysts say that if no other buyer shows up, the only solution would be for Cemig and Light to step up and finish the projects.
But Light has signaled the intention of not taking over with the sale of the stake to a fund.
The projects owe 960 million reais ($233 million) to state development bank BNDES, analysts said."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week with a scramble to recover premarket losses that had been caused by a report suggesting China will seek more concessions from the U.S. before it signs the modest handshake deal it made last week with the U.S.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reassured CNBC earlier Monday that the two sides have an understanding, while Hu Xijin, the editor of China’s English-language mouthpiece, Global Times, also tried to downplay concerns.

“Based on what I know, China-U.S. trade talks made breakthrough last week and the two sides have the strong will to reach a final deal. Initial statement of the Chinese side is moderate,” Hu said via Twitter. ""This is China's habit. It doesn't mean China's real attitude is not positive.”
Even so, markets reacted negatively at the sight of even vague signs of backtracking from what was, in any event, a minimalist deal that did little to resolve the underlying conflict between the two countries.
After falling as much as 0.5% in premarket, the Dow eked out a gain of 22 points, less than 0.1%, by 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT). The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were both still down 0.1% 

Among individual movers,   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) was among the biggest gainers, after an analyst upgrade. Shares hit an all-time high.

  Parsley Energy   (NYSE:PE) fell 13% after agreeing to buy fellow oil producer Jagged Peak Energy (NYSE:JAG) in an all-stock deal valued at around $2.27 billion including debt. 
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell 4.3% after an underwhelming initiation by   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) at market perform. Wells’ target price of $125 is below the current price of $126.20.

Cyber-security firm Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) also fell some 7% after   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) joined Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in downgrading it to a sell.
Elsewhere, crude oil prices tumbled as the lack of clear progress on the trade front shook traders’ faith in the ability of producers to avoid a fresh glut next year. U.S. crude futures fell over 2% to $53.24 by 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).

256,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>",Turkey Markets Sink as Sanctions Risk Swamps Banks’ Lira Defense,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkish markets tumbled amid mounting fears that punitive measures from Washington could deal a fresh blow to the Turkish economy. The lira joined the retreat, despite efforts by state banks to support the currency.
The lira broke past the 5.93-per-dollar mark even as lenders sold more than $1 billion worth of foreign exchange, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because because the information isn’t public. Last week, state banks sold the equivalent of at least $3.5 billion worth to support the currency, three people said.
Stocks plunged more than 5%, two-year domestic bond yields soared as much as 66 basis points and the lira’s one-month implied yield was poised for its biggest jump since March. Room for more interest-rate cuts appears to have vanished, with one-year cross-currency swaps touching 16.6%, above the central bank’s one-week repo rate.
The latest turmoil comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington is ready to sanction Turkey in response to its military incursion in northeast Syria, raising the prospect of another market rout. “Big sanctions on Turkey coming!” Trump said in a separate tweet on Monday, giving way to another leg lower for the lira.
Turkey relies heavily on foreign capital inflows and is still struggling after a recession fueled by a currency crisis last year, which was partly precipitated by American sanctions.
Meanwhile, European Union foreign ministers pledged to restrict arms sales to Turkey over its military operation in Syria, calling for an immediate halt to the incursion.
The lira was trading 0.8% weaker at 5.9321 per dollar as of 3:03 p.m. in Istanbul, it’s one-month forward implied rate was close to 20% and the yield on two-year local-currency bonds trimmed its gain to 15.84%.
The threats of more sanctions were the latest in a string of warnings from U.S. officials this month, who have balked at the Turkish campaign against American-backed Kurdish militants. On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. could shut down all dollar business with Turkey. Last week, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a bipartisan bill to penalize Turkey in response to the incursion.
In a move that risks further muddying the picture, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad sent troops to the country’s northeast after Kurdish fighters turned to Damascus for support. Earlier this month, Trump ordered remaining U.S. forces in northern Syria to withdraw in the face of a Turkish advance."

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Thoma Bravo is adding Sophos Group (L:SOPH) to its cybersecurity stable, announcing on Monday a buyout deal that values the British maker of antivirus and encryption products at about $3.8 billion.
The takeover price of 583 pence per share represented a 37% premium from Sophos's closing price on Friday and Sophos shares surged nearly 38% on news of the deal.
Sophos, whose customers include  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Toshiba Corp (T:6502), listed in 2015 at 225 pence per share and has seen its market value double since then, despite a tough 2018.
Thoma Bravo's move for Sophos trails several other buyout deals by U.S. funds drawn toward the UK as the pound weakened ahead of Brexit.
Sophos Group shareholders will get $7.40 per share in cash, which is 583 pence per share.
Shares of rival Avast (L:AVST) also rose after the Sophos deal was announced.
Sophos CEO Kris Hagerman told Reuters that his company had first been approached by Thoma Bravo in June.
""The (Sophos) board ultimately concluded that this offer and the acquisition can accelerate Sophos' progress in next-generation cybersecurity,"" Hagerman said.
CYBERSECURITY MARKET EVOLVING
Private equity funds are increasingly targeting listed companies in Britain. Advent recently offered to buy engineering firm  Cobham  (L:COB) while an investment consortium led by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) looks to take control of Madame Tussaud's owner Merlin (L:MERL).
Thoma Bravo, which raised billions for its latest private equity fund this year, had been targeting the cyber security sector. Late last year, it bought Imperva and another cyber security firm called Veracode from Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO).
In 2017, it purchased Sophos' close competitor Barracuda Networks, which manages data security over the cloud.
""The global cybersecurity market is evolving rapidly, driven by significant technological innovation, as cyber threats to business increase in scope and complexity,"" Seth Boro, managing partner, at Thoma Bravo said in a statement on Monday.
Analyst Neil Campling of Mirabaud Securities said Sophos could be ""valuably merged with Barracuda to focus on the SMB (small and medium businesses) opportunities"".
Sophos's Hagerman said there was a transition to next-generation security products such as machine-learning and APIs, with the cloud at the heart of that transition for products to actively communicate with each other and manage threat responses.
Hagerman noted that Sophos' growth in recent years has fundamentally been due to its security solutions that can be deployed to any size organization.
Analysts at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) cautioned investors about Thoma Bravo's dollar-denominated deal for Sophos, saying ""but should a Brexit deal be agreed, a rally in sterling could leave investors out of pocket.""
J.P. Morgan Cazenove, Lazard, and UBS AG London Branch were Sophos' financial advisers and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) advised Thoma Bravo."

Flight attendants and pursers at Lufthansa's largest hubs, Frankfurt and Munich, have been called upon to take part in the walkout, which is scheduled from 0600 to 1100 CEST (0400-0900 GMT), UFO deputy chief Daniel Flohr said in a video message https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrSfguFYw9c&feature=youtu.be released on YouTube.
Lufthansa called the planned strike illegal and said it would try to offer its full flight schedule.
Germany's biggest airline, which warned on profits earlier this year, is cutting costs to cope with tough price competition and high fuel prices in a sector which has seen a string of smaller airlines go bust.
UFO's Flohr said additional calls for strikes at the group's five airlines were possible at any time and the union would discuss unlimited walkouts next week.
He said UFO was demanding from Lufthansa's namesake airline a 1.8% pay increase over a half-year period.

At other airlines of the German group, the union is in conflict over issues including pay as well as part-time work and pension plans, Flohr said.

“I expect there will be a deal,” Mnuchin said Monday on CNBC television. The sides made “substantial progress” last week in negotiations and Mnuchin said he expects President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to finalize the accord at a summit in Chile next month.
Bloomberg News reported earlier Monday that China wants further talks as soon as the end of October to hammer out the details of the “phase one” trade deal touted Friday by Trump before Xi agrees to sign it, according to people familiar with the matter.
Asked about reports that a deal might be further off, Mnuchin said he “wouldn’t pay too much attention” to what he called speculation.
The details of the verbal agreement reached in Washington last week between the two nations remain unclear. While Trump hailed an increase in agricultural purchases as “the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,” China’s state-run media only said the two sides “agreed to make joint efforts toward eventually reaching an agreement.”
Mnuchin repeatedly said on CNBC that the countries have a “fundamental agreement” even though the wording and details are still to be worked out."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira slid 0.8% on Monday in the face of U.S. and European threats of sanctions and embargoes, though skeptical traders said it would weaken much further if Western allies turned words into action over Turkey's incursion in Syria. 
Underlining doubts over the threats, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan was quoted as dismissing them as ""quips"" on Sunday, while the country's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva called a possible European Union arms embargo ""a joke."" 
In turn on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Twitter that ""big sanctions on Turkey are coming.""
The lira  slipped to 5.9315 against the U.S. dollar, its weakest since May 30. 
Turkish stocks and bonds also tumbled, with the main share index at its lowest level since June. The cost of insuring government bonds against default hit a six-week high. 
The currency, which suffered a crisis last year that knocked Turkey's economy into recession, has fallen more than 12% so far this year and 5% this month alone as Ankara and Syrian allies attacked Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria. [nL5N26Z26G]
The intervention, now in its sixth day, has drawn international condemnation, including threats from Trump to ""obliterate"" Turkey's economy with ""powerful"" sanctions. 
But many traders and investors said in effect they would believe it when they saw it, especially after U.S. threats earlier this year to sanction Turkey over buying Russian S-400 missile defenses did not materialize. 
""After being led up the hill and down on the S-400 issue, markets don't really believe that Trump has the stomach to sanction Turkey in any meaningful way,"" said Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management. 
FRAGILE ECONOMY
Economists said sanctions could set back Turkey's economic recovery, especially if a prolonged battle puts pressure on Turkey's trade ties with Europe.
Turkey's imports and exports amounted to 155 billion euros ($171 billion) with the EU in 2017, compared to $20 billion with the United States. Before the military incursion, Turkey and the United States said they aimed to boost that to $100 billion in annual trade. 
Inanc Sozer, chief economist at Turkey Macroview Consulting, said given the sanctions threat he would consider zero economic growth this year a ""success"". 
""But if the U.S. implements sanctions next year, we will be talking about a contraction again, which may be around 5%,"" he said. 
""The economy is very fragile and its financial markets have been weak since last year. Sanctions may create a feedback loop that would put manufacturers under severe pressure,"" Sozer said. 
Turkey's calendar-adjusted industrial output, largely viewed as a pre-cursor to growth figures, declined 3.6% year-on-year in August, more than expected, data showed on Monday.
Data from IHS Markit showed Turkish five-year credit default swaps (CDS) - which investors and traders use as protection - rose 11 basis points to 404 basis points.
Among Turkish stocks, an index of banks plunged 8%.
SANCTIONS, EMBARGOES
On Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that Trump had authorized ""very powerful"" sanctions targeting Turkey, to which Turkey said it would retaliate in kind.
But in Istanbul on Sunday, Erdogan was quoted as saying at a closed-door meeting with some media outlets that he expected such talk. ""Of course things such as economic sanctions are being mentioned. Truthfully, I see those as quips along this process,"" he said, according to the state-run Anadolu agency. 
The EU has condemned Turkey's military attack. On Monday France's foreign minister said it must call for ""a firm position"" establishing an arms embargo.
In Geneva, Turkish ambassador Sadik Arslan told reporters: ""That arms embargo is a joke,"" adding Turkey has ""enough of an industrial base to substitute them with our much better systems."" 
The Turkish incursion came after Trump spoke by phone with Erdogan and then decided to withdraw some U.S. troops from the region. On Sunday, Washington said it would withdraw the remaining 1,000 U.S. troops in the face of the expanding Turkish offensive.
It was unclear exactly what sanctions are in a U.S. Treasury order drafted last week. But Senate and House lawmakers have proposed targeting Turkish individuals, banks and its defense sector. 
The ""news flow regarding the military operation in Syria, arms embargo decision from EU and probability of sanctions from U.S., are creating uncertainty for investors"", Oyak Securities said in a note to clients.
Separately, Turkey's TBB banking association said it would launch a restructuring program that would benefit large companies with loans of more than 25 million lira ($4.23 million). 

The move comes as Turkey's economy shows signs of recovery from recession, which left its companies saddled with foreign currency debt.

Total agreed to purchase a 37.4% stake in India’s Adani Gas Ltd., a distributor of the fuel that’s developing import terminals and a national chain of vehicle-filling outlets. The deal gives the French company a footprint in a market where annual liquefied natural gas demand will hit 28 million tons by 2023, making it the fourth-biggest importer of the fuel, according to BloombergNEF.
Total is the latest energy major seeking to expand in India, where population growth and economic development are luring some of the biggest oil and gas producers. In August, Reliance Industries Ltd. said Saudi Arabian Oil Co. may buy 20% of its oil-to-chemicals business at an enterprise value of $75 billion.
“Energy needs in India are immense,” Total Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement. “The natural gas market in India will have a strong growth and is an attractive outlet.”
Total has recently made several investments to beef up its presence in LNG. It agreed to take over a Mozambique LNG project earlier this year as part of a deal for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).’s assets in Africa. It has also absorbed Engie SA’s upstream assets, boosted its investment in Tellurian Inc. and its Driftwood LNG venture, and plans to sanction a new gas-export project in Papua New Guinea.
“Total’s investment in Adani is undoubtedly a show of faith in India’s gas demand growth,” Nicholas Browne, a Singapore-based analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd., said in an email. Gas consumption will almost double to 106 billion cubic meters by 2030, with LNG meeting about 55% of the demand growth, according to the consultant.
Adani, whose shares jumped as much as 18% and headed for the highest close since July, is developing the Mundra and Dhamra LNG import terminals in India. It plans to expand its distribution network in the next decade to about 6 million homes and 1,500 retail outlets for natural gas vehicles.
Total said the acquisition will cost about $600 million taking into account its divestment of another Indian LNG terminal earlier this year.
Total will make the purchase through a tender offer to public shareholders for as much as 25.2% and the residual shares from the Adani family, Adani Gas said in a statement to stock exchanges. The Times of India reported in June that Total was close to buying a 30% stake in Adani for more than $800 million."

European banks are grappling with the consequences of the European Central Bank's September decision to cut its key deposit rate further into negative territory, making it tough for banks to earn money from their traditional lending business.
UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier last week said the bank was working on measures to pass on the European Central Bank's negative rates to customers holding more than 100,000 euros in their accounts.
Italian banking unions were critical of Mustier's announcement which they described as ""reckless"".
Consumer group Codacons said it would fight banks in the courts that planned to hit customers with negative returns on deposits.
A UniCredit spokesman said the negative rates would only apply to clients with more than 1 million euros in their bank accounts, meaning less than 0.1% of the bank's client base. And customers will be offered a number of alternatives.
""We will offer as an alternative investments in money market funds targeting positive returns, with no fees charged,"" the spokesman said.
""For ... deposits with a balance in excess of the 1 million euro threshold, ad hoc measures will be discussed with clients to take into account the extraordinary changes in the macroeconomic environment.""
Mustier, speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the European Banking Federation earlier this month, urged the ECB to take action to reduce the impact of negative interest rates on banks, recommending general charges for cash deposits.
Italy has high levels of private savings, where people have been increasing current account deposits this year to reach 1.17 trillion euros in August, according to Italy's central bank.
Banks in Italy are currently free to charge for cash deposits, but most avoid doing so, fearing depositors would transfer their savings to other lenders.
Italian banks are taking countermeasures against negative rates through fees,  Banca Generali  (MI:BGN) CEO Gian Maria Mossa said in an interview published on Monday.
""UniCredit had the courage to stir up a debate which was already taking place abroad, for example in Switzerland ... (but) I don't think in the end single banks will apply negative rates,"" he told daily La Stampa.
UBS (S:UBSG) in July said it would impose from November a negative interest rate of 0.75% on wealthy clients who deposit more than 2 million Swiss francs ($2 million) with its Swiss bank.
In Denmark, which was among the first countries to introduce negative rates, Spar Nord (CO:SPNO) said earlier this month it would impose negative rates on large deposits by private clients, making it the third Danish bank to do.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian refiners have stopped buying Malaysian palm oil for shipment in November and December fearing New Delhi could raise import taxes or enforce other measures to curb imports from the Southeast Asian nation, five traders told Reuters on Monday.
Lower purchases by India, the biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil so far in 2019, could lead to higher inventories and put pressure on Malaysian palm oil prices . It could also help rival Indonesia increase its shipments to India.
India is considering restricting imports of some products from Malaysia including palm oil after Kuala Lumpur criticized New Delhi for its actions in Kashmir, Reuters reported on Friday.
India's government has not made any public remarks about Malaysian palm oil. The Commerce Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
""We need clarity before doing business with Malaysia,"" said a Mumbai-based dealer.
His trading firm was about to buy 5,000 tonnes palm oil on Friday from Malaysia for November shipment but decided not to proceed after reading about potential disruptions. 
If the government did not provide clarity in coming days, the trader said he would buy from Indonesia.
Malaysian palm oil futures slumped for a second straight day on Monday due to concerns about the possible Indian import restrictions and weakness in related edible oils. 
""Traders are confused on both sides. They don't know how to plan their shipments,"" said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of Sunvin Group, a Mumbai-based vegetable oil importer.
""On the cautious side, buyers are preferring Indonesian shipments to avoid any possible impact of higher duties,"" he said.
Palm oil accounts for nearly two-thirds of India's total edible oil imports. India buys more than 9 million tonnes of palm oil annually, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia.
In the first nine months of 2019, India bought 3.9 million tonnes of Malaysian palm oil, with monthly imports of about 433,000 tonnes, Malaysian Palm Oil Board data showed.
Most October import contracts have already been signed, said a Mumbai-based dealer with another trading firm, adding imports would plunge from November as traders shunned new contracts with Malaysian sellers.
Malaysia traditionally cornered the bulk of India's refined palm oil shipments, while Indonesia dominated crude palm oil supplies, said Govindbhai Patel, managing director of trading firm G.G. Patel & Nikhil Research Company.
Indonesia usually sold palm oil at a discount to Malaysia but that could be narrowed or wiped out if all Indian palm oil buying switched to Jakarta, said Bajoria of Sunvin Group.
India, the world's biggest importer of edible oils, also buys soyoil from Argentina and Brazil, and sunflower oil from Ukraine.
Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Sunday his government would monitor the trade situation with India.
India's government was angered after Mahathir said at the United Nations last month that India had ""invaded and occupied"" Jammu and Kashmir and asked New Delhi to work with Pakistan to resolve the issue.

Muslim-majority Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, which both claim it in full and have twice gone to war over the territory. India revoked the special constitutional status of its portion of Kashmir in August, imposed a communications clampdown in the region and made mass arrests.

Bloomberg reported that China wants additional concessions from the U.S. before President Xi Jinping agrees to sign Friday’s “phase-1” agreement. Specifically, Xi wants the U.S. to suspend the increase in tariffs on imports from China that is currently scheduled to come into force in December, Bloomberg said.
The U.S. had already suspended the planned September tariff increase on $250 billion of Chinese goods last week.
By 6:55 AM ET (1005 GMT) Dow futures had trimmed losses on the news but were still marked down 86 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4%.
Trading may be somewhat thinner than usual on Monday, given the Columbus Day holiday. There are no major corporate earnings announcements due, but the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ are both open as normal.
Overnight, data out of the euro zone and China both continued to point to the damaging effects of the trade dispute on activity. China’s exports and imports both fell more sharply than expected in September, while the euro zone’s factory output fell 2.8% on the year, more than expected.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 07:01AM ET</span>",UK to expand powers to block foreign takeover deals,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain plans to strengthen its powers to block or intervene in the foreign purchase of any company that could affect national security, it said on Monday.
Currently the British state can intervene in the foreign takeover of any company that plays a role in national security, the provision of media plurality or the stability of the financial system.
But setting out its new legislative agenda in a Queen's Speech on Monday, the government said it planned to be able to intervene in deals of any size in any sector that could pose a risk to national security.
Under the plan, a notification system allowing businesses to flag to government a transaction with potential security concerns will be introduced.
The government will then be able to add conditions to the transaction, block it or add sanctions for non-compliance. Companies will be able to appeal.
The move is designed to tackle national security risks wherever they arise and reflects the fact a small company with expertise in cyber could be as important as a major defense company.
Britain has one of the most open economies in the world but it does ask for a thorough examination of the impact of certain deals and it is currently reviewing acquisitions of satellite group  Inmarsat  (L:ISA) and defense company  Cobham  (L:COB).

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's largest truckmakers are expressing optimism again about the growth prospects for Latin America's largest economy, even as the country continues to struggle to rebound from a deep recession that began in 2015.
""We are breathing optimism,"" said Martin Lundstedt, Volvo Group's President and CEO (ST:VOLVb), who traveled to Sao Paulo to take part in the biennial Fenatran expo, the largest truck and machinery trade show in the country.
""Latin America ... is coming back. We are having a very strong year.""
Economic growth, however, has been sluggish in Brazil, with economists now expecting less than 1% growth in 2019, a forecast that has undergone several downward revisions since the year began. Still, for all their rhetoric, Brazil's top four truck makers did not announce new investments in the country.
Truck sales and production have defied the broader economic trends, and industry trade group Anfavea this month revised its growth forecasts upward. It now expects domestic Brazil truck sales to rise 35% while production will grow a healthy 8%, weighed down by a crisis in Argentina, the second-largest consumer of Brazilian trucks.
""What happens is that the truck market is always ahead of the curve, ahead of economic growth,"" said Wilson Lirman, who leads Volvo in Latin America.
That economic growth ""starts around now,"" Lirman added, pointing to sweeping financial reforms that Brazil's right-wing government has proposed, which have cleared several congressional hurdles but not yet received final approval.
Brazil has South America's largest auto industry and is a particularly important base for truckmakers, where it is Volvo's second-largest market globally. The country was Mercedes Benz's largest market in the world before its economy crashed in 2015. It remains the largest market for Swedish maker Scania [SCVSA.UL], a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
Brazil's truck sales reached 137,000 in 2014 and essentially fell by half the next year, according to industry figures. They have grown significantly since then and will push 100,000 for the first time since the crash this year, but have yet to recover to their pre-recession levels. The recession is Brazil's deepest on record.
""Many of you will remember when we said, 'Remember the Brazilian market because we will be ready for when it comes back,'"" said Stefan Buchner, head of Mercedes Benz Trucks, who also traveled to Sao Paulo for the Fenatran trade show. ""Now, here we are. The Brazilian market is growing.""
Mercedes Benz, the market leader in Brazil with about 30% market share, expects 2020 to be an even better year for its truck business.
""Why is that? We have significantly reducing interest rates,"" said Philipp Schiemer, who leads Mercedes Benz in Latin America. ""We had very bad years in the construction business ... but it's regaining some strength, and the retail business is also picking up.""
Not everyone has believed in the truck business potential.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) this year announced it would exit the heavy truck business in South America, shutting its oldest plant in Brazil, located in the heart of the continent's auto industry: the city of Sao Bernardo do Campo. Ford said this was necessary to return to profitability in the country, where it has been losing money for years.
While growth is robust, overall sales numbers are still historically low, meaning that growth rates can appear overstated.
""The base is very low, we are coming out of a crisis,"" said Luiz Carlos Moraes, a Mercedes Benz executive who is also the president of Anfavea, the auto industry trade group."
272,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 06:21AM ET</span>",Sanders unveils economic plan a day before U.S. Democratic debate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Bernie Sanders, a day before the next debate among the Democratic U.S. presidential candidates, released a plan on Monday underscoring his left-leaning economic views aimed at curbing corporate tax avoidance, tightening antitrust enforcement and empowering workers.
Sanders, one of the top three contenders for his party's nomination, said in a statement his plan would raise up to $3 trillion over 10 years by upping the corporate tax rate to 35 percent, eliminating most corporate tax breaks and loopholes, and taking steps to eliminate use of offshore tax havens.
The 78-year-old senator from Vermont, set to take part in Tuesday's debate in Ohio after a heart attack this month, has sought to differentiate himself from another top contender for the party's nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has issued her own set of economic proposals.
In an interview that aired on Sunday on the ABC program ""This Week,"" Sanders said, ""Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I'm not.""
Sanders, part of a large Democratic field vying for the right to face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election, describes himself as a democratic socialist.
In his statement, he complained of ""greedy corporate CEOs"" rigging the tax code, harming market competition and hurting U.S. workers and communities.
""The American people have had enough. They are sick and tired of profitable corporations like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Delta making billions in profits, but paying nothing in federal income taxes,"" Sanders said in the statement.
Amazon disagreed with Sanders.
""We've paid $2.6 billion in corporate taxes since 2016. We pay every penny we owe in the U.S. and every country where we operate,"" an Amazon spokeswoman said.
Delta said it would soon resume paying taxes.
    ""Delta accumulated tax credits during our years of losses after 9/11 and have been using those credits to account for our tax payments. We expect to return to full cash paying status next year,"" Delta spokeswoman Lisa Hanna said.
Halliburton said in a statement it ""complies with all federal tax laws and regulations and pays our corporate tax accordingly.""
General Motors declined to comment while the others did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sanders called for tighter enforcement of antitrust law and undoing mergers that created highly concentrated markets.
His plan would require firms with more than $100 million in annual revenue and all publicly traded companies to begin selling shares to employees until they own at least 20 percent of the firm. These companies would also be required to let workers elect at least 45 percent of their boards of directors.
Sanders called for banning large stock buybacks as well as requiring companies that move production to robots or poorer countries to share any extra profits with displaced workers. He also advocated making it easier for workers to buy a company that is being sold or closing."
273,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 06:11AM ET</span>",Liberty Global backs Sunrise deal to tune of $500 million,"By John Revill and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) - Liberty Global (O:LBTYA) has offered a 500 million Swiss franc ($501.45 million) sweetener to rescue the sale of its Swiss cable and TV business to Sunrise Communications (S:SRCG) but a key Sunrise shareholder said it remained opposed to the deal. 
Some Sunrise investors say the 6.3 billion franc price tag for cable operator UPC is too expensive. They have opposed the Swiss telecoms group's plan to raise 2.8 billion francs to fund the purchase and raised concerns that Liberty Global was not taking part in the deal. 
Liberty Global, set up by U.S. cable pioneer John Malone, said on Monday it had offered to buy up to 500 million Swiss francs in newly created Sunrise shares (S:SRCG) as a way of easing through the capital hike needed to clinch the sale. 
If fully utilised, Liberty Global's ownership in Sunrise would reach 7.8% at current market prices, while Liberty Global will also receive one board seat as long as its shareholding exceeds 5%. 
Sunrise shareholders will vote on the capital increase needed to complete the deal on Oct. 23, with a Reuters survey showing at least 30% of Sunrise shares, including German group  Freenet  (DE:FNTGn), against the capital hike.
Freenet, which holds nearly a quarter of Sunrise's shares, said on Monday it still opposed what would be Switzerland's biggest telecoms deal, despite Liberty Global's offer. 
Shares of Sunrise gained 1.9% in early trading, before retreating to trade 0.4% higher after Freenet's comments.
SIMPLE MAJORITY 
Sunrise, which competes with state-controlled  Swisscom  (S:SCMN), needs a simple majority to back the equity issue, which has been scaled back from 4.1 billion Swiss francs originally planned.
Proxy adviser ISS has recommended shareholders vote against the rights issue. Other proxy advisors Glass Lewis, Ethos, and zRating have recommended Sunrise shareowners approve the capital increase.
""We have always believed in the logic of this combination. It creates a national powerhouse that will provide a fully-converged challenger to Swisscom and represents a smart and accretive transaction for both Sunrise and Liberty shareholders,"" said Mike Fries, CEO of Liberty Global. 
Sunrise welcomed the Liberty Global's offer, saying its financial contribution would lessen the commitment needed from Sunrise shareholders, while Liberty's presence on the board would benefit the company.
""Liberty Global is a leading global cable operator and will bring considerable experience to our board to support management in running the combined business and delivering on our identified, actionable synergies,"" said Sunrise chairman Peter Kurer.
Freenet said it remained of the opinion that the deal was not a good one. 
""The participation of Liberty Global changes nothing in our opinion or that of the majority of shareholders about the deal,"" the German telecoms company said.
""Liberty Global has merely said it will participate at rock bottom prices with the money they will receive from a too expensive sale.""
Liberty Global will have to go further to appease Sunrise shareholders concerned about the deal's cost, analysts said.

""If Freenet, activists and ISS maintain their position as we suspect they will, Liberty Global will need to move on the price to get the deal done,"" said Berenberg analyst Usman Ghazi.

274,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 06:09AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,"Investing.com -- Markets are set to open lower after investors take a more sober look at the provisional trade deal delivered by the U.S. and China at the end of last week, while the U.K.'s Brexit hopes get a fresh setback and Turkish assets fall after the U.S. and EU threaten sanctions. Elsewhere. Softbank is reported to be set to take control over WeWork's parent company to stop the hemorrhaging of cash at the office space provider. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 14th October.
1. Stocks euphoria to continue ebbing
U.S. stock markets are indicated to open the week lower, on disappointment that the substance of Friday’s interim trade agreement between the U.S. and China falls well short of the hype given it by the White House.
By 6:05 AM ET (1005 GMT) Dow futures were marked down 120 points, or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures were also down 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.6%, die partly to a report by Bloomberg saying that China wants more talks before it commits even to the little that was supposedly agreed on Friday.
Both the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ will open for trading as normal today, despite the Columbus Day holiday. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, by contrast, has recommended that the bond market be closed.
2. China's economy is still slowing
Asian markets rallied in relief at the results of U.S.-China trade talks at the end of last week, but the hard data continued to show the extent of China’s problems.
Chinese exports fell at the steepest level since March in September. They dropped 3.2% on the year. Imports fell an even steeper 8.2%, equalling their worst drop since 2016.
There was further evidence of the Chinese economy’s struggles in a 5.2% annual drop in car sales, the 15th straight monthly decline. Even sales of new-energy vehicles – cars which are either wholly or partially electric-powered, fell for the third month in a row. That’s due in large measure to the phasing out of subsidies for electric car purchases.
On an otherwise light day for data, the euro zone’s industrial production fell by a worse-than-expected 2.8% on the year in August, despite a 0.4% monthly rebound.
3. Softbank set to take over WeWork
Softbank is in talks to take control of WeWork’s parent company, according to the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times, aiming to recapitalize the company at a sharply lower valuation than that which it was seeking from the public capital markets last month.
The papers reported that Softbank is also lining up billions of dollars in fresh debt from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Both reports said that a deal wasn’t guaranteed and the FT noted that if new money can’t be raised, then bankruptcy proceedings may be necessary. The WSJ noted that We Co., the largest commercial tenant in some urban real estate markets, needs $3 billion to get through the next year.
Softbank is already We Co.’s largest external shareholder, having invested over $10 billion in We Co. directly and through its Saudi-backed Vision Fund.
 4. Turkish assets falls under sanctions threat
The Turkish lira, and the local stock and bond markets, all fell sharply after both the U.S. and EU warned of imposing economic sanctions on the country if it continues its military operations in Kurdish-controlled areas of Syria.
The dollar rose as high as 5.9225 lira, the highest since June, after a weekend peppered with reports of atrocities committed and jailbreaks by Islamic State prisoners whose Kurdish guards had been redeployed to fight Turkish units.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has counted on Turkey’s significant geopolitical value to defy pressure from the West: he has threatened to reignite Europe’s migrant crisis by sending 3.6 million Syrian refugees westward, while also threatening a major security realignment by buying new missile defense equipment from Russia rather than from its NATO allies.
 5. Not good enough, EU tells U.K. on Brexit plans
The British pound retreated after its sharpest one-day rally in more than two years, after the EU’s top negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly told EU diplomats that the U.K.’s latest proposals on settling the Irish border chapter of the Brexit negotiations were unworkable.
The EU’s reaction means that it’s virtually impossible to agree a legally-binding withdrawal agreement at a summit due at the end of this week. As such, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be forced under a recently passed law to ask the EU for another extension to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. 
Outgoing EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told an Austrian newspaper at the weekend that it would be “unhistoric” not to grant such a request.
Johnson's government meanwhile is preparing for a general election: a new session of parliament opened by the Queen today will read out a laundry list of major spending promises for the time after Brexit.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 05:18AM ET</span>",WTO clears U.S. to target EU goods with tariffs over Airbus,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) formally authorized the United States on Monday to impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion of imports of EU goods after an arbitrator's decision over subsidies to planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR).
The WTO's dispute settlement body, made up of representatives from its 164 members, cleared Washington to take countermeasures against the European Union and Airbus-producing countries Britain, France, Germany and Spain.
The authorization was a formality after a WTO arbitrator awarded a record right to retaliate over illegal subsidies this month. It would only have been denied if all WTO members present voted against. The meeting lasted less than 20 minutes.
U.S. trade ambassador Dennis Shea told the meeting that Washington still preferred a negotiated solution.
""But that can only happen if the EU genuinely terminates the benefits to Airbus from current subsidies and ensures that subsidies to Airbus cannot be revived under another name or another mechanism,"" he told the meeting.
The EU delegation told the meeting that it had ""serious concerns"" and that U.S. tariff measures were short-sighted.
The WTO has found that both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. An adjudication in the Boeing case is expected early in 2020.
The United States has said it will impose 10% tariffs on Airbus planes and 25% duties on a range of products, including French wine, Scottish whiskies and cheese from across the continent.
On Friday, EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer urging him to start negotiations to find a settlement of the Airbus and Boeing cases, adding that resorting to tariffs was not a solution.
""It would only inflict damage on businesses and put at risk jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time,"" she wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.

276,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>","StockBeat: 2nd Thoughts on Trade, Brexit Bring Markets Back to Earth","Europe’s stock markets were brought down to earth on Monday by Chinese data that showed how much economic activity has slowed reminding participants that it will need more than grand words and handshake deals to revive a global economy hobbled by various trade-related uncertainties.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 was down 0.7% at 388.84, having soared Friday to its highest since start of the month in anticipation of major progress in both Brexit and the U.S.-China trade dispute.
The German DAX index was 0.5% while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.4% and the midcap FTSE 250, made up of more U.K.-focused companies, fell a more pronounced 1.1%, as hopes regarding Brexit were scaled back.
Spain’s IBEX 35 also fell 0.5%, led by its banking sector, after stiff sentences handed down to Catalan nationalists for their role in Catalonia's attempted secession reminded investors of the ongoing political risks there.
Data released earlier showed China's imports falling at the fastest rate in three years, while the euro zone's industrial output in August was down 2.8% on the year, despite a monthly rebound of 0.4%. European Central Bank vice president Luis de Guindos said he didn't expect the euro zone, which has been hit badly through its exposure to Chinese and British demand trends, to slip into recession.
Over the weekend, it became clear that the deal agreed between U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators was little more than a bare minimum needed to manage expectations.
“There is a five week period for the two sides to write down exactly what they agreed to in the meeting,” said ING economist Iris Pang in a morning note. “This raises questions about how much ""progress"" has really been made.”
With the market bracing for an earnings season that is expected by many to show profits falling among European companies, the need for a breakthrough on Brexit has seldom been greater. But that too looks to be up in the air after the EU’s top negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly told EU diplomats at the weekend that the U.K.’s latest proposals on managing the Irish border after Brexit weren’t workable.
The gloom in public markets has at least presented some opportunities for those with deep pockets and longer investment horizons. U.K. cyber-security firm Sophos Group (LON:SOPH) said Monday it had agreed to be bought by private equity company Thoma Bravo in a deal that values it at $3.9 billion including debt. The shares shot up by over 35% in response, back to the level they were at in June.
Sophos has had a choppy time since listing back in 2015 with a valuation of roughly one billion pounds, although it swung to a profit for the first time in four years in its last fiscal year, and appeared to have exited a soft patch for revenue growth caused by a switch in billing patterns to monthly subscriptions."

LONDON (Reuters) - A global index of stock markets slipped on Monday as signs of progress in the China-U.S. trade dispute drew mixed a reaction from investors, with some cautioning over a lack of detail in the initial stages of the agreement.
Stock markets in Asia cheered U.S. President Donald Trump's outlining the first phase of an agreement to end a trade war with China and suspending a threatened tariff hike, but European shares slipped.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 0.75% in early trade in London.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI), dominated by companies exposed to China, slipped 0.5%. All European country indexes were in the red.
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.06% on the day.
The emerging trade deal, covering agriculture, currency and some aspects of intellectual-property protection, would represent the biggest step by the two countries in 15 months. But investors advised caution.
""While a positive development, we are not absolutely certain that this marks the start of a clear de-escalation of the trade dispute,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. A number of issues were unresolved or unclear, in his view.
""A delay to the scheduled December tariffs was not announced, although that's likely if a deal is reached, and the state of provisions on intellectual property, forced technology transfer, and Chinese state subsidies, the most difficult aspects of the negotiations, are still unclear.""
Contributing to the gingerly reception of phase 1 of the trade agreement were data showing a further contraction of Chinese exports and imports in September. Liquidity was also lacking with Japan off and a partial market holiday in the United States for Columbus Day.
Australia's main index gained 0.54% (AXJO) and South Korea (KS11) rose 1.11%. Shanghai blue chips (CSI300) added 1%.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were down 0.2% after rising on Friday.
The drag from the trade war was a major reason Singapore's central bank eased monetary policy on Monday for the first time in three years. Data showed the city-state's economy had only narrowly dodged recession.
BIG WEEK FOR BREXIT
The progress on trade was still enough to hit safe-haven bonds. Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.7530%.
The yield curve also steepened as short-term rates were held down by news the Federal Reserve would start buying about $60 billion per month in Treasury bills to ensure ""ample reserves"" in the banking system.
The fading rally in risk assets as European markets opened saw the Japanese yen regain ground against the dollar. The currency was 0.2% higher to the dollar at 108.22 .
The dollar gained 0.2% against a basket of currencies.
Sterling fell to $1.2556 , retreating from a 15-week high of $1.2708 on Friday on optimism Britain could reach a deal on Brexit with the European Union. However, both British and EU officials said on Sunday more work would be needed to secure an agreement.
More talks will be held on Monday before a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.
Spot gold gained 0.05%, last trading at $1,490.20 per ounce.
Oil prices pared gains made on Friday after reports that an Iranian state-owned oil tanker had been attacked in the Red Sea.
Investors were also watching Turkey's incursion into Syria as the White House threatened to impose sanctions on Ankara.
Brent crude futures eased 1.14% to $59.82 a barrel. U.S. crude lost 1.04% to $54.13 a barrel."

It has the potential to extend gains as far as $1.30, the Wall Street bank said in a note to clients on Friday. Sterling fell 0.8% to $1.2573 as of 7:51 a.m. London time.
“If the two sides do make more progress toward a deal, continued short-covering from real money investors should prolong the rally,” said analysts including New York-based Zach Pandl, Goldman’s co-head of global foreign-exchange and emerging-market strategy. “We think sterling has further to run, and reiterate our trade recommendation to go long GBP/USD with an initial target of 1.30.”
Goldman expects that if the EU and Prime Minister Boris Johnson agree on a deal this week, enough U.K. lawmakers will back it to ensure an orderly Brexit at the end of October.
After meeting with his British counterpart Stephen Barclay on Friday, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told ambassadors from the EU’s remaining 27 member states that there has been enough progress for discussions to intensify.
But the EU stopped short of taking the talks into the “tunnel” -- the formal Brussels process by which the actual legal text of an agreement is thrashed out in secret. Instead, the diplomats said they would reconvene early this week for a progress update.
And while Johnson told his Cabinet on Sunday that a Brexit deal is achievable, Barnier told a meeting of envoys on Sunday that the U.K.’s proposals for breaking the deadlock over the Irish border lacked detail and risked leaving the single market vulnerable to fraud."

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.7% at 7:12 GMT after recording its best session since January on hopes of a trade deal and a Brexit agreement.
Late on Friday, United States and China outlined the first phase of a trade deal and suspended this week's scheduled U.S. tariff hikes. But existing tariffs remain in place and officials on both sides said much more work is needed before an accord could be agreed.
In the latest sign of weakness in the Chinese economy, data showed a further contraction in exports and imports in September.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI), dominated by firms with exposure to China, slipped 0.5%. All country indexes were in the red.

Menzies, which offers ground handling, fuelling and cargo handling services for airlines, is looking to boost profit through cost cuts and had earlier said it is considering strategic and structural options for the company.
In July, Menzies named industry veteran and non-executive director Philip Joeinig as chairman, replacing Dermot Smurfit.
European airlines have warned of a challenging market in terms of lower passenger numbers and stagnating cargo volumes, while higher fuel costs, competition among budget airlines and a slowing economy have also weighed on the aviation sector.
Apart from Swissport Group, which is the Swiss cargo handling unit of China's HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], Gomez-Reino has also held finance positions at Amey plc and Ferrovial.
John Menzies, which swung to a loss in the first half, was battered by the fallout from the global grounding of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX jets.
In a move to finalize its senior executive team, the aviation firm said company insider Mervyn Walker has also been promoted to the role of chief operating officer."

Dunkerton, the group's biggest shareholder with an 18.5% stake, rejoined the board in April, prompting the existing directors, including chief executive Euan Sutherland, to resign en masse.
Having served as interim CEO since April 2, Dunkerton's title will now be CEO and his contract will run until April 2021.
Dunkerton's return followed a string of profit warnings as the retailer struggled to expand beyond its sweatshirts, hoodies and jackets with random Japanese text and as demand fell in its wholesale and ecommerce business.
In July the group reported a pretax loss of 85.4 million pounds for the 2018-19 year. Its shares have fallen 56% over the last year.
Superdry's board said Dunkerton had agreed to continue in the role, overseeing his strategy to restore the brand to its design-led roots and lead the business back to growth.
""Today's announcement reflects the board's unanimous view that he is the right person to lead the business through this initial crucial phase of the turnaround,"" it said.
Superdry said the board's nomination committee will continue the process to find a long-term CEO successor.

Dunkerton said his plan was ""seeing early signs of progress"" but cautioned ""this will take time"".

""As China further opens its markets, we will make further investments in China,"" Xin He, SocGen's head of global markets, China, told a financial forum over the weekend.
On the sidelines of the forum, organized by the CFA Institute, He told Reuters that the bank had dropped a joint-venture plan to avoid the hassle of future stake transfers.
International investment banks are only able to own 51% of their China operations. That requires a joint venture with local Chinese partners.
China's securities regulator unveiled a firm timetable on Friday to open up its financial industry, saying foreign ownership limits will be removed completely for the country's futures, mutual fund and securities sectors in January, April, and December next year respectively.
A SocGen spokesman in Hong Kong confirmed that the bank had postponed its plans for a local securities business in China until regulators announced more details, and emphasized the bank's commitment to China.
Response to the announcement from elsewhere in the financial industry has been mixed.
Fidelity International, which has been considering a wholly owned mutual fund business in China, said in an email that it would apply for a license eventually.
But Michael Lu, China General Manager of Eastspring Investments, a member of  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Plc (UK), cautioned that full ownership doesn't guarantee success in China's highly competitive mutual fund market. Local experience, partnerships and banks' sales networks are essential, he added.
Peter Alexander, Managing Director of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors, said China's timetable for opening at least provides a enough clarity that certain companies can move forward.
""The clock is now ticking and a large swath of firms will be concerned if a key competitor is among the very first in the official queue,"" Alexander said."

SoftBank already owns one-third of WeWork. The potential deal, which would involve several billion dollars in equity and debt, would further dilute the influence of WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann and give voting power to the Japanese company, the Journal said, and noted that there is no guarantee that a deal will be reached.
 
WeWork delayed its initial public offering plan last month amid concerns over its governance and valuation. 
 
""WeWork has retained a major Wall Street financial institution to arrange a financing,"" a WeWork spokeswoman said. ""Approximately 60 financing sources have signed confidentiality agreements and are meeting with the company's management and its bankers over the course of this past week and this coming week.""
 
The company lost $1.9 billion in 2018 and spent $2.36 billion in cash in the first half 2019, according to filings."

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp. (T:9984) has prepared a financing package for WeWork Companies Inc that would give it control over the shared office space company, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The package would significantly increase the stake of SoftBank, which already owns around one third of WeWork, and further dilute the influence of co-founder Adam Neumann, said the person, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Reuters had reported that SoftBank was in negotiations to make a $1 billion investment to enable WeWork to go through a major restructuring.
Without a fresh infusion of cash, WeWork risks running out of money as early as the end of the December, the person said. 
WeWork is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to negotiate a $3 billion debt deal after a planned initial public offering was tabled last month because of investor concerns about how it was valued and its business model, Reuters reported last week.
""WeWork has retained a major Wall Street financial institution to arrange a financing,"" a WeWork spokeswoman said. ""Approximately 60 financing sources have signed confidentiality agreements and are meeting with the company's management and its bankers over the course of this past week and this coming week.""
WeWork lost $1.9 billion in 2018 and burned through $2.36 billion in cash in the first half of this year, according to filings.
In recent weeks, global credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings have also downgraded WeWork's credit ratings deeper into junk territory, while the company's junk bond is trading at a record low.
WeWork last month replaced co-founder Neumann as CEO with insiders Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham taking on joint CEO roles.

The pair have talked about the need to return to WeWork's core business of renting out trendy office space to freelancers and enterprises. That would pull the company back from the fringe activities Neumann had forayed into, such as a school, apartment buildings and various businesses.

The U.S. games publisher, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), said last week that it would suspend the player Chung ""blitzchung"" Ng Wai from competition for a year and strip him of prize money after he called for the liberation of Hong Kong in a post-game interview.
The decision made the company the latest corporate name to get caught up in tensions relating to the Hong Kong protests, garnering it support in China but also drawing criticism from fans, players and commentators in the West, some of whom said that they would stop working with Blizzard as a result of its decision.
However on Saturday, Blizzard said it had decided to cut his punishment to a six month suspension and would still award him his prize money, with its president J. Allen Brack saying the company had ""reacted too quickly"" in making its decision.
Brack said that Chung still had to be penalized as he had violated rules, but that his specific views were not a factor in the decision.
""I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,"" he said in a post on Blizzard's website.
Chung said in a statement posted on Twitter that he accepted Blizzard's decision and would express his opinions on his personal platforms in the future, but urged the company to reconsider its decision to penalize two commentators at the tournament where he had made his remarks.
The Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy, with activists throwing petrol bombs, setting street fires and trashing metro stations.
China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong and reacted strongly to expressions of support for the protests.
Last week, the NBA became the target of a fierce backlash in China after one of its team managers posted a now-deleted tweet that expressed support for the Hong Kong protesters, which Chinese state media characterized as the latest example of meddling in China’s own affairs."

PENANG, Malaysia (Reuters) - Years after resisting pressure to move to China, Lee Hung Lung says his bet has paid off. Sales at his Malaysia-based Hotayi Electronic are surging, it's hiring more workers, considering an expansion, and picking and choosing orders.
Lee is the founder and CEO of Hotayi, whose two factories manufacture and assemble circuit boards and other electronics products. The plants are located in the coastal state of Penang, once called the ""Silicon Valley of the East"" for its massive 47-year-old electrical and electronics (E&E) industry before it lost its shine to China.
Then came the trade war between the world's biggest two economies, pushing mostly U.S. companies to look for factories outside China to escape retaliatory tariffs, and leading to Penang's resurgence after what a fund manager described as ""a decade of sleepiness"".
Penang is just one of the areas across Asia competing for supply chains seeking a new location and lower tariffs.
But its two industrial zones have the advantage of a long-established ecosystem of suppliers and customers in one place and cheaper labor than regional rival Singapore. The two zones are connected by a 24 km (14.9-mile) bridge over the Malacca Strait.
The other factor going for Penang is that many semiconductor and other electronics products from Malaysia do not attract U.S. tariffs, unlike the 25% rate for China.
In June, Hotayi opened its second plant - which at 350,000 square feet is five times the first one. On a visit this month, employees were testing equipment that will help build products for clients that include Samsung (KS:005930), LG and Sharp.
""Around 2007, I was facing big pressure even from my management because China was cheaper than Malaysia - up to 30% in labor costs,"" said Taiwan-born Lee, taking off his striped white factory suit as he settled down for an interview in a conference room still smelling of paint.
""I instead decided to go for more smart, which means more investment on IT, software. Today Hotayi is becoming more, more and more big,"" he said. ""Because of the trade war, customers are transferring their complete production lines from China.""
INTEL'S FIRST FOREIGN PLANT
Foreign direct investments into Penang leaped 11 fold to about $2 billion in the first half of this year - much more than it has attracted in any other full year. The government expects second-half numbers to be as strong, but declined to give any estimate of jobs generated.
In its federal budget for next year presented on Friday, Malaysia said it would provide tax incentives to further promote high value-added activities in its E&E industry.
U.S. companies such as chipmaker Micron Technology (O:MU) and iPhone supplier Jabil Inc (N:JBL) are building factories in Penang. The state is urgently freeing up more land, including through reclamation, to make space for new plants, said its top elected official, Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow.
Penang shot to the limelight in 1972 when Intel (O:INTC) built its first international manufacturing plant there. Intel was followed by many other big U.S. names such as Broadcom (O:AVGO), Dell (N:DELL) and Motorola (N:MSI).
But investments largely stayed flat for more than a decade starting 2005, government data shows, as China lured away companies. Intel opened a factory in the Chinese city of Chengdu the same year, prompting some Malaysian suppliers to move as well.
""Penang became more of a sleepy town after that,"" said Geoffrey Ng, director of strategic investments at Malaysian asset management firm Fortress Capital.
""It's almost like a new renaissance for Penang. Penang is starting to see a second wave of investments after so many years of having lost its shine to China.""
Micron this year pledged to invest 1.5 billion ringgit ($358 million) in Malaysia over the next five years. Hotayi, which spent 1 billion ringgit to build its new facility, could spend another 1 billion ringgit in the next one or two years to expand production, Managing Director Goh Guek Eng said.
Its sales are set to jump by up to 40% to $100 million this year - the best ever and compared with an average growth of 20%. A labor shortage, which forced Hotayi to decline an order recently, could however limit Malaysia's E&E growth, she added.
""QUICK TRANSFER""
Among other companies in the Penang zones, Qdos, which makes flexible printed circuits that it supplies to companies including Hotayi, expects to benefit from the trade war only next year when some customers who cut back on inventory place new orders.
Globetronics Technology (KL:GNIC), which exited China in 2011 as production costs rose and focused on its decades-old Malaysian operation, said it had gained more than 10% additional market share this year for its sensor products and was expanding production capacity.
Chief Executive Heng Huck Lee said several of the company's potential clients were ""mainly looking at a quick transfer and start up by renting ready facility and transferring some of their existing mature operations to Malaysia"".
Pentamaster (KL:PMAS), a Malaysian manufacturer of factory automation systems, said it completed its second production plant in Penang last year and is now expanding the floor space of its first plant by another 10%-15%. It said it was looking to sell more to China since some companies there are barred from buying certain high-tech equipment from the United States.
Malaysia's January-August E&E exports rose 0.7% on the year to 247.6 billion ringgit, while total exports slipped 0.4% to 650.8 billion ringgit. Electronics exports from other countries such as South Korea and Singapore have plunged in recent months.
""We sense Malaysia's relative strength as a move up the electronics value chain,"" ING Asia economist Prakash Sakpal said. ""And if so, the outperformance should continue even if recent strength wears off in an entrenched global downturn."""

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component rose 1.7% and 1.3% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). 
Washington will not be raising tariffs on Chinese goods as originally planned this week. In exchange, Beijing will make as much as $50 billion of agricultural purchases and also take steps on intellectual property, financial services and the yuan. 
“My deal with China is that they will IMMEDIATELY start buying very large quantities of our Agricultural Product, not wait until the deal is signed over the next 3 or 4 weeks. THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED!” said U.S. President Donald Trump.
The two sides agreed to the outlines of a deal that could be signed as early as next month.
However, some economist reacted with skepticism and doubt about the agreed “trade deal” as it is an “uncertain” arrangement at best.
“Let’s not get carried away,” said Raoul Leering, head of international trade research at ING Bank NV, in a Bloomberg report. “There is a very tough journey ahead for the U.S. and Chinese negotiators to cut a deal that really has substance.”
In a note written on Friday,   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) strategists Michael Zezas and Meredith Pickett said they do not expect a meaningful rebound in corporate behaviour that would drive global growth higher, as “there is not yet a viable path to existing tariffs declining, and tariff escalation remains a meaningful risk.”
Trump also commented on the situation in Hong Kong, saying that he thinks the current situation of civil unrest “is going to take care of itself.”
 “We discussed Hong Kong and I think great progress has been made by China in Hong Kong, and I’ve been watching and I actually told the vice premier it really has toned down a lot from the initial days of a number of months ago when I saw a lot of people, and I see far fewer now,” Trump told reporters Friday.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2019 10:35PM ET</span>",China's crackdown on sugar smuggling leaves global storage headache,"By Maytaal Angel and Hallie Gu
LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - A crackdown on sugar smuggling into China has left abundantly supplied markets elsewhere in Asia struggling to absorb excess supplies, causing a wider storage problem for global markets.
Vast tonnages of sugar smuggled into China are believed to be produced mostly in India or Thailand and shipped to Myanmar, Laos or Vietnam before entering the Chinese mainland. 
Those flows should more than halve this year to about 800,000 tonnes versus previous years when between 1.5-2.8 million tonnes would be smuggled in, according to Wang Weidong, a sugar analyst based in southern China. 
The crackdown comes as Beijing faces pressure from industry to extend hefty sugar import tariffs beyond 2020 and keep growth in licensed imports into China historically low.
""Chinese authorities have really clamped down on that (smuggling trade) this year. It's been shut down for all intents and purposes,"" said a source a London-based sugar trader with ties to Asia. 
Traders and analysts in London and Beijing said they expect the clamp-down to continue. 
International Sugar Organization (ISO) figures show the global market will record a deficit of nearly 5 million tonnes in the 2019/20 season, meaning Asia will be able to absorb some of the excess resulting from China's crackdown. 
However, following two straight years of surplus, the world market has some 95 million tonnes of stock to absorb, the ISO said. That is equivalent to about six months worth of demand and is disproportionately concentrated in Asia. 
CHINA'S OFFICIAL IMPORTS SLOW
China's tariffs should leave official sugar imports into the country little changed this year at around 3 million tonnes, said Justin Liu, China-based senior sugar analyst at Chaos Research Institute.
The lack of growth is unusual for a developing economy like China which has a sugar deficit, and shows Beijing is serious about protecting its domestic industry.
""With the domestic output and imports under the quota, China's domestic demand can be met. Supply and demand is balanced. If China opens its market completely, the domestic sugar industry will be doomed,"" said Weidong.
""Everyone is speaking from their own interest. Why produce so much when you can't consume it?"" he added.
China in May 2017 hit major exporting nations with hefty tariffs on sugar imports, and started to levy extra tariffs on out-of-quota sugar imports from all origins in August last year.
The measures, with the smuggling crackdown, have helped push Chinese white sugar prices up some 20 percent this year, after they sank to near four-year lows last year.
(GRAPHIC: China sugar smuggling crackdown leaves global storage headache - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6863/6845/Capture.png) 
THAI STOCKS BUILD
China's smuggling crackdown has also contributed to a build-up of stock in Thailand, some of which made its way onto global markets mid this year via record deliveries against ICE (NYSE:ICE) futures contracts.
Analysts Green Pool said Thailand, the world's second largest exporter, was sitting on nearly 7 million tonnes of stock at end-September, 1.1 million tonnes more than last September and nearly 3 million more than the previous two years.
""In an ideal world they would have sold all their stock by September,"" Green Pool analyst Tom McNeill said. A large proportion of this stock will have to be cleared by the end of the year to make way for the new crush, he added.
Industry sources say Thai raw sugar is again trading at a premium to the ICE futures, indicating the supply-demand balance in Asia is starting to tighten. But the China crackdown still leaves Asian markets with unwelcome excess supply.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2019 10:22PM ET</span>",Deadly Los Angeles wildfire burns with subdued fury after change in weather,"By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Firefighters have tightened their grip on a deadly Los Angeles wildfire burning with subdued fury on Sunday after extremely dry desert winds that had stoked the flames gave way to moister, gentler breezes blowing in from the Pacific.
The so-called Saddleridge fire, which erupted Thursday night and raced across the northern edge of L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, had scorched nearly 8,000 acres (3,237 hectares) by Sunday but was mostly confined to foothills and canyons away from populated areas, fire officials said.
As of Sunday morning, firefighters had managed to carve containment lines around 41% of the fire's perimeter, more than double the containment level reported a day earlier as authorities lifted all remaining evacuation notices.
At the height of the blaze on Friday, authorities had ordered the evacuation of some 23,000 homes, comprising about 100,000 people, as flames invaded several communities in northern Los Angeles.
One man who stayed put in an effort to defend his own property from the flames suffered a fatal heart attack, and three firefighters out of some 1,000 assigned to the blaze sustained minor injuries, authorities said.
Thirty-two homes and other structures were destroyed or damaged.
The last two of several emergency evacuation shelters set up during the blaze were closed on Sunday, the American Red Cross said.
A shift in wind patterns was a key factor in the improved fire outlook over the weekend.
Initially stoked by gale-force Santa Ana winds blowing in from the desert east of the city, the blaze had raced through dry brush and chaparral at the rate of 800 acres per hour at the outset. 
On Saturday, however, lighter winds laden with greater moisture began blowing in from the ocean, helping fire crews to halt advancing flames and extend containment lines, city fire spokesman Nicholas Prange said.
""With the winds being reduced, fire behavior is less severe, so firefighters are advancing around the perimeter,"" he told Reuters by phone. ""We can make more headway with containment than before.""
Smoke from the blaze lingered over much of Los Angeles, leading the South Coast Air Quality Management District to issue an advisory for unhealthy air quality for the San Fernando Valley, as well as the Santa Clarita Valley to the west and the San Gabriel Mountains to the north.
The cause of the blaze was under investigation. Fire officials said they were investigating witness reports in local media linking the fire to a power transmission line.
The Saddleridge was the largest among a spate of wildfires across California that burned a total of nearly 160,000 acres (64,000 hectares) and destroyed 134 structures in recent days, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (N:COP) has agreed to sell its northern Australian business to partner Santos Ltd (AX:STO) for $1.39 billion, in a deal that will hike the Australian group's output by 25% and boost its position in the global gas market.
The deal, which was not unexpected, marks the second major acquisition by Santos in less than a year, following a sharp turnaround in its fortunes under Managing Director Kevin Gallagher, and pushed its shares up 7% in early trade on Monday.
ConocoPhillips, which has been focusing on its U.S. shale assets, will quit the Darwin LNG plant, which it opened in 2006, and gas fields off northern Australia, but hold on to its stake in the Australia Pacific LNG plant in Queensland state.
""While we believe the Darwin LNG backfill project remains among the lower cost of supply options for new global LNG supply, this transaction allows us to allocate capital to other projects,"" ConocoPhillips Chief Operating Officer Matt Fox said in a statement.
The move comes as the Bayu-Undan gas field that feeds Darwin LNG is set to run dry in 2022 and the project's owners near a decision on which field to develop next to keep the plant open, with Santos aiming to develop the Barossa field.
""The big prize here is pushing forward with development (of Barossa) and setting up the framework to develop other resources in the region over time,"" Gallagher told reporters on a conference call.
The deal, set to close in the first quarter of 2020, is expected to boost Santos' earnings per share by 16% and increase its production by 25% in 2020, the company said. It adds to its stakes in the Gladstone LNG project and PNG LNG in Papua New Guinea.
Santos has agreed to pay a further $75 million if a final investment decision is reached on developing the Barossa field. It plans to fund the whole acquisition out of cash and new debt.
DARWIN STAKE SALE
The deal gives Santos control over the future of Darwin LNG, the second-oldest of Australia's 10 LNG plants, at a time when it is vying against several LNG projects worldwide to line up gas buyers to extend its life.
""It seems like a good deal. They go from being a small joint venture partner to being the operator,"" said Stephen Butel, an analyst at Platypus Asset Management. ""It allows them to take control of the situation there."" 
Santos will acquire ConocoPhillips' majority stakes in Darwin LNG and Bayu-Undan, as well as a 37.5% stake in Barossa, but will aim to cut its stakes in Darwin LNG and Barossa to about 40%-50%.
It said it has already reached a preliminary agreement to sell down a 25% stake in Darwin LNG to its Barossa partner SK E&S of South Korea.
It was also in talks with other Darwin LNG partners, which include Japan's Inpex Corp (T:1605), Italy's Eni SpA (MI:ENI), Japan's JERA (T:9501) (T:9502) and Tokyo Gas (T:9531), to sell equity in Barossa and Darwin LNG.
At the same time, Santos said it is aiming to line up contracts for 60%-80% of LNG volumes for more than 10 years before taking a final investment decision on Barossa -- the first time it has spelled out a target for contracts.

""It's very competitive. It's positioned well. We're very confident we'll get it away. And it's got very robust economics even in this soft market that we find ourselves in today,"" Gallagher said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Firefighters have tightened their grip on a deadly Los Angeles wildfire burning with subdued fury on Sunday after extremely dry desert winds that had stoked the flames gave way to moister, gentler breezes blowing in from the Pacific.
The so-called Saddleridge fire, which erupted Thursday night and raced across the northern edge of L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, had scorched nearly 8,000 acres (3,237 hectares) by Sunday but was mostly confined to foothills and canyons away from populated areas, fire officials said.
As of Sunday morning, firefighters had managed to carve containment lines around 41% of the fire's perimeter, more than double the containment level reported a day earlier as authorities lifted all remaining evacuation notices.
At the height of the blaze on Friday, authorities had ordered the evacuation of some 23,000 homes, comprising about 100,000 people, as flames invaded several communities in northern Los Angeles.
One man who stayed put in an effort to defend his own property from the flames suffered a fatal heart attack, and three firefighters out of some 1,000 assigned to the blaze sustained minor injuries, authorities said.
Thirty-two homes and other structures were destroyed or damaged.
The last two of several emergency evacuation shelters set up during the blaze were closed on Sunday, the American Red Cross said.
A shift in wind patterns was a key factor in the improved fire outlook over the weekend.
Initially stoked by gale-force Santa Ana winds blowing in from the desert east of the city, the blaze had raced through dry brush and chaparral at the rate of 800 acres per hour at the outset.
On Saturday, however, lighter winds laden with greater moisture began blowing in from the ocean, helping fire crews to halt advancing flames and extend containment lines, city fire spokesman Nicholas Prange said.
""With the winds being reduced, fire behavior is less severe, so firefighters are advancing around the perimeter,"" he told Reuters by phone. ""We can make more headway with containment than before.""
Smoke from the blaze lingered over much of Los Angeles, leading the South Coast Air Quality Management District to issue an advisory for unhealthy air quality for the San Fernando Valley, as well as the Santa Clarita Valley to the west and the San Gabriel Mountains to the north.
The cause of the blaze was under investigation. Fire officials said they were investigating witness reports in local media linking the fire to a power transmission line.
The Saddleridge was the largest among a spate of wildfires across California that burned a total of nearly 160,000 acres (64,000 hectares) and destroyed 134 structures in recent days, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
A separate, smaller fire east of Los Angeles in Riverside County killed two people and destroyed dozens of homes last week. That blaze began when burning refuse dumped by a garbage truck ignited dry vegetation on the ground."

DUBAI/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Emirates still has the right to offer flights to Mexico City, the Dubai state-owned carrier said on Sunday, after Mexican airline Aeromexico disputed an agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Mexico.
Emirates said earlier this year it would start daily flights to Mexico City International Airport via Barcelona in December, the airline's first service to Mexico.
But a Mexican federal judge ruled in October, responding to a complaint by Aeromexico, that a 2016 pact between Mexico and United Arab Emirates did not meet proper legal requirements, according to a court order seen by Reuters.
Emirates said that decision was being appealed.
""We firmly believe that the (memorandum of understanding) is valid and the ruling of the court will be the subject of an appeal by the Government of Mexico,"" an Emirates spokeswoman said in a statement. ""Pending the outcome of this appeal all our rights remain valid and in force.""
Aeromexico declined to comment.
Mexico's Communications and Transport Minister, Javier Jimenez Espriu, said last week that Emirates could offer service to Mexico City without legal obstacles because the 2016 agreement remains valid.
""Emirates has no legal impediment to operating the flight,"" he said in comments to reporters published in newspaper El Financiero on Wednesday."
299,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2019 12:25PM ET</span>",What to watch in third quarter earnings from U.S. companies,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are preparing to report third-quarter results following a rocky few months in which they grappled with a U.S.-China trade conflict undermining the business environment and an overall economy that has been showing signs of struggling.
Earnings among S&P 500 earnings for the July-September period look set to mark the weakest performance in about three years, with respect to year-over-year quarterly changes. 
Analysts are forecasting a 3.2% decline in earnings for the quarter from a year ago, based on IBES data from Refinitiv, although given the historic trend that many companies' earnings will surpass analyst estimates, the quarter could end in positive territory.
""Investors may start to think that the worst of the earnings comparisons are behind us, and if the consensus emerges that we've passed the earnings trough in terms of year-over-year growth, that would be a positive for the market,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. 
(GRAPHIC: US S&P 500 profit performance since 2015 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7256/7187/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Sector-wise, a rough quarter is expected for technology companies, whose shares have led the market's ascent this year but overall are seen posting a 7.6% drop in third-quarter earnings, with Micron (NASDAQ:MU) Technology's results expected to be a particularly big drag on the group, according to Refinitiv.
Materials and energy, two cyclical sectors that are particularly sensitive to the overall economy as well as the trade dispute, also are forecasted to post big year-over-year declines in earnings. The biggest U.S. banks are also expected to report a slight earnings dip. 
(GRAPHIC: Expected third-quarter results by sector - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-RESULTS-OUTLOOK/0H001QXCG8VJ/eikon.png)
""Negative S&P 500 EPS growth in 3Q will be driven by sectors with the highest international revenue exposure,"" David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said in a report.
Trade tensions took center stage last week with a delegation from China in Washington for talks to find a resolution to their 15-month trade dispute. 
During the second quarter, 17% of S&P 500 companies mentioned negative impacts from the tariffs, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists.
An equal-weighted basket of companies impacted by the trade war, created by  Barclays  (LON:BARC), has underperformed the S&P 500 since the end of the second quarter through Thursday.
(GRAPHIC: Trade-exposed stocks lag - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7260/7191/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Uncertainty about the economy and trade situation means that analysts are expecting companies will be cautious with their big investments in buildings and equipment. Capital expenditures are expected to have increased just 2.8% in the third quarter from a year ago, which would be the lowest since the second quarter of 2017, when capex declined slightly, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.
""Capex has been and is likely to remain anemic,"" BofA strategists wrote in their note.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. capital spending growth wanes - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-RESULTS-OUTLOOK/0H001QXCR8WD/eikon.png)
One issue that could confront large U.S. companies that derive much of their revenue from abroad is the stronger U.S. dollar. Since the end of the third quarter of 2018, the dollar strengthened more than 6% against the euro through the end of the third quarter this year, a potential pressure point as U.S. companies translate foreign earnings into the U.S. currency.
Data from cloud treasury and finance firm Kyriba found that North American companies reported a $23.39 billion collective negative impact in the first quarter related to currency, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2015.

Companies new to public scrutiny are also in sharper relief this reporting season after the parent of office-sharing startup WeWork pulled its initial public offering. The company ousted its chief executive and failed to excite investors who raised concerns about its burgeoning losses.
Among other high-profile companies that recently held IPOs, ride-hailing company  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) is expected to report quarterly results on Oct. 30, followed by rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, and later by workplace messaging firm Slack Technologies Inc and online pet products retailer Chewy Inc.

""We have a very good currency, it's stable. Why not use it for global transactions?"" Oreshkin said in an interview with the Financial Times on Sunday.
""We want (oil and gas sales) in roubles at some point,"" he was quoted as saying. ""The question here is not to have any excessive costs from doing it that way, but if the broad  ... financial infrastructure is created, if the initial costs are very low, then why not?""
Oreshkin said that Russia will be able to sell its energy exports in local currency given the popularity of the country's domestic bonds among foreign investors, who own 29% of its rouble debt.
Russia has attempted to reduce its exposure to the U.S. through a ""de-dollarisation"" policy to offset the impact of U.S. sanctions.
Russian assets came under pressure after the first round of western sanctions were imposed in 2014 for annexing Crimea from Ukraine.
Subsequently, Washington imposed further sanctions on allegations of interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections and the poisoning of a former spy in Britain, accusations denied by Russia.
In August, the U.S. banned its banks from buying sovereign Eurobonds directly from Russia. Russia's finance ministry said last month that the country will focus more on selling its debt to investors from Asia and Europe and may adjust the currencies of its bond issues.
Oreshkin told FT Russia was aiming to boost its bilateral trade with the European Union, but it is unlikely to readmit EU food exports unless the bloc eases Russia's access to its market.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2019 02:11AM ET</span>",Realty bites: Indian property slump leaves beleaguered banks exposed,"By Nupur Anand and Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India might have thought the worst of a bad loans crisis was past, but a severe cash crunch in the real estate industry could augur fresh strife for its banks.
A slump in the residential property market is leaving many builders struggling to repay loans to shadow lenders - housing finance firms outside the regular banking sector that account for over half of the loans to developers.
With about $10 billion of development loans coming up for repayment in the first half of 2020, according to Fitch Rating's Indian division, the fallout could spread to mainstream banks that have lent money to the shadow lenders or invested in their bonds.
Indian financial authorities, including the central bank and government, have said this year that the banking sector's bad loans - totaling more than $150 billion - are on the decline for the first time in four years after ballooning during a debt crisis.
But the number of property developers falling into bankruptcy has doubled during the past nine months, piling pressure on non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), commonly known as shadow lenders.
Potential implosions of these NBFCs could expose banks, according to 12 banking and real estate sources.
A senior banking industry official, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said banks would be affected by the property cash crunch in three ways: their lending to NBFCs, their own direct exposure to developers and also individuals who do not repay mortgages.
""It will be a triple-whammy,"" he said.
While the Indian banking system could be hit by billions of dollars of additional soured debt, the cash crunch in the housing market has levied a toll in human misery.
Retired Squadron Leader Krishan Mitroo has paid 90% of the cost of his house in Noida, northern India, to developer Jaypee, and the property was supposed to be handed over five years ago. However, Jaypee was forced to delay the project and went into insolvency in 2017.
""The project has been stuck and there is no progress at all. Even the bankruptcy court has not been able to resolve the issue so far, it is just hanging in thin air,"" Mitroo said. He did not say how much money he had paid, but properties in that project range from about $56,000 to $140,000.
Several such projects are stuck across the country and buyers are waiting for new developers to take interest and complete them with the hope that their hard-earned money, which has been stuck for years, won't be lost forever.
BAD LOANS PILE 'HUGE'
The property sector has been battling a downturn for the last 3-4 years. Things have now, however, hit a critical point due to a liquidity crunch hitting shadow banks that are big lenders to both developers and property buyers.
As of June 30, 421 realtors were under the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP), up from 209 on Sept. 30 last year, data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India shows.
Defaults by two housing finance companies,  Dewan Housing Finance  Corp (NS:DWNH) and Altico Capital, have increased fears of contagion to the banking system..
Dewan and Altico did not respond to requests for comment.
Shadow lenders will be highly exposed when loans worth roughly 700 billion rupees come up for repayment in the first half of 2020, as many builders may struggle to repay, Fitch's India Ratings said last month.
""The number of stressed assets in real estate are huge,"" said Rohit Poddar, managing director at Poddar Developers. ""The stress now is just the start, only the mid-sized to large developers will survive, others will die.""
If three-quarters of the high-risk category of outstanding real estate loans is not repaid, that could lead to additional bad debt of $15 billion on banks' books in the next few years, according to confidential research conducted by one of India's leading real estate consultancies for an international financial client, and provided to Reuters.
The Nifty Bank index (NSEBANK), which surged in late September after the government moved to slash corporate tax rates, gave up more than half those gains as of Friday. Concerns about real estate loans were one factor, according to analysts, but the fall was also driven by low growth in the economy and the overall worsening asset quality of certain lenders.
Banks' gross non-performing assets fell to 9.3% of total loans as of March, from 11.5% a year earlier, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The improvement was bigger than the RBI had expected, having forecast a drop to 10.3% by March and saying last December the ratio had fallen for the first time since 2015. The central bank said in June it expected bad loans to continue to fall in the current financial year, both the ratio and absolute sum.
But India still has the highest bad-loan ratio among major economies; by comparison Italy, which has endured a major banking crisis, had a ratio of 9% at the end of last year.
 Yes Bank  (NS:YESB) and  IndusInd Bank  (NS:INBK) have the largest direct exposure to the commercial real estate sector and would be susceptible to ""asset-quality difficulties"" if the real estate sector continues to slow, according to a Moody's report in mid-September, which also said other banks such as ICICI Bank (NS:ICBK) and  Axis Bank  (NS:AXBK) are likely to feel the pinch.
The four banks did not respond to requests for comment on potential difficulties arising from the real-estate exposure covered in the Moody's report.
The chief financial officer of a large public-sector bank said the problems emerging in real estate loan repayments were a major cause of worry.
It is unclear what individual banks will do to address the problem. State-owned banks, which dominate the sector, have already received tens of billions of dollars from the government in recent years to shore up their finances.
International banks have a very small presence in the Indian market.
JOB LOSSES LOOM
Indian banks' bad debt pile ballooned as a result of out-of-control lending in 2006-11 when the economy grew rapidly, and beyond that. They under-reported their bad loans for years until they were forced by the central bank to recognize and address the issue in 2015.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das touched on the real estate issue this month, saying the central bank would be looking at the sector as part of its six-monthly report on the stability of the financial system. The next report is due to be released in December.
The RBI declined to make any further comment on banks' exposure to bad real estate loans.
A rebound in the real estate market could alter the situation, but the outlook is looking increasingly bleak.
Several industry sources said builders were struggling to offload properties, even though they are ready to offer buyers up to 25% discounts on listed rates. The situation now is so severe that real estate inventories across India are at an all-time high of nearly four years and property prices have not risen in most parts of the country in the last 4-5 years.
Projects worth 1.8 trillion rupees ($25 billion) are stalled across India, according to property consultancy firm Anarock.
As developers go to the wall, more than half a million direct jobs may be lost in the coming months, the National Real Estate Development Council said. The number of indirect job losses from related industries like cement and steel may be even higher.
Slowing sales are piling on the pain, with buyers staying away because they increasingly can't afford properties.
The house price-to-income ratio, which measures the cost of housing versus the change in income levels, rose from 56.1 in March 2015 to 61.5 in March 2019, indicating home purchases have become less affordable.
While consumers are staying away, investors are also wary of residential purchases due to low rental yields and meager-to-negative capital appreciation.
""Sluggishness in sales is further raising concerns of the borrowers defaulting on the interest and EMI payments,"" said Parth Mehta, Managing Director, Paradigm Realty.
As the sector gets stressed further, repayments to lenders are likely to get further hit and banks will be increasingly unwilling to lend to property financiers and developers.
Pankaj Kapoor, chief executive of real estate consultancy firm Liases Foras, described the cash crunch in the sector as a ""bloodbath"" that would deteriorate further.
""This situation is likely to continue for another two years, which means builders may have to offer more discounts."""

The wind-driven blaze, dubbed the Saddleridge fire, broke out on Thursday night and raced through the area's dry foothills and brush-filled canyons to cover some 7,552 acres (3,056 hectares) by midday on Saturday.
The Los Angeles Fire Department said the fire was 19 percent contained after ""aggressive"" overnight air operations in support of ground crews, up from 13 percent a day earlier.
All mandatory evacuation orders were lifted over the course of the day, Mayor Eric Garcetti said.
""My heart goes out to those who have been impacted,"" Garcetti said in a statement. ""I am deeply grateful to the firefighters and first responders ... These brave women and men saved lives — and if not for their quick action, we know the destruction would have been much worse."" 
At least one death has been attributed to the Saddleridge fire, a man who authorities said suffered a heart attack while trying to fight encroaching flames on his property rather than heeding evacuation orders.
Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, the LAFD said, and 31 structures have been either damaged or destroyed.
The cause of the blaze was under investigation.
The Saddleridge is the largest among a spate of wildfires across Southern (NYSE:SO) California. 
On Saturday, authorities said the 820-acre Sandalwood Fire in Riverside County, about 70 miles (110 km) east of the Saddleridge fire, was 25% contained, up from 10% on Friday.
The Sandalwood Fire has killed at least two people: one was an 89-year-old woman and the other has not yet been identified, according to Riverside Deputy Sheriff Robyn Flores.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said Saturday it will boost strike pay for 48,000 hourly workers at General Motors Co (N:GM) by $25 a week to $275 as a strike against the largest U.S. automaker nears the end of its fourth week.
Talks were continuing late Saturday afternoon to try to resolve the longest nationwide strike at GM since 1970, both sides said.
The UAW also said it would allow members striking to take on part-time jobs without reducing their strike pay – as long as they perform picket-line duties. The strike pay hike was previously set to increase on Jan. 1.
Also Saturday, details of a revised GM contract offer emerged, with a person briefed on the matter confirming that GM had boosted its proposed ratification bonus by $1,000 to $9,000.
GM has proposed 3% pay raises in the second and fourth year of the four-year-contract and 3% and 4% lump sum payments in the first and fourth year respectively, the person confirmed. The company would agree to make temporary workers permanent with three years of service and they would get a $3,000 bonus upon ratification of the contract.
About 7% of GM's hourly workforce are temporary workers.
Details of the revised GM contract offer made earlier this week first emerged in a screen shot posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by an ABC-TV affiliate in Flint, Michigan. It's not clear if GM has since revised any proposals.
GM appealed directly to UAW employees in a blog post on Friday that laid out its latest offer aimed at ending the strike, drawing an angry response from the union that the automaker was trying to ""starve ... workers off the picket lines.""
The GM appeal highlighted the conflict that has already cost it more than $1 billion and has also forced it to idle about 10,000 workers in Mexico and Canada and idle operations throughout North America.
The UAW strike began on Sept. 16, with the union seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) estimated the loss could hit about $1.5 billion, and the Center for Automotive Research estimated the weekly costs to GM and the UAW strike fund at $450 million and $12 million, respectively.
As part of its revised offer, GM boosted the amount it plans to invest in the United States to about $9 billion from its previous offer of $7 billion, a source familiar with the offer said. The UAW responded with a counterproposal of its own on Friday.
Of the new total, $7.7 billion would be invested directly in GM plants and the rest in joint ventures including a potential battery plant near the Lordstown, Ohio, factory that has been idled, the source said.
The company said the offer also includes increased compensation through wages and one-time payments, preserves industry-leading healthcare benefits without increasing workers' costs and enhances profit sharing with unlimited upside.
One of the five issues still under discussion is the fate of four U.S. factories that GM has indicated could close."

Daimler said late on Friday that Germany's road traffic regulator KBA has concluded hearings over certain Mercedes-Benz vehicles with so-called OM651 diesel engines meeting Euro 5 emission standards and has ordered Daimler to carry out recalls.
Weekly Bild am Sonntag on Sunday reported a recall of Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vehicles was imminent after KBA warned the luxury carmaker that the transporter vans may contain illegal engine management software.
""Mercedes-Benz customers will be notified in writing over further actions if their vehicle is subject to the recall and a software update can be installed,"" the company said.
Daimler said a ""medium six figure"" number of vehicles would be affected by the recall, including 260,000 Sprinter vans from a previous generation of vehicles that went out of production in 2016, and that it was fully cooperating with the regulator. 
KBA proceedings with regard to engine control functionality were far advanced but not yet concluded, it said. More orders from the regulator could therefore not be ruled out.
Earnings would not be further affected by the KBA proceedings, it added.

In June, Daimler issued a profit warning and announced an increase of legal provisions by a high three-digit million euros amount, to cover various ongoing governmental proceedings and measures relating to diesel vehicles.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday urged a federal appeals court to block New York prosecutors from obtaining eight years of his tax returns, arguing that he was immune from criminal investigation as a sitting president.
In a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, Trump said there was ""broad bipartisan agreement, for decades if not centuries, that a sitting president cannot be subjected to criminal process.""
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, in August subpoenaed Trump's personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018 and other records from the president's longtime accounting firm Mazars USA.
In a separate filing on Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice argued that the court must block Vance from getting the tax returns until they have made a ""heightened and particularized showing of need for the documents' production.""
Though the Justice Department stopped short of saying Vance could not get the returns under any circumstances, it said it was ""unlikely"" he could demonstrate an immediate need for them because the U.S. Constitution bars states from prosecuting a sitting president.
""Recognition of these principles does not place the president above the law; it merely postpones initiation of any potential criminal prosecution until his term of office ends,"" the department said.
A spokesman for Vance's office declined to comment.
Vance's subpoena was part of a criminal probe into the Republican president and his family business. The scope of that probe is not publicly known.
Trump sued Vance's office in Manhattan federal court to block the subpoena. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero threw out Trump's lawsuit on Monday, calling his claim that he was immune from investigation ""repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values.""
The 2nd Circuit has put Marrero's order on hold, and is scheduled to hear arguments in the case on Oct. 23.
Vance's investigation comes amid an impeachment inquiry and investigations into Trump's finances by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Separately on Friday, a federal appeals court in Washington backed an effort by a House Oversight Committee to obtain Trump's financial records from Mazars.
Two other House committees are seeking to obtain Trump's financial records from  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF). The 2nd Circuit is currently considering a lawsuit by Trump to block them from getting those records, which do not include his tax returns.

The impeachment inquiry focuses on the president's request in a July phone call for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic former vice president Joe Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said it had received a temporary restraining order against the two offshore entities, which the regulator said had failed to register to sell 2.9 billion digital tokens called ""Grams"" to initial investors globally, including 1 billion to U.S. buyers. The move marks the latest effort by the agency to crack down on the fledgling cryptocurrency industry.
The SEC has taken the position that initial coin offerings are securities offerings and therefore subject to SEC offering rules, which require firms to file registration and disclosure documents.
""Our emergency action today is intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold,” Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement.
Telegram promised to give the coins to buyers when it launched its blockchain by Oct. 31, when the purchasers and the company would be able to sell them into U.S. markets, the SEC said. 

A lawyer for the companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

(Reuters) - PG&E Corp rejected a $2.5 billion offer from San Francisco to buy the bankrupt Californian company's power lines and other infrastructure within the city, calling the offer inadequate.
The offer significantly undervalued the assets and a deal would not be in the best interest of the company's customers, PG&E's chief executive officer, Bill Johnson, wrote in a letter to San Francisco Mayor London Breed and City Attorney Dennis Herrera.
The company's financing strategy to emerge from bankruptcy did not include selling off company assets, Johnson said in the letter, which was dated Oct. 7.
""Although we cannot accept your offer, we want to clearly communicate that PG&E intends to continue working with the City to best serve the citizens and businesses of San Francisco,"" Johnson wrote.
San Francisco had made the offer in September, eight months after the utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Breed and Herrera responded on Friday by saying that San Francisco would continue to pursue the acquisition of PG&E's electrical assets. They said in a statement that arguments made by the company on the proposal were ""inconsistent"" with the comprehensive analysis done by the city and its financial advisers. 

""We aren't surprised by PG&E's response so far,"" the two officials said. ""We're also not giving up. Now more than ever, it is clear that we must take back control of San Francisco's electric service and achieve energy independence.""

310,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 09:02PM ET</span>","GM appeals directly to employees as strike losses mount, riling UAW","By Ben Klayman and David Shepardson
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) took the unusual step of appealing directly to its unionized employees in a blog post on Friday that laid out its latest offer aimed at ending a month-long strike, drawing an angry response from the union that the automaker was trying to ""starve ... workers off the picket lines.""
While emphasizing GM's commitment to the collective bargaining process, the letter, signed by Gerald Johnson, executive vice-president for global manufacturing, circumvents United Auto Workers (UAW) leadership and points to frustration at a lack of progress on ending a conflict that has already cost the company more than $1 billion.
The UAW strike began on Sept. 16, with the union's 48,000 members at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) estimated the loss could hit about $1.5 billion, and the Center for Automotive Research estimated the weekly costs to GM and the UAW strike fund at $450 million and $12 million, respectively.
As part of its revised offer, GM boosted the amount it plans to invest in the United States to about $9 billion from its previous offer of $7 billion, a source familiar with the offer said.
Of the new total, $7.7 billion would be invested directly in GM plants, with the rest going to joint ventures including a potential battery plant near the Lordstown, Ohio, factory that has been idled, the source said.
GM stock closed up 2.6% at $35.57 on Friday.
The company said the offer also includes increased compensation through wages and one-time payments, preserving industry-leading healthcare benefits without increasing workers' costs, enhanced profit sharing with unlimited upside and a higher ratification bonus than the $8,000 previously offered.
For temporary workers, GM said its offer would create a path to permanent employment and include a ratification bonus.
""The strike has been hard on you, your families, our communities, the company, our suppliers and dealers,"" Johnson said. ""We have advised the union that it's critical that we get back to producing quality vehicles for our customers.""
The UAW in a statement said GM was ""playing games at the expense of workers"" and accused the automaker of ""purposefully stalling the process to starve UAW-GM workers off the picket lines.""
""At every step of the way, GM has attempted to undermine the ongoing, good-faith efforts the UAW has made to end this strike,"" the union said.
In a subsequently released video https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MygB9CMeLtbChEMx33U8XMG_y2T92bKc/view, the UAW's lead GM negotiator, Terry Dittes, said the union would bargain at the table and not through the media. ""Let me be clear: the company's strategy of releasing half-truths does nothing to reach a final settlement."" 
GM responded with a statement from its senior vice president of communications, Tony Cervone: ""The goal of our communication has been to inform – not incite. We will continue to provide information in a straightforward, and importantly, factual way.""
Nevertheless, negotiations continued after that exchange and late on Friday the UAW said it had given GM a counterproposal that covered five unresolved issues the two sides have been discussing, Dittes said in a letter. ""If GM accepts and agrees to this group of proposals, we will have a tentative agreement,"" he said.
GM declined to comment on the new union proposal.
FIVE ISSUES
In a Thursday letter to UAW leaders, GM urged the union to agree to around-the-clock negotiations, while the union insisted in its own letter on dealing with the five issues first before it responded to the broader proposal made to union negotiators Monday.
GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra met on Wednesday with UAW President Gary Jones and Dittes to urge a faster response by the union to the company's last offer.
One of the five issues the committees are discussing is the fate of four U.S. factories that GM has indicated could close, according to the UAW letter. Other issues include future technological changes to production and the fate of the UAW-GM joint training center. Dittes said he did not know when the issues would be resolved, suggesting a final deal may not be close.
UAW workers are concerned that as GM shifts to more electric vehicles it will require fewer workers, and that workers in battery production plants may earn less than those at existing transmission plants.
Reuters previously reported GM told the UAW it could build a new battery plant near the now-shuttered Lordstown factory, and assemble an electric truck at its Detroit Hamtramck plant.
Moody's said in a Friday report that GM must maintain its flexibility under any new deal to build electric and self-driving vehicles without its fixed costs rising further. It said GM's annual costs in wages and benefits are more than $1 billion higher than foreign automakers operating U.S. plants.
""We expect that the long-term strategic benefits of obtaining a UAW contract ... will outweigh the costs of enduring a protracted strike that might last into November,"" Moody's said.

The UAW's membership is largely in the Midwest, in states that could be critical to both sides in the November 2020 presidential election, so the strike has drawn the attention of Republican President Donald Trump, his rivals seeking the Democratic nomination, and U.S. lawmakers. They have urged GM to build more vehicles in the United States and shift work from Mexico.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 08:44PM ET</span>",Boeing board strips CEO of chairman title amid 737 MAX crisis,"By Nivedita Balu and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) board has stripped chief executive Dennis Muilenburg of his chairmanship title, in an unexpected strategy shift announced by the U.S. planemaker on Friday only hours after a global aviation panel criticized development of the troubled 737 MAX.
Separating the roles, which will enable Muilenburg to have ""maximum focus"" on steering daily operations, was the latest step the board has taken in recent weeks to improve executive oversight of its engineering ranks and industrial operations. 
Lead Director David Calhoun, a senior managing director at Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group, will takeover as non-executive chairman, Boeing said in its announcement, which came late on Friday afternoon without warning. It added that the board had ""full confidence"" in Muilenburg, who will retain the top job and remain on the board.
The decision came as Boeing struggles to get its best-selling 737 MAX back into service following a worldwide safety ban in March triggered by two crashes that killed a total of 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
It also comes some six months after Muilenburg survived a shareholder motion to split his chairman and CEO roles, part of the intense pressure he has faced during the worst crisis of his four years at the helm of the world's largest planemaker.
""This decision is the latest of several actions by the board of directors and Boeing senior leadership to strengthen the company's governance and safety management processes,"" the company said. 
INTENSE SCRUTINY 
Earlier on Friday, an international aviation panel criticized U.S. regulators and Boeing over the certification of the plane.
An internal review in August revealed that the company was working to reorganize its engineering reporting lines company-wide and ensure higher ranking officials, including its CEO, get faster feedback about potential safety concerns from lower levels of the company.
As part of the move, Muilenburg received granular weekly reports of potential safety issues discussed at meetings of rank-and-file engineers. 
It also plans to name a new director with deep safety experience and expertise to serve on the board and its newly created Aerospace Safety Committee in the near term, Boeing said.
Muilenburg is set to testify before a U.S. House panel on Oct. 30 and lawmakers have raised questions about Boeing's actions prior to the 737 MAX certification. Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Transportation Department Inspector General and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the plane's approval. 
The company is also facing more than 100 lawsuits over the crashes alleging design flaws allowed erroneous sensor data to set off an automated anti-stall system and overwhelm pilots.
MORE DELAYS
Earlier this week, Reuters reported that a key certification test flight would likely not take place until at least Nov. 1, a move that will push its approval to resume flights until at least December.
On Friday, United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) became the latest U.S. airline to say it would not resume 737 MAX flights until January.
Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis had urged Boeing to split the role of chairman and CEO in April, saying shareholders would benefit from a robust form of independent oversight. 

Muilenburg is set to testify before a U.S. House panel on Oct. 30. Lawmakers have raised questions about Boeing’s actions prior to the 737 MAX certification.

In a statement, BNDES said Andre Laloni was leaving, citing personal reasons. Leonardo Cabral will temporarily replace him, it said.
Laloni had been facing some internal resistance regarding his plans for the sale of some BNDES assets since he was appointed to oversee loans and investments in July, one source inside the bank told Reuters.
BNDES Chief Executive Officer Gustavo Montezano said in July that the bank was looking to expedite the sale of nearly $27 billion in listed assets.
Laloni had wanted to sell shares in Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3) jointly with state-owned bank Caixa Economica Federal, but the plans were shelved as not all directors agreed with the deal, the source said, adding that Laloni had also unsuccessfully tried to change divestment procedures at BNDES.

(Reuters) - U.S. power company  Sempra Energy  (N:SRE) is near an agreement to sell its Chilean business to State Grid Corporation of China for close to $3 billion, the latest deal in its bid to shed non-core assets, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Sempra has been seeking to bolster its finances and increase its appeal to investors after a wave of wildfires in California exposed it and other utilities to more legal liabilities. It also came under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp and investment firm Bluescape Group to scale back its global operations.
Sempra's deal with State Grid Corporation of China could be announced as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning it was still possible that negotiations may falter at the last minute and asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Sempra declined to comment, while State Grid Corporation of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
China, whose booming economy over the past two decades has driven up demand for South America's raw materials, has been investing more in Chile as it seeks to secure resources.
Chile, among Latin America's most open economies and the world's top copper exporter, has sought to remain neutral amid the growing trade tensions between China and the United States, promoting instead the need for open markets.
Sempra said in January it would wind down its South American businesses. Last month, it announced it would sell its Peruvian businesses to a unit of China Yangtze Power Co for $3.6 billion, as it focuses on its core U.S. and Mexican markets.
Elliott has now exited its investment in Sempra, according to its latest quarterly regulatory filing.
Sempra's Chilean businesses include Chilquinta Energía SA, the third-largest distributor of electricity in the country, and Tecnored SA, which provides construction services to Chilquinta.
State Grid Corporation of China beat out a number of other bidders. Italian utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) had said in June it had made a bid for both the Chilean and Peruvian businesses.
Based in San Diego, Sempra owns power utilities that collectively have the largest U.S. customer base. It has about 40 million customers, and is active in California, Texas and Mexico. It also participates in the export market for liquefied natural gas, with Saudi Aramco as one of its clients."

(Reuters) - Shepard Smith, the chief news anchor of Fox News and a sometime critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, abruptly quit the network on Friday after 23 years.
In an unexpected on-air statement at the end of his daily ""Shepard Smith Reporting"" show, Smith said he had asked to leave the conservative-leaning cable news network, which is the most-watched in the United States.
His farewell message ended with the hope that ""the truth will always matter.""
""Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News. After requesting that I stay, they obliged. Under our agreement I won't be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future,"" Smith said.
""Even in our currently polarized nation, it's my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will survive,"" Smith said.
Smith, who was also managing editor of the network's breaking news unit, has been one of the few senior journalists on Fox News to criticize Trump.
His departure follows attacks by Trump on the network's less friendly coverage of his administration since the U.S. House of Representatives began an impeachment inquiry, which opinion polls suggest has growing support from Americans.
The New York Times reported earlier on Friday that U.S. Attorney General William Barr met this week with Rupert Murdoch, whose Fox Corp owns Fox News.
""FoxNews doesn’t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I’m President!,"" Trump tweeted on Thursday.
In March, Smith took issue with Trump's criticism of the late Republican Senator John McCain, and in August Smith spoke out about the ""unmistakable rise of white nationalism and white racism in America"" which Democrats say Trump has not done enough to discourage.
In September, Smith called out Trump for his mistaken insistence that the state of Alabama was in the path of Hurricane Dorian. 
Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the U.S. media as ""the enemy of the people,"" has lashed out publicly against Shepard.
""Watching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith, the lowest rated show on @FoxNews,"" Trump tweeted in August.
Smith has been with Fox News since it was launched in 1996 and his departure took colleagues by surprise.
""Shepard Smith just dropped a bomb ... He was part of the glue that held Fox together. He is a supreme pro who made us all better,"" Fox News chief White House correspondent John Roberts tweeted on Friday.
Fox News President Jay Wallace in a statement called Smith ""one of the premier newscasters of his generation.""

""While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network,” Wallace said.

SILAO, Mexico (Reuters) - Half a continent away from the auto plants of Detroit, U.S. strikes at General Motors (NYSE:GM) have sent shivers through the central Mexican city of Silao, where the local GM factory furloughed 6,000 workers last week when parts from the United States ran out.
Rich or poor, residents are anxiously hoping the labor dispute will end so the company reopens the plant, which has been an anchor of the local economy since GM arrived a generation ago, transforming the landscape forever.
""General Motors is the biggest source of income here. When General Motors stops, everything stops,"" said Silao resident Francisco Vazquez. ""Before General Motors, there was nothing.""
Once a provincial backwater with a handful of colorful old churches, Silao is now enveloped in a thick cordon of factories and warehouses serving automotive companies from all over the world.
In the years after GM opened the Silao plant in 1995, dozens of other firms followed, such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Continental and Pirelli. Meanwhile the city's home state, Guanajuato, drew in plants from carmakers including Mazda, Honda and Toyota.
Tensions over the future of manufacturing in North America are at the heart of the mass GM walkout. The debate has pitted U.S. labor advocates eager to reduce Mexico's cost advantage against Mexican trade unions fighting to protect local jobs.
In the United States, the average GM assembly employee earns about $30 per hour before tax. By contrast, an assembly worker in Silao with 10 years experience was, until the shutdown, getting about $4.50 per hour before tax, including benefits like shopping vouchers, according to a pay-slip he showed Reuters.
When Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, he pledged to bring back manufacturing jobs lost since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in 1994. He also vowed to slash illegal immigration from Mexico.
Yet Silao's labor leaders say moving jobs from Mexico to the United States will only increase pressure on Mexican workers to migrate.
""It's important to keep jobs in Mexico for the sake of the United States,"" said Hugo Varela, the Guanajuato boss of Mexico's CTM trade union confederation, which represents GM workers. ""It's what stops migration to the United States,"" he added. ""If there aren't jobs here, people will try to cross.""
In addition, the GM strike has Mexican business leaders worried that industrial unrest could spread here, where the leftist government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to help strengthen trade unions.
More than a dozen local workers, union officials and contractors of GM told Reuters their priority was defending local jobs. There has been little indication that Mexican autoworkers will show solidarity with the UAW.
EMPTY PARKING LOTS, ODD JOBS
Operations at the GM Silao plant ground to a halt on Oct. 1. Vast parking lots in front of the cream-yellow building were mostly empty this week. Fast food sellers set up on the perimeter of the sprawling plant complained business was bad, and local GM workers said they were trying to make ends meet with odd jobs.
The GM worker with the pay-slip said that during his furlough he was only receiving 55% of his regular wage. He shook his head when asked if he might strike to pressure GM for full pay. His chief concern, he said, was to keep his job - or ensure a proper severance.
""Maybe we'd go on strike if they tried to take the plant away,"" said the GM worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because he worried he could be fired for talking to the media.
The Silao shutdown has sparked temporary layoffs at another GM site in Mexico and some major suppliers locally, including American Axle & Manufacturing (N:AXL), employees said.
In Washington, the GM strike has complicated Trump's push to get Congress to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the trade deal he brokered to replace NAFTA.
Democratic lawmakers allied with unions are resisting, saying Mexico must do more to implement tougher labor rules.
U.S. and Canadian unions accuse their Mexican peers of flouting international standards to undercut them, and hope tougher laws will make Mexico less attractive to offshoring.
Over the past two decades, Mexican annual automobile output has jumped 165% to more than 4.1 million according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, lifting Mexico from 11th to 6th place in the global rankings.
""GETTING DESPERATE""
By July 2019, the automotive industry made up more than 30% of the value of Mexico's total exports. Some 80% of those are sent to the United States, making Mexico highly sensitive to U.S. industrial disputes.
The U.S. strike at the No. 1 U.S. carmaker began on Sept. 16, with its 48,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union seeking more pay and job security, a bigger share of company profits and protection of healthcare benefits.
In Silao, fears about the local economy are growing.
Jose Juan Campos, a contractor who said he had worked regularly at the GM plant from its opening until the strike, said he had never known a stoppage like it and that the firm was unlikely to take back many workers before Christmas.

""People are getting desperate,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended more than 1% higher on Friday though well off the day's highs after the announcement of a partial trade deal between the United States and China.
Indexes cut their gains late in the session as the deal was announced amid worries over the possibility of further flare-ups before the agreement is finalized, strategists said.
President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters after talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, said the United States and China had come to a substantial phase-1 trade deal, reaching agreement on intellectual property, financial services and big agricultural purchases.
The preliminary, partial deal was the biggest step toward resolving a 15-month tariff war between the world's two largest economies.
The market had risen in recent days due to optimism for an agreement and the S&P 500 (SPX) was up as much as about 1.9% earlier in the session.
""The main reason the market rallied the past couple of days was hope that there would be an agreement, even a small agreement, and that this trade war would be done for the foreseeable future,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
""It looks like while there is an agreement, this is still going to ... drag out and be an issue.""
Top-level discussions between the two countries concluded their second day on Friday.
Cyclicals were among the day's best-performing groups, with the S&P industrial index (SPLRCI) up about 2% ahead of the third-quarter earnings season, which is set to begin next week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 319.92 points, or 1.21%, to 26,816.59, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 32.14 points, or 1.09%, to 2,970.27 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 106.27 points, or 1.34%, to 8,057.04.
Indexes also gained for the week, with the Dow and Nasdaq up 0.9% each and the S&P 500 up 0.6%.
The timing of the trade news had a lot to do with the late-day volatility, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""There were 15 minutes to go in the trading day on a Friday ... after the Dow had risen 700 points in the last two days,"" he said. ""Anything that was less than a comprehensive agreement was likely to see some degree of market sell off.""
Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to have declined 3.2% year-on-year in the third quarter, which would mark the first fall since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Bets for another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve fell after data showed a rise in consumer sentiment for the month of October.
Apple's stock (O:AAPL) rose 2.7% as Wedbush raised its price target, citing confidence in the company's new video streaming service.
The S&P industrial index was boosted by a 17.2% jump in shares of  Fastenal Co  (O:FAST) after the industrial distributor beat quarterly profit expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.08-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 60 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.59 billion shares, compared to the roughly 7 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."

The UK Civil Aviation Authority was forced to begin flying more than 150,000 tourists home last month after the world’s oldest travel company failed to secure investment to keep flying.
Transport minister Grant Shapps said he wanted to change the current system to allow failed airlines to be placed in special administration, so the company’s planes and crew can keep flying meaning passengers can return home faster.
The government was unable to use Thomas Cook aeroplanes and instead had to build what was in effect a temporary airline, using spare capacity from other operators, to bring passengers back.
""The recent collapse of Thomas Cook demonstrated not only the impact of the collapse of a major airline on both staff and passengers, but also the complexity and cost of repatriating those affected,"" Shapps said.
""Being able to make use of existing assets and staff in order to get people home will help to cut the costs of these repatriation efforts when they occur, make repatriation easier to deliver and also reduce the disruption felt by passengers.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said the new legislation will be included in the government's Queen's speech on Monday. It typically lists the main priorities and legislation the government aims to pass.
The idea of using dormant aircraft was included in a list of recommendations in a government review earlier this year conducted after the collapse of Monarch Airlines in 2017, which left more than 100,000 tourists stranded overseas.
""Being able to make use of existing assets and staff in order to get people home will help to cut the costs of these repatriation efforts when they occur, make repatriation easier to deliver and also reduce the disruption felt by passengers,"" Shapps said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had insufficient personnel to oversee the certification of new Boeing (NYSE:BA) airplanes and should make significant reforms in how it approves new aircraft, an international aviation panel said Friday.
The panel also faulted assumptions made by the airplane manufacturer in designing the 737 MAX and for not disclosing more information to the FAA.
Reuters reported on a draft copy of the Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) findings and recommendations earlier on Friday that called for sweeping changes in how the FAA evaluates and certifies new airplanes. 
Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat who chairs the House Transportation Committee, said Friday, the report ""raises new and disturbing questions about the separation between regulator and manufacturer."" Democratic Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal said the report confirms ""our worst fears about a failed broken system of aviation safety scrutiny.""
JATR panel Chairman Christopher Hart, a former chair of the National Transportation Safety Bord, told reporters on Friday he thinks the aviation certification system is not broken but needs to be improved, adding the review found ""communication failures.""
""There were a lot of good people trying to do the right thing in sometimes difficult circumstances,"" Hart said, adding a key issue is ""how do we make sure everybody knows what they need to know.""
The report also said the FAA did not closely evaluate a key safety system known as MCAS involved in two fatal crashes of the MAX in five months that killed 346 people and prompted the plane's grounding in March.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said Friday the agency would respond to all recommendations in the ""unvarnished"" review.
At issue is the long-standing practice of the FAA delegating certification tasks to Boeing and other manufacturers. Many critics say the FAA should take a bigger role.
The report said the FAA had just 45 people in an office overseeing Boeing's Organization Designation Authority (ODA) and its 1,500 employees.
In the 737 MAX, the FAA initially delegated 40% of the certification tasks and boosted that figure as the five-year review progressed, including the review of MCAS. The panel said, ""FAA involvement in the certification of MCAS would likely have resulted in design changes that would have improved safety.""
Boeing is revising the 737 MAX software to require the MCAS system to receive input from both Angle of Attack sensors, and has added additional safeguards. If the AOA sensors differ by 5.5 degrees or more then MCAS cannot operate.
The FAA's office oveseeing Boeing has just 24 engineers and they face a wide range of tasks to ensure compliance in overseeing Boeing's 737, 747, 767, 777, and 787 programs.
The review added there are only two technical FAA staff assigned per Boeing program and some are ""new engineers with limited airworthiness experience.""
The review also found ""signs of undue pressure"" on Boeing employees performing tasks for the FAA, ""which may be attributed to conflicting priorities and an environment that does not support FAA requirements.""
DeFazio said, ""Undue pressure may have been placed on individuals at the FAA and Boeing to get the MAX into service as quickly as possible."" 
The panel said the FAA should review delegation procedures ""to remove undue burdens and barriers between the Boeing (office) and the FAA and promote cultural changes at both organizations.""
Those Boeing employees should be able to directly talk to FAA technical staff ""without fear of reprisal,"" the review added.
Boeing did not respond to criticism in the report but said it is ""committed to working with the FAA in reviewing the recommendations and helping to continuously improve the process and approach used to validate and certify airplanes.""
A U.S. Senate panel last month approved legislation to increase aviation safety budgets by $31.8 million and require the FAA to finalize its rule-making on safety management systems for aircraft manufacturers.
The aviation panel report also said the FAA must ensure manufacturers ""provide a full list of all aircraft proposed changes (no matter how trivial)."" 
The JATR, which was commissioned in April by the FAA, includes air safety regulators from the United States, Canada, China, Indonesia, European Union, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Japan, and the five-month review included FAA officials who were not part of the 737 MAX certification.

Deputy FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told Congress in March the agency would need an additional 10,000 employees that would cost $1.8 billion if it were to assume all responsibilities for aircraft certification.

319,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 05:34PM ET</span>",Stocks -- Trade Deal Sends Wall Street Soaring,"Investing.com - Stocks finished at their highest levels in about two weeks as President Donald Trump touted a ""substantial phase one deal"" that resolves some of the trade disputes between the United States and China.
The trade deal includes scrapping imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports due next week and a Chinese pledge to buy more farm products.
The rally was very broad and saw the Dow Jones industrials climb more than 517 points before a strong wave of profit-taking set in and cut the gain by 38% to about 320 points. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit a new intraday high of $237.63, accompanied by a host of big stocks.
The S&P 500 finished up 1.09% but failed for a 16th day to close above 3,000.
The Nasdaq Composite climbed about 1.34%, or 106 points, closing above 8,000 for the first time since Sept. 26.
The Nasdaq 100, dominated by big tech stocks, added 1.34% or nearly 104 points, with Apple, up 2.7%, adding 23 points to the gain by itself.
In addition, Apple, plus Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) contributed a total of 48.6 points to the Nasdaq-100's gain. 
The size of the selloff was biggest in the last 25 minutes of trading. It could be that some investors (or the computer algorithms that guide their trading) were put off by Trump's use of the phrase Phase 1, suggesting that there's much more to negotiate and much more that's contentious. The biggest would be technology theft.
It could also be the classic idea of ""buy the hype and sell the news"" came into play. Markets waited all day for an announcement, and there was enough uncertainty left over to set off the selling.
The {0|Dow}} was led by stocks with overseas exposure that would benefit by a thaw in U.S.-Chinese intensions:   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT), chemical giant Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Only four Dow stocks were lower, with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) the laggard. 
Only six Nasdaq 100 stocks were lower. The leader for the day was Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST), maker of fasteners and vending machines used in industrial settings. The company reported a huge earnings beat. The shares jumped more than 17%, its second-best percentage gain since going public in 1987. 
Fastenal, Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX), fertilizer maker Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) were the top S&P 500 performers. The latter three especially would benefit from the projected U.S.-China trade deal.
The S&P 500 biggest laggards include California utility giant Edison International (NYSE:EIX), gold producer Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM), market-platform operator MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX) and Church & Dwight Company (NYSE:CHD), whose products include Arm & Hammer baking soda.
Interest rates rose as investors sold bonds to move to riskier assets. The 10-Year Treasury yield moved up to 1,767% from Thursday's 1.656%.
Oil prices moved more than 2% higher, in part because of the progress of the trade talks, which would be a boon to global growth. Prices also moved up on reports of an attack on an Iranian oil tanker."

323,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 04:12PM ET</span>",Fed’s Plan to Buy Treasury Bills Could Be an Expensive Ordeal,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s attempt to keep U.S. funding markets calm by rebuilding its cache of bank reserves could be expensive.
The Fed said Friday it will begin buying $60 billion of Treasury bills per month -- with maturities ranging from five weeks to a year -- at least through the second quarter of 2020 to improve its control over the benchmark rate it uses to guide monetary policy. It’s the central bank’s latest measure meant to prevent a repeat of the mid-September turmoil that rocked money markets.
But the Fed may have to pay up to convince people to part with the securities since investors are clamoring to hold bills. Money funds’ holdings of them topped $1 trillion in September, according to Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC. “Funds love them,” Crane said.
Money-market reforms from 2016 spurred record inflows into government funds, driving demand for assets like repurchase agreements, Treasury bills and short-term agency debt. Regulations also require daily and weekly liquidity thresholds for money-market funds, and T-bills can satisfy those requirements.
“Everybody’s got bills somewhere, but it’s shaking those out in size that the Fed wants,” said Blake Gwinn, strategist at NatWest Markets. “I’m wondering what kind of premium the Fed is going to have to pay to get them.”
Even though primary dealer holdings of Treasuries are about $190 billion, their T-bill levels are quite low by comparison: around $7 billion. There’s not enough bills to buy just from the primary dealers, and so the Fed is going to have to convince other investors -- like money funds or corporations -- to part with their T-bills.
However, money markets -- particularly the government ones -- need the Treasuries, both as an investment vehicle, but also because they satisfy fund liquidity requirements. Fed purchases could drive yields down. If a money manager’s objective is to generate as much yield as possible for investors, why sell to the Fed at a lower rate? All that’s going to happen is the fund has to reinvest it in bills at a lower rate, reducing the yield the fund offers investors.
In addition to the Treasury bill purchases, the central bank said Friday that it will continue to conduct overnight and term repo operations through January, if not longer. The Fed has done liquidity injections like these since Sept. 17, and they’ve helped calm this vital funding market."

Under the pact, the U.S. is suspending a planned tariff increase for Oct. 15, and China agreed to some agricultural concessions.
Still, he told reporters at the White House on Friday that the deal isn’t in writing yet. Trump said it will take three to five weeks to put on paper.
While the limited agreement may resolve some short-term issues, several of the thorniest disputes remain. U.S. goals in the trade war center around accusations of intellectual-property theft, forced technology transfer and complaints about Chinese industrial subsidies.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the initial deal includes opening markets to financial services firms.

(Reuters) - A U.S. Bankruptcy Judge signaled support on Friday for a six-month pause to litigation led by 24 states against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP to give the company time to settle thousands of lawsuits alleging it fueled a deadly nationwide opioid crisis.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, said there was little benefit from numerous states trying to prove at trial the liability of Purdue and its controlling Sacker family for improper marketing of opioids.
""A trial is at best a limited way to get to the truth,"" said Drain, adding that verdicts often result in debates about the meaning of the outcome.
""There are trials where people stand up and say 'I did it.' But that mostly happens on Perry Mason,"" he said, referring to the popular TV show from the 1950s and '60s featuring a lawyer who won virtually every case.
Drain was asked to pause for about six months more than 2,600 lawsuits against the privately-held company and controlling Sackler family for their part in the opioid crisis, which has led to some 400,000 deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to U.S. statistics.
The company filed for bankruptcy last month to build support for a proposed settlement that it values at more than $10 billion, and said the pause in litigation will preserve money spent on legal fees.
Most of the lawsuits were brought by local governments, and most back the deal, but at least 24 states oppose it.
Drain said the public deserves an accounting of the company's role in the crisis, but he feared a ""trial becomes an autopsy"" that destroys the value of Purdue.
He suggested a court-ordered examiner could investigate the company and Sacklers, as was done in the bankruptcies of Enron Corp and Lehman Brothers.
The settlement proposes to transfer Purdue's ownership from the Sacklers to a public trust owned by the plaintiffs. In addition, the family has also pledged to contribute at least $3 billion to the settlement.
Purdue's lawyer Marshall Huebner spelled out an agreement struck on Friday morning between the company, the Sacklers and the official committee of unsecured creditors.
The creditors committee would be charged with vetting the proposed settlement and Purdue would provide millions of pages of documents. The Sacklers would provide an accounting of their wealth and would agree to refrain from taking any material action with their property.
The agreement does not bind the hold-out states, but Drain urged them to join the negotiations.
The hearing was still underway on Friday afternoon."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Citibank (N:C) has agreed to pay a $30 million fine to settle charges of repeated violations of real estate holding rules and for failing to meet its commitment to take corrective actions, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said on Friday.
Federal law limits the time a national bank may hold foreclosed and ""other real estate owned"" (OREO) assets.
In 2015, Citi said it lacked adequate processes to effectively monitor the holding period, and committed to developing and taking corrective actions, but it did not do so, the OCC said.
As a result, between 2017 and 2019, the bank committed over 200 violations in South Dakota related to the statutory holding period for OREO assets.
On Friday, a Citi spokesman said the bank did not meet the holding requirement in some instances, but customers were not affected.

""Since identifying the issue, we have strengthened controls, processes and procedures to ensure the timely disposition of these assets,"" the Citi spokesman said.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) ousted chief executive Thierry Bollore on Friday, as the French carmaker and its Japanese partner Nissan (T:7201) seek to rekindle their alliance following the scandal-hit tenure of former alliance supremo Carlos Ghosn.
Tensions between Renault and Nissan, which picked a new CEO on Tuesday, have been high since Ghosn's arrest in Tokyo last year on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies.
Bollore, who was close to Ghosn and had strained relations with Nissan's previous boss, will be replaced on an interim basis by Renault finance director Clotilde Delbos. 
With new faces at the helm, Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard is hoping to draw a line under almost a year of turmoil and revive cooperation between two carmakers once seen as destined to fully merge. 
That is vital at a time when auto markets are slowing and carmakers are having to invest in costly new technologies as well as meet challenging European emissions regulations. 
""We're at a new stage now for this alliance. Sometimes you need new management ... to breathe new life into things,"" Senard, who was brought in earlier this year from tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), told a news conference in Paris. 
He said three members of Renault's 18-strong board abstained in the vote to remove Bollore, who hit out at his looming dismissal in a newspaper interview the night before, calling it a coup. 
Following Ghosn's arrest, a feeling of stagnation around joint Renault-Nissan projects, including on issues such as advancing on cost savings, had begun to set in, people at Renault have said. These would now be the first priority, according to a source close to the carmaker.
""There are a lot of concrete matters that have already been identified, including on the industrial front: working on batteries, electric vehicles, connectivity, purchasing and self-driving cars,"" the source said. 
Shares in Renault closed up 5.1%. 
'COUP DE FORCE'
Tensions between Renault and Nissan were further inflamed this year, including during various spats over governance reforms, and after a failed deal to pair Renault up with  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), which withdrew a merger offer. 
Senard reiterated on Friday that a tie-up with Fiat, which was abandoned in June, was not at present on the agenda. 
The chairman denied there had been pressure from Nissan or from the French state - which has a 15% stake in Renault - to remove Bollore in a kind of quid pro quo.
""It so happens that Nissan's governance has shifted. There is no link between the two,"" Senard said. ""At no time did anyone from Nissan put the question of Mr Bollore on the table."" 
Renault, the dominant partner in the alliance with a 43% stake in Nissan, named two deputies to back up Delbos - top sales executive Olivier Murguet and a senior manufacturing and supply chain chief, Jose-Vicente de los Mozos.
The triumvirate has echoes of the new top team announced on Tuesday by Nissan. 
The Japanese firm picked Makoto Uchida, previously the head of its Chinese business, to replace Hiroto Saikawa, who stepped down as CEO in September after he admitted to being improperly overpaid. 
Uchida is known for close ties to Renault, which could help mend fences in the alliance. 
Saikawa and Bollore barely spoke and were seen as clear irritants to the relationship between the two companies, French official and company sources told Reuters in June.
Before his ouster, Ghosn had been working on a plan for a full merger of Renault and Nissan, but had met resistance in Japan, which is concerned about French government influence in the alliance. 
Bollore said he had only found out his job could be on the line in a French press report on Tuesday. 

""The brutality and the totally unexpected character of what is happening are stupefying ... This coup de force is very worrying,"" he told Les Echos newspaper on Thursday evening.

(Reuters) - WeWork said on Friday it will shut down its WeGrow private school in New York City after the current school year, as the company focuses on its main office-sharing business.
The company is cutting back, including laying off some employees and closing or selling entities that are not essential to its core operations as it seeks to avoid running out of cash.
WeWork, which had to abandon an initial public offering on September 30 because of investor concerns about how it was valued and its business model, is currently seeking new financing from its major shareholder SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), sources have told Reuters. 
WeWork said in a statement it will continue to operate WeGrow through the 2019/2020 school year, and that ""WeWork and the families of WeGrow students are engaging in discussions with interested parties regarding plans for WeGrow for the following school year.""
Last week, parents picking up their children outside the WeGrow elementary school in Manhattan's Chelsea district expressed hope that it would continue to stay open, but said they had not received much information from administrators.
WeGrow, which took in children as young as two years old, was founded by Rebekah Neumann, the wife of former WeWork chief executive Adam Neumann who resigned last month. 

The school charged between $22,000 to $42,000 for annual tuition based on the student's age.

Wedbush raised its price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $265 from $245, on expectations that Apple could scoop up as many as 100 million streaming consumers over the next three-to-four years. Apple) rose nearly 2% to an all time intraday high of $235.16, above its previous intraday record of $233.47. The stock is on track to set a new closing high after closing at $230.09 on Thursday.
The shares are up nearly 49% this year after dropping more than 30% in the 2018 fourth quarter alone. From the stock's 52-week low of $142, reached on Jan. 3, the shares are up 65%.
 
“With some 900 million active iPhones globally, Apple could get 100 million streaming consumers in 3 to 4 years, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note. That could “disrupt roughly 10% of target customer base within the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives added.
The road to record highs for Apple has also been paved by signs that demand for its latest slate of iPhones is firmer than many had expected.
Apple reportedly asked its suppliers to increase production by up to 10%, or 8 million units, Nikkei reported last week. The uptick in production has been driven by better-than-expected demand, according to Wedbush. 
""China as a region is currently one of the main catalysts of demand for the iPhone 11 and is tracking roughly 20% ahead of plan, which is a surprise to many investors in light of the current UFC trade battle between the US and China with pro Huawei and competitive worries abound,"" Wedbush said. 
Ahead of the release of the latest iPhones, some on Wall Street had expected demand for the latest iPhones would be weak on expectations that consumers are waiting for a 5G model of the phone. 
But that proved somewhat of a misstep, forcing many on Wall street including Nomura, Canaccord and Longbow Research to upgrade their outlook on the iPhone maker."
334,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Bruised U.S. banks expected to report third quarter earnings decline,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The biggest U.S. banks are expected to kick off the earnings season on a sour note next week due to falling interest rates, which may have pressured net interest margins enough to cause the sector's first year-over-year earnings per share decline in three years.
While strength in mortgage banking and cheap valuations could provide support to the S&P 500 bank index , its performance depends on what reassurance executives provide on credit conditions, the outlook for loan growth and their ability to reduce deposit costs during their conference calls.
Tuesday brings third quarter profit reports from  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Wells Fargo  and Co (N:WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), and Goldman Sachs (N:GS). Bank of America (N:BAC) reports on Wednesday.
The biggest U.S. banks will report a 1.2% decline in third-quarter earnings, while revenue is seen rising 0.9%, according to data aggregated by Refinitiv analyst David Aurelio. This would be the first profit decline since the same quarter in 2016, according to data from Factset.
""Overall it's shaping up to be a pretty challenging quarter because of the net interest rate environment,"" said Fred Cannon, director of research for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, citing the flattening and temporary inversion of the U.S. Treasury 2-year/10-year yield curve during the quarter.
Bank profits depend heavily on net interest income, or the difference between the rate they charge for long-term loans and the rate they pay for short-term borrowing.
Executives from Citi, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all cut their full-year forecasts for net interest income last month, citing macroeconomic concerns.
Part of the problem is U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in July and September. And futures traders are betting on more Fed rate cuts going forward, including one in October.
As a result, bank investors will listen for executive reassurance on the net interest margin outlook and their ability to mitigate weakness, said Manulife Investment Management's Lisa Welch, who manages the John Hancock Regional Bank Fund.
One offset to lower lending profits would be a reduction in interest rates banks pay their customers for deposits, as those rates rose while the Fed was hiking interest rates.
""There's going to be a lot of questions on how fast banks are able to bring down their deposit costs as loan yields are coming down,"" said Welch, adding that she does not expect deposit costs ""to come down as quickly as loan yields have fallen.""
Mortgages may be another silver lining to lower rates in third-quarter numbers and future quarters as borrowers avail of cheaper rates. Refinancing, which accounts for most mortgage applications, has more than doubled from a year ago, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released on Wednesday.
""With rates being lower, we think mortgage activity will be very strong,"" said Welch, pointing to First Horizon (N:FHN) as one bank that could benefit from mortgage demand.
Bank of America and Wells Fargo should also benefit, according to KBW's Cannon. To cope with rising demand, Wells Fargo is boosting its mortgage team, according to a memo seen by Reuters this week.
But investors will also be on high alert for signs slowing U.S. economic growth is hurting debt repayments, said Mike Cronin, investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""Given that we've had some economic data that's been a little weaker is there any trend in credit costs that raises concerns going into 2020?"" said Cronin.
So far, strong credit quality and bank balance sheets have reassured KBW's Cannon, who is neutral on the sector. ""But if we start to see meaningful credit deterioration that would change our minds about how we think about the banks,"" he said.
Cannon did not recommend buying banks going into earnings season due to the likelihood ""consensus estimates come down in the quarter."" But on the plus side, he said, valuations do seem to reflect an expectation for further weakness.
(GRAPHIC - S&P bank index valuation vs S&P 500: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7190/7121/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
The S&P Bank index has gained 14% year-to-date, compared with a 16.5% advance for the S&P 500. But the sector's trading multiple of 10.2 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compares well to its historical average of 12.6 and the benchmark S&P's current trading multiple of 16.4.
Bank valuations look attractive to Manulife's Welch, who does not expect a recession any time soon.
""If we're wrong and go into a mild recession we think the banks will hold up much better"" than going into financial crisis, she said, citing underwriting improvements.
But, after a spate of weak manufacturing data, Aberdeen Standard's Cronin is looking for data to stabilize before recommending the sector.
""There is a lot of downside priced into the stocks but overall I'd still say I'm not really positive on the group just yet,"" he said."

337,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 01:01PM ET</span>",Euronext plans cash-settled commodity contracts,"PARIS (Reuters) -  Euronext  (PA:ENX) plans to develop commodity contracts based on cash settlement to expand a business in which the financial market operator has so far offered physical delivery of crops like wheat.
In an investor presentation on Friday to explain its growth strategy to 2022, Euronext said it was looking at the ""development of cash-settled products that enable faster listing and trading of higher number of desired price references.""
The group did not provide details in the presentation slides about potential cash-settled commodity contracts, and a spokeswoman said Euronext had no more information to share for now.
Euronext's commodity business is dominated by its French-based wheat futures (BL2c1) that are a benchmark for the European grain market.
Its wheat and other agricultural futures allow physical delivery at the expiry of a contract in order to connect derivative prices with cash markets.
However, Euronext's acquisition this year of Norwegian stock exchange Oslo Bors for 700 million euros ($770 million) brought under its control a salmon derivatives market that is cash-settled.
Cash settlement ties the expiry process to a price benchmark for the physical market and avoids constraints of managing delivery systems.
CME Group (O:CME) adopted cash-settled Russian wheat and Ukrainian maize contracts after an unsuccessful attempt at delivery-based futures in the Black Sea grain export region.
Euronext, which on Thursday unveiled financial targets for 2019-2022, also said it would try to boost its commodity activity by targeting customers in the United States and northern and eastern Europe.
At the same time, Euronext reiterated that it wants to extend its delivery network for core commodity contracts that also include maize (corn) and rapeseed."

The parameters for what and who to include in the list had already been largely finalised, said one of the two sources, who are familiar with the thinking of Chinese leadership, adding that the list still needed to go through an approval process.
""There is already a basic list of companies, but the list may be adjusted according to how the China-U.S. trade dispute progresses,"" the source told Reuters, declining to elaborate on the identities of the firms.
""But Beijing may hold back from publishing the list until the trade situation with the United States is at its most tense,"" the source said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
China's Ministry of Commerce, which has been working on the list, did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
At end-May, the ministry said it would draw up such a list to target foreign enterprises, groups and individuals who block supplies to Chinese companies for non-commercial reasons and violate market rules.
Entities that seriously damaged the rights and interests of Chinese firms and harmed China's national security would also be put on the blacklist.
The plan for the list came after the United States imposed additional tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods and added Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] to Washington's own export blacklist.
The U.S. Commerce Department has barred multiple Chinese tech firms from buying parts and components from American companies without approval from the U.S. government, citing potential threats to national security.
On Oct. 7, Washington expanded its trade blacklist to include eight Chinese companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd.
U.S. officials said the announcement was not tied to the resumption of trade talks with China in Washington this week.
""If Sino-U.S. trade ties improve, the likelihood of China releasing the unreliable entities list is not huge,"" the second source said.
""But if Washington once again exerts pressure on Beijing during their trade talks, China has sufficient and compelling measures to retaliate.""
In late September, the Commerce Ministry said China was still going through internal procedures for rolling out the list.
The ministry previously said the list was not being created to target companies, groups or individuals from specific countries."

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial services regulator is examining allegations of precious metals market manipulation by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co traders following criminal charges by U.S. authorities, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is one of the various authorities that JPMorgan has previously said were investigating its metals trading, according to one of the people, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The watchdog has requested documents and other information from JPMorgan, the source said.
The exact scope of the FCA scrutiny or whether it will result in any charges was unclear.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged five current and former JPMorgan metals traders, who worked in New York, London and Singapore, with alleged price manipulation between 2007 and 2016. Two of them have been charged in parallel by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The joint investigation is ongoing, a DOJ official has said.
One of the traders was charged in 2018, and four this year. Two have pleaded guilty to manipulating prices. The lawyers for the three most recently charged, in September, said their clients would contest the allegations against them.
JPMorgan said in an Aug. 6 regulatory filing that it was ""responding to and cooperating"" with various investigations relating to trading practices in the metals markets.
The FCA, DOJ and CFTC all declined to comment.
The second person familiar with the matter is London-based metals trader Andrew Maguire, who has long complained about alleged metals market manipulation on both sides of the Atlantic.
He told Reuters he met FCA officials in August, along with British lawmaker Jeremy Lefroy, to discuss possible metals market manipulation in London. He said he was told by the officials that they were looking into JPMorgan's metal trading, and that they had contacted the DOJ and CFTC to learn more.
Lefroy confirmed that the meeting with the FCA took place and said he and Maguire were assured that the FCA was following the U.S. investigation closely for any possible implications in Britain and would follow up on these if found.
New York and London are hubs for precious metals dealing, and large international banks are among the biggest traders, managing orders for themselves and clients.
U.S. prosecutors have said that the five charged JPMorgan traders had influenced metals prices by placing bids with the intent to cancel them before execution – a technique known as spoofing. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can move prices to benefit their market positions.
There has been a surge in spoofing-related prosecutions in recent years involving banks and dealers. These include Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's Merrill Lynch commodities unit, which was fined $25 million by U.S. authorities in July, and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which was fined $1.5 million in the United States last month.
The DOJ has taken an aggressive stance, most recently charging three of the five men in the JPMorgan case with a racketeering conspiracy, a technique more commonly associated with organized crime prosecutions. All contest the charges.
The U.S. charges against JPMorgan staff center on manipulation of U.S. exchanges. Trading can be conducted on these exchanges from locations outside the United States, including London, where some of the men charged by U.S. investigators have been based.
The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which sets trade standards for metals trading but is not a regulator, said it ""takes very seriously all allegations of misconduct or criminal conduct which may prejudice or damage the integrity and efficient operation of the precious metals markets"".
JPMorgan, like most other large international banks that trade gold, is an LBMA member."

LONDON (Reuters) - Steelmakers' margins are due to deteriorate in coming quarters despite a fall in the price of raw material iron ore because steel prices have also slumped, pressured by weak demand.
""Even with the correction that we saw in iron ore, steel prices have fallen in just about every market, in Europe, the U.S. and China,"" said analyst Serafino Capoferri at Macquarie in London.
Benchmark spot iron ore for delivery to China hit a five-year high of $126.50 a tonne on July 3, having surged 74% over six months due to reduced supply from top exporters Australia and Brazil.
Since that peak, however, iron ore prices have slumped 26%.
""In the West, particularly in Europe, mills are really struggling. Demand there is weaker and the main headwind is the drop in car sales globally,"" Capoferri added.

The global automobile market, the second-biggest demand sector for steel after construction, has faltered recently due to declining economic growth, especially in top market China.
In China, total auto sales fell 6.9% in August, the 14th consecutive month of declines, as the top industry association warned of weak sales over the next three years.
Automakers in the U.S. market, the world's second-biggest, reported a sharp drop in September sales, while Moody’s cited the weak global auto market for keeping its credit outlook on Europe’s steel industry at negative.
""This will particularly hurt flat steel producers like ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) for whom automakers are important customers,"" Moody's analyst Goetz Grossmann said in a statement.

The slump in auto sales along with diminishing global economic growth have weighed on steel demand and prices.
The Chinese price of hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel, used in cars and home appliances, has shed 16% since July 1 while North American HRC prices have slid by 19% since Aug. 1.
Further erosion in U.S. steel prices is expected in the short term, Jefferies analyst Martin Englert said in a note.
""The earliest anticipated price recovery is likely 1Q20, but buyers remain sceptical pointing to the recent failed recovery late summer,"" he said.

Pressure on steel prices could also come from excess supply due to rising output in China during the winter.
In past years China has enforced closures and weaker production due to a strict crackdown on pollution during the main heating season, but this year the emission standards will be more flexible, analysts said.
""The overall target for air pollution control is tighter than last year, however it appears unlikely to result in material steel supply restrictions,"" UBS analyst Myles Allsop said in a note.
The world's top steelmaker is also having trouble containing increasing illegal new capacity, a government official said last month.
China steel production rose 6.6% last year to a record high, and so far this year has climbed 8.6%, according to the World Steel Association.

Japan's top steelmaker, Nippon Steel Corp (T:5401), warned in August about weak margins due to surging iron ore prices, but there was a glimmer of optimism when prices came off their peak.
""The rapid fall in iron ore prices lifted steelmakers’ hopes around their ability to improve margins,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Alain Gabriel said in a note.
""(But) steel prices have now started to drift lower, possibly setting the scene for disappointment.""
According to Reuters calculations based on Refinitiv data and consensus forecasts, the operating margin for U.S. Steel Corp (N:X) is due to slide to 0.6% in the third quarter from 3.6% in the second quarter.
""To get improvement in steel margins, you need steel prices to recover, but it doesn't look very rosy for steel for next quarter or even for next year,"" Capoferri at Macquarie said.

Mediaset's (MI:MS) second-biggest investor Vivendi (PA:VIV) brought legal proceedings against the corporate overhaul in court because the French group sees it as detrimental to minority shareholders. 
Mediaset's reorganization plan aims to create a new entity - called MediaforEurope - in a bid to pursue pan-European tie-ups to face growing competition in the industry.
Pending a decision on Vivendi's lawsuit, the Spanish court granted a precautionary suspension of the corporate overhaul.
""Mediaset Espana strongly disagree with this interim ruling, and will immediately appeal,"" the company said, adding it was confident a higher court would reverse the decision.
""The reasons behind Mediaset Espana's position ... are very solid and support the legal, economic and managerial rationale of the accords that have been challenged,"" it said.
Mediaset said Vivendi would not stop its European growth plan. 
The French group has also brought legal proceedings against Mediaset's plan in Amsterdam and Milan courts.
In an emailed statement, a Vivendi spokesman said the group was satisfied with the Madrid court ruling. 
The French group has been a hostile Mediaset shareholder since the tycoons who control the two companies, Vincent Bollore and former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, fell out in 2016 over an aborted pay-TV deal. They have been in a legal war ever since.
In Italy, Mediaset's merger plan was approved at a shareholder meeting where Vivendi was allowed to vote only with the 9.6% Mediaset stake it owns directly.
Two-thirds of Vivendi's 29% stake in Mediaset is held through an arms-length trust which Mediaset prevented from participating in the meeting.

By 1500 GMT shares in Mediaset Espana were down 1.2%. Shares in Mediaset were up 2.3%.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 11:32AM ET</span>",Uber to buy Chile's Cornershop in bid to deliver your groceries,"By Dave Sherwood and Aislinn Laing
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Uber (N:UBER) said on Friday it would buy a majority stake in online grocery provider Cornershop as the ride-hailing giant moves to expand its fast-growing delivery service into the grocery store market.
Santiago-based Cornershop operates in Mexico, Chile, Canada and Peru, but Chief Executive Oskar Hjertonsson said the deal would allow it to deliver groceries ""in many more countries around the world.""
He retweeted the news of the deal as it broke, adding: ""This will be fun!""
The app provides delivery of ""groceries to your front door in one hour"" from retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST), Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Mexico's Chedraui (MX:CHDRAUIB). It charges retail chains and customers a commission for its services. 
“Whether it’s getting a ride, ordering food from your favorite restaurant, or soon, getting groceries delivered, we want Uber to be the operating system for your everyday life,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. 
No valuation was disclosed for the deal. Uber said it expected to close the deal in early 2020, ""subject to regulatory approval."" 
Mexican antitrust officials earlier this year blocked a $225 million bid by Walmart (N:WMT) to buy Cornershop, citing concerns the retail giant could not guarantee a level playing field for rival retailers.
Cornershop would continue to operate under its current leadership, which would report to a board with majority Uber representation, Uber said in a statement.
Cornershop has rapidly gained popularity in local markets, including Chile, where its shoppers are a common sight scrambling down the aisles of grocery stores as they hunt down orders for customers. 
The company has also diversified rapidly, moving from food to stores selling clothes, toys, home decor, books, electronic goods and pharmaceutical products. 
The news of the deal comes amid a flurry of similar announcements from Uber, as it seeks to expand beyond its core taxi app. 
This week it launched a boat service in Nigeria's populous Lagos, expanded a helicopter taxi service in New York's JFK airport and began an app in Chicago to connect workers with businesses needing to fill available shifts. 
The move to diversify comes at a time when Uber's main ride hailing operations face competition in Asia, while the U.S. company is also facing regulatory scrutiny for classifying its drivers as independent contractors.

In Chile, Uber remains technically illegal, with a bill to regulate ride-sharing digital applications making its way slowly through Chile's congress amid challenges from traditional taxi firms and drivers' unions, which want tighter labor regulations.

The company said it expects to cancel more than 8,000 flights for October, November, December and the first few days of January and that it will monitor regulatory updates and make adjustments accordingly. Among other U.S. airlines that operate the MAX, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has canceled flights through Jan. 5, while  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) has extended cancellations of Boeing 737 MAX flights through Jan. 15. 
""We have cooperated fully with the FAA's independent review of the MAX aircraft, and we won't put our customers and employees on that plane until regulators make their own independent assessment that it is safe to do so"", the company said in a statement. 
The fast-selling 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since mid-March while  Boeing Co  (N:BA) updates flight control software at the center of two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people within a span of five months. 
Boeing is planing a revision of the 737 MAX software to take input from both of its angle-of-attack sensors in the anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes and has added additional safeguards. 
The company is also addressing a flaw discovered in the software architecture of the 737 MAX flight-control system involving using and receiving input from the plane's two flight control computers rather than one. 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in September that the agency will need about a month following the yet-to-be scheduled certification test flight before the planes could return to service. 

Reuters reported this week that the flight is not expected before Nov. 1, as the FAA continues to review software changes, meaning the FAA is unlikely to allow its return until late November or December at the earliest.

GM made the offer earlier this week in a bid to end a strike that analysts say has cost the company more than $1 billion in profit. The automaker’s shares rose as much as 2.4% shortly after the open of regular trading.
The offer from GM was aimed at sewing up one of the union’s major remaining concerns -- that underused plants could end up being idled or closed during the life of the agreement. UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in two letters this week that the union wanted the company to offer more job security.
GM’s initial formal offer made in mid-September included plans to build electric trucks at a plant in Detroit, which is scheduled to run out of work in January, and to construct a battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, where the company has idled a compact car plant. Those two investments remain parts of GM’s plans, the person said."

The 84-year-old billionaire bought a 7% stake in Mediobanca last month, stunning corporate Italy and raising questions over its future before it presents a new business plan in November.
Del Vecchio, who founded spectacles maker Luxottica in the 1960s, told Business Insider Italia, that Mediobanca was too small, having missed out on a number of possible deals.
""Mediobanca has already wasted several opportunities, it must become bigger. When opportunities for growth present themselves you must jump on them,"" he was quoted as saying.
Del Vecchio grew Luxottica via acquisitions and merged it with French lens manufacturer Essilor last year.
He invited Mediobanca on Wednesday to build up its investment banking business and rely less on contributions from consumer credit and its most prized asset - Italy's top insurer Generali (MI:GASI), in which both Mediobanca and Del Vecchio are shareholders.
Chief Executive Alberto Nagel has steered Mediobanca away from its historic role as a financial holding company, boosting the bank's consumer credit and wealth management businesses through a number of mid-sized acquisitions. It bought French boutique merchant bank Messier Maris & Associes in August.
Nagel has said possible acquisitions in wealth management and consumer banking remain core to Mediobanca's strategy.
However, last month Mediobanca decided against acquiring Julius Baer's Italian subsidiary Kairos after examining it as a potential target.
A source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday Del Vecchio wanted to change Mediobanca's governance rules to ensure he has a say in the choice of the next chief executive when Nagel's mandate comes up for renewal next year.
The bank's bylaws state that the CEO must be picked from among managers who have been with the bank for at least three years, effectively excluding outsiders.
Del Vecchio told Business Insider Italia that changing Mediobanca's bylaws ""would not be much help.""
Sources also have not ruled out Del Vecchio further raising his holding to more than 10%, a threshold which can only be surpassed with approval from the European Central Bank."

The firm committed $5.2 billion in new capital during July, August and September, making it the busiest activist both by capital committed and number of campaigns launched, according to data compiled by Lazard.
This year Elliott has committed $8.4 billion in 14 campaigns. That easily outpaces Carl Icahn's Icahn Associates, which has committed $2.6 billion in three campaigns, and Daniel Loeb's Third Point, which put $2.4 billion to work in three campaigns.

Thanks to Elliott's activities, the pace of activism overall was higher in the third quarter of 2019 than a year earlier with $11 billion deployed in capital compared with $8.7 billion last year.
Europe became the favorite hunting ground as activists launched a record 20 campaigns at companies like EssilorLuxottica and Scout24.
While activists traditionally push for strategic reviews, demands for mergers and acquisitions have never been higher, Lazard said, noting that nearly half of all campaigns this year have had an M&A thesis.

WASHINGTON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A panel of international air safety regulators on Friday harshly criticized the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) review of a safety system on Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX airliner later tied to two crashes that killed all 346 people aboard.
The Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) was commissioned by the FAA in April to look into the agency's oversight and approval of the so-called MCAS anti-stall system.
The report also faulted Boeing for assumptions it made in designing the airplane and found areas where Boeing could improve processes.
""The JATR team found that the MCAS was not evaluated as a complete and integrated function in the certification documents that were submitted to the FAA,"" the 69-page series of findings and recommendations said.
""The lack of a unified top-down development and evaluation of the system function and its safety analyses, combined with the extensive and fragmented documentation, made it difficult to assess whether compliance was fully demonstrated.""
Boeing did not directly address the report's findings but said it ""is committed to working with the FAA in reviewing the recommendations and helping to continuously improve the process and approach used to validate and certify airplanes.""
Regulators around the world continue to scrutinize proposed software changes and training revisions from Boeing aimed at returning the Boeing 737 MAX to service.
Boeing's top-selling airplane has been grounded worldwide since a March 10 crash in Ethiopia killed 157 people, five months after a Lion Air 737 MAX crashed in Indonesia, killing 189 people on board. 
Major U.S. airlines including Southwest Airlines Inc (N:LUV) and American Airlines Inc (O:AAL) currently do not expect 737 MAX flights to resume before January.
The JATR draft recommendations, obtained by Reuters ahead of their release on Friday, also said the FAA's longstanding practice of delegating ""a high level"" of certification tasks to manufacturers such as Boeing needs significant reform to ensure adequate safety oversight.
""With adequate FAA engagement and oversight, the extent of delegation does not in itself compromise safety,"" the report said. 
""However, in the B737 MAX program, the FAA had inadequate awareness of the MCAS function which, coupled with limited involvement, resulted in an inability of the FAA to provide an independent assessment of the adequacy of the Boeing-proposed certification activities associated with MCAS.""
The report also questioned FAA's limited staffing to oversee certification tasks it designated to Boeing and said there were an ""inadequate number of FAA specialists"" involved in the certification of the 737 MAX. 
There were signs that Boeing employees conducting FAA work faced ""undue pressure. ..which may be attributed to conflicting priorities and an environment that does not support FAA requirements,"" it said.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement he would look at the panel's recommendations and take appropriate action following the ""unvarnished and independent review of the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX.""
MCAS UNDER SCRUTINY
The U.S. planemaker has stopped short of admitting any fault in how it developed the 737 MAX, or MCAS, which repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down in the Indonesian and Ethiopian crashes while the pilots struggled to intervene.
However, it has said erroneous Angle of Attack (AOA) data fed to MCAS - the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System - was a common link in two wider chains of events leading to the crashes. 
The JATR report recommended the FAA review the stalling characteristics of the 737 MAX without MCAS and associated systems to determine if unsafe characteristics exist and if so, if a broader review of the system design was needed. 
JATR said MCAS and those systems could be considered a stall identification or stall protection system, depending on how the aircraft handled without them.
Boeing has said MCAS was not meant to prevent stalls and was instead designed so that the 737 MAX would have similar handling characteristics to its predecessor, the 737 NG. 
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last month said it planned to undertake flight tests of the 737 MAX including a test without MCAS to check its performance during high-speed turns and stall.
Boeing is revising the 737 MAX software to require the MCAS system to receive input from both AOA sensors, and has added additional safeguards. If the AOA sensors differ by 5.5 degrees or more then MCAS cannot operate, FAA Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell said last month. 
If MCAS does operate it can only operate once unless the problem had been “completely resolved,” he added.
The JATR is headed by Christopher Hart, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and includes air safety regulators from the United States, Canada, China, Indonesia, European Union, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Japan.

Last month, Hart said it was important to note ""the U.S. aviation system each day transports millions of people safely, so it’s not like we have to completely overhaul the entire system, it’s not broken. But these incidents have shown us that there are ways to improve the existing system.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog will take a ""pragmatic"" approach to financial firms that fail to report transactions on time if there is a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, it said on Friday, given the challenges of adapting to big changes midweek.
Following Thursday's meeting between the prime ministers of Ireland and Britain, hopes for a divorce settlement have increased.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) set out guidance on Friday on what it will do if there is no deal by Brexit day, which is likely to roil investors and markets.
Britain's departure from the European Union is due to take place on a Thursday.
Typically banks and brokers need a weekend to adapt to such major changes that will affect IT systems used for mandatory reporting of stock, bond and derivatives trades to regulators.
""The FCA is aware that leaving the EU during the working week could pose operational challenges for firms,"" the watchdog said in a statement.
""The FCA will take a proportionate and pragmatic approach to supervising reporting around exit day.""
A no-deal Brexit would split cross-border stock markets, and the FCA has yet to say how it would respond to this.
If there is a deal, it would be business as usual for Britain's financial sector during a transition period.
The FCA said firms that are not able to comply fully with securities reporting requirements around Brexit day will need to be able to back-report missing, incomplete or inaccurate transactions as soon as possible thereafter.
For derivatives trades, market participants should have all trades reported to a trade repository no later than Nov. 4.
It echoes comments from the Bank of England which said this week that banks and the broader financial system were well prepared for a disorderly Brexit.
The FCA said it had taken into account statements this week from the EU's European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which said on Monday there was still a high level of uncertainty as to the final timing and conditions of Brexit.
Many banks, insurers and trading platforms in London have opened hubs in the bloc to ensure continued access for EU customers.
The EU's European Banking Authority (EBA) said this week that banks must guard against complacency and press ahead with building out their new EU operations.
""Notably, to ensure that assets, appropriate staff and data are in place to support relevant authorizations and that customers are adequately informed,"" EBA said."

However, a senior industry source close to the matter, also speaking on condition of anonymity, later denied the report.
No comment was available from Boeing.
The U.S. planemaker's fastest-selling jet was grounded worldwide and deliveries were frozen in March after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed a total of 346 people."

(Reuters) - An ongoing workers' strike at General Motors Co (N:GM) could cost the automaker about $1.5 billion, brokerage  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Friday, throwing the U.S. automaker's cost reduction plans off the track and forcing key suppliers to cut their 2019 outlook.
The brokerage has assumed the strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, currently in its 26-day, to last until Oct. 21.
GM, which likely lost production of about 100,000 vehicles in the third quarter, is at the risk of losing another 170,000 vehicles in the current quarter, the brokerage said, with the impact spreading to some of GM's facilities in Mexico and Canada that receive parts from its U.S. factories.
""While investors may look through the one-time impacts...the strike reminds us of the challenge of investing in OEMs at this point in the cycle,"" analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note.
The brokerage said GM may now have to revise its target of $4.5 billion in cost savings through 2020, announced last year, as production curtailments and labor-related cost reductions may not happen as fast as the company had expected.
""We assume just under $900 million of reduced costs or 20% of the original (target),"" Levy said.
Credit Suisse said the strike will hurt suppliers, including American Axle (N:AXL), Aptiv Plc (N:APTV),  Lear  Corp (N:LEA), Delphi Technologies (N:DLPH), and Dana Inc (N:DAN), whose exposure to GM varies between 5% and 18%, with American Axle at 40%.
Last week, Canadian auto parts maker  Linamar Corp  (TO:LNR) estimated a profit impact of up to C$1 million per day due to a fall in orders from its customer General Motors.
Credit Suisse lowered its 2019 earnings per share estimate for GM by 83 cents to $6.11, below the Wall Street consensus of $6.56, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, as the No.1 automaker is also at the risk of losing market share to smaller rivals such as Ford Motor (N:F).
The brokerage has cut its price target on GM's stock to $46 from $50, while reaffirming its ""outperform"" rating.
Of 19 brokerages, 14 rate GM ""buy"" or ""higher"" and five ""hold"", with no ""sell"" rating. The median price target for the stock is $48, representing an upside of more than 38% to Thursday's close."
368,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 07:32AM ET</span>",Uber faces UK tax challenge,"LONDON (Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) says the UK is seeking to classify the company as a transportation provider, potentially opening it up to new tax charges that could weigh heavily on its business, according to UK accounts filings in recent days.
It is the latest headache for the U.S. ride-hailing company, which is also facing regulatory problems in London, one of its largest markets.
Uber says it could be charged 20% VAT on gross booking fees - the amount passengers pay -- or on service fees charged to drivers, typically about 20-30 percent of the fare.
The tax could eat into Uber's margins or force it to increase fares, making it less competitive against rivals, who have previously complained about Uber's non-payment of VAT.
Uber said the charges could apply ""both retroactively and prospectively"", risking a back tax claim that could run to hundreds of millions of pounds.
Uber said it believed the position of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) ""in similar disputes and audits is without merit"" and is defending itself vigorously.
Currently, Uber is structured so that, for tax purposes, it exports digital services to UK-based drivers from a Dutch subsidiary, Uber BV. In future, HMRC could deem its UK operation to be the provider of a transportation service, thus exposing it to VAT.

Last month, Uber received only a two-month London operating license, failing to secure a maximum five-year term in a battle with the regulator, which has previously stripped the company of its right to take rides.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Global ride-hailing firm  Uber Technologies Inc  (UBER.UL) on Friday launched a pilot test of a boat service in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos to attract commuters seeking to avoid the megacity's notoriously congested roads.
The United Nations predicts that Nigeria's population will more than double to 400 million by 2050, which would make it the third most populous country in the world after China and India. 
The combination of population growth and congestion has made Nigeria, and more broadly West Africa, attractive to foreign transport companies.
Uber's chief business officer told Reuters in June the company planned to launch the service to carry travelers in the Lagos megacity of around 20 million people that is built on a lagoon.
The waterway service, UberBOAT, is operated in partnership with local boat operator Texas Connection Ferries and the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA), said the ride-hailing firm. 
""This initiative is aimed at providing commuters with an easy and affordable way to get in and out of the city's business districts,"" Uber said in a statement. 
The pilot phase will operate on weekdays from 0700 GMT to 1600 GMT on a fixed route between two locations in the city. 
Passengers will be charged a flat fare of 500 naira ($1.39) per trip, compared with about 300 naira by minibus for a similar journey in the commercial hub of the West African country where most people live on less than $2 a day. 
At a press conference on Friday, Uber officials said there would be four trips a day, carrying up to 35 people on a boat, during the two-week pilot. 
Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the governor of Lagos state, said the Uber boat service, and the use of waterways in general, were part of a raft of initiatives aimed at easing congestion that include a program of road repairs. 
""We want ferries that carry 60 to 80 people,"" he said, referring to his hopes for the future use of waterways, on Thursday at a forum with businesses. 
Uber's boat initiative follows a number of motorcycle ride-hailing firms that have targeted West Africa as an area for expansion in the last few months.

Technology giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also launched a new feature in July that allows Nigerians to hear travel advice in a local voice on Google Maps. Another feature allows users in Lagos to seek directions from ""informal transit"" services, such as private minibuses.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 07:06AM ET</span>","Hyundai, Kia earmark $760 million to settle U.S. lawsuits over engine fires","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and affiliate Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) have earmarked 900 billion won ($758 million) to settle U.S. class action litigation and address engine-related issues in the United States and South Korea. 
The move marks the South Korean auto giant's first major effort to resolve years of trouble over engine defects that have also sparked probes by the U.S. safety regulator and prosecutors.
Hyundai Motor will make a provision of about 600 billion won in its July to September earnings while Kia will book one for about 300 billion won, they said on Friday.
Hyundai and Kia said in a statement that under the U.S. settlement they would install software to monitor for symptoms of engine failure and take other steps, including offering compensation options and lifetime warranties.
A total of 4.17 million Hyundai and Kia models equipped with Theta II gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines will be affected by the U.S. settlement. 
Hyundai and Kia, together the world's fifth-biggest automaker by sales, recalled nearly 1.7 million vehicles in the United States to address the possibility of engine fires. 
In November, Reuters reported that U.S. federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation to determine if the recalls had been conducted properly. 
Since 2017, the U.S. safety regulator has been investigating whether the recalls covered enough vehicles and were conducted in a timely manner. 
The investigation comes after Kim Gwang-ho, then an engineer at Hyundai, flew to Washington in 2016 to tell the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the companies should have recalled more vehicles over the problem, citing an internal report. 
Hyundai Motor at that time denied allegations. 
The NHTSA this year opened a fresh investigation into 3 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles after reviewing reports of more than 3,000 fires that injured more than 100 people. 

That probe came in response to a petition seeking an investigation filed in June by the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety.

372,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 06:51AM ET</span>",What Brexit? London tightens grip in forex trading,"By Tommy Wilkes and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Financial analytics firm Mosaic Smart Data has doubled the number of developers and quantitative analysts it employs since 2018 at its London base, where nearly 40 now crunch numbers to help banks trade foreign exchange and bonds.
Far from suffering under the economic and political uncertainty wrought by Britain's journey toward leaving the European Union, London is strengthening its grip on currency trading, the crown jewel of the city's financial industry.
Technological and regulatory trends little impacted by Brexit are driving more forex flows into a single, centralized trading hub, largely to London's benefit, interviews with bank executives, investors and central bank officials show.
A boom in new financial technology jobs is helping London to offset a decline in traditional trading roles as the industry becomes ever more automated, though it may not compensate for Brexit-related losses in other financial sectors.
London's share of global daily forex turnover has rocketed to a record 43% - from 37% in 2016 - as it stole market share from New York and Asian hubs, according to a Bank of International Settlements survey last month.
London has long led in forex thanks to its convenient time zone and cutting-edge trading infrastructure.
But the news surprised many who had predicted Brexit would drive an exodus of banks and traders from London, or at least arrest its growth, while cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore were seen benefiting from a boom in local currency activity.
""London is hard to beat ... The depth and diversity of the skill pool here is unrivalled,"" Matthew Hodgson, the founder of Mosaic, one of a clutch of new fintech companies tapping into the forex industry, told Reuters.
Mosaic employed a handful of staff from a shared office around the time Britain voted to leave the EU.
""There is a network effect for talent, the FX liquidity and the clustering of institutions,"" he said, predicting London's advantage was ""likely to have staying power"" despite Brexit.
(GRAPHIC - Geographical distribution of OTC FX turnover: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-FOREX-TURNOVER/0H001QXBQ8S6/eikon.png)
Big banks including Citi,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and UBS base their global forex heads in London.
And some banks have expanded their presence in recent years.
Dutch bank ING, for instance, chose London to centralize its forex trading operations, previously scattered across various cities. ING's global forex and rates boss Gary Prince said it was efficient to run more business out of the British capital.
London's forex fortunes could also be benefiting as European banks retrench from the United States, a recent HSBC report said.
TRANSPARENCY
The BIS gives no explanation for London's increased share.
Some traders caution that improved bank reporting of turnover - especially booming forex swap volumes - may have inflated the 2019 numbers globally, although that would not undermine London's success at the expense of rivals.
Part of the story appears to be new regulations that require investors to justify the prices they get while trading.
Rules introduced in 2018 by the EU aim to bring forex trading more in line with equities and have seen a raft of new London-based firms launch to provide ""transaction cost analysis"" to traders.
Their data, now used by 60% of buyside investors for currencies, according to Greenwich Associates, has reinforced what some market players already knew: trading costs are lowest when liquidity - the ease with which you can buy and sell - is deepest.
And that's overwhelmingly when Asian and American time zones overlap with London.
Quantifying intra-day liquidity is difficult without a single forex trading platform, but several traders said it had become easier and cheaper to transact in London than elsewhere.
Large investment funds can as much as halve execution costs when trading dollar/yen in London versus in Asia or New York, two senior traders told Reuters.
An extra bonus for the city is the increase in electronic trading and the use of computer models known as algorithms, or algos. Aimed at cutting costs and getting the best price, algos are often programmed to seek out the biggest liquidity pools.
""Because London has the liquidity and because liquidity is what larger players are looking for across the spectrum, they are moving the time in which they transact to the most liquid time zones,"" said Itay Tuchman, London-based global head of forex at Citi.
(GRAPHIC - OTC foreign exchange turnover: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-FOREX-BIS/0H001QX6T8EJ/eikon.png)
NEW JOBS?
London's grip on the bank trading business is encouraging more forex fintechs to expand in the city. Often run by ex-bank traders and brokers, these startups offer a range of services, from data analysis to designing programs that can shave milliseconds off trading times.
A City of London report said Britain's fintech sector employs an estimated 76,500 people, while London saw 61% growth in such jobs last year.
Some of Britain's most valuable fintechs are in the forex industry, such as TransferWise and Revolut.
""The network effect of having London as a talent hub to me is a very strong argument on why this city will dominate, even post-Brexit,"" Citi's Tuchman said.
Currencycloud, which builds forex payments infrastructure for businesses, has around three-fifths of its 250 staff in London and is expanding, its CEO Mike Laven told Reuters.
But is has also opened an office in Amsterdam and will employ 20 people there by the end of the year to help serve clients in the EU post-Brexit. These are jobs that ""we would have hired in London,"" Laven said.
London's forex dominance may not offset a broader employment hit in financial services from Brexit.
That's because the same trends that are encouraging more centralizing of trading are leading to forex automation and job cuts in the trading community.
At the world's 12 biggest investment banks, the number of trading and sales staff employed in bonds, forex and commodity globally was down to 1,400 by 2018 from 2,300 in 2010, analytics firm Coalition estimates.
But the draw of London remains strong, even for those who lose their jobs.
When Peter Kinsella was told in 2017 by Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) that it was shrinking teams and might move his forex strategy role from London to Frankfurt, he left the bank.
""You've got the best people in London and the best market information. You can get a call on a Monday and someone will ask what are you doing tomorrow morning? We've got a meeting with a politician on Brexit,"" said Irishman Kinsella, who now advises well-heeled clients at Swiss bank Union Bancaire Privee - from London.
""That type of connectivity you don't get in other parts of the world.""

LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (LON:BP) will take charges of $2 to $3 billion in the third quarter, the British energy firm said on Friday, as it looks to reach divestments worth $10 billion by the end of 2019, a year ahead of schedule.
In a statement, London-based BP said it expects to agree asset sales of $10 billion by end-year after its $5.6 billion sale of its Alaskan business to Hilcorp [HILCO.UL] and divestments in U.S. shale gas.
BP shares were down 1.1% by 0948 GMT compared with a 1.3% gain in the broader European energy index.
The non-cash, non-operating, after-tax charge will impact the company's headline profit figure but not its underlying cashflow, a spokesman said.
BP announced the disposal program following its $10.25 billion acquisition of BHP's shale business last year, its largest purchase in three decades.
The planned third-quarter impairment charges are expected to increase BP's gearing - the ratio between debt and market capitalization - to the top end of the 20% to 30% target, BP said.
Debt levels and gearing are expected to move to the middle of the range through 2020.
BP's third-quarter oil and gas production will be impacted by maintenance in some high-margin regions, BP said. 
Output in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was ""significantly disrupted"" by Hurricane Barry, with facilities shut down for around 14 days.

BP is scheduled to report its results on October 29.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 06:19AM ET</span>",Rising old used car prices help push poor Americans over the edge,"By Nick Carey
FREEPORT, Ill. (Reuters) - For America's working poor, an often essential ingredient for getting and keeping a job – having a car – has rarely been more costly, and millions of people are finding it impossible to keep up with payments despite prolonged economic growth and low unemployment. 
More than 7 million Americans are already 90 or more days behind on their car loans, according to the New York Federal Reserve, and serious delinquency rates among borrowers with the lowest credit scores have by far seen the fastest acceleration.
The seeds of the problem are buried deep in the financial crisis, when in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, automakers slashed production. A decade later, that has made a relative rarity of used 10-year-old vehicles that are typically more affordable for low-wage earners. 
According to data provided to Reuters by industry consultant and car shopping website Edmunds, the average price of that vintage of vehicle is $8,657, still nearly 75% higher than in 2010 despite some softening in prices over the last year. The average new car, in contrast, has seen a price rise of 25% in that same time period.
""This is pinching people at the worst point possible,"" said Ivan Drury, Edmunds' senior manager of industry analysis. ""If you need basic A to B transportation, you have to get an older car that needs more repairs and has more wear-and-tear issues.""
Monthly auto payments for Americans making under $40,000 have remained flat since 2017, while those in higher wage brackets have seen their payments rise, according to a Cox Automotive Inc analysis for Reuters.
On the face of it, this might seem like good news. But to Cox chief economist Jonathan Smoke, it indicates poorer Americans are stretched so thin they cannot afford to pay more.
""They just don't have any flexibility to increase their payment,"" Smoke said. 
Weak lending standards in recent years are partly to blame for the rising delinquency rates, which Warren Kornfeld, a senior vice president on Moody's financial institutions team, said are approaching record highs despite a solid economy.
Auto lenders are belatedly tightening lending standards, but it may already be too late, he said.
""The economy is masking the true performance of auto loans,"" Kornfeld said. ""If we hit a downturn today, the performance of auto loans would not look very good.""
Research from the New York Fed earlier this year showed that while delinquency rates among borrowers with high credit scores have remained steady and low, for subprime borrowers they have been rising, pushing up the overall delinquency rate. Around 8% of loans originated by lower-score buyers with a credit score below 620 were categorized as seriously late, ""a development that is surprising during a strong economy and labor market,"" Fed researchers wrote.
'HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET'
Like many Americans, for Hollis Heyward no car means no job. The 30-year-old father of two makes $10 an hour working at a warehouse in Freeport, a rural town of 25,000 about 115 miles (185.07 km) northwest of Chicago. 
Heyward can only get to work by car.
In the midst of a divorce, all he could afford was a gray 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix with close to 200,000 miles on it, which he bought for $1,300 cash - a fraction of the average new car price. 
Suddenly also stuck paying off the loan on his future ex-wife's car, Heyward had to rework the loan with local used-car dealer Gordy Tormohlen of Good People Automotive. Under his ""workout"" deal, Heyward is paying the loan's principal only and Tormohlen has waived the interest payments. Heyward's monthly payment is now around $120 per month, down from around $350 before the workout.
""Right now, it's hard to make ends meet,"" said Heyward. ""But I am not the kind of guy to walk away from my commitments."" 
Tormohlen, 59, a second-generation dealer, said his business is up 10% this year as auto finance companies tighten lending standards. He said the market feels like it did before the financial crisis hit in 2008, when consumers were over-extended with debt.
""Americans have grown too comfortable with debt and the time has come to pay the piper,"" he said.
Tormohlen is a ""Buy Here, Pay Here"" dealer, offering subprime loans that he finances himself at 19%, which is higher than a bank but lower than many finance companies. 
He said he can work directly with struggling customers like Heyward, whom he has known for a decade, but worries that large finance companies with tens or hundreds of thousands of borrowers will be in deep trouble when a downturn hits.
Indeed, according to the New York Fed, more than 1 million more Americans are behind on their car loans now than at the peak of delinquencies in 2010 after the financial crisis.
""The big lenders who do not know their customers are going to have a problem when the economy turns,"" Tormohlen says. 
""LIVE BEYOND YOUR MEANS""
Expensive older used cars are exacerbating the problem and it may take years for them to return to more affordable levels.
George Augustaitis, director of automotive industry analytics at  CarGurus  Inc (O:CARG), an online marketplace for new and used cars, said late this spring his team started to notice an ""accelerating decline"" in the number of available vehicles under $10,000, which typically would include vehicles between eight and 12 years old.
In an analysis for Reuters, CarGuru's data shows a falling share of inventory of Great Recession-era cars, while the number of online ""leads"" from consumers seeking those vehicles has remained steady. 
In fact, the average American car is the oldest on record, according to IHS Markit, and CarGurus' Augustaitis said the available inventory of vehicles costing under $10,000 will not return to more normal levels until 2022, reflecting rising car production after the Great Recession. 
Ken Shilson, president of the National Alliance of Buy Here, Pay Here Dealers (NABD), said American consumers have become too comfortable with debt and subprime customers have been ""poisoned"" by easy access to capital for much of the long economic expansion. But he added those customers will be forced by tighter underwriting to seek even older vehicles.

""The American way is to always live beyond your means and Americans aren't good at making life adjustments,' Shilson said. ""But there's a reality check coming and many subprime buyers will be forced to find more affordable transportation.""

The London interbank offered rate (Libor) rigging scandal that unfolded in 2012 led to billions of dollars in fines for major banks and jail sentences for traders convicted of manipulating the benchmark for profit.
Libor is a global benchmark for interest rates.
From 2008 to 2011, a number of Tullett Prebon (Europe) Limited (TPEL) brokers put in place improper trades in order to generate fees that should not have been paid, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said, adding that one of the trade mechanisms identified was a ""wash"" trade.
""While these trades did not mislead the market, nor amount to market abuse, the wash trades were entirely improper, undermining the proper function of the market,"" Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said.
Wash trades are two identical but opposing swaps trades between the same two counterparties, done purely to generate brokerage fees.
Citing a wash trade from 2009, the FCA said the motivation for one of the two traders involved in generating such fees for Tullett was assistance from Tullett's brokers in the attempted manipulation of Libor.
""What I normally do is if I get help on the LIBORS over the month, I normally do, at the end of the month...a couple of like in and outs"", one of the traders said in a telephone conversation with a Tullett broker on Feb 10, 2009.
""Alright mate, so that's good, because (another trader) wants to pay for his (overseas) trip already,"" the broker replied.
Tullett Prebon's rates division had ineffective controls around broker conduct between 2008 and 2010, the FCA said.
In 2008, a broker persuaded a trader to pay over the market price for a swap to clear a loss at a Tullett office. In return, Tullett paid expenses for the trader and broker for a 10-day trip to Las Vegas and San Francisco.
A senior manager knew about the arrangement, but took no action though this was ""clear misuse of entertainment expenditure,"" the FCA said.
The FCA also said Tullett Prebon failed to be open and cooperative with the watchdog and a breach occurred between August 2011 and October 2014, relating to the FCA’s request for Tullett Prebon to provide audio tapes of its brokers.
Tullett Prebon became TP ICAP (L:TCAPI) after its merger with ICAP.
TP ICAP said the FCA recognized that TPEL fully cooperated with the investigation into the relevant trades and conducted its own review of certain trades which it disclosed to the FCA.
The FCA had also found that at the time there were inadequate systems and controls in place to deal with the risk of improper broker conduct, the company said in a separate statement.
""None of the individuals involved in the relevant broking activities remain with our firm, which has long since taken the opportunity to significantly enhance its systems and controls to comply with regulatory expectations,"" TP ICAP said."

The comments followed a similar call for relief for businesses by the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, this week. 
On Tuesday, Lam said the number of tourists to Hong Kong in the first week of October, when China celebrated its National Day holiday, plummeted more than 50% from a year ago. 
The ""Golden Week"" break is normally a boon for Hong Kong businesses, with visitors from mainland China arriving in large numbers.
But official data last week showed Hong Kong's August retail sales were the worst on record, falling 23% from a year earlier.
""We hereby urge landlords and property developers to actively consider launching rent reduction schemes to assist the retail sector during this severe time,"" Financial Secretary Paul Chan told a news conference.
He said MTR Corp (HK:0066), which runs the city's metro system and is about 75% owned by the government, was offering rent adjustments to some small- and medium-sized stores that had been affected.
Some in the industry have said that landlords are not doing enough to help ease the pain.
""I understand that property developers may want to adopt stimulus measures to boost the economy and sales, but based on the situation in our society, stimulus measures are less effective to relieve our pressure,"" said Annie Yau Tse, chairman of Hong Kong Retail Management Association.
""To assist the retail sector during this severe time, we think the most effective means would be to cut rents or provide us a sufficient rent-free period.""
Sun Hung Kai Properties (HK:0016), the city's biggest property developer by value, called on the government to introduce relief measures for big and small landlords, and to work with industry to help ease the situation.
The developer said it would provide case-by-case assistance to its tenants.

Henderson Land (HK:0012) and Hysan Development (HK:0014), both major shopping mall landlords, said they had offered some tenants temporary rental adjustments and launched promotions to attract more customers.

The announcement by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to scrap foreign ownership restrictions in these sectors comes amid on-going top-level Sino-U.S. trade talks in Washington.
Earlier this year, China vowed to scrap ownership limits for foreign investors in its financial sector in 2020, but has not given a specific timetable.
CSRC told a press conference in Beijing that ownership limits in futures companies will be scrapped January. 1, 2020. 
Limits on foreign ownership of securities firms will be removed on Dec. 1, 2020, while such limits will be scrapped for mutual fund companies on April 1, 2020. 
China has stepped up efforts to open its financial sector amid a festering trade war with the United States, with increased access to its financial sector among a host of demands from Washington.

However, some analysts cautioned that the optimism for a deal might be overblown.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 04:37AM ET</span>",Ford's China sales decline again despite new models,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's (N:F) July-to-September vehicle sales in China fell 30%, as the U.S. automaker continued to lose ground in a prolonged sales decline in its second biggest market.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker delivered 131,060 vehicles in China in the third quarter, Ford said in a statement. 
Ford's sales in China fell 35.8% in the first quarter and by 21.7% in the second quarter. 
In the third quarter, sales of the automaker's mass-market Ford brand fell 37.7%, while its luxury division Lincoln saw sales drop by 24.1%. It delivered around 421,000 vehicles in the first nine months of the year, according to Reuters calculations. 
Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China after its business began slumping in late 2017. Sales sank 37 percent in 2018, after a 6 percent decline in 2017.
The automaker plans to launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years of which more than a third will be electric vehicles. It also said it would localize management teams by hiring more Chinese staff and aimed to improve relationships with joint venture partners.
Ford has launched a series of new models in the third quarter in China, including Focus, sport-utility vehicle models Edge, and electric Territory.
In China, Ford makes cars through its joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd (SZ:000625) and Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) (SZ:000550). It has said it would partner with Zotye Automobile Co Ltd (SZ:000980) to sell lower priced cars, but there seems to have not been little progress.
In a series of moves, Ford named a new president for its main local venture, Changan Ford, in August and said it would enhance its partnership with Changan through research, production and marketing cooperation in September. 
Ford is also planning to revamp some of its existing manufacturing facilities with Changan to localize production of its premium brand Lincoln.
Changan Ford's sales down by around 33.5% in the third quarter, according to Reuters calculations based on Changan's filings.
Ford's rival General Motors Co's (N:GM) July to September vehicle sales in China also fell 17.5% to 689,531 vehicles.
As GM and Ford China sales extend declines, U.S. car companies' share of total China passenger vehicle sales fell to 9.5% in the first eight months of this year from 10.7% in the year-ago period, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).
Over the same period, German car makers' share has risen to 23.8% from 21.6% and Japanese auto makers' to 21.7% from 18.3%.
Annual industry car sales in China fell last year for the first time since the 1990s, and they are expected to fall this year too. Sales dropped 6.9% in August from the same month in the prior year, CAAM said.

An official at the association said last month that in the next three years the industry could see ""low or small negative growth"".

382,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 03:43AM ET</span>",California governor says broad power shutdown to prevent fires 'unacceptable',"By Alex Dobuzinskis and Andrew Hay
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom called a widespread electricity shutdown triggered by a power company to prevent wildfires ""unacceptable"", as gale-force winds and dry weather posed a critical fire threat to the north of the state.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co (PG&E) has imposed unprecedented shut-offs that left more than 730,000 homes and workplaces in northern California without power on the second day of planned outages.
But as of late Thursday, power was restored to more than half of those who had lost it, PG&E officials said in a release. About 312,000 electric customers remained without power as of 10 p.m. officials said.
Some of the state's most devastating wildfires were sparked in recent years by damage to electrical transmission lines from high winds, with flames then spreading through tinder-dry vegetation to populated areas.
Newsom, a Democrat, told a news conference on Thursday he did not fault the utility for shutting off electricity as a safety measure, but he described the outage as too broad and said it resulted from years of mismanagement by the utility.
""We're seeing a scale and scope of something that no state in the 21st century should experience,"" Newsom said. ""What's happened is unacceptable and it's happened because of neglect.""
The remarks were the most pointed comments Newsom has directed at PG&E since the outages began early on Wednesday. Among the questions he raised was whether the utility was too large, with a service area covering more than 40 counties.
He also faulted PG&E for putting what he called ""greed"" ahead of investments in its infrastructure to protect the electrical grid from dangerous winds.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires linked to its transmission wires and other equipment.
PG&E Chief Executive Bill Johnson acknowledged that his company had left ""millions of people"" without a ""fundamental service"" they expect and deserve.
""This is not how we want to serve you,"" he told a media briefing in San Francisco, adding that PG&E ""was not adequately prepared"" for such a large power outage.
'THIRD WORLD COUNTRY'
As high winds moved south, a similar cut-off was under way by neighboring utility Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison, which warned that more than 173,000 customers could lose power in parts of eight counties, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Ventura.
Residents, business owners and even public officials expressed frustration about the blackouts, which the utility began on a much smaller scale last year during times of high fire risk.
""Northern California is not a Third World country,"" the San Jose Mercury Statesman said in an editorial. ""It's unacceptable that the region is being forced to endure this level of disruption as the long-term strategy for dealing with the threat of wildfires.""
PG&E, California's biggest investor-owned utility, said power would be restored to areas once up to 77 mph (124 kph) winds die down and 2,500 miles (4,025 km) of transmission lines could be inspected.
""We faced a choice between hardship or safety, and we chose safety,"" Michael Lewis, PG&E's senior vice president of electric operations, said in a statement.
ECONOMIC COST
The National Weather Service said the hot gusty winds that usually hit northern California in October, sometimes called the ""Diablo Winds"", would continue into Friday morning. 
Much of northern California, from San Francisco to the Oregon border, remains under a state ""red flag"" fire alert, although no major blazes have been reported.
""As soon as the weather passes, PG&E will begin safety inspections with 6,300 field personnel and 45 helicopters standing at the ready once we get the all clear,"" the utility said in a tweet on Thursday.
Oakland supermarkets brought in refrigeration trucks to save food.
Michael Wara of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment estimated the economic cost of the shutdown could reach $2.5 billion, with small businesses hit hardest as they typically lacked back-up generators.
In Santa Rosa, a California wine country town where entire subdivisions were destroyed by a deadly 2017 wildfire, restaurateurs Mark and Terri Stark said they had to close one of their six restaurants after it lost power.
""This is preventative medicine and medicine sometimes is not good to take,"" said Mark Stark, 60, who lost one restaurant in the 2017 blaze. The fires in that region killed 46 people.

""Those fires and what they caused are still very real for people in our 'hood,"" he said.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 01:04AM ET</span>",Cracks found on 38 of 810 Boeing 737 NG jets inspected globally,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Thursday that airlines had inspected 810 of the company's 737 NG jets around the world and found 38 structural cracks requiring repair and replacement of the affected parts.
The planes will be grounded until the repairs are made, Boeing and airline officials said. Nearly 5% of inspections have found cracks in a ""pickle fork"" - a part that attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure and manages forces.
The 737 NG is the third-generation 737 and version before the now-grounded 737 MAX, which is not impacted by the cracking issue.
On Wednesday, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas (SA:GOLL4) grounded at least 13 737 NG airplanes after U.S. regulators ordered urgent inspections. Indonesia's Sriwijaya Air said on Friday that it had grounded two planes.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week told U.S aircraft operators to inspect 165 older 737 NGs for structural cracks, but it now appears the actual number of planes covered is more than 200.
The FAA said late on Thursday ""a small number of aircraft based in the United States have been removed from service while Boeing develops instructions for customers to repair or replace the affected parts.""
The agency added it ""is working with the manufacturer and other international aviation safety regulators to better understand the factors that led to the formation of the cracks."" 
Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said of more than 200 high-use airplanes it had found cracks on two planes and grounded them. She declined to say if cracks had been found on any other jets but said the airline planned an update next week.
""We do not have a timeline for when the airplanes will be returned to service, we are working with Boeing to schedule the upcoming repairs,"" King said.
Boeing shares fell 1% to close at $371.00 on Thursday.
American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) said earlier this week they have not seen any cracks on their airplanes.
Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in a research note Thursday that the findings from the 737 NG inspections could ""potentially take up to 4% of capacity off-line between mid-Oct and mid-Dec.""
Planes with cracks ""may need to be taken out of the fleet for up to 60 days for maintenance,"" Syth said.
The FAA last week said inspections would look for ""cracking of the left and right hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps.""
It added that the cracking ""could adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane and result in loss of control of the airplane.""

Aircraft with more than 30,000 cycles must be inspected within seven days, while planes between 22,600 and 29,999 cycles must be inspected within 1,000 cycles, which typically correspond to the number of flights. In total, 1,911 U.S. 737 NGs are covered by the FAA directive.

388,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2019 12:59AM ET</span>",Huawei's side businesses keep it all in the family,"By Sijia Jiang
SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - On a hot summer morning at Huawei's new European-themed campus outside of Shenzhen, a man resembling a younger version of company founder Ren Zhengfei was dressing down two subordinates.
""Use your brain to think!"" he scolded, apparently dissatisfied at how they were handling visitors at the lavish facility, which features replicas of European cities and monuments.
The man was Steven Ren Shulu, 63, the younger brother of Ren Zhengfei, who joined Huawei in 1992 and is now supervisor of the board. The encounter was witnessed by chance by a Reuters reporter during a visit to the campus in August.
Huawei may be one of China's most global companies - with more than 180,000 employees in more than 170 countries running a telecommunications and technology business that generates more than $100 billion annually - but it still has elements of a family firm, with members of Ren's family playing key roles in web of side businesses, many of which have nothing to do with telecoms.
Often those side businesses, which range from hotels to food and wine, cater mainly to the Huawei employees and customers.
The role of Ren's daughter, chief financial officer Sabrina Meng Wanzhou, is widely known, especially in the wake of her arrest in Canada last December on U.S. charges relating to sanctions violations. 
Far less visible are Ren's brother, son and wife, but all play big roles within Huawei's subsidiaries.
The 74-year old Zhengfei Ren officially owns just 1.14 percent of privately held Huawei, but retains absolute authority, according to insiders at the firm, where he holds veto power and where his speeches are regularly circulated to all staff for study. 
HOUSING AND HOTELS
With the title of Chief Logistics Officer at Huawei, younger brother Steven Ren's broad brief includes overseeing construction, catering and hospitality. 
That includes the final phase of the lavish new Songshan Lake campus in Dongguan, with offices for 25,000 employees, as well as a new apartment block for employees near Huawei's Shenzhen headquarters that is expected to be built by 2023. 
Huawei declined to answer questions on the scope of its housing benefits for employees.
It is not uncommon for large Chinese state-owned or private corporations to build infrastructure including housing for employees and to provide hospitality for visiting potential customers, said Colin Hawes, an associate professor at the University of Technology, Sydney who specializes in Chinese corporate governance. 
Ren Zhengfei's son, 44-year-old Ren Ping, is now the boss of Shenzhen Smartcom Business Co. Limited, a Huawei subsidiary whose holdings include more than a dozen hotels and serviced apartments in China, Thailand, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. The hotels also mostly serve Huawei employees and clients, though some - such as the Amber House in Nanjing - can be booked by anyone online.
At the 5-star Amber Prime Hotel in Dongguan, next to Huawei's new campus, the stylish rooms come with Huawei AI speakers as well as a special TV channel with clips of Huawei executives' recent speeches.
Huawei declined to make Steven Ren, Ren Ping or another Smartcom executive available for interview. 
WINING AND DINING
Ren Ping is also president of Shanghai Mossel Trade Co., Ltd, a subsidiary where Ren Zhengfei's wife also works, according to Chinese company registration records. Named after Mossel Bay in South Africa, the company sells imported foods from around the world including Huawei-labeled wines, premium beef and fine rice, according to its website.
Most of its patrons are internal, though Mossel's e-commerce platform and bricks-and-mortar stores on Huawei campuses are open to outside customers too. Huawei did not respond to questions about why it set up Mossel in 2010, though a story in the Guardian newspaper in April quoted a spokesman saying it arose after the company took part-payment in the form of wine and beef from an Argentinian customer seeking to avoid currency controls.
Some employees told Reuters they found the Mossel goods too pricey, though others said they liked its high-quality selection of wines and foods from around the world - and that the Huawei logo on the products make for good corporate gifts.
Huawei's leisure travel subsidiary, HWTrip.com, another part of Ren Ping's Smartcom business, appears to have fallen victim to the U.S. government's campaign against Huawei: a notice on its website says it closed in August as Huawei needed to ""focus on its main channel during war times"".
Hawes said Huawei's family connections were nothing out of the ordinary for private firms in China.
""It's partly an issue of whom the CEO can trust, and also a Confucian-style sense of obligation to share one's success with family members,"" Hawes said. 
Ren has stated on multiple occasions that none of his family members, including Sabrina Meng, would succeed him as Huawei CEO.
Interviews with nearly a dozen employees turned up no signs of resentment about the role of Ren's family members.

""I don't care what the boss's family does as long as I get my pay and dividends,"" said one employee-shareholder who declined to be named.

GM urged the UAW to agree to around-the-clock negotiations to try reach a deal, while the union insisted on dealing with five specific issues first before it responded to a broader proposal from the company.
The UAW began strike action on Sept. 16, with the union's 48,000 members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the automaker's profit and protection of healthcare benefits.
Apart from costing GM more than $1 billion, the work stoppage has forced it to idle U.S. operations along with nearly 10,000 workers in Canada and Mexico. 
A day after senior union officials met with GM Chief Executive Mary Barra for the first time, the company late Thursday evening sent a letter expressing its frustration with the union's lack of response to an offer it made on Monday. 
Details of that offer have not been made public. GM said the day before the strike began that it had offered to make $7 billion in new U.S. investments in eight facilities in four states, but did not specify timing, location or products with the exception of a planned electric truck. Since then, it has offered additional concessions, but has not disclosed any details.
""As we have urged repeatedly, we should engage in bargaining over all issues around-the-clock to get an agreement,"" Scott Sandefur, GM vice president of North American labor relations, wrote in the letter sent to the UAW.
""Your members and our employees lives are being disrupted and they deserve our commitment to getting any remaining issues resolved as quickly as possible,"" Sandefur added. ""We object to having bargining placed on hold pending a resolution of these five areas.""
UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, who heads the union's GM department, said in a letter earlier on Thursday evening to GM that the union would not reply to GM's latest proposal until committees discussing five specific issues had completed their work.
Those committees are discussing issues including the fate of four U.S. factories that GM has indicated could close, cutting 15,000 jobs in North America, and future technological changes to production.
Dittes said he did not know when the five issues would be resolved, suggesting a final deal may not be close. 
UAW workers are concerned that as GM shifts to more electric vehicles it will require fewer workers, and battery production may result in workers getting paid less than at existing transmission plants.
Reuters previously reported GM told the UAW it could build a new battery plant near the now-shuttered Lordstown, Ohio, factory, and build the electric truck at its Detroit Hamtramck plant. 
U.S. President Donald Trump and many lawmakers have also waded in, urging GM to build more vehicles in the United States and shift work from Mexico. The UAW's membership is largely in the Midwest, in states that could be critical to both sides in the 2020 presidential election.
GM declined to comment on the talks between Barra, Dittes and UAW President at GM's headquarters on Wednesday. The UAW said both sides continued to meet at all levels.
Barra's goal was to get the talks moving again, sources briefed on the matter said. UAW officials had previously urged Barra to involve herself in the negotiations.
On Sunday, the UAW said the talks took a ""turn for the worse"" and on Tuesday urged GM to boost U.S. vehicle production. GM's production of trucks and sport-utility vehicles in Mexico has drawn anger among union workers.

GM shares closed up 1.5% in Thursday trading.

391,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 11:35PM ET</span>",Governor Attacks PG&E for Blackout Caused by ‘Greed and Neglect',"(Bloomberg) -- Faced with mounting public anger over massive blackouts, California Governor Gavin Newsom blamed PG&E Corp. for years of “greed and neglect” and demanded major structural changes at the bankrupt utility.
Newsom’s comments came as many Californians questioned whether PG&E overreacted to a windstorm that didn’t prove as powerful as forecast. The company cut electricity to more than 2 million people -- the largest preemptive blackout in the state’s history -- to prevent its power lines from sparking wildfires.
The Democratic governor, who on Wednesday called the blackouts “appropriate under the circumstances,” took a dramatically harsher tone Thursday, blaming PG&E for not hardening its grid and saying the outage was the result of years of bad choices. His comments came just before PG&E’s chief executive officer made his first public appearance, apologizing to customers for the “hardship” the power failures have caused while defending the decision. The company said it has restored service to about 31% of customers affected.
Story of ‘Greed’
“It’s decisions that were not made that have led to this moment in PG&E’s history -- it is not conditions,” Newsom said at a Thursday evening press conference in the state’s emergency operations center. “This is not, from my perspective, a climate change story so much as a story of greed and neglect.”
Newsom said he wanted to see a “major reorganization of this entity” and said PG&E was too large to move quickly. But the governor stopped short of saying what kind of structural changes he preferred. He suggested the company needed to be far more surgical about future outages, saying some counties didn’t need to be included in this week’s blackouts. He acknowledged, however that such preemptive power cuts should remain an option for the state’s utilities when faced with dangerous winds.
PG&E, he noted, made a decision last November not to cut power near the town of Paradise during a windstorm. A transmission line then sparked the Camp Fire, the state’s deadliest blaze, which killed 86 people.
510,000 Without Power
After affecting almost 750,000 accounts -- or about 2.25 million people -- the utility said about 510,000 customers in Northern California were still without power on Thursday night. The adverse weather has mostly died down, and PG&E said it would begin to inspect an unspecified subset of the 25,000 miles of transmission lines that were shutdown, a necessary precursor to restoring power.
Newsom called on California utility regulators to review PG&E’s actions. A spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission said the agency, as a policy, reviewed all intentional outages by California utilities.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January, facing an estimated $30 billion in liabilities from two consecutive years of deadly wildfires blamed on its equipment.
CEO Bill Johnson, who took over in May, said the company made a determination that the blackouts were necessary for safety reasons, to ensure “zero risk” of sparks. He told reporters at a San Francisco press conference that started an hour after the governor’s that it’s “very likely” the company will need to cut power again in the future. Johnson said the utility will try to be more “surgical” about shutoffs.
‘We Failed’
“This is not how we want to serve you, this is not how we want to run our business,” he said. “We are in the business of providing power, not taking it away.”
Johnson and other PG&E executives cited high wind-speed measurements in 21 of the 33 counties affected and said they found fallen tree branches on some lines that could have caught fire.
The main failure was in communicating with customers about the outages, company officials said.
Johnson said the utility posted outage maps with inconsistent or inaccurate information, its website crashed and its call center was overwhelmed. “We failed our customers,” said Laurie Giammona, senior vice president and chief customer officer for PG&E.
The CEO declined to respond directly to the governor’s remarks, saying: “I didn’t come here to deal with the past, I came here to help improve the future. I haven’t delved into all those matters. I might have some slight disagreement with the governor if I did.”
Johnson asked local residents not to take their frustrations out on PG&E workers, saying some employees had been shot at, punched and sworn at. “The buck stops with me,” he said."

HO CHI MINH CITY/HANOI (Reuters) - A new front has opened in the U.S.-China trade war as companies shifting manufacturing to Vietnam engage in a fierce battle for skilled labor, aggravating an existing shortage and prompting calls for education reforms to address the problem. 
Vietnam has emerged as one of the largest beneficiaries of the trade spat between Washington and Beijing. 
Exports to the United States were up 21.5% in the first eight months of this year, and several companies including Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Nintendo (T:7974) have announced new plans to open facilities in the country.
Hanoi's trade deals, including its recently signed FTA with the European Union, have also become a draw.
""Fresh, unskilled people are plentiful, but even basic sewing workers will need training for at least six months, so patience is the key,"" said Jef Stokes of Maxport, a Vietnam-based garments manufacturer, highlighting a lack of reform in the education system as part of the problem. 
""It's adequate, but not graduating highly qualified candidates in enough volume,"" said Stokes. ""This is the choke point.""
IT workers, engineers, and managers were already in tight supply, but additional demand from trade war refugees is increasing turnover among highly skilled workers, factory owners, consultants and recruitment firms told Reuters.
The lack of capacity should come as no surprise: Vietnam's population is just 7% that of China's, the country still lacks investment in infrastructure, and according to the World Bank needs to spend an average of $6.7 billion a year to expand its annual power generation capacity by 10% between 2016 and 2030.
Accelerating investment in the high-tech sector and companies re-considering their regional supply chains due to the trade war have re-ignited concerns about high-skill labor availability in Vietnam, said Michael Sieburg, of consultancy firm YCP Solidiance.
Only 12% of Vietnam's 57.5 million-strong workforce are highly skilled, according to recruitment firm ManpowerGroup.
This has created rising competition for talent among new investors, said Sieburg, who advises foreign companies looking to set up operations in Vietnam.
""I know that when companies are considering where to locate their facilities, they do review what other manufacturers are in the area and the associated risk of poaching.""
Nguyen Quang Anh, a 28-year-old software developer from Hanoi said he was approached several times by headhunters before he even graduated.
Since leaving university, Anh has switched jobs four times, each time for at least a 50% pay rise.
""Because of the shortage, employers are willing to pay us at much higher rates,"" said Anh. ""If tech giants relocate to Vietnam as a result of the trade war, I'll definitely apply for a position.""
OVERSEAS EXPERTISE
When Vietnam's biggest listed company, Vingroup (HM:VIC), began its push into industrial manufacturing, it had to look elsewhere to fill top talent jobs.
At the launch of its foray into automobiles, Vinfast, at least five members of the founding leadership team were veterans from General Motors (N:GM), including the CEO. 
""Our foreign experts have helped train our Vietnamese staff,"" Vingroup said in a statement. ""This model has been applied among large Vietnamese companies in the face of rapid process of globalization"".
Another solution has been to expand vocational training.
In 2016, the Vietnamese government announced a strategy to develop a skilled workforce to meet domestic and international demand and bring the country on par with the rest of the ASEAN region, although few details have been published since.
HO CHI MINH THOUGHT
Much of the problem stems from a lack of educational reform, analysts say.
At secondary level, Vietnamese schools score highly in Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores, an OECD study which assess the reading, mathematic and scientific skills of 15-year-olds around the world.
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2OwxQ0x
In 2015, the last year for which PISA data is available, Vietnam ranked eighth out of 72 countries in terms of science performance, and was 21st overall - ahead of the United States and most European nations.
At higher levels, however, the results differ.
Around 28% of the 18-29 age group attend university in Vietnam, compared to 43% in Thailand and 48% in Malaysia who pursue higher education.
""Numerous studies show that educational curricula in Vietnam are outdated, teachers overwhelmed and underpaid, and graduates lack the job ready skills sought by the private sector,"" said Adam Sitkoff of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi.
The government should take further action to modernize its education system, particularly at the vocational and university levels, Sitkoff added.
Vietnam's labor and education ministries did not respond to requests for comment. 
One example highlighting the lack of reform is the compulsory study at Vietnamese universities of the ideology and history of the ruling Communist Party, and Vietnam's founding president, Ho Chi Minh.
Nguyen Bac Chuong, a lecturer of Ho Chi Minh Thought at Hanoi Medical University, said while the central tenets of the teaching were important, the way lectures on revolutionary and party history are delivered is a little dated, and not that practical. 
""Not everyone is interested in hearing about politburo, national assembly or party meetings,"" said Chuong.

""So it's understandable that the revolutionary lines of the Communist Party of Vietnam are not always welcomed by students.""

Trump added that he plans to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He later in the day.
“We just completed a negotiation with China, we’re doing very well, we’re having another one tomorrow. I’m meeting with the vice premier over at the White House, and I think it’s going really well,” Trump said Thursday. “We’re going to see them tomorrow, right here, and it’s going very, very well.”
It was previously reported that the Chinese negotiating team might leave Washington earlier than planned due to worsening relationship with the U.S. Earlier this week, the U.S. blacklisted eight Chinese technology firms.
But things were looking more optimistic yesterday after some reports suggested that China is open to a partial trade deal and even offer to purchase more U.S.-made agricultural products.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) says it does not have copies of U.S. President Donald Trump's tax returns, a U.S. appeals court said on Thursday, closing one possible avenue for the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives to obtain the returns.
Trump has asked the court to block Deutsche Bank from releasing banking records related to himself and his family, which the House Financial Services Committee and Intelligence Committee subpoenaed in April.
The subpoena is part of Democrats' broader efforts to gather information about the Republican president's finances. 
Long a principal lender for Trump's real estate business, a 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million in liabilities to Deutsche Bank.
In a letter to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in August, the bank acknowledged that records related to Trump and three of his children subpoenaed by the committees included tax returns. 
But while the previously redacted letter said Deutsche Bank held tax returns for two individuals named in the subpoenas, their identities were withheld.
Media organizations including Reuters had asked the court to unseal the letter and reveal whose tax returns Deutsche Bank had on file from the Trump family. The court denied the motion on Thursday. 
However, in its ruling, the court said Deutsche Bank's letter revealed the tax returns it has for individuals or entities named in the subpoenas were not those of the president.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the court's ruling. A spokeswoman for Trump did not respond to requests for comment.
While campaigning for the presidency in 2016, Trump broke with a decades-old convention of candidates releasing their tax returns publicly. 
A decision on whether Deutsche Bank needs to hand over the banking records of Trump, his children and businesses is still pending, the court confirmed.
The two congressional panels issued a joint 12-page subpoena in April seeking the records. Lawmakers requested documents that identify ""any financial relationship, transactions, or ties"" between Trump, his family members and his companies and ""any foreign individual, entity, or government"", according to the subpoena.

In a separate ruling on Monday, a federal judge said eight years of Trump's tax returns must be provided to Manhattan prosecutors, forcefully rejecting the president's argument that he was immune from criminal investigations.

395,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 10:15PM ET</span>",Walmart U.S. CEO Foran to exit and be replaced by Sam's Club boss Furner,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) said on Thursday its chief executive for U.S. operations, Greg Foran, will leave the company early next year and be replaced by the head of its Sam's Club warehouse chain unit, John Furner. 
Foran's departure is likely to be considered a blow for Walmart given the New Zealand native is credited with turning around Walmart's U.S. business by focusing on improving existing stores. Walmart reported 20 quarters of comparable sales growth under his leadership.
Foran, who has held the job since 2014, will stay with Walmart until Jan. 31 and then take on the role of chief executive at Air New Zealand Ltd (AIR.NZ), an appointment that was also announced separately by the airline.
Walmart Inc Chief Executive Doug McMillon said Foran's ability to innovate, including using new technology, ""has helped position us for the future.""
However, some investors were skeptical of the change in leadership.
""While we've been highly impressed with Mr. Furner's work at Sam's Club... he does admittedly have big shoes to fill,"" said a note from Jefferies Group LLC (N:JEF). ""We can't help but expect the market to react negatively to today's news.""
Furner has run the $57.8 billion Sam's Club business since 2017. Over that time, he has improved the unit's performance with higher comparable sales by pushing the retailer to innovate, shutting stores, and repurposing stores as distribution hubs.

Walmart in August raised its forecasts for U.S. comparable sales for the full year. Its shares have risen 28% so far this year.

The company said it will also lower franchise fees at its 7-Eleven convenience stores and offer owners more assistance to keep them open 24 hours, a move likely to hit margins.
The company has faced complaints by franchise owners, some of whom were forced to keep working amid massive snowstorms or in the wake of a family death, attracting nationwide attention and scrutiny from regulators.
It also announced on Thursday that it will accelerate closures of some Ito-Yokado supermarkets as well as poor-performing department stores under the Sogo and Seibu brands.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 08:21PM ET</span>",Google begins responding to Texas antitrust investigators' data demands,"By Diane Bartz and Paresh Dave
AUSTIN/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Texas officials managing a sprawling investigation of the advertising practices at Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google have begun receiving data from the search and advertising giant after two previous probes bogged down in extended document fights.
The Texas attorney general's office said that as of Thursday, it had received some data from Google but declined to discuss it further.
The investigation, which involves all state attorneys general except Alabama and California, seeks to dig into the opaque business of online digital advertising, where Google is a dominant player. AGs for the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico are also part of the investigation.
Google, which had no immediate comment for this story, offers free searches, email and other services but much of its revenue is from advertising.
The investigation is in early stages. Texas sent a lengthy request for information to Google last month, with a response date of Oct 9.
At least twice previously, Google battled state attorneys general over data needed to complete investigations, which included antitrust and consumer protection issues.
Then-Missouri Attorney General Joshua Hawley, who has since become a U.S senator, announced an investigation into Google in 2017. He recently complained that Google at the time balked at providing information and then inundated his office with outdated documents.
Google has disputed Hawley's assertions.
Texas opened a previous multi-state antitrust investigation into Google in mid-2010. In 2012, Texas sued Google after it declined to share documents it deemed protected under attorney-client privilege. That eventually was resolved, and Texas dropped the investigation in 2014.
Jeff Mateer, Texas' first assistant attorney general, said in an interview that Google has responded through its legal counsel to last month's document request.
""We're in the process of negotiating their compliance,"" he said. ""To date they seem to be cooperating.""
If Google does balk, the states will fight, Mateer added.
""If we have to use the courts to get the information, then we will use them,"" he said.
Google faces two other major inquiries - a U.S. Justice Department investigation and a probe by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee - both of which have broad reviews of the big internet companies underway.
Texas state officials are in touch with the Justice Department about their investigations.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has been critical of Google. In a fund-raising email last month, he said Texans ""are put at risk"" by the company, ""whose executives clearly display anti-conservative and anti-Republican bias, subtly controlling what Americans see when they search for information about national political issues.""
But Mateer sought to allay concerns that the investigation was inspired by anything other than antitrust complaints.
""What we have been tasked to pursue is digital advertising,"" he said. ""We do not contemplate that - that being the investigation into conservative bias - as a part of this antitrust investigation. We do not."""

Salaries will be paid as normal during the furlough, which will last between Jan. 6 and Jan. 20, according to the company, as well as the metalworkers union representing several thousand of Embraer's workers. 
Boeing has agreed to buy 80% of Embraer's commercial plane division for $4.75 billion, a deal approved by shareholders and the Brazilian government but which is undergoing an intensive regulatory investigation in Europe. 
""The objective [of the furlough] is to implement the internal segregation of the commercial aviation business,"" Embraer said in a statement. 
It is unlikely that the deal will have received regulatory approval by Jan. 20 as European authorities have set a Feb. 20 deadline to issue their decision on the deal. The company said that workers will return to their normal functions at Embraer, without any Boeing involvement, until the deal is approved. 

Embraer said this month that it expects the deal to close in early 2020, in the wake of the additional regulatory scrutiny. Previously, Embraer had said the deal would close by the end of 2019.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 05:24PM ET</span>","Amid vaping crisis, U.S. to issue new advice for doctors focused on lung infections","By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. health officials are preparing to release new guidance for doctors stressing the need to ask every patient with an apparent respiratory infection about their vaping history. 
The updated guidance will also advise physicians on how to diagnose and manage patients who may have both a lung infection and a vaping injury.
Dr. Ram Koppaka, a medical officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said doctors need to be aware that there is an overlap between the early symptoms of vaping injury and common respiratory infections.
The CDC has already recommended doctors start asking patients about their vaping history during routine visits, but gathering that information is especially important as doctors evaluate patients with respiratory symptoms from infectious causes.
""Both diagnoses must be evaluated,” Koppaka said in a phone interview.
The CDC reported on Thursday that as of Oct. 8, 1,299 people in the United States have had confirmed or probable cases of lung injuries linked to vaping. Some 80% of those patients were under age 35, and 26 deaths have been linked to the illness.
Of 573 patients whose vaping habits have been evaluated so far, 76% reported using THC - the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana - some of whom also used nicotine vape products. Nearly a third said they only vaped THC products, while 13% percent said they only vaped nicotine. 
Some U.S. doctors have raised concerns that vaping injury cases will be missed in the crush of patients seeking treatment for seasonal flu and other respiratory ailments.
The early symptoms of vaping injury include shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, fever, and in some cases, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. ""All of those can also be seen with influenza,"" Koppaka said. 
In the United States, flu activity starts to pick up in October and November and typically peaks between December and February.
""The fact that a given individual that presents for clinical evaluation could have flu, could have lung injury due to e-cigarettes, or both, makes it complicated for providers,"" Koppaka said.
As many as 72% of the earliest vaping patients in Illinois and Wisconsin sought medical treatment in outpatient clinics and emergency rooms before doctors admitted them to a hospital with severe lung injuries from vaping, state officials reported last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Most of those patients initially were given antibiotics. When those failed, many responded to treatment with supplemental oxygen and steroids.
'ENDED UP IN AGONY' 
In addition to flu, many respiratory infections, including fungal infections, can cause symptoms that could confound doctors and delay a vaping injury diagnosis. 
The University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City has treated 22 patients with vaping injuries, including Jeffrey Manzanares, 33, who was also infected with a cold and human metapneumovirus that led to pneumonia.
Manzanares, who said he routinely vaped nicotine and occasionally vaped THC, first sought treatment at a local hospital on Sept. 3, where he was given an antibiotic and oxygen for his pneumonia and sent home, his vaping injury undetected.
""I ended up in agony from the lack of oxygen. It felt like someone was stabbing a knife into my whole body,"" he said in a phone interview.
He went to the University of Utah Hospital the next day, where he spent 21 days, including 17 in intensive care. During his illness, Manzanares said he lost 50 pounds (22.7 kg), a third of his normal body weight.
""He was wildly sick,"" said Dr. Scott Aberegg, a pulmonologist who treated Manzanares. ""If that is any harbinger of what is to come in viral pneumonia season, this could be very problematic."" 
Aberegg said many doctors who get back a positive flu test may just assume the patient has the flu and not realize they are also a vaper.
State health officials are on alert.
""We want to make sure to investigate all cases that are reported and make sure we don't miss anything that may be thought of as flu or may be associated with vaping or vice versa,"" Dr. Pam Pontones, Indiana's deputy health commissioner and state epidemiologist, said in a phone interview.
Influenza can be deadly in people who have other underlying illnesses.
""It's really important that anyone, but especially people who have underlying pulmonary infections of any kind, be vaccinated for influenza,"" Pontones said. 

The CDC recommends everyone over the age of six months get a flu shot.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday on hopes that top-level U.S.-China trade talks would yield at least a partial deal, while a jump in Apple's shares also boosted the market.
Top U.S. and Chinese negotiators met on Thursday for the first time since late July to try to find a way out of a 15-month trade war.
After the bell, the S&P e-minis  jumped and were last up about 1%, as U.S. President Donald Trump said the talks with China went ""very well today.""
He had tweeted earlier that he would meet with China's top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Friday.
Chinese officials had indicated more willingness to negotiate, according to a Chinese state news agency Xinhua report, while a senior U.S. Chamber of Commerce official said U.S. and Chinese negotiators were working toward an ""early harvest"" of confidence-building agreements, including one to avoid currency manipulation.
Cyclical groups including energy, financials, industrials and materials were the day's best-performing sectors, while the Dow Jones transportation average (DJT) jumped 1.3%.
""There's still some hope that something happens here,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. 
""But there seems to be an acceptance that this thing may not be finished."" 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) jumped 1.3% after Longbow Research upgraded the company's stock to ""buy"", citing higher iPhone 11 demand.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 150.66 points, or 0.57%, to 26,496.67, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 18.73 points, or 0.64%, to 2,938.13 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 47.04 points, or 0.6%, to 7,950.78.
Stocks have been volatile in recent weeks because of weak economic indicators showing a contraction in U.S. manufacturing and a bleak reading on business activity, bolstering bets of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve to combat a slowdown.
Data on Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in September, while underlying inflation retreated.
Among other stocks, Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) fell 1.5% after the carrier forecast disappointing current-quarter profit.
Focus will shift even further to earnings next week when the reporting period begins in earnest. Analysts are forecasting a 3.1% decline in earnings for the third quarter from a year ago, based on IBES data from Refinitiv, and that could mark a recent low point in year-over-year quarterly changes.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 15 new highs and 128 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.16 billion shares, compared to the roughly 7 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

404,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 04:47PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Rises on Hopes for Trade Deal,"Investing.com – Stocks climbed for a second day in a row Thursday as hopes built for some sort of trade deal between with the United States and China.
The S&P 500 climbed 0.64%, and the Dow Jones industrials climbed 0.57%. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indices rose 0.60% and 0.65%, respectively.
The trade optimism was set off, in part, by President Donald Trump who tweeted that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, chief of the Chinese negotiating team, would visit the White House on Friday.
Overnight, fears the Chinese delegation would leave Washington Thursday, after just a day of talks, had sent futures markets plunging. Markets have tended in recent months to move violently on any trade news. Thursday's move looked like computer algorithms reacting to the Trump tweet.
If there was a downside to the rally, it was the lack of news during the trading day. The negotiators met (they reportedly called in for takeout at lunch from Clyde's in Washington) but there was no real news.
As a result, the Dow, which had been up as many 257 points in the late morning, lost 40% of the gain, finishing up 151 points. That's good, but not boffo.
The major indexes have been slapped around by trade battles with little change since hitting new highs in July. The S&P 500's close was its 15th straight below 3,000, and the index is 2.97% below its July peak. The Dow is off 3.29%, and the Nasdaq off 4.66%. 
 
The rally was broad and 10 of 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by financial stocks, including American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Energy shares also moved up. 
Only utilities were lower because interest rates moved higher. The 10-Year Treasury yield finished at 1.661%, up from Wednesday's 1.587%. (The yield hit a low of 1.429% on Sept. 3 as investors started to worry a recession might be coming.) 
Twenty-three Dow stocks were higher, led by construction-equipment giant   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT), chemical maker Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) and pharmacy company Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) were the biggest decliners.
A total of 88 Nasdaq 100 stocks were higher, 
 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit a 52-week high of $230.43 and finished at $230.09, its first close above $230 since Oct. 3, 2018. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT), paint maker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) were among stocks hitting new highs. CBS (NYSE:CBS), Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA) and   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) all reached new lows.
Chip company Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), streaming company Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), copper-and-gold producer Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX) and chipmaker Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) were among the top S&P 500 performers. 
Computer-storage company NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), supermarket operator Kroger (NYSE:KR), Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) and chemical giant DuPont (NYSE:DD)

405,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>",U.S. judge urges parties to wisely use Purdue opioid settlement funds,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Thursday urged parties that will benefit from a proposed settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP to focus on addressing the opioid addiction crisis and avoid battling over the deal's billions of dollars.
The outline of a proposed settlement that Purdue values at more than $10 billion was filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, New York on Tuesday. 
The deal aims to resolve more than 2,600 lawsuits by states, local governments and other plaintiffs against Purdue and its Sackler family owners. The lawsuits accuse them of fueling a public health crisis by aggressively marketing opioids while downplaying their overdose risks, contributing to some 400,000 deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to U.S. statistics.
""No one can ignore the individual people affected by this crisis,"" said U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain at a Thursday hearing. ""So I hope that you all will be able to work together to use the money as wisely as possible.""
Drain urged the parties to consider ways to distribute settlement funds quickly, rather than follow the usual bankruptcy practice of evaluating each creditor claim before making payments.
He mentioned as examples the litigation settlements involving victims of Vietnam War herbicide Agent Orange, the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and the  BP  Plc (L:BP) Gulf oil spill. 
Each of those cases was resolved using compensation funds overseen by attorney Kenneth Feinberg to settle large numbers of lawsuits for personal injury and other claims.
Feinberg told Reuters on Thursday that Drain appeared to be suggesting short-circuiting the bankruptcy process by encouraging the use of a protocol that lays out a category for each claim, and automatically pays a certain amount. 
""That will avoid the jockeying and disagreements. That's a very creative idea. Clearly doable,"" said Feinberg, adding that he has not been contacted regarding Purdue.
The opioid litigation has been compared to the $246 billion settlement in 1998 between U.S. states and tobacco companies. States have been criticized for spending some of that money on budget shortfalls rather than prevention program or treating smoking-related illnesses.
Drain also said bankruptcy law could be used to bind permanently how the Purdue settlement funds were used.
On Friday, Drain will consider a request by Purdue to pause all litigation against the company and the Sacklers, which has been opposed by 25 states.

Purdue said it needs the litigation pause to try to settle with the hold-out plaintiffs.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 04:27PM ET</span>","Renault board to meet, as CEO denounces potential exit as 'coup'","By Gilles Guillaume and Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  SA's (PA:RENA) CEO, Thierry Bollore, denounced as a ""coup"" his potential exit from the French carmaker, which has called a board meeting on Friday to discuss governance matters.
Bollore also told Les Echos newspaper on Thursday he was appealing to the key Renault shareholder, the French state, to avoid destabilizing the company.
""The brutality and the totally unexpected character of what is happening are stupefying ... This coup de force is very worrying,"" Bollore said.
Earlier, Bollore had skirted the matter of his potential exit from the firm in a conversation with staff on Thursday, two company sources said.
A source close to the French government - a major Renault shareholder - earlier this week confirmed that a senior management shake-up at Renault was on the cards. 
Le Figaro newspaper reported that Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard was poised to kick off a process to replace Bollore.
The French finance ministry expressed its support of Senard on Thursday evening - after Bollore's comments were published - and said in a brief statement Senard was trusted to submit the ""necessary decisions"" to Renault's board of directors.
The French state holds a 15% stake in Renault.
Renault Chief Financial Officer Clotilde Delbos could be named as interim CEO to replace Thierry Bollore, French TV BFM said on its website on Thursday.
Speaking to staff on Thursday in an internal video exchange, Bollore referred to the media buzz and said that what mattered for the company was its alliance with Japan's Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), and that it was ""not a question of people,"" the Renault sources said. 
He avoided going into further details, however, saying only that he had met with Senard earlier on Thursday, and referred all matters to the board. 
Renault declined to comment. Separately, the company said in a statement it would hold a board meeting on corporate governance issues on Friday.
The company, like its alliance partner Nissan, is still reeling from the arrest in Tokyo last year of former boss Carlos Ghosn on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies.
Bollore, for a long time Ghosn's right-hand man, was promoted to help steady Renault earlier this year, while Senard was hired from  Michelin  (PA:MICP) to chair the group. 
""The only thing one can reproach me, maybe, is to have been named deputy CEO in early 2018, on a proposal of Carlos Ghosn unanimously approved by the board,"" Bollore told Les Echos.
As well as stabilizing the alliance with Nissan, Senard was tasked with shaking up Renault's governance, which he had yet to do.
Any change at the top of Renault would follow on the heels of a management overhaul at Nissan, and could help ease tensions between the alliance partners.

A source close to the French government’s thinking denied that Bollore’s exit was part of a quid pro quo deal to appease Nissan and renew management at the top of the two companies.

407,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 04:25PM ET</span>",Amazon Executive’s Comments Draw Ire of President Trump’s Son,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).’s top spokesman Jay Carney criticized the administration of President Donald Trump on Wednesday, questioning the patriotism and honesty of the current White House and criticizing it for trying to influence the Federal Reserve. His comments drew the attention of Trump’s son, and Carney responded by praising government officials on Thursday.
In a 30-minute interview at the GeekWire Summit in Seattle, Carney drew distinctions between the current administration and those of former Presidents Barack Obama, George Bush and Bill Clinton. Carney used to be Obama’s press secretary and worked as a political reporter before that.
“Virtually with no exception, everyone I dealt with in those administrations, whether I personally agreed or disagreed with what they thought were the right policy decisions or the right way to approach things, I never doubted that they were patriots,” he said. “I don’t feel that way now.”
Carney also said he never lied on behalf of the White House and “there doesn’t seem to be that standard today.”
On Wednesday, Carney added that it was “drummed into his head” as a government official not to mention interest rates or decisions made by the Federal Reserve. “I guess they didn’t get that memo in the current White House,” he said. Trump has railed against the Fed this year for not cutting interest rates more.
Carney, who joined Amazon in 2015, frequently tweets about his time in the Obama administration. But Amazon itself tries to keep out of hot-button political issues. Carney’s comments on Wednesday stoked tension between Amazon and Trump’s circle. The president has long denounced Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos in tweets, criticizing him for the rates the e-commerce giant pays the U.S. Postal Service to deliver packages and Bezos’s ownership of what Trump calls “the Amazon Washington Post.”
On Thursday morning, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted news reports of Carney’s comments to his 3.9 million followers and asked if this was Amazon’s official stance.
Within an hour of that tweet, Carney praised government officials on Twitter: “I have enormous faith in and respect for the countless patriots throughout the US gov’t.”

Over the past five years, health care added 249,000 jobs, about a fifth of the total and the largest show of strength among 16 industries in a ZipRecruiter analysis of labor market data from Statistics Canada. Professional and business services and the transportation industry were next highest, accounting for a combined 353,000 new positions.
Canada’s job market continues to be a bright spot in an economy that has otherwise seen mixed signals this year. The statistics agency will release its labor force survey for September on Friday, and economists expect job growth to cool to 20,800, after a stellar gain in August of 81,100.
When it comes to wage growth, which has been sluggish overall, workers in management occupations have seen the fastest increases over the past five years, according to the ZipRecruiter study. Wage growth in the business, sales and management sectors topped 12%, versus 7% in the health industry."
409,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 03:52PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. All Eyes on Trump
U.S.-China trade hopes were given a lifeline Thursday on reports that both nations could announce a limited agreement on trade. News of a limited deal arrived just hours after Trump confirmed that he would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday. 
The agreement, however, will not end the trade war as it is unlikely to address Trump’s concerns on key points that have dogged trade talks for months such as China’s economic practices and policies that force U.S. firms – wanting to enter the Chinese market -- to team up with local partners.
But the limited deal is enough to persuade Trump to halt tariffs on Chinese goods that were set to go into effect on Oct. 15, potentially deescalating trade tensions between the world’s largest two economies.
With Trump seemingly set to orchestrate the trade talks on Friday, and hopes of a deal running high, U.S. government bonds will likely be in the spotlight again, after Treasury yields surged on Thursday. The 10-Year Treasury yield moved up to 1.661% Thursday from Wednesday's 1.587%.
The uptick in bond yields comes even as markets continue to price in a Fed rate cut at the of the month, with the odds of further easing now at about 80%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
2. Consumer Confidence Check
Consumer confidence numbers will be in the spotlight tomorrow, with many the strength of the consumer will likely continue to keep the U.S. economy above water.
The University of Michigan releases its preliminary measure of October consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Consumer sentiment is expected to decline to a reading of 92, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The expectations component is forecast to drop to 81.7.
3. Rig Counts on Tap
The latest rig count data due Friday may take on added importance for clues on domestic crude production, which rose to record 12.6 million barrels a day last week.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 3 to 710.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 1.8% higher at $53.55 a barrel after OPEC suggested the door was open for further production cuts next year, with a decision expected to be made at oil-cartel’s meeting in December."
410,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>","Fed eases post-crisis rules for domestic, foreign banks","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday unveiled a final package of rules easing capital and liquidity requirements for domestic U.S. and foreign banks that were originally introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.
The changes, which should reduce the compliance burden and free up funds for U.S. Bancorp (N:USB),  Capital One  (N:COF) and PNC Financial (N:PNC), among others, mark another win for the industry after the Fed also relaxed rules on derivatives trades and banks' annual health checks. 
Thursday's package stems from bipartisan legislation passed by Congress in May 2018 that rewrote parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. 
That 2018 law ordered the Fed to reduce the burden on community and regional lenders, but progressive Democrats and consumer groups are likely to criticize the central bank for giving larger banks too much leeway with its final changes.
Randal Quarles, the Fed's top regulatory official, said the package allows the Fed to more closely tie stricter rules to risks and retains the toughest requirements for the largest firms.
But Governor Lael Brainard voted against the easier rules, saying in a statement they go beyond the law passed by Congress and would ""weaken the safeguards at the core of the system before they have been tested."" Brainard has regularly opposed recent efforts at the Fed to ease bank rules.
The Fed on Thursday said the changes, which it first proposed in October last year, aim to more closely tailor regulations to the riskiness of firms' businesses. 
The final domestic rules, which are nearly identical to the 2018 proposal, establish tiers of regulations for larger U.S. banks. Domestic banks with under $700 billion in assets, which includes all but a handful of the nation's largest firms, would enjoy some degree of relaxed capital and liquidity rules.
Fed staff estimated the final rules would lower capital requirements by about 0.6% and liquidity requirements would drop by about 2% for all affected banks.
Globally systemically important U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) would not benefit from the changes however.
On Thursday the Fed also finalized a new regulatory regime for foreign banks operating in the United States. The rules relax capital, liquidity and stress testing requirements for subsidiaries of foreign banks but retain stricter standards for firms that engage in riskier activities like short-term funding.
Thursday's rules package also includes a relaxed schedule for when foreign and domestic banks must submit ""living wills"" to the regulator detailing how they could be safely dissolved.
In a win for foreign banks, the Fed said it was no longer considering establishing its own stricter liquidity requirements for foreign bank branches. Instead, the Fed will work with international regulators on the issue. The Fed had previously considered stricter rules for branches out of a concern that overseas lenders could use them to shield assets from oversight.
But the Fed opted to apply a higher liquidity standard to all larger lenders in its final rule. 

In its original proposal, the Fed sought comment on setting a reduced liquidity ratio for larger firms somewhere between 70% and 85% of the full requirement for global banks. In the final rule, the Fed stuck to the high end of that scale for banks with over $250 billion in assets.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 02:26PM ET</span>",Markets dance to Trump's trade tunes,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The ebb and flow of trade tensions between the United States and China has roiled financial markets for months, and with the December deadline for higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods approaching fast no asset class is immune to trade-related risks.
Markets' sensitivity to trade headlines was on stark display this week.
The S&P 500 index (SPX) fell 2% over the first two days of the week as the trade outlook darkened following a U.S. move to impose visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province.
The benchmark stock index, however, reclaimed most of the lost ground over Wednesday and Thursday as Beijing and Washington's continued willingness to talk supported hopes that the latest talks would yield at least a partial deal.
On Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.7%.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Friday, the second of two-days of high-level U.S. China trade talks aimed at averting scheduled increases in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said China is willing to reach agreement with the United States on matters that both sides care about so as to prevent friction from leading to any further escalation, the state news agency Xinhua reported.
Despite assurances that both Washington and Beijing want a trade deal investors are acutely sensitive to the very real risk that the latest round of trade talks could end without a deal.
Equity investors in particular have been hyper-sensitive to every trade-related headline, boosting stocks on any sign of news that bodes well for a trade deal while pulling the market down on the first sign of bad news.
Any significant escalations of trade tensions have been followed by sharp pull-backs in U.S. stocks, as seen in May, when President said he would raise tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese imports.
Graphic: U.S.-China trade war timeline - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/0100B2FT1P9/trade-timeline.png
Currency markets have also been swayed by trade headlines. Increased trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have generally been supportive of the dollar as investors view the United States to be in better shape than its rivals to weather a trade war.
The dollar index (DXY) which measures the greenback against six major currencies, is up nearly 3% for the year. It recently hit a 28-month high.
International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars, have boosted their bullish bets against the dollar to a 14-week high, according to CFTC data.
""That's a safe-haven play,"" said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto.
""It's not that they are totally confident in the U.S. economy, it's just that the U.S. dollar being a reserve currency gives them a bit of a safety advantage,"" he said.
Graphic: U.S. dollar speculative positions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7189/7120/cftc.png
Traders in the equity options market are equally anxious and on the lookout for safety.
For S&P 500 options contracts expiring in December, put options, which are typically used for bearish bets, make up 14 of the top 20 largest blocks of open contracts, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
The put-to-call ratio, a measure of positioning sentiment is the most bearish in at been in at least 5 years, according to Trade Alert data.
""Big institutions use this contract primarily for hedging and they're very hedged, heavily hedged,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin.
""Even though we had a little bit of a pullback last week, they didn't really take any of those hedges off, and so now they're still ready and prepared for another big downturn if we get one,"" he said.
""I think ultimately, a lot of this has to do with the trade talks with China.""

Since then, Charles Schwab shares have fallen nearly 4%, Ameritrade 1.4%, while E*Trade has risen nearly 6%. 
Newer rivals such as Menlo Park, California-based startup brokerage Robinhood have been capturing market share in recent years by offering commission-free stock trades, forcing traditional brokerages to follow suit.
The firms are able to offer the free trading by pushing their customers' orders to so-called wholesale market makers, such as Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial (O:VIRT), which aim to make a profit on the spread between the bid and the offer on the shares.

Fidelity said the change will take effect on Thursday for individual investors and Nov. 4 for investment advisers.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 01:42PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo beefs up mortgage division to cope with higher volumes,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) is boosting its teams that process mortgage loans to prepare for higher mortgage volumes, changing course after it laid off about 1,000 employees https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-layoffs/wells-fargo-plans-1000-u-s-job-cuts-idUSKCN1NK2P7 in the division in 2018, according to a memo viewed by Reuters.
Many of the hires will be in Des Moines, Iowa and Minneapolis, according to the memo. Yet, Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage originator according to Inside Mortgage Finance, laid off hundreds of mortgage employees in these cities just last year.
Representatives from Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately clear how many employees the bank will add.
The about-face comes as banks brace for a surge in mortgage activity fueled by lower interest rates. Refinancing activity, which accounts for a majority of mortgage applications, has more than doubled from a year ago, according to data released by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday. Purchase activity has climbed 10% from a year ago.
Indeed, business could boom further if mortgage rates drop even more, with U.S. monetary policymakers expected to cut the benchmark interest rate a third time this year at the end of October.
Other large banks that also let go of staff https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mortgages-jobs/u-s-mortgage-industry-faces-job-losses-as-refinancing-dries-up-idUSKCN1MS1U0 in 2018 will likely follow Wells Fargo in staffing back up, according to banking sources. They said some lenders have been struggling to keeping up with the wave of originations following sweeping headcount reductions across the industry.
Large banks have laid off thousands of mortgage employees over the past two years as refinancing applications plunged and amid increased competition from non-bank entrants like Quicken Loans Inc.
The financial services industry tends to fire and rehire thousands of employees as revenue fluctuates, but analysts thought the most recent decline in the mortgage business would be permanent as the process has become more automated.
The Wells Fargo staffing plans will be fluid, allowing the bank to adjust to the market, the memo said.
The latest hiring initiative could throw a wrench into Wells Fargo's plans to cut costs. In July, the bank warned investors that 2020 costs would not be lower as previously expected since the bank hired thousands of employees to improve its risk management and work through the regulatory fallout from its various scandals.
The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets has leaned on cost cuts to stabilize its bottomline amid sluggish revenue trends. Now, the San Francisco-based bank must also contend with fresh macroeconomic uncertainty from a changing interest rate environment that’s pressuring lending margins across the industry."
415,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 01:29PM ET</span>","As GM workers picket, Michigan's economy feels the chill","By Tim Reid
FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Waving a placard on the picket line outside a General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) truck plant in Flint, Michigan, Robert Bacon says he has no money to spend. His $250-a-week strike pay barely covers his food and gas.
Up the road, bartender Jeanne Bonner made just $2 in tips one day last week, compared with $80 during a normal shift.
""We've thrived off GM for years,"" Bonner said. ""When they are not working it hurts everybody around here.""
Convenience store owner Brad Khirfan says he has lost two-thirds of his business since GM workers walked off the job last month, triggering the longest nationwide U.S. auto strike in nearly 30 years.
Khirfan, who has run his shop next to the GM truck plant for 32 years, said the strike could have political repercussions.
""I take the pulse of the workers here. A lot of them feel abandoned by (U.S. President Donald) Trump,"" he said. ""He promised manufacturing jobs would come back, and it's not happened.""
The United Auto Workers union strike is spreading pain throughout Michigan, a battleground for the November 2020 election where the economy was slowing before more than 23,000 UAW workers walked out of GM's Michigan plants in mid-September. The total number of UAW strikers nationwide is 48,000.
Unemployment in the state is 4.2%, and it has been rising even as the national rate continues to fall. The state's job growth has slowed dramatically, said Chris Douglas, an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint. The strike has cost a total of $228 million in lost wages in the state between Sept. 16 and Oct. 6, according to the East Lansing, Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group. 
The health of Michigan's economy matters to rivals in the 2020 U.S. presidential race. 
Trump, a Republican, carried Michigan by less than 11,000 votes in 2016, an unexpected victory that along with wins in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin propelled his ascent to the White House. Trump's tough stance on trade and his promises to win back manufacturing jobs resonated with many UAW members. 
Some of Trump's Democratic rivals have tried to use the GM strike to win back UAW votes. They have joined GM strikers on picket lines and echoed their calls for GM to share profit more fairly and invest more in U.S. plants.
A HISTORY OF CONFLICT
Flint, a city of about 100,000 people located 70 miles (113 km) northwest of Detroit, has a long history of labor conflict. In 1936, workers at a GM factory here staged a sit-down strike that forced the automaker to recognize the United Auto Workers union, a milestone in U.S. labor relations. 
Some workers picketing outside GM's Flint truck this week remembered the UAW's 1998 strike against GM parts-making plants in Flint that lasted 54 days and cost the company $2 billion. In the years following that bitter clash, GM sold or closed several of its Flint operations, shedding thousands of UAW jobs and battering the city's economy.
Today, Flint is one of the most impoverished cities in America. Nearly 40% of the city's residents live below the poverty line, according to U.S. Census data published in 2018. Flint suffered a prolonged water crisis that began in 2014, when it emerged that lead had leeched into its water supply, exposing many residents to elevated lead levels.
The sprawling GM truck assembly plant offered hope for better times. The new heavy-duty pickup trucks assembled at the plant are highly profitable, and GM President Mark Reuss earlier this year traveled to Flint to say the plant would hire 1,000 additional workers to build them.
The strike halted production just as the truck plant was ramping up to deliver vehicles to dealers.
DOUGHNUTS AND $250 A WEEK
Instead of earning overtime pay, GM truck plant workers are getting by on $250 a week in UAW strike pay.
On the picket line, strikers acknowledged the frequent horn blasts from passing drivers honking in solidarity. One truck driver arrived with free doughnuts for the strikers, while another group set up an impromptu hot dog stand. 
Russ Van Buren, 47, a striking worker outside the Flint plant, describes himself as a political independent. He has not decided whom he will vote for next year, but said if the Michigan economy turns worse, Trump will be in trouble.
""If our economy goes down the toilet, people will desert Trump,"" Van Buren said. A third of UAW workers backed Trump in 2016, the union has said. ""People are going to look for another person to run this country,"" Van Buren said.
Standing nearby, Jeremy Henman, 32, a striking forklift driver, said he likes Trump's idea of a border wall and his support of gun owners, and thinks the economy is doing great.

""I'm thrilled with what he's done,"" Henman said. ""I'm definitely voting for him again.""

416,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 01:16PM ET</span>","Instant View: USDA raises corn yield estimate, lowers soybean yield","CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture in a monthly report on Thursday raised its U.S. 2019/20 corn yield estimate to 168.4 bushels per acre (bpa), from 168.2 in September, but lowered its estimate of the U.S. soybean yield.
The government's projection of the U.S. corn crop was 13.779 billion bushels, down slightly from September as a reduction in harvested acreage offset the higher average yield.
The USDA put soybean production at 3.550 billion bushels, down from 3.633 billion in September, and lowered its 2019/20 soy ending stocks forecast to 460 million bushels, from 640 million last month.
The USDA cut its soybean yield estimate to 46.9 bpa, from 47.9 in September.
Chicago Board of Trade corn and wheat futures fell after the reports were released while soybean futures rose.
Highlights:
* USDA trims U.S. corn, soy production outlook
* USDA October crop supply, demand summary
* U.S. and world crop highlights-USDA
* Trade estimates for corn, soybean crops
* Trade estimates for U.S. grain stocks
* Trade estimates world crop end-stocks
COMMENTS:
* Brian Hoops, president of Midwest Market Solutions:
""The market is focusing on the corn yield. The trade was expecting a reduction and did not get it, actually saw a small increase from last month. Two-tenths of a bushel is not a large increase, but it's well above what the trade expected, and that set off a lot of selling. The only thing we have to be bullish about in this corn market is possible lower yields and lower production.""
* Ted Seifried, chief market strategist, Zaner Ag Hedge:
""USDA raised the yield in corn, which if you look at the polls not many people were expecting. I think that number will come down over time. (CBOT) corn is testing some very key resistance with its lows today. For soybeans, ending stocks are sub-500 million bushels, and that's without a trade deal. If we get a trade deal, we're going to say, 'Wow, we're going to run out of soybeans this year.' I see more upside potential, especially if South America stays dry.""
* Ed Duggan, analyst at Top Third Ag Marketing:
""Most people still believe we're still dealing with (corn) harvested acres somewhere around 78 million, and not the 81.8 (million) that USDA is using ... Until the silage report comes out in January, that's a number we're going to have to deal with ... I still have a hard time believing a (corn) yield figure of 168.4 (bpa), considering 33% of the crop was planted after June 2. You've got a freeze in the northern Plains this weekend that's going to take the top off some of it. It's also going to have a bigger impact on the beans, with all the snow in the Dakotas.""
* Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities:
""The corn market and wheat market both say we have adequate to bearish supplies. The one positive is the soybeans. Ending stocks continue to drop like a rock, down to 460 million (bushels), and the government took the cash price up 50 cents a bushel to $9, and took the demand up.""
* Tomm Pfitzenmaier, analyst for Summit Commodity Brokerage:
""There's way more corn than we thought there was going to be. The yield is better than the trade expected. It just makes it tough going for the corn market, given the demand we've got - or don't have.""
* Jack Scoville, analyst with the Price Group:
""They really trimmed back on the corn demand. That's one of the primary reasons for corn (futures) being down today ... It's a significant drop in ending stocks on beans, but that's still an ample supply. There's going to be questions on the production side of corn, especially since they're showing weaker production in the beans. I don't understand why the corn wouldn't see weaker production as well. That will be a question mark moving forward.""
* Terry Reilly, senior analyst, Futures International:
""The soybean-corn spreading was a given after USDA cut the soybean yield by a bushel and took the corn yield up a surprising 0.2 bushel ... It's not what the amount is for the corn and soybean ending stocks for 2019/20, it's the direction the stocks are moving. Now that we're looking at less than 500 million bushels (for 2019/20), longs are starting to get behind the soybean market."""

Investing.com – Financial stocks hitched a ride to lead the broader market higher as Treasury yields caught a bid on rising optimism over a progress on a U.S. and China trade deal thanks to President Donald Trump confirming that he would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday. 
The sector was easily the strongest in the S&P 500, up nearly 1.5%. Ten of the 11 sectors in the index were higher.

In the hours leading up to the trade talks, traders had to contend with a wave of conflicting reports, which had suggested the potential for progress on this week’s talks was murky at best. 

But with Trump set to join talks on Friday, trade hopes were restored somewhat, prompting investors to move out of safe-haven Treasuries, sending yields higher, which move into the opposite direction to bond prices. 

The United States 10-Year yield was up 8 basis points to 1.665% from Wednesday's 1.587% while the 2-year yield climbed 5 basis points to 1.52%. 

Financials, mostly banks, rose in tandem with rising yields with Bank Bank of America (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) rising more than 2% and   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) up nearly 2%. 

Rising Treasury yields are seen as a boon for banks, letting them boost their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income the banks generate and the interest they pay out."

MILAN/ROME (Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) is mulling an overhaul of its Italian business MTS ahead of a potential merger with data provider Refinitiv, two Italian sources with knowledge of the situation said on Thursday.
The changes under consideration include shutting down a bond trading platform called BondVision, and moving the management functions of Italian securities' clearing operations from Milan to London, the sources said.
LSE's Chief Executive David Schwimmer was in Rome on Thursday to discuss the proposed changes with officials from the Bank of Italy and market regulator Consob, the sources said.
LSE declined to comment on Schwimmer’s visit to Italy and content of discussions.
LSE Group owns Italian stock exchange Borsa Italiana, which in turn controls the MTS platform on which Italian government bonds are traded.
The British group is moving ahead with a $27 billion plan to buy Refinitiv after Hong Kong's bourse scrapped an unsolicited $39 billion bid for the London exchange operator.
Thomson Reuters, a professional information company that is the parent of Reuters News, holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv.
The BondVision trading platform is used by institutional investors, including the Bank of Italy, and mostly trades Italian government bonds, with a daily volume of 5-6 billion euros.
The sources said the plan the LSE was considering envisaged shutting down BondVision because Refinitiv has a similar bond trading platform, Tradeweb (O:TWO).
One of the sources said that LSE was also considering moving the management functions of clearing house unit Cassa di Compensazione & Garanzia (CC&G) and settlement house Monte Titoli from Italy to London.
In London the LSE operates LCH, one of the world’s biggest clearing houses.
The sources said Italian authorities were concerned that the planned overhaul would be a first step toward centralizing actual clearing and post-trading operations outside of Italy and would eventually lead to MTS being dismantled.
Italy, which has the world's third largest public debt, considers the Milan stock exchange and its government bond trading unit MTS a strategic asset. Last month, it approved a law giving the government special powers to protect the Milan exchange from possible outside threat."

426,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>","Delta looks at faster hiring to meet 'surprise' demand, costs rise","By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) hopes to speed up the hiring of pilots, flight attendants, reservation and airport staff after ""surprise"" demand growth fueled better-than-expected third-quarter profit, Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters.
However, that growth is driving up expenses, a concern for investors. Shares of Delta, which have outperformed major airline peers this year, sank 3.4% to $52.06, after earlier dropping to $51.07, its lowest since March 29.
Delta paid its pilots record overtime this summer as the carrier flew a heavy schedule, in part because of demand tapped from competitors that canceled flights due to the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
""The size of the demand surprised us,"" Bastian said in a telephone interview.
Atlanta-based Delta does not own the 737 MAX, which has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes. As a result, it is able to increase flight capacity at a time when growth at MAX carriers like Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and American Airlines (O:AAL) remains at a standstill.
Delta is forecasting capacity growth of around 4.5% in the fourth quarter, though costs per available seat mile, excluding fuel, are also seen rising between 4% and 5% in the period.
Costs, excluding fuel, rose 2.4% in the third quarter due to higher employee wages, demand volume and weather incidents, Delta said. ""Given the high volume that we've experienced and the demand for the product, it's created a need for additional resources across all of our work groups (...) and getting this staffing in sooner,"" Bastian said.
Delta expects to retain the market share it picked up this summer, he told investors on a conference call. New hires will help meet larger travel volumes and keep cost inflation at around 2% over the longer term.Net income climbed 13.1% to $1.5 billion in the quarter to Sept. 30 on total adjusted revenue of $12.56 billion. Adjusted earnings per share reached $2.32, beating analysts' expectations for profit of $2.26, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts were forecasting revenue of $12.6 billion.

For the fourth quarter, Delta expects earnings per share in the $1.20 to $1.50 range, below analyst estimates for $1.51. The airline, the first of its peers to report quarterly earnings, is among the U.S. airlines hardest hit by a new 10% tariff on European-made Airbus (PA:AIR) planes. Bastian said the tariff is not expected to have an impact this year because its remaining Airbus deliveries will come from the European planemaker's plant in Mobile, Alabama, which is exempt from the levy. Delta is ""looking at all of our options to make sure that we don't incur any increases to our already negotiated prices with Airbus"" for deliveries due next year, Bastian said. Last month, Delta pledged to buy 14 more A350s, which are assembled in Europe, as part of a strategy to grow in Latin America through the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group. The airline is also still targeting an investment of around 100 million euro ($109.80 million) in the rescue of Italian flagship carrier Alitalia, Bastian said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A member of Swiss drugmaker Roche's controlling family said on Wednesday that short-term profit maximization has ""destroyed the planet"" and the world needs a new breed of capitalism putting long-term interests first.
Roche Vice Chairman Andre Hoffman, 61, the scion of the 123-year-old drugmaker's founder whose family's stake is worth some $23 billion, said business must set more ambitious goals for reining in human impact.
Hoffmann's comments won a sudden round of applause from the 900-strong audience of business people at the Building Bridges sustainability summit in Geneva, Switzerland's French-speaking banking hub.
Hoffmann, an environmentalist, said he understood why activists are impatient for faster climate-change action but he rejected violent protest.
The Extinction Rebellion group has risen to prominence after protests around the world, including in Switzerland. It wants to see politicians and businesses take tougher and swifter steps against climate change.
""I can understand people in the streets gluing themselves to doors,"" Hoffmann told Reuters. ""Violence should never be allowed, it should not happen. But the fact that people are panicked about the future, I understand that."" 
""Today, the company which says, 'I'm not doing any harm, I'm using resources and activities in a way that doesn't harm,' that company is behind the curve,"" he said. ""We need to be net contributors. We need to repair the damage done. Short-term profit maximization has destroyed the planet, environmentally and socially.""
Hoffmann cited a new Roche remuneration model for the company's U.S. salesforce, which sees pay more closely tied to patient outcomes rather than numbers of pills sold, as an example of his company's pursuit of longer-term goals and sustainable practices.

""Society is destroying the planet. And that's happening in front of our eyes. We can all say, 'OK, it's finished, let's quickly make hay while the sun still shines.' Or we can try to do something active about it. And I believe business is the way to do it,"" he said.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 11:11AM ET</span>","Southwest, Gol ground 13 Boeing 737 NG airplanes after checks","By David Shepardson and Marcelo Rochabrun
WASHINGTON/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas have grounded a total of 13 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 NG airplanes, the companies said, after U.S. regulators ordered urgent inspections.
Southwest said it had taken two planes out of service, while Gol had grounded 11. Both airlines are major operators of the 737, including the NG variant and the more recent MAX, which has been grounded for months after two deadly crashes. 
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last week told aircraft operators to inspect 165 older 737 NG planes for structural cracks within seven days, after cracking was found on a small number of planes. Nearly all the 165 jets were Southwest aircraft, officials said. 
First delivered in 1997, the NG is the third generation of the 737, preceding the grounded MAX, which is unaffected by the cracking issues.
Southwest, which did not find any issues in the ""vast majority"" of planes, said it ""removed the two aircraft from our operation and reported the findings to Boeing and the FAA."" 
Gol, which runs a fleet of 115 737s excluding its grounded MAX jets, said it took 11 out of service after finding ""evidence of the need to replace a specific component."" The fleet change will affect 3% of passengers until Dec. 15, it said.
The inspections were ordered following the discovery of cracks on a part known as the ""pickle fork,"" which attaches the fuselage to the wing structure and manages forces.
Minor aircraft cracks are not unusual, an industry source said, but are not normally expected to occur on the pickle fork until near the end of the plane's lifespan, typically considered to be more than 90,000 takeoff and landing cycles.
The FAA mandated checks for ""cracking of the left and right hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps,"" warning the issue ""could adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane"" and result in loss of control. More planes will eventually be inspected, it said.
The initial inspection order covered a total of 1,911 U.S.-registered planes. The checks can be done visually and take about an hour per airplane.
Aircraft that have carried out more than 30,000 flight legs, or cycles, must be checked within seven days, the safety regulator said, while those with 22,600-29,999 cycles must be checked before completing a further 1,000.
Boeing has been in touch with 737 NG operators about the inspections, the manufacturer said earlier, emphasizing that ""no in-service issues have been reported.""
United Airlines and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Inc are among other U.S. carriers flying the 737 NG, which includes the 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER variants.
Each airline has about 80 planes that will need inspection in coming months, United and American said, but none that fall into the seven-day requirement for more urgent checks.
European budget carrier Ryanair, which has a fleet of more than 450 737-800s, confirmed it was in the process of carrying out the inspections, without saying how many planes required them.
""We are midway through the first part of this mandatory check program and don't expect it will have any impact upon our fleet or operations,"" a Ryanair spokeswoman said.
Transavia Airlines, a low-cost carrier owned by Air France-KLM, said it would examine all 42 of its 737s even though only 16 need checks under the FAA mandate - of which one was inspected under the seven-day requirement. KLM, which also operates 737 NGs, has inspected all but one of 13 aircraft covered by the order and found no anomalies, a spokesman said.

Jeju Air, a South Korean low-cost operator, had also completed the majority of required checks, while inspections were ongoing at domestic rival Jin Air and had been completed at Eastar Jet. None of the three airlines had found any issues, they said.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's Lamda Development (AT:LMDr) hopes to secure all the necessary licenses to start a huge development of luxury homes and offices at a disused airport site in Athens early next year, its top executive said on Thursday.
The former Hellenikon airport, a sprawling site of disused runways, terminals and venues used for the Athens 2004 Olympics, has been abandoned for almost two decades.
Lamda plans to turn it into a complex of luxury homes, hotels, offices, a yachting marina and a casino at a total cost of 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion), aiming to attract thousands more tourists and investors to the Greek capital.
The project, part of a post-bailout agreement between Greece and its lenders, has faced several hurdles in recent years. But the newly elected Conservative government has expedited plans, including a tender for a casino resort at the site.
""I believe when we go in, and this I think will happen in January - in any case, early next year - all permitting will be completed. There will be no risk in terms of licensing,"" Lamda's Chief Executive Officer Odisseas Athanasiou told shareholders, as they met to vote on an equity issue of up to 650 million euros to fund part of the investment.
NOT JUST A CASH CALL
Lamda announced the cash call last month, saying China's Fosun (0656.HK) and Arab funds had withdrawn interest in the project and it would undertake the development on its own due to the complexity and strict timetable.
Its biggest shareholder, the Latsis family, has committed to fully exercise its preemptive rights over the share sale and underwrite any unsubscribed shares.
Greece's biggest air carrier Aegean Airlines (AT:AGNr) also said this week it would buy a 1.6% stake in Lamda and participate in the cash call.
""I am inviting you to take part not in a simple share capital increase but in the implementation of a project which we will be all proud of,"" Athanasiou said.
Lamda, which first outlined the investment plan in 2013, expects to spend about 2 billion euros in the first five years of an estimated 25-year construction phase to build two skyscrapers of offices and a hotel, about 800 residences and a park, Athanasiou said.
""Investment risk for the first five years is covered,"" he said, adding there had been strong foreign interest in the residences, of which there are eventually expected to be about 10,000.
Along with issuing new shares, Lamda expects to secure 400 million euros from property sales, about 800 million from banks loans and 150 million from issuing debt to reach that sum, he added.
Greece last week received two bids for the 1 billion euro casino resort within Hellenikon: one from U.S. casino operator Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment partnered with Greek contractor GEK Terna, and another from Hard Rock International."

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union is considering tighter rules to counter the flow of dirty money into the region's banks and other economic sectors, EU officials said on Thursday.
Following a spat of money-laundering scandals at several lenders that highlighted weak oversight by national authorities, the EU is also considering setting up a new agency or beefing up existing EU-wide agencies.
New rules under consideration could increase controls over sectors where risks of money laundering are high, such as financial services, gaming and real estate, Finance Commissioner Valdis Dombrovski.
One official said stricter rules could also hit intermediaries, like lawyers or tax advisers. The EU has already changed its anti-money laundering rules twice over the past five years to keep up with emerging threats and close loopholes.
Speaking after a meeting of EU finance ministers, Dombrovski said there was also support for plans for reducing states' leeway in applying existing rules.
Currently, the 28 EU states have large discretion in imposing sanctions to wrongdoers and in fighting financial crime. This creates loopholes that criminal organizations exploit.
As part of the overhaul, many ministers supported the creation of a new agency at EU level that would take over supervision powers from national authorities, officials said.
""We need to be ready to discuss some forms of EU supervisory body. It should have an independent structure and decision-making,"" Finnish Finance Minister Mika Lintila said at the end of the meeting.
The European Central Bank and the EU parliament have called for an EU agency against money laundering, which they believe could better counter the flow of illicit money, estimated by the United Nations to amount to around $2$ trillion a year globally.
Many governments have long opposed changes to the supervision of financial crime, fearing they would lose power and be forced to share sensitive information.
At the meeting on Thursday, some ministers cautioned against changes. One official said Estonia, Malta and other smaller states were among the least keen on reforms.
Last year, the Estonian branch of Danske Bank emerged as the epicenter of the largest money-laundering scandal in the EU. Two Maltese banks have stopped operations since last year because of money-laundering allegations.
France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria pushed instead for a comprehensive reform, officials said. Germany's finance minister, Olaf Scholz, remained silent during the ministerial debate. Berlin has in the past opposed major reforms.
Talks among states will continue. A final decision on the new framework is expected in December, officials said."

LONDON (Reuters) - The owners of London's Ritz hotel, a haven for royals, statesmen and movie stars, have hinted that they would be open to selling the luxury establishment for $1 billion, a source close to them said on Thursday.
Opened in 1906 by Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz, the high society hotel hosted Charlie Chaplin in the 1920s and was used as a meeting place by Winston Churchill, Dwight Eisenhower and Charles de Gaulle to discuss operations during World War Two.
Today, it offers its well-heeled global clientele 111 rooms, 25 suites, a range of bars and restaurants and the Palm Court, where an elaborate afternoon tea is served and men have to wear ties.
The Ritz has been owned since 1995 by David and Frederick Barclay, twins who also own the Daily Telegraph newspaper. The pair usually decline interviews and give little away in public about their business strategy.
A source close to the twins told Reuters they had recently received several unsolicited offers for the Ritz, and its latest accounts gave a valuation for the hotel, a move that has fueled speculation they would sell if they received a high enough bid.
The accounts said the business ""is not and has not been marketed for sale"". But the source confirmed that the publication of the valuation, which was more than 800 million pounds ($980 million), was a significant hint from the  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The directors said in the accounts that the valuation reflected the hotel's freehold tenure, its prime location on the busy Piccadilly thoroughfare near Buckingham Palace, the quality of the building, the casino lease and the brand name.
Turnover stood at 47 million pounds in 2018, while the operating profit was 15 million pounds, according to the accounts.
Independent real estate expert Paul Olliff, said the high valuation, which relied more on the hotel's prestige than on its financial performance, could be a hurdle to a deal.
""However, given it will be classed as a 'trophy asset', buyers might not be put off by a financial performance that doesn't reflect the sale price,"" said Olliff, who is a legal director at law firm Ashfords' real estate team. 
""Whether it's an inflated price or not, this should not be seen as an indication of the buoyant hotel market in the UK in a wider context, primarily because the Ritz is almost a 'one-off.'""
He said the hotel would attract significant attention worldwide, with a pool of 10 or so ultra-high net worth individuals likely to consider a bid.
The London Ritz is not connected to its Paris namesake. Both were founded by the same man, but are now under entirely separate ownership. The Paris Ritz was where Princess Diana dined just before her fatal car crash in 1997.
Two years after her death, her widower Prince Charles made his first public appearance with his new partner, Camilla Parker Bowles, at a party at the London Ritz. The couple later married.
The potential sale of the London hotel was first reported by the Times newspaper. 

A representative of the Barclay brothers declined to comment.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Coffee trees all over Brazil's top producing state Minas Gerais have bloomed this week, marking the first major flowering for the new Brazilian coffee crop that could indicate the size of next year's production.
Farmers and analysts shared pictures and videos of their crops, with trees full of flowers or flower buds. Agronomists say a good flowering, ample and uniform, followed by adequate moisture and mild temperatures, could lead to good production.
""In general, flowering was good, but we are anxious about the next rains and praying for temperatures to stay bland,"" said Mariana Caetano, chief operating officer at Guima Cafés, a coffee producer controlled by Brazilian bank BMG, with 900 hectares in the Cerrado region in Minas Gerais.
She said rains had been scarce all around, below historical levels, and that the company had kept trees healthy using dripping irrigation. Reservoirs were running low, however, and Caetano was unsure whether irrigation levels could be maintained if rains faltered.
Paulo Piancastelli, who manages 210 hectares of coffee fields in the Triangulo Mineiro region, said the flowering was positive.
""We farmers end up sharing the best pictures we take, in places where there are more flowers, which are pretty. That way, we put some more pressure on prices,"" he joked.
In fact, arabica coffee prices fell this week in New York, with traders commenting about the flowering, which could lead to a large crop next year in the world's largest producer if weather conditions were adequate.
Haroldo Bonfá, a coffee expert at Pharos Consultancy in Sao Paulo, said the pretty photos and videos shared on social media could be misleading.
""Not all fields are the same. It was not a uniform occurrence,"" he said, indicating many areas were not in good shape due to dryer-than-normal weather and lower crop care.
He said it was hard to assess how much of the flowering would turn into fruit to boost the 2020 crop. ""We will probably have to wait until the end of October, early November to estimate numbers.""
Rains are expected in coming days, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon's Agriculture Weather Dashboard, with up to 90 millimeters (3.54 inches) in the southern part of Minas Gerais."

The company said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of C$14.5 million ($10.89 million) to C$16.5 million, compared with the about C$26 million it estimated in June.

Hexo, which is double testing vape products amid increased regulatory scrutiny on the devices, also said jurisdictional decisions to limit the availability and types of cannabis-based products added to the uncertainties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late last month that an investigation into 805 confirmed or probable cases of vaping-related respiratory illnesses suggested that products containing THC, the psychoactive element in cannabis, likely played a role.

Uncertainty remains as investors received mixed signals about what, if any, progress has been made between the two largest economies in the world. 

Sentiment dampened earlier after the South China Morning Post reported that no progress has been made in deputy-level trade talks that occurred before high-level ones on Thursday, which it said will last only one day instead of the two days originally scheduled. 
 
 
They then ticked up again as President Donald Trump chimed in on Twitter.

Bloomberg had previously reported that the U.S. was considering a currency pact with China. Meanwhile China has also urged the U.S. to stop putting pressure on Chinese companies, following a White House decision to blacklist eight further tech companies in China this week.

Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) fell 4.4%, as its third-quarter revenue came in below forecasts. Pacific Gas & Electric tumbled 30.8% after a judge ruled that a rival bankruptcy plan from Elliott Management and other bondholders should be considered instead of its chapter 11 plan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States' and China's top trade negotiators met on Thursday for the first time since late July to try to find a way out of a 15-month trade war as new irritants between the world's two largest economies threatened hopes for progress.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer greeted Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on the steps of the USTR office before a meeting in which they will seek to narrow differences enough to avoid a scheduled Oct. 15 tariff rate increase on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.
But the atmosphere surrounding the talks was soured by the U.S. Commerce Department's decision on Monday to blacklist 28 Chinese public security bureaus, technology and surveillance firms, citing human rights violations of Muslim minority groups in China's Xinjiang province. A day later, the U.S. State Department imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials related to the Xinjiang issue.
If negotiations break down again, by Dec. 15, nearly all Chinese goods imports into the United States -- more than $500 billion -- could be subject to punitive tariffs in the dispute that erupted during U.S. President Donald Trump's time in office.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in Sydney on Thursday that the tariffs were working, forcing Beijing to pay attention to U.S. concerns about its trade practices.
""We do not love tariffs - in fact we would prefer not to use them - but after years of discussions and no action, tariffs are finally forcing China to pay attention to our concerns,"" Ross said in remarks prepared for delivery on an official visit to Australia.
Although some media reports suggested both sides are considering an ""interim"" deal that would suspend planned further U.S. tariffs in exchange for additional purchases of American farm products, Trump has repeatedly dismissed this idea, insisting that he wants a ""big deal"" with Beijing that addresses core intellectual property issues. 
Speaking to reporters in Washington on Wednesday, Trump said: ""If we can make a deal, we're going to make a deal, there's a really good chance.""
""In my opinion China wants to make a deal more than I do,"" Trump added.
The two sides have been at loggerheads over U.S. demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase U.S. companies' access to largely closed Chinese markets.
LOWERED EXPECTATIONS
But Chinese officials, surprised and upset by the U.S. blacklisting of Chinese companies, including video surveillance gear maker Hikvision, along with the suspension of U.S. visas for some Chinese officials, told Reuters that Beijing had lowered expectations for significant progress from the talks.
""I've never seen China respond with concessions to someone throwing down the gauntlet in this manner,"" said Scott Kennedy, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""It suggests to me that the U.S. may have determined that progress was impossible so everyone is just going through the motions.""
Other flashpoints that have cropped up in recent days include China's swift action to cut corporate ties to the National Basketball Association over a team official's tweet in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.
But in a possible easing of tensions, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration will soon issue licenses allowing some U.S. companies to sell non-sensitive goods to China's top telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies.

The report cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. A Commerce Department spokesman said the agency has been given no such direction. Huawei since May has been on the same trade blacklist affecting Hikvision because the United States says the company can spy on customers - an allegation Huawei denies.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland raised 2 billion euros on Thursday from the sale of green bonds at a yield well below a debut sale a year ago, highlighting the growing popularity of the bonds which provide cash for projects with environmental benefits.
Dublin mandated a syndicate of banks to tap its solitary green bond that matures in 2031, having raised 3 billion euros ($3.31 billion) from its initial sale a year ago.
Ireland sold the then debut 12-year green bond at a yield of 1.4% but with bond yields tumbling further in the last 12 months, Thursday's sale was priced at 26 basis points through mid-swaps, a spokesman for the country's debt office said.
That implies a yield just under 0.24%. Ireland received 11 billion euros worth of orders, the spokesman said, a similar level of demand from a year ago.
Although green bonds make up a fraction of the overall market, global interest has soared as banks, sovereigns and companies look to tap into increasing investor appetite as calls grow for tougher and swifter steps against climate change.
Led by issuance in France and the Netherlands, a total of 8 billion euros in sovereign green bonds were issued in the second quarter, the greatest quarterly change to date, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe said last month.
Ireland has now raised 14.25 billion euros of its 14 billion to 18 billion euro bond sales target for the year, with one more regular auction scheduled to take place next month.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 09:19AM ET</span>",Congo Republic president's adviser awarded oil licenses at heart of Eni probe,"By Joe Bavier, Emilio Parodi and Stephen Jewkes
JOHANNESBURG/MILAN (Reuters) - A Congolese presidential advisor played a key role in awarding oil licenses now at the heart of a corruption probe by Italian authorities that has engulfed energy giant Eni SpA and the family of its chief executive.
The advisor, Denis Gokana, headed a committee that awarded licenses to Italy’s Eni and a Congolese partner company he founded, according to government records and confirmed by Gokana via email.
The Congolese president appointed Gokana in 2013 to head a committee responsible for boosting the role of the country’s private sector in the economy, a role that was disclosed at the time in the official government gazette, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.
This is the first time the role played by a key Congolese official in events at the center of the Italian corruption probe has been publicly revealed. Gokana, who is special natural resources advisor to Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso, denied any wrongdoing.
State-controlled Eni, one of the world’s largest oil companies, disclosed last year that it was under investigation by Milan prosecutors for corruption in Congo Republic.  Reuters reported on Sept. 28 that Italian prosecutors were investigating the wife of Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi as part of its corruption probe. 
The inquiry revolves around agreements signed between 2013 and 2015 by Eni’s Congolese subsidiary with local partners and seeks to determine whether certain contracts hid a form of bribe.
Eni denies any wrongdoing and said it had no say in the awarding of the licenses or the government’s choice of its local partner - Africa Oil & Gas Corporation (AOGC), the company founded by Gokana. A lawyer for Descalzi’s wife, Marie Magdalena Ingoba, said his client had no comment.
The Congo investigation comes as Eni faces allegations alongside Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) that it paid more than $1 billion in bribes to gain control over a Nigerian oil field. Italian authorities have charged Eni, Shell and 13 individuals, including Descalzi, with violating Italy’s international corruption law in an ongoing case in Milan.
Shell, Eni, Descalzi and the other individuals have denied any wrongdoing in the Nigeria case. The company has said it is confident the allegations leveled at it by prosecutors would be found groundless.
In the Congo matter, the fresh detail about the role of the president’s advisor raises questions about Eni’s due diligence into its local partner, said Natasha White, a London-based researcher at anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness. The non-governmental organization identified the role Gokana played in the reallocation of the licenses and shared the findings with Reuters.
A former Eni director told prosecutors that while at the company, he raised concerns to CEO Descalzi about ties between Eni’s Congolese partner company and the president’s advisor, and that the CEO dismissed them, according to a 2015 deposition reviewed by Reuters.
Descalzi “disputed the basis of my remarks and told me my behavior was paralyzing Eni's commercial activities in the petroleum sector,"" former board member Luigi Zingales, a finance professor, told prosecutors.
Descalzi, who has led Eni since 2014, is not a target of the corruption probe related to the company’s Congolese operations, according to Eni and a person familiar with the investigation.
Eni, Africa's biggest foreign oil and gas producer, declined to comment on Zingales’ statements to prosecutors but said it didn’t believe he was in a position to properly assess its governance. 
The company said an audit conducted with the help of external lawyers and consultants found no evidence of corruption in relation to operations in Congo. Eni said its due diligence did identify that its local partner company had been founded by presidential advisor Gokana but concluded that he no longer held an ownership stake or served as a manager.
Asked whether the company was aware that Gokana headed the committee that awarded the licenses, Eni said: “Eni has no evidence of knowledge of any specific of alleged activity rendered by Mr. Gokana for the benefit of Eni in the award processes.”
A Congolese government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment addressed to the president and the government.
FAMILY TIES
Congo Republic, sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest oil producer by volume, is one of Eni’s key African operations. One area of focus for Italian prosecutors is whether Eni gave away a portion of its rights to extract oil in Congo Republic to companies linked to public officials in order to secure the reissue of oil exploration licenses in violation of Italy’s international corruption laws, according to search warrants reviewed by Reuters.
""Eni SpA has 'gifted' to companies reporting to Congolese politicians participation shares in oil exploitation licenses,"" prosecutors asserted in a search warrant issued last year. The warrant identified Gokana as among several public officials with links to AOGC.
When the government in 2013 reallocated four oil extraction licenses, which Eni had previously held, the committee chose AOGC to partner with Eni, according to Gokana and Eni. Those four licenses produced oil worth about $400 million in 2014, according to a Reuters calculation based on pricing data from UK energy analysts S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Platts.
Eni told Reuters that its share of the four licenses generated $127 million of gross revenues in 2014, which amounted to $72 million of free cash flow, or less than 1% of Eni’s overall free cash flow.
Gokana, in written responses to Reuters, said that the company he founded was the only local entity with the necessary technical and financial capacity to partner with Eni. He said he had been sole shareholder of AOGC but had divested his entire stake after he was appointed head of Congo’s state oil company in January 2005.
Italian prosecutors allege he has retained “very strong links” to AOGC, according to a March 2018 search warrant. The four licenses are among a number of permit allocations involving Eni that Italian authorities are investigating, according to the warrant.
Gokana confirmed to Reuters that his cousin had been chairman of the local partner. The cousin, Dieudonne Bantsimba, was listed as AOGC’s chairman on the company’s website as recently as January of this year. 
Reached by telephone, Bantsimba said he no longer held the role. He declined to say when he stepped down or answer further questions.
Eni said that its investigations in Congo ""could not (and did not) identify the alleged presence of family ties between Gokana and Bantsimba."" It added “that AOGC had certified to Eni the absence of family ties between any company beneficiaries and public officials.”
AOGC didn’t respond to a request for comment.
“A SORT OF ‘RETROCESSION’”
Another part of the Italian prosecutors’ corruption probe focuses on what they describe in search warrants as “a sort of ‘retrocession,’” or a form of kickback, involving six individuals, including the wife of Eni CEO Descalzi.
Specifically, prosecutors are investigating whether the individuals benefited from a deal in which AOGC obtained a stake in a potentially promising offshore oil exploration zone and then transferred it to a British-registered oil exploration company named World Natural Resources Ltd.
In a Sept. 26 prosecution document related to Ingoba, prosecutors allege WNR’s then-director Alexander Haly was a business partner of Descalzi's wife.
Haly is chief executive of Monaco-based supply-ship operator Petro Services, part of Amsterdam-based Petroserve Holding BV, according to the company’s web site. Petro Services’ Congo subsidiary won more than $100 million worth of contracts with Eni from 2012 to 2017, according to a 2018 search warrant.
Prosecutors, in the September document, allege Petro Services was controlled by Descalzi’s wife via a series of shell companies located in Holland, Luxembourg and Cyprus.
In its response to Reuters, Eni said contracts won by Petro Services “took place within a competitive framework” and ""no Eni director or employee has ever told the company about having an interest in World Natural Resources.""
A spokeswoman for Haly and Petro Services declined to comment. According to British company registration filings, Haly resigned as a WNR director in 2014.
WNR didn’t respond to a request for comment.
'SIMPLY DISCLOSED’
Italian authorities are also investigating the CEO and his wife in relation to a separate probe into alleged failure to disclose a conflict of interest connected to Eni’s dealings in Congo.  
No charges have been made in either the corruption or the disclosure probe related to Eni’s Congolese operations.
Descalzi, whose term as CEO is up for renewal by shareholders next spring, denied wrongdoing in a written response to Reuters. “Had I known about any such potential situation, I would have simply disclosed,” he said.

Descalzi also referred Reuters to a statement issued by Eni last month in which he said in part: “I am totally certain that I have always behaved lawfully.”

The board is planning to meet with its advisers on the initial public offering around Oct. 17, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. The oil giant will gauge market conditions and assess feedback from a roadshow for potential cornerstone investors that ends this week before giving the final go ahead, the people said.
Aramco is speeding up preparations for the IPO with an aim of listing on the Saudi bourse as soon as November, Bloomberg News has reported. People involved in the deal say about 2% of Aramco may be sold, which could raise $40 billion. The firm is targeting a valuation of at least $2 trillion -- more than double that of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The sale is key to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s strategy to fund the diversification of the OPEC nation’s economy.
Upcoming key dates:
Note: Dates subject to change and according to people familiar with the matterInvestment banks’ research teams are in the midst of preparing pre-IPO reports on Aramco, according to an internal schedule seen by Bloomberg. Analysts had barely three weeks to get them done, compared with six-to-eight weeks they normally get for some of the biggest global listings.
Each bank’s team needed to finish a first draft of their analysis by Oct. 9, with second drafts due Oct. 15. The reports need to be finalized and printed by Oct. 18, so they can be ready to be distributed to fund managers once Aramco announces its intention to float on Oct. 20, the schedule shows.
While Aramco is likely to move ahead with the listing, no final decision has been made and the Saudis could still decide to delay or cancel the IPO, the people said. Aramco officials didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment."

RAM had planned to receive the two 737 MAX aircraft in June, the source said, adding that two other 737 Max planes in its fleet had been grounded pending the findings of an investigation into the Ethiopian crash in March.
Boeing did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
The U.S. planemaker's top-selling jet was grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people within five months.
Saudi Arabian airline flyadeal canceled a $5.9 billion provisional 737 MAX order after the Ethiopian crash and Emirati carrier flydubai has said it could replace MAX aircraft it has ordered with Airbus jets.
Separately, the source said that RAM is not concerned about its fleet of 737 NG planes after inspections that have taken place elsewhere in the world, saying the checks routinely take place on older jets or after a set number of flights.
RAM operates 36 of the 737 NG planes and only one has required such an inspection and no problems were found.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and Brazil’s Gol Linhas Aereas have grounded a total of 13  Boeing Co  737 NG airplanes after U.S. regulators ordered urgent inspections last week.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt plans to sell minority stakes in two companies by year-end, ramping up its long-delayed privatization program though analysts doubt it is moving quickly enough to convince investors it is serious about opening up the economy.
The state still controls vast swathes of Egypt’s economy, including three of its largest banks along with much of its oil industry and real estate sector.
The government plans to sell extra shares in two state firms already trading on the Egyptian bourse, Abu Qir Fertilisers and Chemicals Industries (CA:ABUK) and Alexandria Container and Cargo Handling Co. (CA:ALCN), while retaining overall control, sources familiar with the planned transactions told Reuters.
It has been talking for years about privatizing these and other companies, but has repeatedly postponed the sales.
The central bank also said last week it had selected two banks to advise on the sale of its 99.9% stake in United Bank, a deal it said several years ago would occur by end-2016.
Economists say if these and other sales do go through it would be a sign that Egypt, after enacting painful macroeconomic reforms backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is serious about opening up the economy.
""The government has managed to restore macro stability, it has reined in the budget deficit, monetary policy has improved, the pound has been devalued and inflation is now coming under control,"" said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
But he said Egypt had so far shied away from privatizations and other structural reforms that could keep growth at the 6% economists say is needed to absorb hundreds of thousands of new workers entering the market each year.
""The fact that they're continuously being delayed suggests that there is significant resistance from within the regime towards the government ceding control,"" Tuvey said.
Egypt hopes the sales will bring in revenue, encourage investment and help its bourse, whose market capitalization of $40 billion is less than a tenth of the Saudi bourse and smaller than even Casablanca's in Morocco.
DOING BUSINESS
Boosting investment has taken on extra urgency since small protests broke out last month over economic grievances.
""The government's macroeconomic policy, under the IMF ($12 billion) loan, has been widely lauded by investors. But its microeconomic, structural reforms, such as improving the ease of doing business... matter too,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer.
Charlie Robertson, Renaissance Capital's global chief economist, said privatizations were ""tremendously helpful"" to provide more variety on the bourse.
The government announced a list of 23 companies in March 2018 for partial sale that year and in early 2019, but the 2018 emerging market crisis derailed the plan.
The risk of a global downturn may deter officials, who fear being accused of selling state assets at below their true value, an accusation prosecutors leveled at officials close to Hosni Mubaral after the 2011 uprising, an Egyptian economist said.
Other impediments include bureaucratic obstacles, economists said.
""There might be some people not happy with the share sales and putting up hurdles, including the legalities,"" said one Egyptian asset manager, asking not to be named.
So far the only sale in over a decade was of a 4.5% stake in tobacco monopoly Eastern Company (CA:EAST), which went for 1.7 billion Egyptian pounds ($100 million) in March.
Investment bankers working on Alexandria Container have taken the proposed sale to select investors outside Egypt for market testing, but since then there has been no update, a source familiar with the transaction said.
""The exact timing will be determined by several factors. We're still waiting for more clarity,"" he said.
Public Enterprise Minister Hisham Tawfik put the delays down to ""purely legal"" issues, including the death of one of the judges working on the case.
""The investment banks who are managing the two next offerings are ready and have done their road shows and are ready for the offerings as soon as this problem is over,"" Tawfik told CNBC Arabia television on Sunday.
Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said it was crucial to take the sales to investors at the right time.
""We will not go to the market unless we are sure this is a good decision, we will get a good outcome, with results. Otherwise, we will have to wait. We are not in a hurry,"" he told Reuters last month.

Klein will take over, effective immediately, from interim chairman John Bell, who will continue as a director on the board. 
In July, Canopy fired its co-founder, co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Bruce Linton after Constellation expressed disappointment over the company's financial performance.
Bell was appointed as the interim chairman after Linton's ouster.
Klein has served as a director on Canopy Growth's board since 2018.
Constellation Brands has invested over $4 billion in Canopy, making it one of the first major alcohol producers looking to cash in on the proposed legalization of recreational weed in several countries.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fixed income trading platform Tradeweb Markets (O:TW) on Thursday reported record volumes in the third quarter as market volatility driven by the U.S.-China trade war and global rate cuts bolstered activity during the normally sluggish summer months.
Average daily volume across all asset classes was $815 billion in the last quarter, a 53.3% increase from the same period a year ago. The gains were partly driven by its interest rates business, which was up 64.5% year over year.
Tradeweb is majority owned by Refinitiv. Thomson Reuters, the parent of Reuters News, holds a stake in Refinitiv.
The other main fixed-income-only trading platform, MarketAxess (O:MKTX), earlier this month reported average daily trading volume of $824.7 billion for the third quarter and $875.5 billion for September, up 35% and 22.43% from the same period in 2018 respectively.
Trading desks are typically quieter in July and August as market participants go on holiday. But this year the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 in July, then again in September; the U.S.-China trade war persisted and began to weaken U.S. economic data; and political stability was threatened from Hong Kong to Britain to Iran.
While trading volumes have been generally elevated this year, the surge in the third quarter has been notable, said Kevin McPartland, managing director, market structure and technology, at Greenwich Associates.
""Volatility is effectively driving volume, which is driving volatility,"" he said.
While other exchanges did not report overall monthly or quarterly records, volumes still rose dramatically from prior years. CME Group (O:CME) averaged 20.2 million contracts in all asset classes per day in Q3, up 30% from a year ago. Intercontinental Exchange (N:ICE) reported a 12% year-on-year rise in average daily volume.
Top-line growth at companies like Tradeweb has surged as fixed-income trading has begun to move online, a transition equities traders made in the 1990s. Capitalizing in part on this shift, Tradeweb went public in April of this year and its share price has since risen 16%.
Tradeweb and MarketAxess have benefited from both the overall rise in market trading volumes and the increased proportion that is being conducted electronically.
""As recently as five years ago, when markets got volatile, the buy side's inclination when executing a trade was to move away from the screen and pick up the phone. That approach has shown signs of reversing,"" said McPartland."

MUNICH (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) aims to double sales of large luxury cars next year from 2018 levels to help revive profit margins hit by investments in new technologies, Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter said on Thursday.
BMW hopes to sell around 135,000 premium models such as the i8, 8-series, X7 and 7-series in 2020, up from around 65,000 in 2018, Peter told reporters in Munich.
""We want to grow in the coming years and we are convinced the premium segment will outperform the overall market - and that we will outperform the market,"" he said.
Luxury models deliver higher than average profit margins, and will help BMW to return to an operating margin of between 8% and 10% in its automotive division, Peter said.
The costs of developing smaller cars, including an electric Mini, have eaten into profitability at the German automaker.
In March, BMW warned it expected group pretax profit to fall by more than 10% this year and announced a 12 billion euros ($13 billion) savings and efficiency plan to help offset higher technology investments.
BMW has no plans for forced redundancies in 2019 or 2020 among its German full time employees, the carmaker said. The company will, however, seek cost cuts through early retirements and reducing employees' annual bonuses.
""The annual payment needs to be recalibrated to a sensible level. It has already been adjusted for the management board,"" Peter said, adding the level depended on the outcome of negotiations with worker representatives.
To lower development costs for electric and driverless cars, BMW will pursue alliances, such as a plan to make a low-cost electric car with Chinese partner Great Wall (SS:601633).
""It is easier to build a large electrified vehicle profitably than a small one,"" Peter said, adding the project with Great Wall remained on track.
BMW wants to remain in the city car segment with its Mini brand, even though smaller vehicles tend to deliver a lower margin and customers are buying ever-larger vehicles.
""Mini is a strategic part of BMW,"" Peter said, adding smaller vehicles were gaining in relevance among urban customers seeking to downsize.
BMW reiterated it would close its Oxford, southern England, plant - where it builds the Mini - on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 to prepare for potential disruption to trade should Britain leave the European Union without a withdrawal agreement.
""We are prepared for various scenarios,"" Peter said, adding that specific vehicle parts had been stockpiled to enable a resumption of production once it became clear whether vehicles would be subject to a 10% tariff after Brexit.
""We will pass on part of the cost of these tariffs to customers,"" Peter said, adding Mini prices would be raised.
BMW will gauge the impact of price increases before taking further steps, such as considering a shift in production of vehicles or components to plants outside the United Kingdom.
""It is too early to discuss such steps. We will have to see how demand develops first,"" Peter said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has rejected calls from lawmakers to give regulators more powers to protect consumers from unregulated investment products as thousands face losing money on ""mini-bonds"" bought from London Capital & Finance (LCF), which collapsed in January.
The government said it would, however, fast-track conclusions from its review of collapse of LCF that left 11,500 bondholders likely to lose most of their 237 million pounds in investments.
Parliament's Treasury Select Committee (TSC) said in August that the failure of LCF showed the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) needed powers to formally recommend extending its remit to cover unregulated parts of the financial system.
The FCA can only comment on activity around the so-called regulatory perimeter.
""Decisions on which activities should be within the perimeter of regulation should ultimately be for ministers, with approval by parliament,"" the government said in a response to the TSC on Thursday.
It also rejected calls to give the FCA powers to ask companies it does not regulate for data on their activities. LCF itself was regulated, but the mini-bonds it sold to raise funds for companies, were not.
""Asking the FCA to gather and process data from unauthorized firms would add significantly to the FCA's supervisory responsibilities and have considerable resource implications,"" the government said.
It said it was working with the FCA to consider if further steps were needed to ensure that consumers understand the risks of buying unregulated products as part of its response to LCF.
""The conclusions of the government's work in response to the failure of London Capital & Finance, including on the financial promotions regime, will be brought forward as soon as possible,"" the government said."

The rejection is a further hiccup for the German lender, which has reshuffled management, is cutting thousands of jobs and closing down some businesses in an effort to make a profit.
 Deutsche Bank  chair Paul Achleitner had announced in August the appointment of former UBS (S:UBSG) manager Juerg Zeltner, praising him as a valuable addition and ""a top-level European banker with proven expertise"".
Zeltner was also to represent the interests of Qatar's royal family - a top shareholder in the German lender. KBL is controlled by the same family.
Deutsche's regulators - the European Central Bank and financial markets watchdog BaFin - have now determined that Zeltner's position on Deutsche's board would be a conflict of interest because he is also the chief executive officer of KBL European Private Bankers (KBL epb), a business that overlaps with Deutsche's.
""It's a done deal. It is now only a matter of finding a face-saving way out,"" the person said.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
The bank said last month in a statement that all potential conflicts of interest that could arise from Zeltner's activities and his relationship with one of Deutsche's major shareholders had been reported to the supervisory board and the company.
""They were reviewed by the Nomination Committee and considered to be low,"" Deutsche said at the time.
Achleitner chairs the committee that recommends new board members who represent shareholders.
The ECB, BaFin, KBL and a spokesman for Zeltner declined to comment."

The bankrupt utility said late Wednesday that it had begun a second round of power cuts that will plunge another 234,000 customers in cities including Berkeley and Oakland into darkness. It’s part of the biggest blackout ever orchestrated to prevent strong winds from knocking down electrical lines and igniting fires. Half a million homes and businesses in Northern California were already in the dark, cut off by PG&E overnight.
Meanwhile in Southern (NYSE:SO) California, Edison International (NYSE:EIX) was cutting power to dozens of customers and has warned of more, while San Diego’s main utility is also considering shutoffs. Altogether, more than 3 million people may eventually be affected, or almost 8% of the state’s population, based on city estimates and the average household size. The economic impact may reach $2.6 billion.
After being forced into bankruptcy from wildfires its equipment caused over the past two years, PG&E is using the massive power cuts in an attempt to prevent another deadly disaster. While San Francisco and Silicon Valley will be spared, the extensive reach of the outages threatens to roil the area’s economy by disrupting workers, shutting stores and forcing companies and agencies to shell out for costly back-up generators to keep operations limping along.
Restoring Power
Determining just how deep the impact will be is difficult. PG&E had already restored power to some 50,000 customers in the Sierra Nevada foothills as of late Wednesday and were looking to return service to 80,000 by Thursday morning, the company said in its statement, released around 11 p.m. local time Wednesday. But outages could persist into next week as the utility sends crews to inspect all of its lines. Santa Clara County warned a shutoff could last seven days.
Parts of Northern California’s East and South Bays were set to lose power later in the evening under the second phase. After that, PG&E will weigh a third round of cuts for portions of Kern County, which may affect about 4,000 customers. The utility earlier predicted impact to 43,000.
A prolonged blackout will strain the region’s economy, said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University. Blackouts lasting hours or a single day close offices and schools, and prompt runs on grocery stores. At five days, cupboards start running bare, diesel for backup generators start selling out and gasoline runs short as stations won’t have power.
“If you lose power for five hours, you may have to throw out some milk,” Wara said. “If you lose power for five days, you need to throw anything that’s perishable away, and you are likely eating out of a can.”
Wara estimated PG&E’s blackout could cost $2.6 billion if it lasts two days, using a planning tool developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Two of the researchers who developed that tool, however, cautioned that it’s designed to calculate the impact of much shorter blackouts -- less than 24 hours.
Running on Generators
In areas where electricity was already out early Wednesday, many stores and businesses sat closed, while others worked off back-up power.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) shuttered some branches. A few dozen Safeway supermarkets were affected as of midday, and the company was providing backup generators and refrigerated trailers upon availability.
Cities also turned to generators to power some facilities on Wednesday and simply closed others. Santa Rosa used generators to keep tap water flowing to residents and the lights on in fire stations. It shut down City Hall, according to its website. Public buses were running but not collecting fares -- its own expense.
For wineries, the blackout hit at a crucial time: harvest. Michael Haney, executive director of Sonoma County Vintners, said many wineries have either bought or rented backup generators. Some smaller growers have struck agreements to have their grapes stored at other facilities where there’s power.
“Wineries have had to pay out money for backup power,” he said. “The sad thing is some of our smaller wineries can’t afford it.”
Elsewhere in Sonoma County, the Russian River Brewing Company rented a 2-megawatt generator to power its brewery. The company -- famed for its Pliny the Younger cult beer -- wanted something smaller, but wineries had already snapped up most, said co-owner Natalie Cilurzo. It’s instead paying about $27,000 to rent its backup unit for a month, and fueling it with diesel probably costs between $8,000 and $10,000 every day it runs, Cilurzo said.
Readying Workers
In San Francisco, companies prepared for the impact to employees, even while offices went unaffected.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). told employees whose commutes were affected by the outages that they could work from home. Down in Silicon Valley, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. similarly encouraged telecommuting.
The region’s main commuter rail system -- Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART -- expected no disruption, in part because the service had already deployed generators, some from PG&E, to vulnerable spots. PG&E also supplied four generators to a keep a heavily traveled freeway tunnel open beneath the East Bay hills, a major artery to San Francisco.
The widespread impact angered Californians -- and some elected officials. State Senator Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, called the outage “a completely unacceptable state of affairs.” Governor Gavin Newsom was more measured, saying the blackout was “appropriate under the circumstances,” but added: “No one is happy about it.”"

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firms raised $191 billion in the first nine months of 2019, nearly as much as in all of 2018, as investors flocked to well-known managers raising large capital pools, according to a report by research firm Pitchbook.
Some of the private equity industry's biggest players completed their fundraising in the third quarter of this year, including Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) with a $26 billion buyout fund, and Vista Equity Partners Management LLC with a $16 billion fund.
This increased the amount raised by private equity funds by 38% year-on-year, even as the number of funds that raised capital fell 18% to 131, according to the report released on Thursday.
The strong fundraising showed investors believe concerns about an economic downturn fueled by a trade war between the United States and China will help create bargains that will allow private equity firms to put money to work, Pitchbook said in the report.
The results also showed that investors are being more selective in the managers they allocate capital to in a more precarious environment.
""While a recession would hurt the value of current portfolio companies, it would also create buying opportunities for funds with sufficient cash reserves,"" Pitchbook analysts said.
U.S. private equity firms embarked on dealmaking this year at a feverish clip. In the first nine months, 3,883 deals valued at $501.2 billion were completed, according to Pitchbook, maintaining the high level of dealmaking recorded in 2018.
However, U.S. private equity firms sold fewer companies from their portfolios, as potential acquirers balked amid the market jitters. Buyout firms exited 726 companies valued at $220 billion, down 19.5% year-on-year.
""Trade war tensions, as well as domestic and international economic disputes, may explain the overall slump in exit activity that we have seen through the third quarter,"" Pitchbook said."

(N:JPM) has set up a trust company in Singapore, its first in Asia, to cater for a growing cadre of ultra-wealthy individuals in the region.
The move by the U.S. banking giant, which already has a Delaware trust company for U.S.-based clients and one in the Bahamas, comes amid a boom in family offices, or private investment vehicles, in Hong Kong and Singapore.
""Many of our Asian clients will likely migrate their trusts from the Bahamas to Asia,"" Kam Shing Kwang, CEO at JPMorgan's private bank in Asia, told a news conference on Thursday.
Several of JPMorgan's European clients were also keen to book their trusts in Singapore, she added.
The Asia Pacific region had 814 billionaires at end-2017, accounting for 38% of the global billionaire population, with China minting two new billionaires every week, a report by UBS (S:UBSG) and PwC found last year.
""We will be in a better position to support clients who have complex wealth planning needs and serve a wider range of clients in one of the fastest, wealth-generating hubs in the world,"" said Kwang.
Demand for trust companies is on the rise in Singapore, one of the world's leading financial and legal centers, as newly wealthy families in Asia seek legal structures to park their assets and begin succession planning.
JPMorgan has set up its Singapore trust company, which had been in the works for some time, some three years after the private bank established its Asian booking center there.
""It's a lot easier for us to find the right type of trust officers and people who understand the business in Singapore,"" said Kwang.
Singapore is home to a number of trusts set up by private banks and corporates, among others, supported by an advanced legal framework."

Danske Bank has been rocked by its involvement in a major money laundering scandal. It said last year it had channeled 200 billion euros ($220 billion) of payments through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank said were suspicious.
The bank said in February it would spend up to 2 billion Danish crowns ($295 million) to step up anti-money laundering efforts, such as improving IT systems and hiring compliance staff.
""The hiring freeze comes after we've seen higher compliance costs and costs related to our anti-money laundering efforts,"" a spokesman said.
""This is part of our ongoing focus on costs, as we, like all other banks, are challenged by low interest rates and low margins,"" he said.

The hiring freeze would not include critical positions such as regulatory jobs, the spokesman said. He did not say how much it would save on the hiring freeze or how long it would be in place.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were pulled from several  Nike  (N:NKE) stores in major Chinese cities amid the furor surrounding a tweet from the team's general manager in support of anti-government protests in Hong Kong. 
Managers at five Nike stores in Beijing and Shanghai told Reuters during visits on Thursday they had been told in recent days via a memo from management that all Rockets merchandise had to be removed. Reuters was unable to view the memo. 
Although Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has since apologized for his tweet last week, National Basketball Association (NBA) Commissioner Adam Silver further angered authorities when he said the league backed Morey's right to exercise his freedom of expression. 
Despite the controversy, the NBA was pressing ahead with an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai on Thursday night. Promotional events earlier in the week had been canceled.
The stakes are high for NBA, whose league business in China is said to be worth more than $4 billion. The world's most populous nation is Nike's top source of revenue growth as other regions slow.
Three Nike stores in Shenzhen also kept Rockets merchandise off the shelves, as well as NBA products in general, staff told Reuters by phone. Three Nike stores in Chengdu, a bustling inland city in southwest China, also removed Rockets products. 
Nike and its China office did not respond to multiple Reuters requests for comment. 
A specialist NBA store at Super Brand Mall, a major shopping center in the Shanghai financial district of Lujiazui, has also removed all Rockets-related merchandise.
""Other stuff, there hasn't been any impact, and no one has said we need to withdraw it,"" said a store manager, laughing. ""If they say that all NBA stuff has to be withdrawn then our store will go bankrupt."" 
At two basketball-themed NBA Playzone family entertainment centers in Shanghai and Beijing opened by NBA China, staff confirmed that Rockets products had been removed.
""Rockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red. Now, it is mostly yellow and blue,"" the colors of the Golden State Warriors, said a manager at the Shanghai Playzone, who like the NBA store employee declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.
NBA China did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about the entertainment centers. 
WIDER BACKLASH
Major Chinese e-commerce platforms  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and JD.com (O:JD) have taken Houston Rockets merchandise off their sales platforms, including mobile apps.
Searches for sneakers with the NBA logo on Alibaba and JD.com also yielded no results. Those include collaboration sneakers marketed with brands such as Nike and Carlyle-backed (O:CG) Supreme.
A handful of individual online merchants still sell the sneakers. 
Alibaba, which declined to comment, told domestic media that Morey's comments had seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, and that there was no room for negotiation. 
JD.com, which also did not comment, told local media that the firm deeply resented and strongly condemned Morey's remarks.
Two of the largest online resale marketplaces for sneakers in China have also removed all branded shoes connected to the NBA, according to four sneaker traders. 
Poizon and DoNew, two mobile shopping apps popular among fans of designer sneakers, have taken NBA shoes off their platforms, traders said.
A Reuters search on Poizon and DoNew's apps with the keyword ""NBA"" returned no results. 
Poizon did not respond to an emailed request for comment and phone calls to DoNew's office in Shanghai went unanswered. 
""As long as the bosses of Nike and Adidas don't come out and say something stupid and get banned by China's central government, I think sneaker resales in China will remain pretty profitable,"" said Zhu Junwen, a reseller in Guangzhou. 
Adidas (DE:ADSGn) is in the middle of a reported $200 million, 13-year endorsement contract with Houston Rockets star guard James Harden, who is the centrepiece of the apparel maker's basketball shoe lineup. 

""But if (Nike and Adidas get banned), that would be the end of it,"" Zhu said.

Investing.com -- Philips (AS:PHG) provided a stark illustration of what’s at stake as the U.S. and China prepare to resume talks on resolving their trade dispute Thursday.

The Dutch medical goods and services group said it would miss expectations for profits by a country mile in the third quarter and was forced to admit its three-year streak of big improvements in profit margins would end this year as a result.
The full results are due out on Oct. 28.
The company’s shares fell nearly 9% in reaction, their biggest drop in over a year, dragging the local AEX index down by 0.6%.
That’s on a day when Europe’s stock markets were choppy but essentially range-bound as they assessed pre-negotiation spin coming from the two trade teams via U.S. and Chinese media. The Stoxx 600 was down less than 0.1% at 380.24 by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), while the U.K. FTSE 100 was essentially unchanged and the German DAX was up 0.2%.

For each of the last three years, Philips has raised its favored profit margin measure by at least 1 percentage point (it's been rewarded by a near-doubling of its shares price since mid-2016). CEO Frans van Houten said this year’s improvement, by contrast, is going to be a meager 10-20 basis points instead (a basis point is one-hundredth of a percent). He promised to step up “mitigating actions” (read – ‘cost cuts’) to address the problem.
The shares were arguably ripe for a correction, having risen to a 19-year high this year. Even after the 9% drop, at 27 times trailing earnings, they still don’t look cheap, and a dividend yield of barely 2% is hardly enough to tempt income investors. 

Even so, with the structural overhaul that Philips has achieved in the space of three years, van Houten has accumulated a lot of capital with investors, and its businesses still look healthy if one looks through the short-term noise around the trade war. Van Houten noted that “growth momentum is still strong,” and a 6% rise in currency-adjusted sales would seem to back that up. Order intake was flat against an exceptionally strong year-earlier period.
In that context, Thursday’s drop could easily turn out to be a buying opportunity. The risk is that, if the trade talks in Washington break down, it could be just an invitation to catch a falling knife.
The same may well be said about a lot of stocks by the time the quarter’s earnings season is over."

Better terms for free movement of its professionals and greater access to Chinese market are also crucial for India to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the people said, asking not be identified as the matter is not public. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal will raise the demands at the meeting of trade ministers of the 16-member RCEP in Bangkok on Saturday.
A trade ministry spokeswoman didn’t immediately reply to questions about India’s stance when reached on her mobile phone, saying a statement will be issued Thursday.
India is under increasing pressure to decide whether it will be a part of the China-backed grouping that seeks to conclude negotiations by November. The RCEP, which aims to create the world’s largest trading bloc covering nearly half of the globe’s population, is being seen as a champion of free trade amid a climate of trade war.
India’s primary concern about the pact is the influx of cheap Chinese goods, which could further widen New Delhi’s about $55 billion trade deficit with Beijing last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wants addition of a clause that would enable an automatic increase in levies, in case the import of items exceeds a certain threshold.
The Modi-led administration is seeking to minimize the hit on domestic sector, especially in agriculture and certain infrastructure industries.
The government is seeking better terms for the movement of its skilled workers, a demand that’s run into opposition from countries including Singapore, the people said. It also wants stricter rules of origin to prevent misusing duty benefits.
Tensions between India and China have contributed to the delay in finalizing the talks, which have dragged on for seven years with India participating in more than 27 rounds of discussions with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and China."

The U.S. company said Thursday it’s now decided to remove HKmap.live from its App Store after consulting with local authorities, because it could endanger law enforcement and city residents. That marks a return to its original position, where it initially rejected the app. After an outcry, the iPhone maker allowed it to run for a few days before Thursday’s decision. The see-sawing is unusual for Apple, which exercises rigid control over its app store, the foundation of its global iPhone ecosystem.
Apple joins other foreign companies struggling to navigate the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong as protests that began in June show no sign of abating. The issue has become a red line for those doing business in China, most recently drawing the National Basketball Association into a firestorm over a tweet that’s caused partners to stop doing business with the league and state television to halt airing its games. A growing number of American giants, including Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI)., find themselves embroiled in controversies over the extent to which their actions are influenced by economic considerations in a vast Chinese market.
“Many concerned customers in Hong Kong have contacted us about this app and we immediately began investigating it,” Apple said in a statement. “The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.”
Apple’s reversal came after the Chinese Communist Party’s flagship newspaper criticized Apple for letting the software through. Protesters in the city used HKmap.live to monitor police whereabouts and it facilitated illegal activities, the People’s Daily said in a commentary late Tuesday. But the app’s developers rejected that view.
“We disagree with Apple’s claim that our app endangered anyone” in Hong Kong, the developer said in a statement.
Greater China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, is Apple’s largest market after its own home country. The iPhone maker is also one of the most visible symbols of corporate America in the world’s No. 2 economy. Apple recently pulled the Taiwan flag emoji from some iPhones, underscoring the difficult balance the company must strike in supporting free speech while appeasing China. Beijing has long been sensitive to how foreign companies portray an island it considers part of its territory."

GM delivered 689,531 vehicles in China in the third quarter this year, according to a company statement. The drop for the quarter ended September 30 marks the fifth straight quarterly sales decline for GM in China, the world's biggest auto market.
It delivered 2.26 million vehicles in the first nine months this year, according to Reuters calculation.
As GM and Ford Motor Co's (N:F) China sales extend declines, U.S. car companies' share of total China passenger vehicles sales fell to 9.5% in the first eight months of this year from 10.7% in the year-ago period, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).
Over the same period, German car makers' share has risen to 23.8% from 21.6% and Japanese auto makers' to 21.7% from 18.3%.
In China, GM has a joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104), in which the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac are made. It also has another venture, with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group, in which they make no-frills minivans and have started to make higher-end cars.
GM, the second biggest international automaker in China by sales, sold 3.64 million units in China last year, down from 4.04 units in 2017.
Sales of GM's affordable brand Baojun dropped 34.9% for the latest quarter, while sales of the mass-market Buick fell 20.6%. But luxury brand Cadillac's sales jumped 10.9%.
Annual industry car sales in China fell last year for the first time since the 1990s, and they are expected to fall this year too. Sales dropped 6.9% in August from the same month a year prior, CAAM said. 
An official at the association said last month that in the next three years the industry could see ""low or small negative growth"".

CAAM is set to announce September sales next week.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Global stocks recouped early losses as news reports raised hopes that the United States and China would settle some economic disputes, but investors were kept on edge by an earlier report that trade talks due to begin on Thursday could be cut short.
U.S. S&P500 mini futures (ESc1) traded down 0.1%, with a big part of early losses cut after the New York Times reported Washington will soon issue licenses allowing some U.S. firms to supply non-sensitive goods to China's Huawei Technologies.
Another report, from Bloomberg, that the White House is looking at rolling out a previously agreed currency pact with China, also raised hopes of a partial deal and helped to lift risk assets.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) gained 0.24% while Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 0.34%. Shanghai shares (SSEC) also rose 0.49%.
European stocks are on course to open higher, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) rising 0.17% in Asian trade.
Earlier U.S. stock futures slumped as much as 1.3%, as the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported the Chinese delegation, headed by Vice Premier Liu He, was planning to leave Washington after just a day of minister-level meetings, instead of as originally planned on Friday.
Top negotiators from the two countries were scheduled to meet in Washington on Thursday and Friday to try to end a bruising 15-month-old trade war.
Though there were some conflicting reports on whether Liu's plans have been changed, many market players remained cautious.
Without significant progress, U.S. President Donald Trump is set to hike the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% next Tuesday.
""Barring any surprise today, it looks like their talk is breaking down. The tariff will be hiked. The situation looks dire,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
China is unlikely to be willing to make an easy compromise with a U.S. president who seems increasingly vulnerable to domestic political pressure as opposition Democrats seek to impeach him, analysts also said.
U.S. Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden called for the impeachment of Trump for the first time in a deepening partisan fight over a congressional investigation of the Republican president.
""Mr. Trump's recent impeachment risk has turned the timetable against him, Chi Lo, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset in Hong Kong, wrote in a report to clients.
""While China is not eager to reach a trade deal, Mr. Trump is, however, under pressure to get at least a temporary deal done to help his re-election bid before his impeachment risk rises and the U.S. economy weakens further,"" Chi said.
In the currency market, the offshore yuan reversed early losses to gain 0.3% to trade at 7.1148 per dollar following the Bloomberg report about a U.S.-China currency pact.
""The yuan rose on expectations of a currency pact. If there will be such an agreement, the yuan could rise to 6.9 to the dollar. But the trouble is, no one knows what's in that pact that they had reportedly agreed in February,"" said Ei Kaku, currency strategist at Nomura Securities.
In the onshore trade, the renminbi gained 0.25% to 7.1130 .
The safe haven yen and Swiss franc gave up most of their early gains.
The yen last stood almost flat at 107.56 while the Swiss franc traded at 0.9946 franc per dollar , about 0.1% higher than late U.S. levels. The euro firmed slightly to $1.0986 (EUR=).
Sterling wobbled near one-month lows against the dollar and the euro as hopes of a break-through on a key sticking point for a Brexit deal were dashed.
Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, a coalition partner in the British government, said it would emphatically oppose a reported European Union concession on the Irish backstop under any Brexit deal.
The pound last stood at $1.2227 , up 0.2% for the day but still not far from Tuesday's five-week low of $1.2196.
The Turkish lira retreated to six-week lows as Turkish troops, together with their Syrian rebel allies, attacked Kurdish militia in northeast Syria, opening a fresh chapter in Syria's eight-year-old civil war.
The lira fell to 5.8777 per dollar , the lowest since its flash crash on Aug. 26.
U.S. Treasuries yield slipped back after having risen to 1.594% on Wednesday, pressured partly by this week's heavy bond supply.
The 10-year Treasuries yield dipped to one basis point to 1.577% (US10YT=RR).
The price of front-end Fed funds rate futures gained on increasing bets on more rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The November contract is almost fully pricing in a 0.25 percentage point cut on Oct. 30.
Oil prices also slid on wariness over U.S.-China talks. Brent crude (LCOc1) futures fell 0.15% to $58.23 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) lost 0.11% to $52.53 per barrel."
471,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 01:21AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China Everbright Group to restructure, pursue billion-dollar HK IPO - sources","By Engen Tham and Julie Zhu
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - State-owned financial conglomerate China  Everbright  Group aims to restructure its sprawling business and pursue a billion dollar IPO next year in Hong Kong, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
While the offering size has yet to be finalised, the initial public offering (IPO) will likely be at least in the billion-dollar bracket, two of the people said. The third person estimated that Everbright, backed by sovereign wealth fund subsidiary Central Huijin Investment Ltd and China's Ministry of Finance, could raise up to $3 billion.
The Fortune 500 company has recently hired U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Chinese peers China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC) (HK:3908) and CITIC Securities Co Ltd (SS:600030) as restructuring advisers, the people said.
The advisers will help the group - with businesses as varied as banking, insurance, aircraft leasing and environmental protection services - to finalize details, such as what assets will be listed and under which entity, two of the people said.
Everbright Group, JPMorgan, CICC and CITIC Securities did not respond to requests for comment. The three people declined to be identified as the information was not public.
Beijing-based Everbright has been exploring IPO plans since the first half of the year and has been asking another state-owned conglomerate, CITIC Group Corp, for guidance and advice, said one of the people.
The group decided to list in Hong Kong rather than Shanghai partially because the process is shorter and there are fewer uncertainties, the person said.
Like many heads at Chinese state-owned enterprises, Everbright Chairman Li Xiaopeng who joined the group in December 2017 from another state-backed conglomerate, China Merchants Group Ltd, is a senior Communist Party official.
One of the people said a successful IPO would likely help Li, 60, climb further up the ranks of the Party.
Everbright's IPO pursuit in Hong Kong comes as Asia's top financial hub looks to be back in business with companies forging ahead with listing plans after a freeze during months of frequently violent anti-government protests.
 Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd  (HK:1876) last month raised about $5 billion in Hong Kong, in this year's second-largest IPO worldwide.
On Thursday, Chinese sportswear manufacturer Topsports International Holdings Ltd (HK:6110) debuted on the Hong Kong stock exchange after raising $1.01 billion.
Everbright, one of mainland China's oldest and biggest financial conglomerates, was founded in Hong Kong in 1983, early in China's economic reform era.
The group now has registered capital of 60 billion yuan ($8.41 billion) and about 11 stock market-listed entities including China Everbright Bank Co Ltd (SS:601818), Everbright Securities Co Ltd (SS:601788) and asset manager China Everbright Ltd (HK:0165)."

PAPER MONEY, BIG BLACK BOX
* The Vision Fund's $20.2 billion of investment gains are mostly on paper and its valuations are under growing downward pressure as shares in four of the fund's five listed portfolio firms have fallen sharply in the three months through September.
Those newly listed firms are Uber,  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK),  Guardant Health  Inc (O:GH),  ZhongAn Online  P&C Insurance Co Ltd (HK:6060) and Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co Ltd (Ping An Good Doctor) (HK:1833).

(Reuters) - Australia's AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) said on Thursday it will merge its banking and Australian wealth management units as part of a turnaround plan aimed at making the firm more customer-focused, after an inquiry revealed widespread misconduct.
AMP has been struggling to repair its reputation after the Royal Commission inquiry found it had for years wrongfully charged fees to thousands of clients and then attempted to mislead the regulator about it.
Its shares are languishing near record lows and customers have been pulling out in droves, with the wealth manager undergoing a major restructuring that has included culling some financial advisers aligned to it.
Chief Executive Officer Francesco De Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) said the decision to merge the two units comes after Sally Bruce, AMP Bank's CEO, decided to step down.
""Closer integration of the businesses was part of our long-term plan, and with Sally's decision to step down we have been able to accelerate our internal reorganization,"" De Ferrari said.
In September, AMP said it had raised A$784 million ($528.49 million) to fund the restructuring of its flagship wealth-management business in Australia and New Zealand.
""Wealth management is still a business with a future in Australia, but if there's any sector of the market that relies on its reputation, it surely must be in the financial services sector,"" said James McGlew, an executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut.
""It takes 50 years to build a reputation and it only took a few months to see it trashed,"" he said.
The new combined business will be called AMP Australia and will be led by Alex Wade, the current CEO of the Australian wealth management arm.
In August, AMP said it was targeting A$300 million a year in savings by 2022. It also said outflows at its Australian wealth-management unit totaled A$3.1 billion, more than three times the rate of the net cash outflows it reported at the same time a year earlier.
OPPORTUNITY?
Following the inquiry, Australian banks have been offloading non-core business units, including wealth management.
""The banks have pretty much gone and pushed their wealth management businesses out, which in turn creates an opportunity for AMP,"" McGlew said.
But it all comes down to AMP rebuilding its reputation, he said.
Shares of AMP were flat by 0235 GMT, amid minor gains by the broader market (AXJO)."

Customers tweeted photos Wednesday of the notice popping up on the touch screens of their electric cars, advising them to top off their batteries while they still could. Utility owner PG&E began shutting off electricity to parts of the region early Wednesday to prevent its power lines from sparking fires during an expected windstorm.
“A utility company in your area announced they may turn off power in some areas of Northern California beginning October 9 as part of public safety power shutoffs, which may affect power to charging options,” the notice read. “We recommend charging your Tesla to 100% today to ensure that your drive remains uninterrupted.”

Developments on the Sino-U.S. trade war were in major focus this week, as high-level officials resumed in-person negotiations. Some reports said today that China is open to a partial deal with the U.S., if no more tariffs are imposed on Chinese goods. 
 
Citing an unnamed official with direct knowledge of the talks, Bloomberg reported that Beijing would offer purchases of agricultural products in return, but it would not give in on major sticking points. 
 
Bloomberg said the U.S. is now considering rolling out a previously agreed currency pact as part of the partial trade deal. The deal had been agreed earlier this year before talks between the two nations broke down. 
 
However, other reports said that Chinese negotiators are not optimistic about reaching a broad agreement that would end the trade war between the two sides, and that the China delegation is planning to leave Washington on Thursday instead of Friday as previously planned.

BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Surprised and upset by the U.S. blacklisting of Chinese companies, China has lowered expectations for significant progress from this week's trade talks with the United States, Chinese government officials told Reuters, even as President Donald Trump on Wednesday expressed fresh optimism. 
While Beijing theoretically wants to end the trade war, Chinese Communist Party officials are not optimistic about the size or scope of any agreement with Washington in the short-term, the Chinese officials said. 
Top U.S. and Chinese trade and economic officials will meet in Washington on Thursday and Friday to try to end a 15-month-old trade war that is slowing the global economy and threatens to upend decades-old trade systems. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to take part.
Without significant progress, Trump is set to hike the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% next Tuesday.
Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said: ""If we can make a deal, we're going to make a deal, there's a really good chance.""
""In my opinion China wants to make a deal more than I do,"" Trump added.
Based on the current situation, there is a possibility that this week's talks between the world's two largest economies could end in a deadlock, according to a Chinese official briefed on preparations for the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity. Asked about the probability of reaching an agreement, the official said, ""This is not an easy task. It requires a lot of preparation work and consensus on both sides.""
For trade relations or overall ties between the two countries to improve, more time is needed, Chinese officials said. 
While previous lower-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials aimed to create a good atmosphere for the upcoming meeting, the U.S. blacklisting of 28 Chinese companies has generated a negative atmosphere instead, Chinese officials said. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday blacklisted video surveillance firm Hikvision and 27 others, days ahead of the talks. The Commerce Department barred the technology and artificial intelligence companies from doing business with U.S. firms, citing human rights violations of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang. Chinese officials said the action interfered with China's sovereignty. 
Both sides should not escalate disputes or they will drift apart, said a second Beijing-based Chinese official briefed on the talks this week. 
The trade talks come in the wake of tit-for-tat bans on certain visas for each other's officials and a controversy sparked by a Twitter post by an executive with the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets supporting anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
""We can add the Diplomatic war to the Financial war, Currency war and Technology war, that we already have,"" John Browning, managing director at brokerage BANDS Financial in Shanghai, said in a note to investors.
While there is a huge contingent of high-level Chinese officials traveling to Washington, ""to my jaded perception it looks less than a delegation rather a funeral cortege,"" Browning wrote.
The U.S. demand that the Chinese Communist Party fundamentally change how it directs China's massive economy to shift to a more Western model of free-market capitalism is irrational and misguided, a Chinese diplomat in the United States said. 
""What we achieved during the past few decades shows that our system is good for development in China,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
China would not ask the United States to shift to an economy that relies heavily on state-owned enterprises, or ask it to start fully funding education, as China's does, he said, so why should Washington expect the same from Beijing?
""We hope to strike an agreement but also accept the differences,"" the diplomat added.
Western governments' treatment of China in the past, including welcoming the country into multilateral organizations such as the World Trade Organization, has been predicated on the assumption that this ultimately would lead to Beijing's liberalization and gradual embrace of democratic norms. 
Washington is expected to press new demands for Beijing to protect U.S. intellectual property this week, but both sides have very different views of that topic as well. 
Chinese officials contend that China did not steal intellectual property in the past, saying Western companies gave it up willingly and reaped the benefits. 
""Many decisions were made based on entrepreneurial partnerships,"" the U.S.-based Chinese official said, adding that they have mostly benefited Western companies.

For example, for every $1,000 iPhone, China's share of production is just $70, the official said.

NBC News fired Lauer two years ago after a female colleague accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, making him one of a series of rich and powerful men to be felled by accusations of harassment or misconduct.
In Farrow's book, ""Catch and Kill,"" the same former NBC employee who leveled the accusations that led to Lauer's dismissal says he forced her to have anal sex after a night of drinking in the Russian city that hosted the 2014 Summer Games, Variety reported, citing the book.
""It was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,"" the woman told Farrow, the report said. ""It was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn't want to have anal sex.""
Reuters was unable to obtain a copy of the book, which publisher Little, Brown and Co is due to release on Oct. 15.
Variety later on Wednesday published a letter from Lauer provided by his lawyer denying the allegations described in Farrow's book as well as other accusations of misconduct that have been leveled against him over the past two years.
""Today, nearly two years after I was fired by NBC, old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made,"" Lauer wrote. ""All are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book.""
Efforts by Reuters to reach representatives of Lauer, Farrow and Little, Brown and Co were not immediately successful.
In statement on Wednesday, NBC said: ""Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint.""
""Catch and Kill"" focuses on Farrow's investigation into allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who was arrested last year in New York on rape and other charges.
This week, ""The New Yorker"" magazine published a three-part series of excerpts from Farrow's upcoming book. The passages did not contain any reference to the allegations against Lauer."
480,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 08:12PM ET</span>","Judge opens door to PG&E wildfire victims, noteholders filing rival reorganization plan","By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The judge overseeing the bankruptcy of PG&E Corp (N:PCG) on Wednesday issued an order opening the door to a group of noteholders and wildfire victims to file their own reorganization plan for the California power provider.
PG&E's shares tumbled 28% in after-hours trade to $7.90.
Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali said in his order filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco that he favored allowing the noteholders to file their plan because it has the support of the committee representing victims of the massive California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that pushed PG&E to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.
Allowing the noteholders, which include Apollo Capital Management and Elliott Management Corp among others, to file while PG&E advances its own plan may help force the sides to negotiate a settlement of the case, Montali added.
The rival plan offers more money to wildfire victims and would give debt holders control of PG&E after it emerges from bankruptcy. Noteholders propose putting $29.2 billion in new money into the San Francisco-based power provider in exchange for new debt and a controlling equity stake. 
PG&E's plan, backed by current major shareholders, would use $34 billion in new debt and $14 billion in equity commitments to reorganize.
The company in a statement provided to Reuters said it was disappointed by Montali's order.
""We are confident that our fully funded plan of reorganization, which will satisfy all wildfire claims in full while treating all stakeholders fairly and protecting customers, is the better solution for all constituencies,"" PG&E said. 
Montali said he was swayed by the committee of wildfire victims, noting it has ""spoken loudly and clearly that they want their and the senior noteholders' proposed plan to be considered."" 
Montali said he wants the noteholders to file their plan by Oct. 17.
The wildfire victims committee backs the noteholders' plan because it expects the proposal to provide more than the $8.4 billion in compensation PG&E has proposed for the victims.
Their claims may be worth $13.5 billion, a lawyer for the committee said at hearing on Monday.
When it filed for bankruptcy, PG&E estimated its total wildfire-related liabilities could top $30 billion.
In addition to the $8.4 billion it has proposed paying individual wildfire victims as part of a reorganization, PG&E recently agreed in a settlement to pay $11 billion to insurers to compensate their wildfire-related payments. Their claims were originally worth $20 billion.
The noteholders have offered to match the $11 billion settlement.

Also on Wednesday, PG&E cut off electricity to more than 500,000 homes across California in a planned outage of unprecedented scale to lower the risk of hot, dry weather and high winds damaging its equipment and sparking fires.

481,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 07:18PM ET</span>",Shell to offset carbon emissions for British fuel buyers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) said on Thursday it would offset the carbon dioxide emissions of around 1.5 million road users in Britain starting later this month under a loyalty scheme.
Shell, like other oil companies, has come under pressure from shareholders to show how it plans to reduce its carbon footprint and help cut greenhouse gas emissions, a major cause of global warming.
Britons are increasingly concerned about their environmental impact, with thousands of students striking earlier this year and green group Extinction Rebellion carrying out civil disobedience to push for more ambition on climate change. 
Sinead Lynch, Shell UK country chair, said the best way for people to cut their road emissions was to use electric vehicles, supplied with renewable power.
""But today the majority of people still use petrol and diesel. We can help them address the impact of their emissions by offsetting their fuel purchases,"" she said in a statement.
From Oct. 17, emissions relating to fuel purchased by customers with the Shell Go+ app or card will be offset for free until September 2020.
Shell said about 20% of its customers were registered with the loyalty scheme. It expects the program to cost roughly 10 million pounds ($12.2 million) and offset emissions from around 1.5 million cars.
Carbon offsetting involves helping to fund a cut in emissions elsewhere, such as through preventing deforestation.
Some climate groups say offsetting should be used as a last resort and that absolute emission cuts should be the priority.
Shell said it would use carbon credits from conservation projects in Peru, Indonesia, the United States and Britain.
Most of the credits that will be used for the scheme have already been bought, Shell said, but it did not disclose the purchase price.
The cost of carbon offsets varies widely depending on the type of project and the social and environmental benefits it brings. 

Credits traded under a U.N.-backed scheme are trading at around 0.22 euro per tonne of carbon dioxide, while carbon-offsetting firms can charge around 8 euros a tonne.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 06:42PM ET</span>",Massive jury award against J&J highlights risks of its legal strategy,"By Carl O'Donnell and Tom Hals
(Reuters) - A jury award that hit Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) with $8 billion in punitive damages for a case involving its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal highlights the risks of the drugmaker's all-or-nothing legal strategy, several legal experts told Reuters on Wednesday. 
The jury in a Philadelphia court awarded the $8 billion to a man who previously won $680,000 over his claims that it failed to warn that young men using Risperdal could grow breasts.
J&J called the sum ""grossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award"" and said it was confident it would be overturned.
Legal experts agreed that the penalty was likely to be slashed.
But the verdict, which helped drive J&J's shares down 2% on Wednesday, is an example of how public outrage at the pharmaceutical industry for high drug prices has contributed to harsher verdicts against drugmakers accused of wrongdoing in recent years, legal experts said.
Outsized penalties awarded by some juries highlight risks in a longstanding strategy by drugmakers such as J&J of taking their chances at trial rather then settle product liability lawsuits brought by patients.
""Every pharmaceutical company needs to seriously consider if they want to litigate to verdict in the present environment, but with the settlement demands so incredibly high it's not always clear what their alternative is,"" said Barry Thompson, a partner at Baker McKenzie law firm who was not involved in the case.
Drugmakers often prefer to litigate rather than settle in hopes of protecting their brands and discouraging future patient lawsuits, Thompson said.
Companies also may use a series of early trial verdicts to gauge the size of any settlement it might eventually offer, as Merck & Co (N:MRK) did with its withdrawn Vioxx arthritis pain drug when facing thousands of lawsuits by patients who claimed harm from the drug. 
A 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision suggests that the upper limit of a fair punitive penalty in the Risperdal case would be about $6 million based on the earlier compensatory award. 
J&J could still get a favorable ruling on appeal that would give the company leverage in dealing with the remaining cases, said Benjamin McMichael, a professor at the Alabama School of Law who has researched punitive damage awards.
""With such a large punitive damages award at issue, appellate courts may be more willing to come down hard on the plaintiffs,"" McMichael said.
J&J faces more than 13,000 lawsuits tied to Risperdal alleging that it caused a condition called gynecomastia in boys, in which breast tissue becomes enlarged. The company is also facing lawsuits involving its baby powder, opioids, medical devices and other products.
""We’re operating within a very litigious environment, and we must at times be willing to go to trial when the science, facts and law are on our side,"" J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said in an email.
""We also have to remain open to resolving cases through settlement when and where that’s appropriate to do. We have a proven track record of being able to successfully and appropriately manage this balance,"" Knewitz added.
The company has had its share of legal wins, losses and settlements.
An Oklahoma judge in August ordered J&J to pay $572.1 million to that state for its part in fueling the opioid crisis by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers, although the sum was substantially less than investors had expected.
Johnson & Johnson has said it plans to appeal the ruling. 
Earlier this month, the company agreed to pay $20.4 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, avoiding a federal opioid trial.

In 2013, J&J paid more than $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and other drugs.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 06:05PM ET</span>",California set to end private prisons and immigrant detention camps,"By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - America's largest state prison system is moving to quit the practice of farming out inmates to lockups run under contract by private companies, following a nationwide decline in the for-profit incarceration business.
California Governor Gavin Newsom is expected to sign legislation this week designed to effectively ban private, for-profit corporations from running prisons or immigration detention facilities.
Sponsors of the measure say it will end a brief but hapless experiment in privately outsourced incarceration begun as a means to ease overcrowding - an endeavor Newsom branded an outrage when he took office in January. 
Bill supporters say private prisons, driven to maximize shareholder profits, lack proper oversight or incentives to rehabilitate inmates, and have contributed to a culture of mass incarceration by making it cheaper to lock up people.
They point to research cited in a 2016 U.S. Justice Department Office of Inspector General report that found private prisons spend less on personnel, and are less safe, than public institutions.
""This is a total and complete failure, and it's hurting and abusing Californians,"" said state Assemblyman Rob Bonta, a chief author of the bill. 
The facilities at stake are low-security lockups operated by one of two leading U.S. private prison companies, Florida-headquartered GEO Group (N:GEO) or Tennessee-based CoreCivic (N:CXW).
Defending their business model, the companies say they provided a vital service when detentions in California's prisons more than doubled the system's capacity, sparking lawsuits that led to court-ordered cuts to inmate populations.
""For 10 years, we provided safe, secure housing and life-changing re-entry programing for inmates that had faced extreme overcrowding,"" CoreCivic spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist said.
Separately, GEO Group cited its record as ""an innovator in the field of rehabilitative services"" and said the bill worked against the state's goal of lowering inmate recidivism.
SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLES
Inmate advocacy groups say the legislation does not go far enough, pointing to what they call significant loopholes, including an exemption for facilities that provide ""educational, vocational, medical or other ancillary services"" to inmates.
""I cannot think of any prison that does not provide those services,"" said Kara Gotsch, director of strategic initiatives for the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice reform group. 
Several states, including New York, Illinois and Nevada, have adopted similar bans on private prisons, and nearly half of all states have no such facilities, Gotsch said.
The bill sets the stage for the three remaining private prisons in California, collectively housing about 1,400 inmates, to close four years from now, when their contracts with the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation expire.
Perhaps more significantly, the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) agency stands to lose four privately-run detention facilities in California next year that hold roughly 4,000 people, unless the ban is challenged in court.
ICE has not taken a public position on the bill. But assuming the measure were adopted, detainees would simply be transferred to facilities outside California, the agency said in a statement.
The impact ""would be felt almost exclusively by residents of California, who would be forced to travel greater distances to visit friends and family in custody,"" ICE said.
The average daily population at issue in those facilities accounts for less than a tenth of the 52,000 ICE holds nationwide, it said.
SMALL FRACTION
The bill, which secured its final passage by the state legislature last month, bans any new or renewed California contracts with private, for-profit prisons, starting in January. 
Four detention facilities privately operated for ICE would be put out of business even sooner, when their contracts with the federal government expire next year, Bonta said.
California had already been moving in this direction, terminating in June its contact with a privately-run correctional center in Arizona - the last of several such out-of-state facilities - followed by last month's closure of a 700-bed facility in McFarland, California, near Bakersfield.
The state's share of inmates in private facilities is a small fraction of its total prison population of nearly 126,000. 

By comparison, Texas, which became the first state to outsource incarceration to private companies in 1985, had far more inmates than any other state in for-profit facilities in 2017, nearly 13,000, or 7.8 percent of its total, said Gotsch of the Sentencing Project.

(Reuters) - Hydraulic fracturing firm ProPetro Holding Corp (N:PUMP) on Wednesday announced a management shakeup, following an internal investigation into disclosure of electric frac equipment purchases and executive spending.
Dale Redman will no longer be the principal executive, but will remain on as chief executive officer. Phillip Gobe, currently board chairman, will take over as the company's executive chairman and serve as the principal executive officer, responsible for its annual and quarterly reports.
Gobe will also partly oversee the remediation of control deficiencies identified in the internal review, the company said.
ProPetro said its chief accounting officer had resigned, while chief financial officer moved to the role of chief administrative officer.
The Midland, Texas-based company said in August it would delay its second-quarter results due to an audit into disclosures related to purchases of DuraStim hydraulic fracturing fleets from AFGlobal.
The audit, which pointed to weakness related to internal controls, was then expanded to include expense reimbursements and transactions involving key executives that may have been in conflict of interest."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of 17 U.S. states that sued to block a proposed $26.5 billion tie-up of Sprint Corp (N:S) and T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) agreed to drop the challenge after reaching a deal with the companies.
Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood said in a statement he will withdraw from the legal challenge over the planned merger of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers. He said the combined company has agreed within three years to deploy a 5G network in Mississippi with at least 62 percent of the state’s general and rural populations having access to high-speed service.
Hood said the prior merger agreement did not include any specific commitments benefiting Mississippi. The company agreed that for at least five years it will offer an unlimited talk, text and 2GB data plan for $15 per month and a $25 per month plan for 5GB of data.
""The world around us is almost fully digital, but Mississippi is lagging behind with internet deserts across the state,"" Hood said. ""My agreement with T-Mobile will help fill this gap.""
T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said on Twitter the company was ""thrilled"" Hood ""withdrew from the states’ lawsuit after learning more about ALL the amazing benefits the New T-Mobile will deliver to US consumers!""
T-Mobile has also promised to roll out a broadband service that will be available to hundreds of thousands of Mississippians, Hood said.
Last week, a majority of the five-member U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to approve the deal, but the order has not yet been made public. The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July. 
The lawsuit led by New York against the firms and their parent companies Softbank Group Corp (T:9984) and Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), argues the deal will hike consumer prices. A trial date has been set for Dec. 9, and several states have joined in recent months.

Earlier this week, LightShed analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone suggested that T-Mobile should renegotiate the deal with Sprint to get better terms. The company's merger agreement will expire on Nov. 1 unless they agree to extend the date.

487,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 05:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Delta pilots received record overtime while MAX crisis hit rivals - unions,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) pilots are receiving record overtime, straining the airline's labor costs, in part because it has added more flights to fill a supply gap left by the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX at rival carriers, union officials told Reuters.
The surge in overtime highlights a split in the fortunes of U.S. airline workers as carriers like Delta, which does not fly the MAX, scramble to meet demand while staff at rivals like Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and American Airlines (O:AAL) sit at home on basic pay.
Delta issued a record 40,554 ""green slips"" - double-pay for overtime flying - between May and August, double the same period in 2018, according to pilot union Delta Master Executive Council, a unit of the Air Line Pilots Association. 
""There were weekend days that I would get up to 10 calls a day to pick up an extra shift or an extra flight,"" Delta pilot Dana Dann-Messier, who flies a Boeing 717, told Reuters.
""There were times when the pace of the summer was so hectic that guys wouldn't be volunteering because they were so wiped out,"" said Dann-Messier, who is based in Atlanta.
Delta, due to publish third-quarter results on Thursday before the market opens, last week raised its estimate for growth in third-quarter cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel costs, to about 2.5%, in part due to employee wage increases.
""Maintaining the operational reliability customers have come to expect and love about Delta required additional pilot flying this summer, largely due to severe weather impacting our operation and some incremental flying above our previous plan,"" Delta spokesman Michael Thomas said.
He played down the 737 MAX grounding as a major contributing factor.
Still, Delta's third-quarter capacity growth is expected to outpace that of U.S. rivals whose capacity has stagnated or even fallen as slimmer fleets without the MAX force over 100 daily flight cancellations.
Part of that growth, which Delta has estimated at around 4% for the third quarter, reflects flying that it has covered for partners  Aeromexico  (MX:AEROMEX) and WestJet (TO:WJA), which both own the MAX.
""They had an opportunity for more flying,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said, while adding that challenging weather this summer, particularly where Delta has a lot of operations in the U.S. Southeast, also likely contributed to the overtime hours. 
While overtime is voluntary for pilots, the union has argued that Delta needs to increase the pace of its hiring to better cushion its ranks.
Delta said it continues to hire pilots this year and plans to add more than 900 in 2020.
Meanwhile, Southwest, the world's largest Boeing 737 MAX carrier, has delayed pilot hiring while the jetliner remains grounded.
Its pilot union this week sued  Boeing Co  (N:BA) for an alleged $100 million-plus in lost wages they attribute to reduced flying time because of the grounding, now in its seventh month.
American Airlines' pilots have demanded compensation over lost pay but have not filed any lawsuits.

The Boeing 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people within five months.

There was a little good news as Bloomberg reported China was open to a partial deal.
The S&P 500 was up 0.91%, thanks in part to gains for its two biggest components, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple NASDAQ:AAPL), and strength in tech and energy stocks overall. 
The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.02%, and the Dow Jones industrials rose 0.7%, or 182 points. At one point, the blue chips were up more than about 260 points before profit-taking set in. The Dow's finish was off about 30% from its peak. The S&P 500's close was about 26% below its peak.
Activity was light on Wall Street as many traders had taken the day off for Yom Kippur.
The rally was set off by a report China was open to a number of trade measures, including boosting purchases of U.S. farm products. But the report suggested a resolution to disputes over intellectual property and market access for industrial products could come later.
Like the S&P 500, the Dow was pushed higher by Microsoft) and Apple. The duo plus Visa (NYSE:V) contributed more than 60 points to the Dow's gain.
Apple moved up on an upgrade from Canaccord Genuity. Microsoft was lifted by Tuesday's upgrade from Jefferies.
The biggest loser among the three Dow stocks that ended lower was Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), which fell nearly 2% after a Philadelphia jury awarded a man $8 billion in damages over side-effects from using the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal.
The other Dow decliners were investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), off 0.26%, and pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), down 0.03%. 
Meanwhile, all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were higher, led by technology, up 1.45% and energy, up 1.07%. 
But the rally left the S&P 500 under 3,000 for a 14th-straight day. The index is 3.59% below its 52-week high and 0.7% below its high in the fall of 2018.
That's a signal of deep uncertainty about the trade fight and its impact on the economy.
The Dow is off 3.84% below its 52-week high, with the Nasdaq off 4.95% from its peak and the Nasdaq 100 down 4.2% from its peak.
The market anticipated minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting that officials are increasingly worried about the trade fight's impact on business spending and expansion. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell repeated the concern in speeches this week.
Oil prices were little changed. West Texas Intermediate crude was off 4 cents to $52.59. Global benchmark Brent  crude gained 8 cents to $58.32.
Metal prices moved higher. Gold futures added $8.90 to $1,512.80 an ounce in New York.
Interest rates moved up, thanks to the stock rally. The 10-Year Treasury yield was at 1.587%, up from 1.539% on Tuesday.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 04:49PM ET</span>",Boeing's 787 under pressure as Russia's Aeroflot cancels order,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) faced additional uncertainty on Wednesday over future production rates for its 787 Dreamliner after Russian carrier Aeroflot (MM:AFLT) formally canceled an order for 22 aircraft valued at about $5.5 billion at list prices.
The cancellation, first reported by the Seattle Times and buried in Boeing's monthly order release, is the final step in unwinding an order that had been shrouded in uncertainty ever since the airline said in 2015 it no longer needed the planes.
But the lost business theoretically knocks a hole in the production profile for the 787 Dreamliner after the world's largest planemaker increased its build-rate to 14 aircraft per month from 12 at twin U.S. factories.
Barring new orders, Boeing faces the growing possibility that it may have to cut production back by 2022, industry sources say, piling on new pressure as the grounding of the smaller 737 MAX stretches into its eighth month.
One of the sources, who closely monitors Boeing's production plans, said the planemaker has dozens of unsold or potentially vacant 787 positions on its production line in 2022.
The actual number of unfilled production slots depends on assessments about the ability of airlines to take delivery as promised, a subjective guess that planemakers keep confidential.
Boeing declined to comment. 
While demand for the narrowbody aircraft that dominate most fleets remains strong, demand for larger, long-haul aircraft like the 787 and Airbus (PA:AIR) A330 and A350 has weakened.
Boeing won most of the widebody orders so far this year but neither planemaker is selling as many aircraft as it would like amid trade tensions, concerns over the global economy and the increased ability of smaller narrowbodies to fly long distances.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told a conference last month that Boeing is closely tracking ""macro risk areas,"" and had reserved slots on its 777 and 787 production lines for Chinese orders that have been held back by the U.S.-China trade war.
""There is dependency there on Chinese orders ultimately coming through,"" Muilenburg said.
The comments surprised some suppliers because planemakers typically raise output only after selling aircraft rather than opening the taps in the hope of winning orders later - though a strategic buyer like China might expect special treatment.
Boeing remains under pressure to reduce an overhang of deferred accounting costs on the 787 by producing more units.
European rival Airbus also has gaps in its production profile for widebody jets, especially the upgraded A330neo and to a lesser extent the newer A350, other industry sources said.
The lull in widebody orders has also raised questions about jetliner pricing. Multiple industry sources say aircraft are being offered at unusually steep discounts, something that officials at both planemakers deny. 

Meanwhile, company data showed that Boeing had officially booked a previously announced order from Air New Zealand for eight 787-10s, the largest Dreamliner model.

491,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. US-China Trade Talks to Resume
The U.S. and China are set to resume trade talks Thursday against the backdrop of rising optimism that discussions could pave the way to at least a little progress on trade.
China does not expect this week's talks to lead to a meaningful agreement, but it is open to the idea of a “partial deal,” Bloomberg reported, citing sources.
Beijing reportedly could give into some non-core concessions such as more purchases of agriculture goods like soybeans. But it is not willing to budge on key points that have dogged trade talks for months such as subsidies for Chinese companies or the ""forced technology transfers"" that require U.S. companies – seeking entry into China – to partner with a local company.
The talks come as trade tensions flared earlier this week when the U.S. blacklisted 28 Chinese organisations and accused them of human-rights violations against ethnic Uighurs in China's Xinjiang province.
The ban was likely a tactic to ramp up pressure on China ahead of the talks, though it unlikely “negates the possibility of a partial agreement from the two countries,” Nomura said in a note to clients.
 2. Retail Inflation, Jobless Claims Due 
Market participants look ahead to the release of consumer inflation data due Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists forecast that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1% in September, the same as the month before. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy price, is expected to have slowed to a rise of 0.2% from 0.3% a month earlier.
Economists expect the year-over-year pace of the CPI to rise to 1.8% and core CPI growth to stay unchanged at 2.4%.
The consumer inflation comes a a day after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the pace of inflation has been firming in recent months, though it remained somewhat below the central bank’s 2% target.
The weekly report on initial jobless claims is also due at 8:30 AM ET.
Jobless claims are expected to dip to 215,000 from 219,000 in the prior week, according to a forecast of economists polled by Investing.com.
3. Delta Flies in Q3 Earnings
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is set to report earnings before the markets open on Thursday.
Ahead of the results, Delta last week saw its shares fall sharply after revealing that costs were increasing at a faster pace than expected. 
Despite the recent update, the earnings report will be carefully parsed for commentary on fourth-quarter guidance and forecasts about capacity next year.
The return of Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets next year is expected to ramp up global capacity, raising worries that airfares could come under pressure.
Delta is expected to report earnings of $2.28 per share on revenue of $12.7 billion."
492,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 04:01PM ET</span>",GM Strike Seen Forcing Credit Firms to Mull Negative Action,"(Bloomberg) -- The United Auto Workers union’s strike against General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). may force credit raters to take action and move the company closer to junk status, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
Now in its fourth week, the strike has gone beyond the two-week threshold that raters including Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings had said posed downside risk, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joel Levington wrote in a report Wednesday. The “fuse is burning” for ratings that, in Moody’s case, is just one notch above junk, Levington said.
So far, bondholders haven’t priced in the possibility of negative rating actions. GM’s bonds have barely moved, while its stock is down about 13% since the strike took effect Sept. 16. Credit default swaps have widened since then, but so have those of peers Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, as well as the broader investment-grade market.
GM is rated BBB by S&P and Fitch Ratings, which is two levels above junk. Moody’s, S&P and Fitch all have stable outlooks for the automaker’s rating.
The Detroit-based automaker and the union remain deadlocked over job guarantees, according to a letter sent out Tuesday by UAW Vice President Terry Dittes. Workers are also fighting for better wages and benefits, which could affect GM’s cost structure going forward.
“The longer this drags on, the more risk that the concessions would have to be larger on GM’s part,” said Olesya Zhovtanetska, senior director of public fixed income at Sun Life Investment Management. “It goes beyond the immediate financial impact.”

493,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 04:01PM ET</span>",Make-or-Break Trade Week Sours $3 Billion Bet on U.S. Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Three straight weeks of losses in U.S. stocks were enough to scare off exchange-traded fund investors ahead of trade talks with China.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, ticker VOO, saw $2.9 billion worth of outflows at the start of the week, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That was the biggest withdrawal of 2019, and the second-largest in the fund’s 9-year lifespan.
With an envoy traveling from China to the U.S. for high-level negotiations, a raft of Fedspeak alongside the release of the central bank’s meeting minutes and inflation data, markets face a string of potential catalysts. The S&P 500 Index has fallen for three straight weeks, yet remains less than 4% away from its record. Nerves are running high.
“Frankly, we could see another event like Q4 (when stocks slumped the most since 2011) very easily,” said Randy Frederick, a vice president of trading and derivatives who helps oversee $3.7 trillion in assets at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). “I don’t anticipate it, but another breakdown in discussions with China, ‘OK talks are off the table, we’re done for now,’ or whatever, we could easily see that again.”
Such large outflows from VOO are notable because massive redemptions aren’t common. Unlike the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which is used heavily by traders, Vanguard’s $115 billion fund is utilized more by long-term investors.
“Outflows from VOO are as rare as a four-leaf clover since it is a preferred fund of long-term sticky money,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. “When it does happen it’s more likely connected to a rebalance of some sort by a large advisor or model portfolio.”"

The cuts affect 650 workers across Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and North Dakota, Emily Mir, a spokeswoman, said Wednesday in a prepared statement. Most were offered the option to relocate to other areas where greater oilfield work is expected, she said.
The moves come three months after the Houston-based oilfield contractor announced it was trimming 8% of its North American headcount and parking unused frack gear.
Oilfield servicers have been among the worst-hit companies amid a slowdown in the once red-hot U.S. shale patch. Their exploration customers are dialing back spending as low crude prices dent profits and investors urge financial discipline. Bankruptcies in the industry are surging and on track to eclipse last year’s casualties, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP.
The number of U.S. crews that frack wells, the final step before oil production, has dropped 17% this year, according to Primary Vision Inc. Halliburton is set to report financial results from the third quarter on Oct. 21.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will testify before a key congressional committee that deals with the finance industry later this month, the latest sign of rising opposition to the social media giant’s plans to create a cryptocurrency.
The social network’s top executive will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Oct. 23, according to Maxine Waters, the panel’s Democratic chairwoman. He’ll be the sole witness at the hearing, which is advertised as an examination of Facebook’s broad impact on the financial services and housing industries, Waters said in a Wednesday statement.
Zuckerberg looks forward to testifying before the committee and responding to lawmakers’ questions, a Facebook spokesman said. The committee had previously been discussing bringing in Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.
The hearing will be the second held by Waters in a matter of months that features a Facebook senior manager. In July, both Democratic and Republican members on her panel grilled David Marcus, the executive leading Facebook’s development of the digital token, known as Libra. Marcus sat through two days of contentious hearings where Facebook’s prior missteps around user privacy and election security were cited as reasons why the company shouldn’t be moving into financial services. Zuckerberg was also criticized for sending a deputy instead of answering questions himself. Marcus said repeatedly that Facebook plans to work with regulators to get Libra off the ground.
Facebook announced in June it’s trying to create the new cryptocurrency using similar technology to that of Bitcoin, saying it would lower the cost of payments and money transfers. The company helped form a new organization, called the Libra Association, that’s incorporated in Switzerland and would manage the currency. It also recruited 27 partners to serve as Libra Association members to help govern the proposed currency, but one of those members --  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL). -- abandoned the project before the group’s charter was even signed.
Following Facebook’s initial announcement, blowback to the plan was swift. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said Libra could pose a risk to the financial system, and it’s drawn criticism from President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The French and German finance ministers have said they would block the project.
Lawmakers are also concerned that the coin might be used to bypass money-laundering rules or that it could undermine government control over the flow of money.
The committee’s questions for Zuckerberg likely won’t be limited to Libra. The House Financial Services Committee also oversees housing issues, and Zuckerberg may be asked about Facebook’s advertising practices. Earlier this year the Department of Housing and Urban Development accused Facebook of letting advertisers restrict housing ads to Facebook users based on protected characteristics, like race and religion.
Zuckerberg has appeared before Congress just once before -– in April 2018, to answer questions about Facebook’s privacy practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, Zuckerberg was in Washington just last month and held meetings with a number of lawmakers from both the House and Senate, and with Trump in the Oval Office.
(Update includes added context around Zuckerberg’s history in DC and more details about other issues that may be discussed.)"

Ten-year Treasury yields approached 1.6%. The Turkish currency and its stocks dropped after the country began a military offensive in Syria against Kurdish militants.
While volume was subdued during the Yom Kippur holiday, equities traders seemed to get a boost of confidence before high-level U.S.-China trade talks are set to resume in Washington on Thursday. While a broad agreement seems unlikely, China signaled it’s open to a limited deal, provided no more tariffs are imposed, according to an official. In return, Beijing would offer non-core concessions like purchases of agricultural products without giving in on major sticking points, the official said, without offering further details.
“It’s encouraging to hear China say that they want to make some sort of small deal,” said Randy Frederick, a vice president of trading and derivatives who helps oversee $3.7 trillion in assets at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). “If we can get the two sides to agree to not raise tariffs any further than where they are, that would be positive.”
Investors are also looking to gauge the next moves by major central banks. Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve will resume purchases of Treasury securities to avoid a repeat of recent turmoil in money markets, while hinting at the possibility of another rate cut. Minutes of the Fed’s most recent rates meeting will be released Wednesday, providing further insight into policy makers’ thinking ahead of their next meeting at the end of the month.

By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Former  Barclays  (L:BARC) finance director Chris Lucas would have been criminally charged over two emergency fundraisings launched by the bank at the height of the financial crisis if he were not too ill to stand trial, a London fraud trial heard on Wednesday.
As a former bank director, Lucas, who stepped down in 2013 due to his health, arguably took direct responsibility for false representations in the bank's public documents about capital raisings in June and October 2008, a prosecutor for the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) alleged.
The high-profile trial revolves around undisclosed payments to Qatar as Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds ($13.4 billion) from the Gulf state and other investors to avert a state bailout as markets roiled in the global credit crisis.
Prosecutor Edward Brown highlighted the alleged role played by Lucas on the second day of the fraud trial of three former top Barclays executives; Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath, at London's Old Bailey criminal court.
""The prosecution say ... that Chris Lucas may be regarded as directly making a false representation in the Barclays documents (as a director),"" Brown said, as the prosecution laid out its case.
""He (Lucas) is not a defendant, before the court, due to illness...But for his illness he would have been charged.""
Lucas' lawyer declined to comment.
The defendants are charged with conspiring with Lucas to commit fraud by false representation as well as a separate charge of fraud by false representation. They deny wrongdoing.
The trial is expected to last five months. The defense will later present its case.
Barclays paid Qatar 322 million pounds in fees that were not disclosed in public documents, such as the prospectuses and subscription agreements that outlined payments and commissions paid to investors as incentives for their support.
The prosecution alleges that the defendants breached well-established banking practice, under which all investors should be paid equally, and disguised these fees as ""bogus"" advisory services agreements (ASAs).
Brown said Barclays' lawyers wanted evidence of services to justify the fees the bank was paying Qatar -- and he alleged the defendants and Lucas had made ""after the event"" attempts to demonstrate some services had been provided.
But he added: ""These did not come close to justifying the huge amounts paid over to the Qataris and, you may well conclude, were nothing more than a smoke-screen to seek to legitimize what had gone before.""
Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested about 4 billion pounds in Barclays over 2008.
But that June, the Qataris demanded more than double what the bank had agreed to pay other investors and the defendants, knowing Barclays needed to strengthen its balance sheet in volatile markets, wrestled with how to pay them, Brown said.
Boath laid bare the pressure the bank was under.
""If he (Sheikh Hamad) doesn't come through with his money, we're fucked,"" Boath was quoted as saying on June 11, 2008, according to Brown.
Jenkins, the former chairman of the bank's Middle East investment banking arm, Kalaris, who led the bank's wealth division and Boath, a former European head of corporate finance, are charged with fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over the first fundraising in June 2008.
Jenkins also faces both charges over the second fundraising that October."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors retreated from the U.S. stock market by unloading nearly $11.8 billion from mutual funds and exchange traded funds that hold domestic equities last week, as concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy mounted, according to data released by the Investment Company Institute on Wednesday.
The $11.8 billion in outflows came during a week in which data showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector tumbled to a 10-year low in September, a sign that the trade war between the United States and China was weighing on the U.S. economy.
Over the last two weeks, investors have pulled more than $28 billion from U.S. stock funds, the largest pullback since the beginning of June. For the year to date, investors have pulled nearly $103 billion out of domestic equity funds.
At the same time, investors continued to gravitate to the perceived safety of bonds by sending another $8.5 billion into the category. For the year to date, investors have directed about $327.5 billion into bonds. 
World stock funds lost slightly more than $2 billion in outflows, making it a 4-week losing streak for the category. For the year to date, investors have pulled nearly $40 billion out of world stock funds.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) has appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) to run the sale of its Malaysian oil and gas assets as the U.S. firm accelerates a vast disposal program, banking and industry sources said.
The Malaysian assets, which include stakes in two large fields, are expected to fetch up to $3 billion, the sources said.
Exxon is exploring a sale of its Malaysian oil-and-gas producing assets, among a number of other properties worldwide, confirmed spokeswoman Julie King. 
The oil major has no agreements with potential buyers for the Malaysian properties and will continue to operate the fields as it explores their sale, she said. Exxon has said it aims to sell $15 billion in assets by 2021. 
Bank of America declined to comment.
Irving, Texas-based Exxon has ramped up sales of assets around the world in recent months. Those it has offered or sold include production in Norway, Australia, Nigeria, Azerbaijan and Britain.
In Malaysia, Exxon operates 35 oil and gas platforms in 12 offshore fields and has working interests in another 10 platforms in five fields in the South China Sea, according to its website.
The operations produce 15% of Malaysia's oil output of 600,000 barrels per day and half of its natural gas output of over 2 billion cubic feet per day.
The fields are operated under a 50% and 78% stake in two large production sharing contracts (PSC), consultancy WoodMackenzie said in a note. 
""The Malaysian assets are both operated and generally highly mature, with a significant amount of ageing infrastructure. A buyer will need to have strong operating credentials, and be recognised by (Malaysian national oil company) Petronas to be a suitably qualified and reputable operator,"" one banker said. 

Exxon, which has operated in Malaysia for more than 125 years, will continue to operate other businesses in the country after any sale. It runs two support centers in Kuala Lumpur for its upstream, fuels, lubricants and chemicals manufacturing and for information technology support. It also is a provider of polyethylene to the Malaysian market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook (O:FB) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Oct. 23 as the social media company faces growing scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers over a planned cryptocurrency and other issues including advertising policies.
Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing titled ""An Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors."" It will be his first appearance before a U.S. congressional committee since April 2018 although last month he was on Capitol Hill to meet privately with some lawmakers.
Zuckerberg is likely to be peppered with critical questions from lawmakers skeptical of Facebook's efforts to help launch a global cryptocurrency called Libra. Also, the federal government charged Facebook in March with violating fair lending laws, saying the company sold targeted advertising that was racially discriminatory.
Rep. Maxine Waters, the Democrat who chairs the panel, has been fiercely critical of Facebook, calling on it to halt its Libra project, which the company has said would launch in the middle of 2020.
Zuckerberg's testimony will come at a precarious time for Libra. U.S. payments processor  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) said this month it was leaving the Libra Association, a group of private companies helping develop the currency.
The project also faces significant skepticism from global regulators wary of what a digital currency with a potentially massive scale could mean for the financial system. On Tuesday, the European Union's finance commissioner said he would push for new rules to regulate virtual currencies, reacting to Facebook's plans to introduce Libra which the EU considers a risk to financial stability.
Facebook confirmed Zuckerberg will testify, which will come as the world's largest social media company faces scrutiny not only from Congress, but the Federal Trade Commision and a group of state attorneys general over antitrust issues.

504,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 01:07PM ET</span>","U.S. Army vows more funds, measures to fix housing hazards","By Joshua Schneyer and M.B. Pell
(Reuters) - Pledging to overcome a housing crisis on its installations, the U.S. Army is outlining new steps it is taking to provide better housing for families of service members while demanding accountability from private landlords and Army commanders.
In an interview, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said private real estate firms operating housing on military bases have already committed some $500 million to address substandard conditions like those documented in a Reuters series, Ambushed at Home.
[Read the series https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-military/]
McCarthy, confirmed by the U.S. Senate last month as the Army's senior civilian official, said more money is needed to build new housing on Army bases and renovate thousands of existing units. In the coming months, McCarthy said, the Army will consider a broad ""recapitalization"" of its housing program with its private partners.
The Reuters series documented housing hazards including shoddy construction, mold and pest infestations, the presence of lead-based paint and others.
Already this year, the Army has moved 1,800 families into temporary housing while repairing their homes, it said. It has been sending military personnel to inspect each home in its 87,000-unit portfolio for environmental threats, and, with its partners, has spent an extra $68 million addressing maintenance delays, the Army added. Going forward, the Army will require regular home inspections for safety hazards including peeling lead paint, mold and asbestos, it said.
In addition, the Army has hired 100 new housing inspectors and is requiring private landlords to create phone apps so residents can track the progress of maintenance work, it said.
""There was a breakdown over the last decade,"" McCarthy said. ""These are hard lessons learned, but we're trying to dig out quickly.""
McCarthy added, ""Behaviors have changed.""
Starting in January, McCarthy said, the Army will change the way it approves incentive fee payments to its private landlords to ensure that firms do not profit from homes left in disrepair.
The Army has placed four-star General Gus Perna, who heads the Army Materiel Command, in charge of personally approving all incentive fees paid to the housing partners, which can be worth millions of dollars each year.
""I have one metric: Make sure our families live in the best base housing possible,"" Perna said.
Housing problems also have plagued U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force bases, often stemming from landlord neglect, shoddy construction and lax military oversight.
A recent Reuters report described how an Air Force landlord falsified maintenance records to help it win incentive fees. [Read the story https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-maintenance]
Since the late 1990s, nearly all family housing on domestic U.S. military bases has been privatized. Developers and property managers who oversee the homes hold 50-year contracts worth billions of dollars. But the privatization program gave families little recourse to challenge landlords, who can deduct rent from military paychecks of service members. Now, the Army is holding regular town hall meetings to let residents air concerns. Other service branches have followed suit.
Some landlords have committed to new housing investments. Rhode Island-based Corvias, among the Army's top partners, recently arranged $325 million in lending to launch upgrades, McCarthy said. Some $100 million is targeted for Fort Bragg in North Carolina, the most populous U.S. base, where residents have cited mold and leaks.
""A lot of work remains,"" McCarthy said. ""We just want families to know we're going to get out of this."""
505,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Roku Jumps as Macquarie Says Users Could Triple,"Investing.com –  Roku  surged on Wednesday after Macquarie upgraded its outlook on the streaming giant on expectations that a move into international markets could see its user base triple within the next three years.
Macquarie upgraded its rating on  Roku  to outperform from neutral and raised its price target on the stock to $130 from $110, sending shares of Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) soaring around 8%.
With Roku already established in the U.S. domestic market, the road to pick up more users may lie abroad as the shift to connected television – a trend well underway in the U.S. – catches on internationally, according to Macquarie.
Roku can grow its user base by 200% to 300% to more than 70 million active accounts by 2022 from 31 million currently, the bank estimated.
The potential uptick in user growth would bolster the company’s financial performance, with Macquarie estimating that 72 million more subscribers by 2022 could drive platform revenue to $2.3 billion and generate total revenue of $2.7 billion.
That is more than double the company’s 2019 guidance for revenue in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.095 billion.
The thumbs up from Macquarie cooled concerns somewhat about the threat of rising competition to Roku from bigger companies, with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) rolling out its Xfinity Flex streaming box and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) set launch its Portal TV streaming device on Nov. 5.
The concerns caused the shares to drop more than 44% from a Sept. 9 peak of $176.55 to a low of $98.08 on Sept. 27. The share have risen 19% since.
 
As a result, Roku is up 280% for the year and has an average price target of $131, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian food processor BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) confirmed on Wednesday that its plant in Abu Dhabi was being audited and that Saudi Arabia had restricted buying of some of its products, but it was still supplying Gulf markets.
BRF, which did not immediately name the auditing body involved, said the restrictions to sell to Saudi Arabia affect only a fraction of its business in the Gulf region.
The Abu Dhabi audit concerns the added value of the plant's processed meat sales, a company spokeswoman told Reuters, adding that it has tax incentives which are based on these.
BRF said some 90% of the halal meat it sells in the region is fresh and therefore not affected by the restrictions, which were first reported by Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico.
For meat to satisfy halal standards, an animal has to be slaughtered in accordance with certain rules. 
The Abu Dhabi plant remains open during the audit process to serve other markets, BRF said, and supply to the Gulf region is guaranteed by its regional inventory.

In the second quarter, BRF said it sold 298,000 tonnes of chicken in the halal market, of which 40,000 tonnes were processed. Of the 40,000 tonnes of processed products sold in the second quarter by BRF, about 25% was destined to Saudi Arabia, company filings show.

(Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Wednesday on the back of gains in technology stocks, as investor sentiment was boosted by reports indicating an ease in trade tensions between the United States and China ahead of pivotal talks on Thursday.
China was still open to agreeing to a partial trade deal with the United States, despite the inclusion of top Chinese artificial intelligence startups in a trade blacklist, according to a Bloomberg report.
Separately, the Financial Times said Beijing was offering to increase its annual purchases of U.S. agricultural products.
Shares in  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose about 1% and were among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 (SPX). The technology sector (SPLRCT) rose 1.08%.
Chipmakers with a sizable exposure to China also gained, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX) up 1.45%.
""The reality of what we can actually expect from these talks is for both sides to come to a truce. If they just called a time-out, a detente, then the markets would celebrate that,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
Trade tensions, intensifying efforts to impeach President Donald Trump and signs of slowing economic growth rocked equity markets in October, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes off more than 2% since the end of September.
Rising geopolitical risks have also not offered investors any respite. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday said a military operation targeting Kurdish fighters in northeast Syrian had begun.
A sharp contraction in U.S. manufacturing data, as well as a dismal reading on business activity last week has raised bets of a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged openness to further rate cuts on Tuesday, repeating that the central bank would act ""as appropriate"" amid an economy that he said was likely to continue to expand.
At 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the central bank is due to release minutes from its September meeting.

Energy stocks (SPNY) also gained 1.3%, tracking an increase in oil prices.
Investors will now turn their eye to the third-quarter earnings season, which begins next week with U.S. banks reporting, to gauge the health of the domestic economy.
Analysts expect the worst quarterly profit performance since 2016, with earnings for S&P 500 companies estimated to fall 3.1% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hungarian energy firm MOL (BU:MOLB) is in talks to acquire Chevron's (N:CVX) stake in a giant oilfield in Azerbaijan for more than $2 billion, according to three banking and industry sources involved in the process.
Both  Chevron  and its larger U.S. rival  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) are seeking to sell their stakes in the BP-operated Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in the Caspian Sea. This marks the retreat of the U.S. majors from the central Asian state after 25 years as they refocus on domestic production.
MOL was initially interested in both oil companies' stakes in the field but decided to bid only for Chevron's 9.57% holding, the sources told Reuters.
Chevron and MOL both declined to comment.
The discussions come as the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is seeking to develop closer relations with central Asian countries.
Exxon continues to seek a buyer for its 6.8% stake in the field. The sale process is being run by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML), according to the banking sources.
""Exxon Mobil is testing market interest for its non-operated producing assets in Azerbaijan. We continually review our assets for their contribution toward meeting the company's operating needs, financial objectives and their potential value to others,"" Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said.
BAML declined to comment.
In a presentation earlier this year, MOL said it was seeking to maintain production of 110,000-130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day through to 2023 while adding 350 million barrels of oil and gas reserves over the same period.
MOL's upstream oil and gas production is focused in Croatia and Hungary, which account for 64% of total production. It also has production in the North Sea, Iraq and Russia."

""If there was a vote on the new #NAFTA before thanksgiving, the agreement would be defeated. Fast action would be a colossal mistake. #1u,"" the group's president, Richard Trumka, said in a tweet. 
His concerns include reservations that Mexico might not make necessary changes to ensure labor reforms, or adequately fund enforcement mechanisms, he separately said in an interview with the Washington Post, which first reported his comments. 
""If they can’t enforce their own laws, we have a real problem,"" Trumka told the Post. ""No agreement will be able to work.""
""If we can get these things fixed, we can get to yes,"" he added. ""If we can’t get them fixed, we can’t get to yes."" 
His comments echoed concerns from House Democrats, which must pass the deal secured by Republican President Donald Trump. A top Democratic lawmaker, who led a delegation to Mexico, this week said Mexico must do more to implement labor reforms.
Trump, his administration, congressional Republicans and several key business groups have been pressuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take up the measure before the Thanksgiving holiday in late November. 

Pelosi, in a letter to House Democrats on Tuesday, said they would ""continue our discussion of the USMCA.""

British Airways, owned by IAG (L:ICAG), said that the six-per-week service would begin on April 30 2020, and also promoted the flight with a British Airways Holidays offer.
Thomas Cook collapsed last month, with its UK business entering liquidation. Antalya and Dalaman in Turkey were Thomas Cook Airlines' most popular destinations for British travelers, according to data from airline database Cirium.
""Holiday makers can look forward to another option when flying to Turkey with British Airways next summer,"" said Adam Carson, BA's managing director of Gatwick.
A spokeswoman for British Airways said that the route announcement had been a long time coming and was not connected to Thomas Cook's failure.
But its collapse has seen airlines exploring how they can replace Thomas Cook's capacity to holiday destinations or buy its slots at airports like Gatwick or Manchester.
Turkey's Tourism Minister said last month that easyJet and Dart Group's Jet2.com would join BA in boosting their flight numbers to Turkey, adding that Turkey will be able to make up for the shortfall in tourist numbers after Thomas Cook's failure.
EasyJet (L:EZJ) Chief Executive Johan Lundgren has said the airline is looking at Thomas Cook's assets, although it is not interested in buying Condor, Thomas Cook's German airline, which is still operating and has been offered a bridging loan by the German government.
A spokesman for AlixPartners, which is handling the liquidation of Thomas Cook's UK airline and tour operator, was not immediately available to comment on whether there had been bids for Thomas Cook's airport slots.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has expressed interest in taking on some of Thomas Cook's leased Airbus planes and pilots, but also said that the airline group is not interested in taking on Condor."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's  Reliance Industries  Ltd's (NS:RELI) telecom arm Jio said on Wednesday it will charge its customers for voice calls made through its network to other operators as it racks up fees to rivals.
The move goes back on a promise Jio made in 2016 to keep all voice calls free. Operators such as Jio have to pay fees when calls are made from one network to another, to cover the use of a rival's network. Jio's rivals are  Bharti Airtel  Ltd (NS:BRTI) and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) Idea Ltd (NS:VODA).
India's telecom regulator TRAI said in 2016 that it planned to reduce the so-called Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC) to zero from 6 paise (0.13 cents) per minute by January 2020 as it had envisaged that by then most of India's voice traffic would have moved to 4G, therefore substantially bringing down the cost.
However, as 70% of India's telecom subscribers are still not on 4G, TRAI is considering continuing the IUC charges, thwarting Reliance's plans to continue giving customers free voice calls.
""So far, in the last three years Jio has paid nearly Rs.13,500 crore (135 billion rupees) as net IUC charges to the other operators,"" Jio said in the statement.
Reliance, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, invested some $40 billion to launch Jio three years ago. It was India's first company to offer free voice calls, chiefly because it was the only company which was offering voice over 4G data.
Ambani's foray into the telecoms sector shook the industry, leading rivals to cut prices, shut up shop or merge.
Jio has gained 340 million customers by offering cut-throat data prices but has had to pay a high fee to its rivals because they have more customers.
""For all recharges done by Jio customers starting today, calls made to other mobile operators will be charged at the prevailing IUC rate of 6 paise (0.13 cents) per minute,"" Jio said in a statement on Wednesday.
Ambani had said at the company's 2016 annual general meeting (AGM) that he intended to keep all voice calls free.
At the latest AGM in August Asia's richest man said he intended to make Reliance net debt free by 2021.
Analysts estimate that for the full year ending in March 2020 Jio would have to pay up to 20 billion rupees in IUC charges, denting its operating income."

NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) said on Tuesday it was reviewing its involvement in Megvii Technology Ltd's planned initial public offering after the U.S. government placed the Chinese artificial intelligence firm on a human rights blacklist.
The Trump administration said on Monday that Megvii and seven other Chinese companies were targeted because they were implicated in Beijing's repression of Muslim minority populations in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in the far west of the country.
In an emailed statement in response to a request for comment on the Alibaba-backed Megvii IPO, Goldman said it was ""evaluating in light of the recent developments"". 
Sources had previously told Reuters the listing was scheduled for Hong Kong in the fourth quarter and might raise as much as $1 billion.
Other U.S. companies involved with the blacklisted Chinese firms, whether as investors or as underwriters, are also likely to re-evaluate their relationships, risk consultants and Silicon Valley lawyers said.
Goldman is a joint sponsor of the Megvii IPO, alongside  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), which both declined to comment.
Megvii declined to comment on Goldman's statement but said that it was in close contact with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange about its IPO plans and would continue to monitor developments.
Goldman had thoroughly evaluated the Megvii deal before initially signing onto it using its usual due diligence process, a person familiar with the matter said.
Known for its facial recognition platform Face++, Megvii will become the first Chinese AI firm to go public if the deal goes ahead. 
The company provides facial recognition and other AI technology to governments and companies including  Alibaba  (N:BABA), Ant Financial,  Lenovo Group Ltd  (HK:0992) and Huawei.
MUSLIM MISTREATMENT
The U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday barred eight companies, as well as 20 Chinese government entities, from buying U.S. technology without U.S. government approval. 
That will include high-powered computer chips made by U.S. companies such as Nvidia (O:NVDA), Intel (O:INTC) and Qualcomm (O:QCOM), which are considered critical for building and operating many AI systems.
The government said the entities were ""implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups"".
Megvii said it ""strongly objects"" to being added to the blacklist and there were ""no grounds"" for the designation. In a statement, it said around 1% of revenues were derived from Xinjiang in 2018 and none in the six months ended June 30.
It added that a May 2019 report from Human Rights Watch (HRW) on a surveillance app in Xinjiang had implicated Megvii's Face++, but in a corrected and reissued report, HRW did not highlight Megvii's name.
On Tuesday, the U.S. government imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslims in Xinjiang.
U.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs, and members of other largely Muslim minority groups, have been detained in camps in the remote region.
Beijing denies any mistreatment at the camps, which it says provide vocational training to help stamp out religious extremism and teach new work skills.
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who has been seeking to spotlight both the easy access that Chinese companies have been given to U.S. markets and human rights abuses in Xinjiang, said the government's move had been long overdue. 
""We should continue to do more to hold Chinese government and Communist Party officials accountable for potential crimes against humanity being committed in Xinjiang,"" he said in a statement.
""PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK""
In recent years, Chinese and some foreign investors have poured money into startups that specialize in facial and voice recognition software, as well as other surveillance equipment and software. They have been buoyed by China's plans to build a ubiquitous CCTV surveillance network.
Another company on the U.S. government's blacklist, SenseTime, is among the world's most highly valued artificial intelligence firms and counts marquee U.S. technology investors Tiger Global and Silver Lake Partners among its backers. Fidelity, the U.S. mutual fund firm, is also a SenseTime investor, along with Qualcomm.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology said it will review its relationship with SenseTime, the first company to join the U.S. school's research effort into human and machine intelligence.
MIT will review all of existing relationships with organizations on the blacklist and ""modify any interactions as necessary,"", a spokeswoman said in an email.
Risk consultants say that investors and underwriters have jumped into the sector without fully assessing the dangers both to their reputations and to the valuations of the companies concerned.
""There has been a dearth of adequate due diligence performed on these companies from both a national security and a human rights perspective,"" said Roger Robinson, president and CEO of Washington DC-based risk consultancy RWR Advisory Group, and a former senior director of international economic affairs at the National Security Council.
He said that investors and others involved with these Chinese companies ""may well be putting themselves at risk.""
Silver Lake, Tiger Global and Qualcomm all declined to comment. Fidelity didn't immediately return a call seeking a comment.
""There will be a judgment call as to whether any U.S. investor would want to be associated with such businesses,"" said Rocky Lee, managing partner of the Silicon Valley office of law firm King & Wood Mallesons. 

""I believe you will see some 'quiet' exiting by U.S. funds and possibly LPs, at least those U.S. investors who feel strongly that owning companies engaging in these activities are either immoral or politically incorrect.""

(Reuters) - Biotechnology start-up Ginkgo Bioworks said on Wednesday that it had raised a $350 million fund to more easily invest in spinout ventures that use its bio-engineering technology in a variety of industries that are just starting to use cutting edge biology.
Dubbed the Ferment Fund, the investment vehicle will invest in two to three companies a year, Ginkgo Chief Executive Officer Jason Kelly said in an interview. Ginkgo hopes such investments will help increase the use of its technology.Ginkgo has used this strategy in the past. In 2017, it formed a joint venture with  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) to develop bacteria that can perform similar functions to fertilizers without the associated pollution. Earlier this year, it launched Motif Foodworks, a company developing meat-free foods with investment from agricultural merchant Louis Dreyfus Co. General Atlantic, Viking Global Investors, and Bill Gates' investment firm Cascade Investment participated in the financing. Ginkgo is one of the world's largest privately held biotechnology firms. It works to make biological engineering cheaper and more accessible, particularly in fields where biotechnology is not yet widespread, by serving as a platform that allows customers to bypass the expensive overhead associated with doing their own scientific research.
This includes large corporations working in industries such as agriculture, cosmetics, foods, and textiles, sectors where biotechnology could have useful applications but where its use is in early stages.""As computers got cheaper, a whole host of applications became accessible. We think the same thing is true for biology"" Kelly said. ""The big thing we’re tying to accomplish now is build an ecosystem for people to build apps essentially for cells."" The new fund follows a $290 million funding round the company completed in September, which brought its total financing to $719 million and its valuation to $4 billion.
Despite the large amount of investment for a biotechnology company, Kelly said Ginkgo has no immediate plans to go public and hopes to have several successful spinouts first. ""What we want to be able to tell public investors is that we are the platform to program cells,” he said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) on Wednesday extended cancellations of Boeing 737 MAX flights through Jan. 15, running contrary to the U.S. planemaker's promises that the grounded jets would be flying again before the year-end.
The largest U.S. airline, which had previously canceled about 140 flights a day through Dec. 3, upped its estimate for the impact of the groundings on third-quarter pre-tax profit to $140 million, $15 million more than a previous estimate.
Its shares, down about 16% in a rough year for airlines, rose, however, on the company's statement that lower fuel costs had boosted margins in the third quarter. Boeing (N:BA) shares, buffetted this week by conflicting signals on European regulators' attitude to the MAX, were also marginally higher. 
In July, American said full-year profit would be reduced by about $400 million if the MAX remained grounded through Nov. 2, and that figure is likely to increase now with a spillover effect into 2020.
Boeing's sales numbers on Tuesday also showed that by the end of September it had delivered only half the number of aircraft it did in the same period of 2018.
Regulators are still reviewing proposed software changes to the grounded plane with no certain timetable for the jet's return.
American, which canceled 9,475 flights in the third quarter, said it expects to gradually resume MAX flights starting Jan. 16, adding that software updates could lead to the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) ""recertification of the aircraft later this year and resumption of commercial service in January 2020.""
The FAA said Wednesday it was ""following a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 Max to passenger service. The FAA will lift the aircraft's prohibition order when it is deemed safe to do so.""
REVIEW
The fast-selling 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since mid-March while Boeing updates flight control software at the center of two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people within a span of five months.
Among other U.S. airlines that operate the MAX, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has canceled flights through Jan. 5 and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) until Dec. 19.
An ongoing regulatory safety review means a key 737 MAX certification test flight is unlikely before November, Reuters reported Tuesday. Boeing has repeatedly said it hopes to resume flights in the fourth quarter, which began on Oct. 1.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in September the agency would need about a month following the yet-to-be scheduled certification test flight before the planes could return to service.
Boeing plans to revise the 737 MAX software to take input from both of its angle-of-attack sensors in the anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes and has added additional safeguards. Boeing is also addressing a flaw discovered in the software architecture of the 737 MAX flight-control system that involves using and receiving input from the plane's two flight control computers rather than one.
Meanwhile, airlines that had purchased the fuel-efficient MAX have canceled thousands of monthly flights as they scramble to meet demand with slimmer fleets, eating in to profit and hurting some growth plans.
On Monday, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association sued Boeing alleging that the planemaker ""deliberately misled"" the airline and pilots about its 737 MAX aircraft. The grounding of the 737 MAX has wiped out more than 30,000 Southwest Airlines flights, causing over $100 million in lost wages for pilots, the union said. Boeing said the suit is ""meritless.""

Fort Worth, Texas-based American, with 24 MAX jets at the time of the grounding and dozens more on order, said it expects to resume about 20 MAX flights a day in mid-January and plans to slowly return the MAX into commercial service throughout January and into February.

Links of London was founded in 1990, offering unisex jewelry and lifestyle accessories, with luxury products designed after London's art, music, and film scenes at the time.
Links of London said on its website it was unable to process any online sales, but directed people to its stores.
""The Company has had to contend with difficult trading conditions that have impacted the whole retail sector,"" joint administrator Matt Smith said in a statement.
Smith added that the directors had been seeking alternative solutions, including a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), refinancing or sale, but were unable to ink such a deal.
CVAs allow retailers to avoid insolvency by offloading unwanted stores and securing lower rents on others and reach a compromise with creditors. They have been adopted by other British retailers including fashion chain New Look.
Britain's retail sector is still reeling from the collapse of well known names such as Debenhams, music store HMV and department store House of Fraser.
Deloitte said it will continue to run Links of London and will explore options for a sale. It also said no job losses were being announced at this stage and the company's international operations were not directly affected.

LONDON (Reuters) - A shortage of aluminum in China as domestic supplies fall has boosted prices in Shanghai, which are outperforming those on the London Metal Exchange where weaker demand in the rest of world is reflected, a divergence expected to dominate for some time.
Benchmark aluminum on the London Metal Exchange  (LME) hit its lowest since January 2017 at $1,704.85 a tonne earlier this month, a drop of 12% since March when the trade dispute between the United States and China escalated.
Prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SAFc1) (ShFE) between March and the middle of September rose nearly 8% to 14,600 yuan ($2,048.55) and are currently around 14,000 yuan. Aluminum is widely used in the transport and packaging industries.
(GRAPHIC - Aluminum prices in London and Shanghai: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6834/6816/Aluminium%20prices.png) 
""Normally the disconnect would not last as China would export less,"" said Citi analyst Tracy Liao.
That would normally mean more aluminum for local consumption, lowering prices. But demand from Chinese aluminum product manufacturers is also rising as they take market share from rivals in the rest of the world, keeping Shanghai prices buoyant. 
""A price disconnect between the LME and ShFE for a couple of quarters won't change that dynamic. The disconnect would have to last for longer for the supply chain to adapt,"" Liao. 
(GRAPHIC - China aluminum exports: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6835/6817/China%20ali%20exports.png)
China accounts for about 55% of global aluminum supplies, estimated at around 65 million tonnes this year. 
Data from the International Aluminium Institute shows China's aluminum production fell to near 21 million tonnes between January and August this year, down 13% from the same period in 2018.
Analysts expect the gap between new supply and demand in China to be covered by stocks of about seven million tonnes accumulated since 2010.
""The deficit is a new development. China has had chronic overcapacity and surpluses since 2009,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Edgardo Gelsomino, adding that year's was the only other deficit since 2001. 
""Globally the deficit this year will be about one million tonnes but the reality is that most of that deficit is in China. However they have a big cushion with stocks.""
The inventory draw in China can be seen in the stocks of aluminum in warehouses monitored by ShFE , which at around 314,000 tonnes are less than a third of May's levels of above 990,000 tonnes.
(GRAPHIC - Shanghai aluminum stocks vs prices: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6833/6815/SHFE%20stocks.png)
China's aluminum deficit is mainly due to closures of about 3 million tonnes of production in the second half of last year, with more added this year, according to Citi's Liao.
These include Xinfa Group, one of China's top aluminum producers, shutting down a production line after an explosion at a plant in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang.
Damaged facilities belonging to China Hongqiao Group (HK:1378), the world's top aluminum producer, after Typhoon Lekima wreaked havoc in the smelting heartland of Shandong also contributed to lower supplies.
Global aluminum stocks are expected by Wood Mackenzie to end the year at 12 million tonnes, which would be about 66 days of consumption compared with an average around 60 days.
""The global market is not short of metal,"" Gelsomino said.

Wood Mackenzie expects global demand to grow 1.1% this year, down from 3.6% last year and Chinese demand to rise 2.9% from 6.1% last year.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 09:41AM ET</span>",New investor Del Vecchio challenges Mediobanca's strategy,"By Claudia Cristoferi and Gianluca Semeraro
MILAN (Reuters) - Eyewear tycoon Leonardo Del Vecchio on Wednesday urged Mediobanca to build up its investment banking business in a challenge to venerable merchant bank's strategy, nearly a month after he snapped up a 7% stake that stunned corporate Italy.
Del Vecchio said a new business plan due in November should rely less on contributions from its consumer credit business and from its most prized asset - insurer Generali (MI:GASI).
""I expect a new business plan that ... builds a future as an investment bank, able to play a leading role in Italy and Europe,"" said Del Vecchio, the executive chairman of Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX).
Three sources close to the matter said Del Vecchio aims, by building a stake in Mediobanca and putting pressure on its management, to have more control over the future of Generali, including through possible cross-border deals.
Mediobanca effectively controls Generali, Europe's third largest insurer, with a 13% stake. Del Vecchio owns 4.9% of Generali, often seen as a potential target for foreign rivals.
Mediobanca, which Chief Executive Alberto Nagel has led since 2008, is an outperformer in Italy's sluggish financial industry and in its last fiscal year booked its strongest ever revenues.
Its wealth management and consumer businesses accounted for 60% of revenues in the year to end-June, compared with 25% for investment banking.
But a person familiar with Del Vecchio's thinking said he believes the bank could be managed better, noting that Generali accounts for about 30% of operating profit.
The person said Del Vecchio wanted to change Mediobanca's governance rules to ensure he will have a say in the choice of the next chief executive when Nagel's mandate comes up for renewal next year.
The bank's bylaws currently state that the CEO must be picked from among managers who have been with the bank for at least three years, effectively excluding outsiders.
To change the criteria, Del Vecchio would need the backing of two-thirds of shareholders. So far, Mediobanca's other top investors have not taken sides and most analysts have praised Nagel's tenure.
""Mediobanca's CEO has steered the company in the transformation of recent years ... with better profitability than the system average, higher revenue growth, lower risk profile versus peers and solid capital,"" Citi analysts said.
""Never change a winning horse.""
Del Vecchio also blames Nagel, and Generali's CEO, Philippe Donnet, for what he sees as Generali's poor share price performance compared to rivals like Allianz (DE:ALVG) or  Axa  (PA:AXAF), the sources said.
While he would favor a tie-up with a foreign group, he wants to ensure Generali's Italian identity is preserved.
Del Vecchio's bold move on Mediobanca has echoes of the corporate intrigue in the so-called salotto buono, or fine drawing room, the informal club that has pulled the strings in corporate Italy since 1945 and had Mediobanca at its center.
Though its influence has diminished in the wake of the global financial crisis, Mediobanca still plays a powerful role in Italian corporate life.
One source said Del Vecchio informed Nagel of his 580 million euro ($637 million) investment just hours before issuing a statement on Sept. 17.
""Del Vecchio is unpredictable, no one knows what he's up to,"" said a banker who has worked with him. ""It's like walking in the dark,"" said another person close to the situation.
Del Vecchio, who grew up in an orphanage and went on to become Italy's second richest person, has worked closely with Nagel for years.
Mediobanca advised Del Vecchio when Luxottica merged with French lens maker Essilor in 2018 to create EssilorLuxottica, the world's biggest eye-wear manufacturer.
But the relationship between Del Vecchio and Nagel has soured in recent months, the sources said, after Mediobanca helped to block an investment the tycoon wanted to make in a Milanese hospital."

The news comes a day after Japan's second-largest automaker named Senior Vice President Makoto Uchida as its next chief executive, picking an outsider who joined mid-career.
The company said the action was to enable Nada to focus on important tasks including the forthcoming legal action.
Nada, who was under pressure to leave the company following the pay scandal involving Ghosn, was named senior adviser overseeing special projects. He will report to acting Chief Executive Officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi.
Nissan has been shaken by the arrest of Ghosn last year on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies, and the more recent exit of previous CEO Hiroto Saikawa after he admitted to being improperly overpaid."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starting next year, there will be a lot more ""green"" in those brown UPS delivery trucks.
 United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) on Wednesday announced plans to buy more than 6,000 natural gas-powered trucks over three years and step up purchases of renewable natural gas (RNG) as part of a new $450 million investment to reduce the environmental impact of its 123,000-vehicle fleet. 
The latest move from the world's largest package delivery firm comes as utility companies, investors and others seek to expand the use of RNG - which is derived from decomposing organic matter such as cow manure on dairy farms, discarded food in landfills and human waste in water treatment plants - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
RNG and natural gas from fossil fuel are both methane and can be used interchangeably. Natural gas vehicles are less polluting than those that run on unleaded gasoline or diesel, but RNG has the added benefits of replacing fossil fuel and preventing naturally occurring methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - from being released into the environment. 
UPS's latest effort ""allows for seamless integration of a truly renewable, organic fuel source into the fleet,"" Mike Whitlatch, UPS's vice president of global energy and procurement, told Reuters. 
UPS expects to use 31.9 million gasoline gallon equivalents (GGE) of RNG this year. As of this month, it has agreed to purchase 230 million GGE of RNG over the next seven years, a commitment that UPS says makes it the transportation industry's largest user of RNG. 
""We provide one large-single user to help de-risk (RNG) projects,"" Whitlatch said of UPS. 
The Atlanta-based company's new vehicle purchases will begin next year and add to the roughly 10,000 alternative fuel or advanced technology delivery vehicles already in use by UPS. 
Norway-based Hexagon Composites' Agility Fuel Solutions will equip UPS's new brown delivery trucks, semi trucks and terminal tractors to run on natural gas.
UPS customer and rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) last month pledged to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from startup Rivian Automotive LLC and have them all on the road by 2024. Amazon's independent delivery partners currently use about 30,000 conventional fuel vans. 
UPS's fleet of planes and trucks created 14.6 million metric tonnes of CO2e, a standard unit for measuring carbon footprints, while moving 5.2 billion packages in 2018. 

Amazon, which has not yet released data on its carbon footprint, last month said it would be net carbon neutral by 2040.

The Bank of Italy deputy governor and veteran of more than three decades had been the only candidate proposed to replace Benoit Coeure, who will step down on Dec. 31.
""The Eurogroup gave its support to the candidacy of Fabio Panetta for the position of the new member of the ECB's executive board,"" the ministers said on Twitter.
The 60-year-old economist had previously helped engineer some of the ECB's non-conventional tools, such as a long-term liquidity facility to banks known as LTRO (Long Term Refinancing Operation).
Once formally appointed by EU leaders at a summit in December, Panetta will serve a non-renewable eight-year term at the ECB.
Each of the euro zone's three biggest economies -- Germany, France and Italy -- have traditionally had one representative on the executive board, and the Italian seat falls open on Oct. 31 with the departure of ECB President Mario Draghi.
The ministers also started the process of choosing a replacement for Sabine Lautenschlager of Germany, who will step down from the ECB's board at the end of the month.
Germany will be expected to nominate another candidate, probably a woman, for the job by the end of October.

533,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 08:52AM ET</span>",Stock Investors Hedged for a Crisis Risk a New ‘Pain Trade’,"(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors are hedged to the teeth, anticipating a looming crisis from fraught U.S.-China trade talks, recession risk or political bombs in Washington. That’s making it dirt cheap to bet on the bull market defying the odds.
Traders in S&P 500 Index options have rarely been this bearishly positioned, with nearly 2.5 puts outstanding for every bullish call. The cost of hedging, or skew, has spiked to one-year highs across multiple equity benchmarks and options tenors, according to an Oct. 7 note from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
But for investors optimistic there’s a way out of the tangled trade mess, bullish on the U.S. economy or sanguine about impeachment risk, opportunity awaits.
“Given the defensive positioning right now, we think the pain trade is to the upside,” Mandy Xu, chief equity derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse, wrote. “If we get a positive turn of events -- whether it’s on trade, politics, or economics -- the upside rally could catch investors off guard.”
Stocks were pummeled Tuesday after Beijing said it strongly opposed a U.S. decision to blacklist some of its technology firms and Bloomberg reported the Trump administration is moving ahead with discussions about restricting capital flows. For many, it was the kind of day that justified skepticism about high-level talks in Washington to end a protectionist showdown with China.
“There’s a bit of a fool-me-once,” Xu said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “We’re now onto the 13th round of trade talks, and investors have significantly dampened their expectations.”
But with a mercurial U.S. president and talk of a mini-deal, there’s always the possibility that the bearish bets are overextended. S&P 500 futures rallied on Wednesday on news that China is still open to agreeing a partial trade deal with the U.S.
“Everyone’s so focused on the left tail -- markets going down -- no one’s really concerned about the right tail,” Xu said in the interview. “If you are concerned about the right tail, looking at those upside calls right now, it’s a good trade.”
Trade isn’t the only risk out there, with President Donald Trump vowing to stonewall the impeachment probe by House Democrats and a recent string of gloomy data pointing up the fragility of the global economy.
Still, not every market metric shows outright pessimism. A basket of trade-sensitive stocks outperformed the S&P 500 between mid-August and mid-September, and remains above the lows seen in May and early August, both periods when the trade war escalated.
“We believe that the surprise could be more on the upside than on the downside,” strategists at Unigestion wrote in a note. “Any rally in the equity and credit space could trigger an unwinding of hedges and amplify the positive trend, which could lead to equity indices testing previous highs.”
UBS Wealth Management for one is weighing the possibility that a better-than-expected outcome in U.S.-China negotiations powers stocks higher.
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at the world’s biggest private bank, told a Bloomberg Invest conference Tuesday that his firm is looking at bullish call options to “play the chance we get some kind of outsized trade deal.”"

535,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",PG&E Cuts Power to a Half Million in Epic California Blackout,"(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp., the California utility giant forced into bankruptcy by two years of devastating wildfires, is carrying out the biggest planned blackout yet to keep power lines from sparking more blazes. Cutoffs began overnight Wednesday, with the first phase impacting about 513,000 customers.
The company began cutting power in an orchestrated shutoff that will eventually plunge almost 800,000 customers into darkness across Northern California, including parts of Napa Valley and Oakland. Altogether, more than 2.7 million people may be affected, based on city estimates and the average size of a U.S. household.
The shutoff is a key strategy for preventing its power lines from sparking another deadly -- and costly -- conflagration. Never before have California utilities intentionally cut power to so many people for their own safety. Electricity will be go out in cities including Oakland and Berkeley, but San Francisco and Silicon Valley are expected to be excluded.
“This is unprecedented in terms of what all of us are facing as a community,” PG&E Vice President Sumeet Singh said at a media briefing Tuesday night. “We are doing everything we can to minimize the impact on our customers’ lives.”
The shutoff will occur in three phases. The second stage will occur around noon and affect 234,000. The last phase is being considered for the southernmost portions of PG&E’s service area, impacting 42,000.
“There is a pretty significant fire risk across California,” said Marc Chenard, a senior branch forecaster with the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “The biggest threat looks to be today and continuing into the day tomorrow.”
As California’s climate warms and dries, the massive blackouts could become a new, annual ordeal. The shutoff warning came two years to the day after wildfires tore through Napa and Sonoma counties, and 11 months after one of PG&E’s transmission lines triggered the Camp Fire, which leveled the town of Paradise and killed 86 people.
“We have a grid that was built to manage a set of circumstances that don’t exist anymore,” said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University. “We are having to adapt to new circumstances brought about by climate change.”
He estimated PG&E’s blackout for two days could have an economic impact of as much as $2.6 billion, using a planning tool developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
The cities affected warned residents to brace for six days without power. California’s transportation agency said it was preparing to close two major tunnels in the region due to the loss of power.
Meanwhile, Edison International’s Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison utility said it was weighing cutting power to 106,000 homes and businesses, most of them in the mountains east of Los Angeles.
Within the blackout zones, residents were rushing Tuesday to buy food, water and electric generators -- almost as if a hurricane were approaching. Stores including Rite Aid and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) across Oakland had run out of flashlights and most batteries. Public officials tried to assure residents that essential services would still be available, while asking them be prepared regardless.
The section of PG&E’s website where people can check their home’s status was so inundated that it was inaccessible for much of Tuesday afternoon.
‘No One is Happy’
Governor Gavin Newsom, at a public appearance Tuesday, called PG&E’s actions warranted while acknowledging the massive disruption the blackout represented.
“No one is happy about it, no one is satisfied, but no one should be surprised, because we have been anticipating this moment for a year,” Newsom said. The blackout, he said, “shows that PG&E finally woke up to their responsibility to keep people safe.”
State Senator Jerry Hill, a frequent PG&E critic, called the blackout an overreaction. “I think they need to spend the billions they’ve already received to harden the system,” he said. “I think they’re in crisis and will do anything to prevent another wildfire.”
The region’s main commuter rail system -- Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART -- said it expected no impact on its electrified trains or its stations, in part because it had already deployed backup generators to stations that needed them.
Similarly, the utility that supplies water to 1.4 million residents east of San Francisco Bay said it had stationed generators at its pumping stations and treatment plants, but it asked residents to conserve water just in case.
“We are here to assure Oaklanders that the city of Oakland is fully prepared for the potential planned outage,” Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said at a Tuesday press conference. “This is an evolving world where these extreme weather conditions that we see from climate change are happening, and we have got to adjust.”
Sonoma County and the city of Santa Rosa, which were hit hard by the wine country fires in 2017, declared local emergencies and called on Newsom to declare a state emergency with the shutoff.
Generators, Batteries
In Emeryville, just across the Bay Bridge from San Francisco, the  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) was nearly sold out of back-up generators by Tuesday morning. Andy Kovacevic of Oakland snapped up one of the last units. The 73-year-old said he had rushed down to the store after he got a robo-call from Alameda County, warning him that he could be without power for days.
“I’m not happy about it,” Kovacevic said. “I’m not sure it’s really necessary.” The generator was going to set him back about $1,000, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - How investors can pull cash from open-ended funds will be updated in December, following the high-profile suspension of money manager Neil Woodford's equity fund, the Bank of England said.
In the clearest sign yet that changes to how funds are designed are on the cards, the BoE's Financial Policy Committee published principles on Wednesday to reduce ""incentives"" for investors to redeem before others, which can trigger fire sales.
""The committee continued to judge that the mismatch between redemption terms and the liquidity of some funds' assets had the potential to become a systemic risk,"" the committee said in a statement.
Woodford had to suspend his flagship fund in June, trapping thousands of retail investors. The fund offered daily redemptions to customers, but it ran out of cash because some of the assets were unlisted and could not be quickly sold.
The BoE and the Financial Conduct Authority are looking at the illiquidity mismatch in open-ended funds that contain hard-to-trade assets and offer daily withdrawals.
""The progress of this review will be reported in the December Financial Stability Report (FSR),"" the FPC said. The FSR is due to be published on Dec. 10.
The committee said that incentives for investors to redeem ahead of others in the fund should be reduced through ""greater consistency in the design of the funds"".
This would be between their liquidity - or how quickly assets can be sold - and redemption frequency or length of notice period, as well as the price offered to redeeming investors. Investors often suffer a price discount if they withdraw when the fund is struggling to sell assets.
""Consistency between these features of a fund could ensure that investors redeeming their share could do so without placing a cost on remaining investors,"" the FPC said.
Britain, however, may not be able to introduce all the fund rule changes itself. Some will need backing from international regulators, who have already signaled scepticism over the need for an overhaul.
Open-ended funds like Woodford are regulated under European Union rules.
The FCA last week published tougher rules for funds that invest in hard-to-sell assets like property, as property funds with more than 18 billion pounds in assets under management froze shortly after the June 2016 Brexit vote.
But the new FCA rules did not cover funds like Woodford's and did not tackle fund structure, leaving that to the separate BoE and FCA review.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks gained on Wednesday as investors clung to hopes that the United States and China could yet agree some sort of trade deal, while the prospect of a last-minute Brexit agreement between the European Union and Britain seemed as remote as ever. 
Markets have begun October in a nervous mood, and this week has seen investors dump stocks on concern the U.S.-China conflict over trade and foreign policy is nowhere near a resolution and is increasingly damaging the global economy.
With a little more than three weeks until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU, both sides launched into a blame game over the lack of agreement on the terms of their divorce, giving investors more to worry about. 
But European shares managed to find a floor, with the pan-regional Euro STOXX (STOXX) extending gains after a media report said China was open to a partial trade deal with the U.S. despite the recent blacklisting of Chinese technology firms.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) strengthened 0.96%, France's CAC 40 (FCHI) 0.77% and Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) 0.6%. U.S. stock futures (ESc1) rose 0.87%, recovering some of the benchmark S&P 500's (SPX) drop on Tuesday.
""The market is reacting to news China may be open to a partial deal with the U.S. and it seems they want to avoid the increase in tariffs which will happen on Oct. 15,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, fund manager at Legal and General Investment Management. 
""But a broad agreement doesn't seem to be on the cards given the relationship between the U.S. and China seems to have deteriorated in recent weeks. It looks like the trade talks in coming days might be a bit of a waste of time."" 
Washington and Beijing are engaged in a year-long row that has expanded beyond trade policy, suggesting even more damage to a global economy that is already showing signs of slowing.
Hopes that the two sides could reach a truce this week faded after President Donald Trump's administration introduced visa restrictions on Chinese officials and added more Chinese companies to a U.S. trade blacklist.
A U.S. official said high-level trade talks would still take place on Thursday and Friday as planned, but Trump has said tariffs on Chinese imports will rise on Oct. 15 if no progress is made in the negotiations.
Oil prices snapped their losing streak and rebounded as traders bet any easing of the U.S.-China tensions would benefit global oil demand. [O/R]
The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled further interest rate cuts and the resumption of bond purchases following a recent spike in money-market rates.
BREXIT TALKS
In Europe, talks between the European Union and Britain over an agreement to cover London's departure from the EU on Oct. 31 appeared to be going nowhere.
British lawmakers have voted to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek an extension to the departure date if he cannot agree a deal, but the prospect of further prolonged political uncertainty is worrying investors.
Sterling jumped after a British newspaper report said that the EU would make a major concession in the negotiations, but the gains were quickly unwound as EU sources denied it. The pound was last down marginally on the day at $1.2214 .
Many economists say markets have already priced in the failure to reach a deal.
""In the interminably tedious EU-UK divorce process, things are getting uninteresting. Tweets are being fired. Latin quotes are being sent out. Markets did not expect a deal to be done, and so should remain indifferent (unless it looks as if a no-deal exit will be introduced in defiance of legislation),"" said UBS economist Paul Donovan.
With some semblance of risk appetite returning, the safe-haven dollar fell, shedding 0.2% against the euro to $1.0979 (EUR=).
The offshore yuan, which fell on Tuesday, recovered 0.5% to 7.1311 yuan per dollar .
Sweden's crown weakened to another decade low against the euro (EURSEK=). Scandinavian currencies have been buffeted by concerns about a global trade slowdown, and the Norwegian crown  (EURNOK=) this week hit a more than decade low.
In bond markets, U.S. Treasury (US10YT=RR) and euro zone government bond yields (DE10YT=RR) ticked higher as investors happy to take on some more risk sold out of safer assets. 
Spot gold prices succumbed to selling pressure and were last down at $1,501 .

Brent crude futures rallied 0.79% to $58.70 a barrel (LCOc1), reversing earlier falls. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude increased 0.8% in price to $53.05 (CLc1).

538,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 07:01AM ET</span>",GE’s Gaping Pension Deficit Is Just a Tiny Part of Companies’ $269 Billion Gap,"(Bloomberg) -- General Electric's (NYSE:GE) gaping pension deficit certainly stands out for its size. But the company is hardly the only one at risk of potentially shortchanging some of its employees come retirement.
All across corporate America, underfunded pensions have become the norm. Even now, a decade after the financial crisis, the largest plans face a shortfall of $269 billion, right about where it was 10 years ago. Years of low interest rates have largely offset gains in the stock market. Companies haven’t helped matters by lavishing money on shareholder rewards and clinging to assumptions about returns that proved to be too rosy.
The situation isn’t likely to improve any time soon, particularly if interest rates keep falling. Even though a banner year in both stocks and bonds lifted returns on the largest pensions by 12% this year, their liabilities have grown even faster, according to consulting firm Milliman. And while GE’s move to freeze benefits and set aside money will help trim its $22.4 billion pension shortfall by as much as $8 billion, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said last month that low rates could boost those same liabilities by roughly $7 billion.
In other words, unless companies take even more drastic steps, they’re currently doing little better than treading water.
“Plan sponsors are getting concerned that we’ve had a historic equity run in the market and they’re still sitting on underfunded pension positions,” said Steve Keating, managing director at BCG Pension Risk Consultants.
Part of it has to do with what’s called the discount rate, which for corporate pensions typically corresponds to yields on highly rated corporate bonds.
Simply put, the lower the discount rate, the less a plan assumes it will earn over time. That means the plan needs to set aside more money today to cover retirement benefits a company has promised to pay its employees in the years and decades to come. In August, the discount rate fell to an average of 2.95%, the lowest level in the 19-year history of Milliman’s pension funding index.
Defined benefit plans, like your traditional corporate pensions, have largely disappeared from view in the past couple of decades as companies have embraced plans like 401(k)s. Employers can opt to contribute to those plans, but it’s the employees who are responsible for choosing the right investments and are solely on the hook if those investments fare poorly.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of older employees and retirees that are collectively still owed tens of billions of dollars in benefits that companies have failed to adequately fund.
GE’s predicament underscores the scope of the problem. On Monday, the company said it would freeze pension benefits for more than 20,000 employees and set aside as much as $5 billion to cover future obligations. (For those who didn’t grow up with pensions, “freezing” benefits essentially means whatever you’ve accrued thus far is what you get from that plan, and no more, regardless of how many more years you work for that company.) And for GE, that helps reduce the amount they’ll ultimately need to pay out.
Yet at the end of 2018, GE owed benefits to at least 600,000 people worldwide, amounting to nearly $92 billion in future payouts. Globally, its pension plans had just $69 billion in assets.
To be fair, many companies probably didn’t expect interest rates, which fell to rock-bottom levels as a result of the Federal Reserve’s crisis-era monetary policies, to stay so low. Outside of brief periods during parts of 2013 and 2018, when bond yields looked like they were finally about to return to historical norms, they’ve kept falling. That’s had real-world consequences for retirees who not only rely on a fixed income, but are also living longer as well.
“Even though the equity markets have done pretty well this year, it’s been hard for them to make up ground” because of low rates, said Beth Ashmore, a managing director for retirement at Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) Plc. Despite the stock market run since the crisis, “funding levels really haven’t recovered as much as everybody would have hoped.”
While many companies have plenty of money to plug or significantly reduce their pension deficits if they wanted to right now, others do not. GE has $32 billion in cash and equivalents, enough to wipe out its deficit (setting aside, of course, its many other debt obligations.) On the other hand, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). has $6.4 billion in unfunded liabilities and just $2 billion in cash.
Some have sought to transfer their pension liabilities to life insurers. The market for single premium buyouts reached $26 billion last year, according to data from industry group Limra. Earlier this year,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). said that it struck deals with Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU). and Athene Holding Ltd. to transfer billions in pension obligations.
Others like  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). have taken advantage of low borrowing costs to finance their pension contributions in the debt markets. Chipping away at a shortfall can help companies cut back on payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a government agency that helps backstop plans. The agency has been ratcheting up rates for companies that maintain pension deficits in recent years, in an effort to get them to plug those shortfalls.
“I think CFOs, in some ways, want to take control and start to thoughtfully reduce the size of their pension plan over time,” BCG’s Keating said.
Whatever the case, it’s often the employees who end up losing out. Freezing pensions has become a more popular strategy for companies in recent years. A decade ago, about 20% of Fortune 500 companies with pension plans in place since 1998 had frozen their plans, according to Willis Towers Watson. Since then, that figure has swelled to 42%.
“In a situation of ‘corporate battlefield surgery,’ this tends to be a typical, if unfortunate, casualty,” said Julian Mitchell, an analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc."

Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel company whose shops have been a feature of British town centers for generations, collapsed last month, and its UK business went into liquidation.
Hays Travel will acquire all 555 stores and look to re-employ former employees from Thomas Cook's retail operations, Britain's Insolvency Service said in a statement. 
""This agreement ... provides re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former Thomas Cook employees, and secures the future of retail sites up and down the UK high street,"" Jim Tucker, Partner at KPMG, said.
Hays Travel is a private company, jointly owned and managed by Managing Director John Hays and Chair Irene Hays. The 40-year-old firm based in Sunderland in north-east England reached sales of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.22 billion) in 2018. 
""It is a game-changer for us, almost trebling the number of shops we have and doubling our workforce - and for the industry, which will get to keep some of its most talented people,"" John Hays said in a statement on the company's website.
Thomas Cook's collapse stranded hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers around the globe and sparked the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.
Hays Travel has already recruited 421 former Thomas Cook employees since its collapse, and have made other offers to the travel firm's former workers, the Insolvency Service said.

Britain has appointed an Official Receiver to try and realize value from Thomas Cook's assets. KPMG is overseeing the process at its retail division and aircraft maintenance companies, while insolvency practitioners from Alix Partners are managing the liquidation of its airline and tour operator.

Hanjin Philippines, a unit of South Korea's Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co Ltd (KS:097230), in January defaulted on $1.3 billion in loans, of which $900 million is owed to South Korean banks and the rest to five Philippine lenders.
Austal and Cerberus are interested in the distressed shipyard, and they have two to three weeks to formally submit a bid, receivership lawyer Rosario Bernaldo told Reuters.
""What I want to happen is that the shipyard operates again instead of being a white elephant,"" Bernaldo said, adding that Dutch and Italians firms had inquired about the facility early on.
Austal, which operates a shipbuilding facility in central Philippines, and Cerberus did not respond to requests for comment.
Hanjin Philippines' shipyard until recently employed 20,000 workers in Subic Bay, which is considered an important asset because of the its shelter, deep water and access to the South China Sea. Until 1992, Subic was home to a U.S. navy base.
The creditors are engaged in exclusive talks with a potential bidder, said Eugene Acevedo, president of mid-sized Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (PS:RCB) (RCBC). He declined to name the company given non-disclosure agreements.

(Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of California homes and businesses started to lose electric power early Wednesday as part of an unprecedented effort by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to prevent wildfires, the utility said.
Nearly 800,000 northern and central California homes and businesses can expect to lose electricity for up to several days, starting on Wednesday, PG&E said.
State investigators determined in May that PG&E transmission lines had caused last year's Camp Fire. That fire killed 85 people, making it the deadliest in California's history.
The company had already filed for bankruptcy protection by then, citing potential liabilities of more than $30 billion from the Camp Fire and the 2017 North Bay Fires.
Conditions before the fires were about the same then as they are now in the region. Gale-force winds are expected to last through midday Thursday, with gusts up to 70 miles per hour, PG&E said. Humidity is low, leaving the air extremely dry.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said ""red-flag"" warnings were posted across the entire state for what was shaping up to be the strongest wind so far this season.
Consequently, PG&E said on Tuesday it was extending a previously announced ""public safety power shutoff"" to 34 counties, more than half of all the counties in California. It's the largest such precautionary outage the utility has undertaken to date.
Once power is turned off, it cannot be restored until the winds subside, allowing the utility to inspect equipment for damage and make any repairs, PG&E said.
The first phase of the outages, affecting about 513,000 customers in northern California, began after midnight, PG&E said in an early morning release. Depending on the weather, additional outages will continue at noon, the company said.
""We're telling customers to be prepared for an outage that could last several days,"" PG&E spokeswoman Tamar Sarkissian told Reuters.
SOME OBJECT
Some consumer advocates have objected to the precautionary disruptions, saying they can harm people who need electricity for medical equipment.
But PG&E promised to open community centers in 30 locations across the planned outage zone to furnish restrooms, bottled water, battery charging and air-conditioned seating during daytime hours.

Sarkissian said PG&E had placed 45 helicopter crews and 700 extra ground personnel on standby for inspections and repairs once the wind dies down. Some equipment locations will require workers to hike into remote or mountainous areas, she said.

544,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 05:33AM ET</span>",China Open to Partial U.S. Trade Deal Despite Tech Blacklist,"(Bloomberg) -- China is still open to agreeing a partial trade deal with the U.S., an official with direct knowledge of the talks said, signaling that Beijing is focused on limiting the damage to the world’s second-largest economy.
Negotiators heading to Washington for talks starting Thursday aren’t optimistic about securing a broad agreement that would end the trade war between the two nations for good, said the official, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private.
But China would accept a limited deal as long as no more tariffs are imposed by President Donald Trump, including two rounds of higher duties set to take effect this month and in December, the official said. In return, Beijing would offer non-core concessions like purchases of agricultural products without giving in on major sticking points, the official said, without offering further details.
S&P 500 Futures rose 0.9% on the news and the offshore yuan extended gains.
The Ministry of Commerce didn’t immediately reply to faxed questions.
The latest round of trade talks come just days after the White House announced the blacklisting of Chinese technology firms over their alleged role in oppression in the far west region of Xinjiang, as well as visa bans on officials linked to the mass detention of Muslims. At the same time a fight over free speech between China and the National Basketball Association, triggered by a tweet backing Hong Kong’s protesters, showed the widening gap between the countries.
“I think there might be big breakthrough in the coming trade talks as both sides have expressed good gestures and positive signals,” said Huo Jianguo, a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now vice chairman of the China Society For World Trade Organization Studies. “The recent blacklist and sanctions from the U.S. is just another usual tactic to showcase that it has multiple tools in the trade negotiations in line with Trump’s maximum pressure policy. It is hardly surprising to us and we shouldn’t take it too seriously.”
Bloomberg News reported last month that the Trump administration has discussed offering a limited deal that would delay or even roll back some U.S. tariffs for the first time in exchange for Chinese commitments on intellectual property and agricultural purchases. Questions about the strength of the U.S. economy have lingered before Trump faces an election next year.
President Xi Jinping’s government is under pressure to stem the broadening conflict as the trade war adds to the downward forces on China’s slowing economy. At the same time, China has resisted changes to its own industrial and economic policies that could potentially weaken the Communist Party’s grip on the economy.
The trade talks have failed to make serious headway since negotiations collapsed in early May. Since then, China has ramped up its nationalist rhetoric as the U.S. has targeted national champions like Huawei Technologies Co.
The reaction of the Chinese state this week after an NBA team manager tweeted support of protesters in Hong Kong is a case in point, with broadcasters refusing to broadcast games watched by millions. China also vowed to retaliate after the U.S. took action against companies and officials it said were involved in oppressing Muslims in Xinjiang.
“The rising nationalism sentiment at home is creating hurdles for President Xi to make concessions in the upcoming trade talks with the U.S. in light of the NBA firestorm and Xinjiang sanctions,” said Suisheng Zhao, executive director of the Center for China-U.S. Cooperation at the University of Denver’s Graduate School of International Studies. “Even if China is willing to make some compromise, that space is limited.”"
545,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>",StockBeat: GVC Underlines British Bookies' Lucky Streak,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- There is life after death-by-regulation for British betting shops, it seems.
GVC Holdings (LON:GVC), the owners of the   Ladbrokes   (LON:LCL) and Coral chains of bookmakers, raised its earnings guidance for the year after a strong third quarter that showed its high street stores shrugging off new rules that crippled their business with fixed-odds betting terminals.
The regulator had cut the maximum stake on FOBT to 2 pounds from 100 amid fears that they were highly addictive and responsible for a steep rise in indebtedness, especially among low-income households.
However, it seems that customers are happy to scratch their gambling itch by walking a couple more yards to the counter. In the third quarter: sports betting at its U.K. retail outlets rose 7% in year-on-year terms – an impressive performance given that the year-earlier period included the soccer World Cup, which featured an uncharacteristically long run by the England team. 
As a result, the group raised its forecast for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to a range around 675 million pounds ($820 million), from a midpoint of 660 million earlier.
Bookies have been among the star performers over the last month in a U.K. market increasingly hobbled by Brexit fears. GVC, which rose 1.7% by 5 AM ET (0900), has now risen 9.1% in the last month, while rival Flutter Entertainment (LON:FLTRF), which owns the   Paddy Power   and Betfair chains, has risen 7.2%.
In part, that’s because the downside from the FOBT episode has not been as bad as feared. But it’s also due to optimism that both chains will cash in significantly from the liberalization of the U.S. betting market. GVC has teamed up with casino operator MGM and last month launched the BetMGM app in New Jersey – “a key milestone”, as the company called it on Wednesday.
“Our U.S. sports-betting joint venture with MGM Resorts remains very well-placed to capitalise on the U.S. sports-betting opportunity,” it added.
There was no indication from GVC that it intended to crash Flutter's agreed merger with Canada-based Stars Group, a move which analysts have said puts Flutter in pole position as regards exploiting the U.S. market.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 04:43AM ET</span>","After spurned play for LSE, Hong Kong bourse to seek deeper China embrace","By Sumeet Chatterjee and Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong stock exchange boss Charles Li ignited his unrequited overture to the  London Stock Exchange  with a riff on Romeo and Juliet as a corporate romance, and doused it in a wistful blog reference to the author of 'Alice in Wonderland'.
After this week dropping the shock $39 billion approach, will Chief Executive Li's next post outlining a strategic vision for the bourse swap British literary references for a metaphor from a Chinese classic?
Investors and analysts expect Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX) (HK:0388) to refocus its efforts - for now - on expanding its links with mainland Chinese counterparts following the collapse of its ambitions to build a global exchange platform via a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) (L:LSE).
HKEX's abortive approach was the largest withdrawn stock exchange-related mergers and acquisitions transaction ever, surpassing Deutsche Boerse's (DE:DB1Gn) $13.9 billion approach for LSE in 2016, according to Refinitiv data.
""Charles Li must have known that the LSE was a long shot,"" said Larry Tabb, founder and research chairman at U.S.-based capital markets advisory firm Tabb Group. ""So I actually think the bid was meant to demonstrate his aggressiveness to Beijing and put him in a better spot in relation to Shanghai and other exchanges throughout China.""
HKEX's approach for LSE also came against the backdrop of four months of increasingly violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Rejection by LSE managers and shareholders signaled concerns over giving control of an exchange to a buyer with close links to China, analysts said. 
""You can well imagine if Hong Kong stock exchange makes an offer for some other developing country exchange, why wouldn't you see similar (regulatory) pushback?"" said David Blennerhassett of Ballingal Investment Advisors, who publishes research on the Smartkarma website.
""This is going to curtail their global expansion. So, that means they will look inwards for their growth going forward.""
HKEX declined to provide comment on future plans for this article, but speaking at a conference in Singapore on Wednesday, HKEX Chair Laura Cha said that while she was disappointed the deal didn't go through, the approach for the LSE was just one facet of one part of HKEX's three-pronged strategy - building on the bourse's China links, focusing on technology and international ambitions. 
NOT ONLY 'CONNECT'
Hong Kong's track record for developing China-related trading links is well documented.
It has since 2014 operated the only direct stock trading link between the mainland and the rest of the world, the so-called 'Stock Connect'. In 2017, it added a 'Bond Connect' allowing international investors access to mainland debt markets. 
High on its wish list for future growth is opening a 'southbound' Bond Connect, allowing Chinese investors to trade bonds in Hong Kong. Opening an 'IPO Connect' allowing mainland investors direct access to Hong Kong listings is another ambition.
Beyond that, Li has talked also of the potential for an 'ETF Connect', offering Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to Chinese investors. 
""The LSE acquisition was about growth, but there is still potential for growth in HKEX's earlier strategy - building its fixed-income currencies and commodities products. I expect them to return to this,"" said Michael Wu, an analyst at Morningstar.
As part of this, HKEX is keen to expand the operations of its successful British acquisition - the London Metal Exchange, bought for 1.4 billion pounds ($1.71 billion) in 2012 - into Asia and China in particular. 
""The LME business also has significant cost-saving opportunities and further potential to expand its commodity breadth of products, which combined should drive significant earnings growth over time, if management execute on these organic growth options,"" said Ashley Pittard, head of global equities at fund manager Pendal, a top 15 shareholder in the HKEX.
In the near-term, attention is focused on already announced plans to launch a futures contract based on MSCI's mainland China index - which would be the first internationally traded contract based on the MSCI benchmark, a key gauge for global emerging markets investors.
CROSS-BORDER COMPETITION
While HKEX has previously made much of the former British colony's status as a gateway for capital flows in and out of China - it has been the world's largest listings venue in five of the past 10 years - the continued evolution of mainland markets could make pushing deeper into China a tougher proposition.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange has been particularly active, this year launching a new Nasdaq-style board, known as the STAR Market, which aims to attract the type of tech start-ups that Hong Kong began courting last year through rule changes that made it easier for them to list. 
""There is obviously competition across the border,"" said Ballingal's Blennerhassett, who also suggested a Hong Kong exchange merger with the Shanghai or Shenzhen bourse would be a logical step. 
""Forging a union between these exchanges seems to make a lot more sense - of course a lot would depend on how they structure it,"" he added.
Other HKEX watchers haven't given up on the potential for future cross-border exchange deals, even if Li's bold gambit failed this time.
""Longer term there is no doubt consolidation in stock exchanges globally will continue,"" said Pendal's Pittard, who pointed to the benefits of scaling exchanges' high fixed operating costs.
""Near term the road blocks have been from regulators primarily, but over time it is feasible that a European and Asian exchange could merge.""

For Charles Li, writing in his 'Chief Executive Blog' on Tuesday, the only certainty the future holds is that HKEX is ""strong enough and diverse enough to dust ourselves down and move forward"" - even without a Lewis Carroll looking glass.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 04:16AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Airbus defense unit sees cash challenge, adopts efficiency plan","By Tim Hepher
LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) Defence and Space has issued an internal warning of significant challenges in meeting cashflow and other targets for 2019 as it rolls out an internal efficiency plan called ""Momentum"", people familiar with the matter said.
It is the second time in as many years the group's second largest division has been forced to urge its 33,000 staff to save more cash in the final quarter of the year, a period when government customers are often slow in finalizing payments.
This year, the squeeze has gained extra urgency as Airbus remains locked in a dispute with Germany over a freeze on arms exports to Saudi Arabia, imposed after the killing of journalist Jamal Kashoggi by Saudi operatives just over a year ago.
Airbus says the moratorium on defense export licenses has disrupted an already long-delayed Saudi border systems contract.
Airbus Defence and Space staff have been urged to take steps to improve the division's cash position by the end of 2019, the people said, adding no figures were available.
One part of that effort is Momentum, a new plan aimed at achieving durable improvements in performance over a long term.
Responding to a Reuters query, an Airbus spokesman confirmed the focus on improving cash as well as the new efficiency plan.
""In early fall, as is rather customary, management has reminded the teams inside Airbus Defence and Space that we have to work hard in order to meet our targets by year-end,"" the spokesman said.
""Our particular focus in 2019 is on achieving our free cashflow objectives. Momentum, in its current phase, is one supporting tool in our instrument box to make that happen.""
Airbus took a total of 208 million euros ($228 million) in first-half charges related to the Saudi contract, but has declined to put any numbers on the fallout to its cashflow.
The group is targeting a positive free cashflow before M&A and customer financing of approximately 4 billion euros in 2019 after an outflow of 3.981 billion euros in the first half blamed partly on higher inventories due to delayed jetliner deliveries.
Airbus Defence and Space is the group's second largest division by sales and contributes some 17% of its revenue.
The division supplies aerial refueling tankers, satellites and military transport planes, and contributes to the four-nation Eurofighter Typhoon combat jet. It has also partnered with France’s Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) to study a successor to the Eurofighter and the French Rafale.
Divisional chief executive Dirk Hoke has urged Berlin to relax the Saudi export ban, saying it will not lead to far-reaching changes in the Gulf kingdom. But Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has said there is no reason to alter the moratorium which has been extended to March next year."

The announcement comes only a week after the pair said they would remain in their roles to regain trust after revelations that 20 company officials had received payments and gifts worth $3 million from a local government official.
Kansai Electric said Chairman Makoto Yagi's resignation was effective Wednesday. President Shigeki Iwane will step down the day a third-party probe committee, set up on Wednesday, returns its findings, which the firm said it hopes will be by late December.
Bowing deeply at the start of the news conference, Yagi said he had changed his mind over the past week following criticism from clients and the general public, and decided that resigning to take responsibility was the right thing to do.
""I am deeply sorry for the disturbance this has caused,"" Yagi said.
Osaka-based Kansai Electric's stock closed up 2.5% on Wednesday, versus a 0.6% decline in the benchmark Nikkei average share price index (N225), following earlier media reports of the planned resignations. The stock is still down about 13% since news of the scandal broke on Sept. 27.
""I believe it is my final responsibility to cooperate with the third-party committee to make sure a thorough investigation can be completed,"" Iwane said.
Iwane previously said he and 19 colleagues had received payments and gifts worth 320 million yen ($3 million) from the late deputy mayor of the town of Takahama, where Kansai Electric has a nuclear power station.
An internal company investigation found the then-deputy mayor, Eiji Moriyama, exerted influence over local government officials and sought to influence them to support the local economy and use local businesses as suppliers.
The payments were disclosed after the matter was raised by the local tax bureau.
Takahama, a town of about 10,000 people in central Japan, had no comment on Kansai Electric's findings about Moriyama, an official said on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - U.S. venture capitalists are expected to pour over $100 billion into startups for a second straight year, following the record sum invested in 2018, according to a report released on Wednesday. 
During the first three quarters of the year, venture capital firms had already invested $96.7 billion in 7,862 funding deals, according to the report by venture capital database PitchBook Data Inc and National Venture Capital Association. In 2018 it invested a record $137.6 billion. 
The strong investment numbers come as Silicon Valley investors and startups brace for a possible correction after several years of sharp rises in valuations that have minted an unprecedented number of so-called unicorns - startups valued at over $1 billion.
Fears of a setback for the industry were heightened by high profile initial public offering flops such as  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) and the valuation plunge of WeWork Companies Inc as it tried to go public.
So far, the money is still flowing, several venture capitalists told Reuters in the past week, although there have been fewer deals but they have been bigger in size.
The latest PitchBook data showed the number of deals valued at over $100 million are set for a record count this year, while the number of early-stage deals in the third-quarter touched their lowest levels since the first-quarter 2013. 
Craig Sherman, a partner at law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati said he's still seeing quite a few large deals coming down the pipeline.
“When the market is really bad and there's a correction, deals that have signed term sheets will often die ,” said Sherman. “We definitely are not seeing a meaningful market correction right now.“
Even last week scooter sharing company Bird said it raised $275 million with a valuation of $2.5 billion before the investment. And that comes despite skepticism that bike and scooter sharing companies could ever become profitable.
Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden told a tech conference last week his company changed its focus to emphasize profitability. ""The tech investment community is changing and reacting quickly to the public markets,"" he said. ""If you're a ...growth at all costs company burning hundreds of millions of dollars with negative unit economics, it's going to be very difficult to get funding moving forward.""
That concern and the fact that there's still a lot of late stage capital available could keep venture capital backed funding strong for the next quarter or two, said Jeff Grabow, US Venture Capital Leader at EY.

556,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 12:11AM ET</span>",Japan's Fast Retailing likely hit by South Korea boycott; succession plans in focus: analysts,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A South Korean boycott of Japanese goods is seen dragging down sales at Fast Retailing Co Ltd's (T:9983) Uniqlo stores, denting otherwise strong financial results due to be announced on Thursday by Asia's biggest fashion group, analysts said.
But another focus will be on succession plans after founder Tadashi Yanai, Japan's richest person according to Forbes, turned 70 earlier this year.
Analysts on average expect operating profit of 258.6 billion yen ($2.41 billion) for the year ended August, up 9.5% from a year prior, Thomson Reuters data showed. They see a 14% rise in the current year, helped by strength in China and new markets.
Some have been marking down forecasts since Uniqlo and other Japanese businesses were targeted by South Korean boycotts amid a diplomatic spat - a reminder of risks that come with overseas expansion. The company opened its first store in India last week and is also expanding in markets such as Malaysia and Indonesia.
Sales in South Korea, which account for around 8% of sales in Fast Retailing's flagship Uniqlo business, fell 40% year-on-year in July and more in August, the Nikkei reported.
J.P. Morgan analyst Dairo Murata recently lowered his Fast Retailing earnings forecast for the current year by 4.6% and cut his price target on the shares to 68,000 yen from 70,000 yen.
The shares last traded at around 61,300 yen, up 15% in the year to date.
""We foresee a double-digit decline in sales and a roughly 40% fall in operating profit for the South Korea business,"" Murata said in a client note, adding that the yen's appreciation against China's yuan was another near-term negative factor.
Fast Retailing's biggest growth market in recent years has been China, where it opened its first Uniqlo store in 2002 and now has over 700 locations. The company has said it expects Greater China revenue to grow to 1 trillion yen in fiscal 2022.
The Japan market, by contrast, has shown little growth. Uniqlo's September same-store sales data showed a 4.2% decline from a year earlier, with analysts saying they had expected stronger sales ahead of a consumption tax hike this month.
SUCCESSION
Another key focus on Thursday will be succession planning. Previously, Yanai said he would retire at 65 but shelved such plans when the time approached.
He has said he does not want his two sons to take the top job, though both were promoted to the ranks of company directors last year.
The next leader will be tasked not only with maintaining growth in China but also addressing long-term problems, such as its struggle to establish its brand in the United States. Investors are also keen for more results from recent technology investments including automated checkout and state-of-the-art logistics systems.
Possible successors include finance chief Takeshi Okazaki, who joined Fast Retailing from McKinsey & Co in 2011, and Pan Ning, head of Uniqlo's China operations.
Maki Akaida, head of Uniqlo's Japan operations, is also considered a candidate after Bloomberg News reported Yanai as preferring a female leader."

A slowdown in domestic growth and the lingering shadow banking crisis mean the September-quarter results season that kicks off Thursday will be similar to one seen over several quarters in recent years -- tepid and patchy.
Analysts expect to see a contraction in profits across most industries, with Edelweiss Securities Ltd. forecasting sales growth for the stocks it tracks to be the lowest in a decade. The spate of measures taken by the government to revive growth, including the $20 billion tax break to companies, are too recent to be reflected in company report cards, although analysts have since raised their estimates for 12-month forward earnings.
“Overall, we expect a soft quarter and earnings revival could still take some time,” Edelweiss Securities Ltd. analysts Prateek Parekh and Padmavati Udecha wrote in a note on Oct. 7. The brokerage’s forecast for sales growth excludes banks and commodities-related companies.
NSE Nifty 50 Index earnings for the year to March will shrink by about 4% from a year earlier, according to Edelweiss and Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. While commodities-related companies and corporate banks’ deferred tax assets will drive the contraction, the “earnings momentum is still soft and upgrades are likely to be modest“ even if they are excluded, Parekh and Udecha wrote.
Information technology and industrial companies’ earnings growth probably fell below 5%, they analysts said, while they expect retail banks, oil marketing companies and consumer discretionary firms to post profit expansion topping 25%.
Earnings risks continue to be tilted to the downside because of the slowing economy, uneven asset quality patterns seen in financial-services companies and depressed commodity prices, according to Motilal Oswal.
“At this point, tax rate cuts will largely limit the downgrades rather than driving big upgrades on the earnings front,” the brokerage said in a recent note.
The Leaders
While Nifty index’s pre-tax earnings are seen declining, banks led by Axis Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India Ltd. should post 34% growth, Kotak analysts led by Sanjeev Prasad wrote in Oct. 7 note.
Pharmaceutical companies are a top pick for the analysts, who estimate the domestic drug business could see 10-12% growth from a year earlier.
Weaker Commodities
Poor consumer demand and narrower margins for commodities-related companies will weigh on overall Nifty profits, according to Antique Stock Broking Ltd. The brokerage said it will its 13,100 year-end target for the index once the reporting season ends. The measure closed Monday at 11,126.
Margins for steel companies are expected to narrow sequentially due to weak domestic demand, while upstream oil players’ profitability will be eroded by lower oil prices, the analysts wrote."

Traders and analysts previously hoped that the two nations could make progress on trade talks when high-level officials meet later this week in Washington.
But hopes of that happening faded after the U.S. decided earlier this week to blacklist a list of Chinese tech companies to address human rights violations within China.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union's top negotiator in talks with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to resolve a more than three-week strike said late Tuesday a key issue separating the two sides is job security.
""We have made it clear that there is no job security for us when GM products are made in other countries for the purpose of selling them here in the U.S.A.,"" UAW Vice President Terry Dittes wrote in a letter to UAW officials on the 23th day of the strike. ""We believe that the vehicles GM sells here should be built here. We don't understand GM's opposition to this proposition.""
The strike at the United States' biggest carmaker began on Sept. 16, with its 48,000 UAW members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the automaker's profit and protection of healthcare benefits. The strike has cost GM more than $1 billion and forced it to idle operations in Canada and Mexico.
GM declined to comment on the UAW letter, which the union released to the media. Talks are set to resume Wednesday morning and the sides have exchanged numerous proposals since the strike began.
GM's production of trucks and sport-utility vehicles in Mexico has drawn anger among union workers.
Through August, 526,000 of the 573,000 vehicles GM exported from Mexico were sent to the United States, equal to about a quarter of its U.S. sales. U.S. President Donald Trump and many lawmakers have also urged GM to build more vehicles in the United States.
GM announced in November 2018 it would close four U.S. factories, including two assembly plants, and cut 15,000 jobs in North America.
GM said in September before the strike began that it had offered to make $7 billion in new U.S. investments in eight facilities in four states, but did not specify timing, location or products with the exception of a planned electric truck.
UAW workers are concerned that as GM shifts to more electric vehicles it will require fewer workers and that battery production may result in workers getting paid less than at existing transmission plants.
Reuters has reported that GM has told the UAW it could build a new battery plant near the now shuttered Lordstown, Ohio factory.
To date, the strike has hit as many as 150,000 workers in the auto industry, a report from research and consulting firm Anderson Economic Group (AEG) showed on Tuesday.
About 75,000 employees of auto parts suppliers have either been temporarily laid off or have seen their wages shrink due to the slump in demand from GM, according to the AEG report.
About 5,000 workers at Michigan auto suppliers have filed for unemployment benefits as a result of the strike, the state said on Tuesday.
AEG estimates that the strike has resulted in a $660 million profit hit for GM and more than $412 million in direct wage losses for all employees through the third week of the strike.
GM's share price dropped by 2.5% on Tuesday as broader indexes fell. Its share price has lost 9% since the strike began, slicing more than $4 billion from the automaker's market value.
The stoppage has also led to $155 million in lost federal income and payroll tax revenue and $9.1 million in lost Michigan income tax revenue.

Talks for a new four-year labor contract took a ""turn for the worse"" on Sunday after the UAW rejected GM's latest offer but the two sides were still talking.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 10:01PM ET</span>",U.S. online brokers still profiting from 'dumb money',"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - People who trade stocks online cheered last week when several large retail brokers slashed stock-trading commissions to zero, a move made possible, in part, by a controversial source of broker revenue that has drawn regulatory scrutiny.
 Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp and E*Trade Financial Corp followed the lead of Interactive Brokers in eliminating stock and exchange-traded fund trading commissions, sending their share prices tumbling on the revenue they were giving up.
But the brokers have other ways of profiting from retail trading, including interest earned on customer cash balances and margin lending. 
There is also payment for order flow, in which wholesale market makers, like Citadel Securities or Virtu Financial pay for the first crack at executing a stock order. They then execute the transaction, either internally, in other off-exchange trading venues, or on an exchange.
The practice has drawn scrutiny from regulators globally because it creates an incentive for brokers to send orders to whoever pays the most, rather than the place that might get the best outcome for customers.
Still, the practice is common among retail brokerages where ""mom-and-pop"" investors place their orders, making up around 20 percent of all U.S. trading activity. Very few of their stock orders ever go directly to an exchange like Intercontinental Exchange Inc's New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Inc. 
Canada has banned the practice. The United Kingdom recently put it under review and said in September that nearly all UK-based brokerages acting in an agency capacity had stopped accepting payment for order flow. 
For their part, market makers say they give, on average, a better price than the market is offering, usually a fraction of a penny per share. Retail brokers say they use the additional revenue to improve technology and lower customer costs.
When market makers execute orders, they collect the spread between the bid and the offer, which they divide between payment for order flow for the broker, price improvement for the retail trader, and profit, said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill + Partners.
Professional traders covet retail orders because unlike large institutional investors with large portfolios and orders that are big enough to move the market, retail investors tend to be less informed as to which way a stock is likely to be moving and their orders are generally smaller. In trading circles, this is known as ""dumb money.""
Prior to launching its free trading service, IBKR Lite, last Monday, Interactive Brokers did not accept payment for order flow. Users of the company's IBKR Pro service will still pay to trade and their orders will routed to the market where they will get the best execution, instead of being sold. 
Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Greenwich, Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers, said he thought the conflict in payment for order flow is not so much between broker and customers as between the market makers who buy the order flow and the prices at which they execute the orders.
""The better the execution price the less money the market maker earns,"" he said in an email. ""But this has been the story forever on Wall Street. This is how the large investment banks make about $250 billion per year. They call it 'trading profits.'""
Online brokers have U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission-mandated ""best execution committees"" to ensure that all of their trades are executed inside the national best bid and offer and that the market makers that provide the most price improvement get majority of the order flow, he added.
Schwab and TD Ameritrade also said in statements that getting customers the best execution possible is a top priority.
Virtu and Citadel Securities declined to comment.
For its part, the SEC adopted rules last November that will force brokers to disclose more about any payment for order flow or profit-sharing relationships in quarterly public disclosures. But the SEC delayed the compliance date twice after brokers said they needed more time to make changes to their electronic order routing systems to track the orders. The disclosure rules are now set to take effect in 2020.
Brett Redfearn, the SEC's director of trading and markets, said in March that enhanced disclosures would ""enable greater transparency into any potential trade-offs being made between payment for order flow and execution quality.""
YEARS IN THE MAKING
Payment for order flow is a growing revenue stream in an ultra-competitive industry in the middle of a price war. But it is not the biggest source of income for online brokers, and not all accept it. Fidelity, for one, does not. 
Schwab made $139 million from selling its customers' orders in 2018, up 22% from the previous year, according to a regulatory filing. TD Ameritrade was paid $458 million for customer orders in its last fiscal year, up from $320 million the year before, according to a filing.
The move to zero commissions has been decades in the making. The online brokers' use of technology to place orders instead of relying on traders on a trading floor allowed them to cut costs while speeding up the process, making it easier for everyone to buy and sell stocks.
But in more recent years, online brokers like Schwab and TD Ameritrade have come under mounting competition from startup fintech companies that have embraced payment for order flow as a way to cut out trading commissions entirely.
Menlo Park, California-based brokerage Robinhood launched in late 2014 with the stated mission of democratizing access to the financial markets. By the end of last year, it said it had signed up 6 million user accounts. 
Other startups have followed suit and many, like Robinhood, offer things like free trading of cryptocurrencies, along with stocks and ETFs, to help attract younger investors.

Now that the larger brokers have followed suit, analysts have said they expect more mergers and acquisitions as the erosion in commission revenues makes scale more important.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 09:56PM ET</span>",Boeing 737 MAX timetable uncertain as regulators continue safety review,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and European Union regulators said on Tuesday they were still reviewing changes Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co made to 737 MAX software after two fatal crashes, a development that raised questions about how quickly the grounded aircraft can return to service. 
The ongoing safety review means a key 737 MAX certification test flight is unlikely before November, two sources said. Boeing has repeatedly said it hopes to resume flights in the fourth quarter, which began on Oct. 1.
Regulators sought to play down talk of transatlantic divisions over safety changes to the 737 MAX, which was grounded worldwide in March after two crashes killed 346 people within five months.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement it has a ""transparent and collaborative relationship"" with other civil aviation authorities as it continues its 737 MAX safety review. Its European Union counterpart said it was in ""continuous contact"" with both the FAA and Boeing.
""We do not at this stage have any specific concerns resulting from that assessment that would mean that we could not agree to a coordinated return to service. We are in continuous contact with both the FAA and Boeing,"" a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) spokeswoman said by email.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in September the agency would need about a month following the yet-to-be scheduled certification test flight before the planes could return to service.
The FAA reiterated on Tuesday that it does not have a firm date for completing its review.
Among its changes, Being is addressing a flaw discovered in the software architecture of the 737 MAX flight-control system that involves using and receiving input from both flight control computers rather than one.
For decades, 737 models have used only one of the flight control computers for each flight, switching to the other computer on the following flight, Reuters reported in August.
FAA still needs to see Boeing’s ""final system description"" - a ""500-ish page document that has the architecture of the flight control system and the changes that they have made,"" Dickson said last month. It then will need to complete an ""integrated system safety analysis"" and conduct pilot workload management scenarios.
Boeing plans to revise the 737 MAX software to take input from both angle-of-attack sensors in the anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes and has added additional safeguards.
Separately, a $50 million Boeing assistance fund that announced Sept. 23 it would pay each family $144,500 in the two deadly crashes has already paid three of the five claims submitted to date, the fund's co-administrator, Camille Biros, told Reuters on Monday.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co is scheduling without the MAX until at least early January, pending regulatory approval for commercial flight. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group and United Airlines have canceled MAX flights through part of December.

564,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 09:56PM ET</span>",Jury says J&J must pay $8 billion in case over male breast growth linked to Risperdal,"By Brendan Pierson and Nate Raymond
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) must pay $8 billion in punitive damages to a man who previously won $680,000 over his claims that it failed to warn that young men using its antipsychotic drug Risperdal could grow breasts, a Philadelphia jury said on Tuesday.
The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas jury's verdict in favor of Nicholas Murray came in the first case in which a Pennsylvania jury had been able to consider awarding punitive damages in one of thousands of Risperdal cases pending in the state.
""This jury, as have other juries in other litigations, once again imposed punitive damages on a corporation that valued profits over safety and profits over patients,"" Murray's lawyers, Tom Kline and Jason Itkin, said in a joint statement. ""Johnson & Johnson and (subsidiary) Janssen chose billions over children.""
J&J said the award was ""grossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award in this case, and the company is confident it will be overturned."" It added that the jury in the case had not been allowed to hear evidence of Risperdal's benefits.
Professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law said he expects the punitive damages to be lowered on appeal, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision which found that ""few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.""
Tobias said the verdict was about sending a message.
""A jury, if it's outrageous enough conduct, will award a big number and let the lawyers and judges work it out,"" he said.
Tobias added that the verdict could be a sign that J&J will face more large damages awards in other Risperdal cases.
""The kind of evidence in this trial may persuade another jury or judge to do something similar,"" he said.
Murray, like other male plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation over Risperdal, alleges that he developed breasts after being prescribed the medicine when he was a minor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug in late 1993 for treating schizophrenia and episodes of bipolar mania in adults.
Plaintiffs claim that J&J failed to warn of the risk of gynecomastia, the development of enlarged breasts in males, associated with Risperdal, which they say the company marketed for unapproved uses with children.
In his lawsuit, Murray, now 26, alleged that he developed breasts after his doctors began prescribing him Risperdal off-label in 2003 after a psychologist diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines as they see fit, while companies are only allowed to promote their drugs for approved uses. 
A jury in 2015 awarded Murray $1.75 million after finding J&J was negligent in failing to warn of the risk of gynecomastia. A state appeals court upheld the verdict in February 2018 but reduced it to $680,000.
Plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation had been barred from seeking punitive damages since 2014, when a state court judge ruled that the law of New Jersey, which prohibits punitive damages and is J&J's home state, should be applied globally to the cases.

But a Pennsylvania Superior Court ruling in 2018 cleared the way for punitive damages awards, holding that the law of each plaintiff's state should instead apply.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who became nationally known as an outspoken critic of U.S. President Donald Trump before his arrest earlier this year, will stand trial in April on charges that he stole from his former client Stormy Daniels, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts set the April 21 trial date at a brief hearing in Manhattan federal court. The trial is expected to last one to two weeks.
Avenatti, 48, was arrested in New York in March. New York prosecutors have charged him with stealing nearly $300,000 from Daniels in the course of representing her and helping her secure a book deal, to which he has pleaded not guilty.
The prosecutors said Avenatti diverted two $148,750 installment payments from Daniels' $800,000 book advance by forging her signature in a letter to her literary agent and directing that the money be sent to his bank account.
Avenatti eventually paid $148,750 to Daniels after obtaining the funds from another source, according to prosecutors. However, when Daniels asked about the second payment, Avenatti falsely told Daniels the publisher ""owes me a payment"" and that he was ""on it,"" prosecutors said.
Avenatti's lawyer, Dean Steward, said at Tuesday's hearing that he was considering filing a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that it was motivated by the ""vindictiveness"" of Avenatti's political enemies in the Trump administration.
Batts, however, expressed skepticism.
""This office is not known for being vindictive,"" she said of the Manhattan federal prosecutors who brought the charges.
Avenatti is charged in a separate federal case in New York with trying to extort  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). Prosecutors in that case have accused Avenatti of threatening to publicize claims that Nike arranged for payments to elite college basketball recruits unless the athletic wear company paid him more than $20 million and hired him to manage an internal probe.
A trial in that case had been scheduled for November, but Avenatti has asked that it be postponed until January.
He is also charged by federal prosecutors in Los Angeles with stealing millions of dollars from clients to pay for personal and business expenses and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a Mississippi bank about his finances. A trial in that case is scheduled for May 19.

Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.

(SA:JBSS3), due to alleged ties with the Venezuelan government of leftist President Nicolas Maduro.
President Donald Trump's government has imposed sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials as well as state oil company PDVSA in an effort to remove Maduro, whom it accuses of fixing elections last year and abusing human rights in the oil-rich nation. 
Senators Marco Rubio and Robert Menendez sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review transactions by JBS, which has bought several American meat companies in recent years, Rubio's press office said on Twitter.
""This meat-processing conglomerate has engaged in illicit financial activities and has business ties with the Maduro regime,"" the Twitter post said.
In a statement, JBS said it had always cooperated ""transparently"" with U.S. authorities regarding ""passed events"" in Brazil.
It had improved the management of the companies it acquired in the United States, delivering ""solid results"" that contributed to farm sector growth, JBS added, and continues to provide opportunities to farming and cattle-raising families.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In August, Washington froze all Venezuelan state assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on any company continuing to do business with the government. 
In their letter to Mnuchin, made public on Tuesday, the senators said CFIUS should investigate the business transactions among JBS, the Venezuelan Corporation of Foreign Trade (CORPOVEX) and Diosdado Cabello, a powerful ally of Maduro who is under U.S. sanctions.
They did not provide further details about the alleged transactions.
The senators said JBS had engaged in the bribery of public officials in Brazil to obtain funds to expand abroad, acquiring in recent years U.S. meat-packer Swift Foods Co and chicken producer Pilgrim's Pride Corp.
Brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, founders of JBS's holding company J&F, signed plea bargain and leniency deals in May 2017, in which they confessed to running a political bribery ring in Brazil.

""We ask CFIUS conduct a review of JBS SA's acquisition of U.S. companies to assess the implications for security and safety of America's food supply and, in turn, our national security,"" the senators said in their letter.

Juan Guaido, whom many nations recognize as Venezuela's real leader following accusations that Maduro rigged a 2018 election, told parliament the proposed loan was intended to alleviate the effects of a crushing five-year recession.
Venezuela has defaulted on its foreign debt and is reeling from an unprecedented economic crisis, political hostilities, U.S. sanctions and an exodus of several million citizens.
""Those who don't pay don't get loans,"" Guaido said, ruling out the proposed CAF loan going to Maduro's administration but without specifying the alternative arrangement.
Caracas-based CAF, which is owned by 19 countries primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean and 13 private banks in the region, did not respond to a request for comment.
CAF approved a $500-million credit line to Venezuela's central bank in December, drawing criticism from opposition lawmakers for financing the ""dictatorship.""
There was no immediate comment from Maduro's government, which views Guaido as a U.S. ""puppet"" and coup plotter."

The rewrite, which takes full effect at the start of 2021, is meant to provide lenders a clearer picture of which trades are prohibited by Volcker. Four other financial agencies had already signed off on the effort and had waited weeks for the Fed to add its approval.
“The revisions continue to prohibit proprietary trading, while providing greater clarity and certainty for activities allowed under the law,“ the Fed said in a Tuesday statement.
Fed governor Lael Brainard voted against the changes, saying in a statement that the revised Volcker “weakens the core protections against speculative trading within the banking federal safety net.” Others who opposed the overhaul include former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, who the original rule was named for."

The S&P 500 finished down 1.56% just after hitting its low on the day. The Dow Jones industrials, which had fallen as many as 338 points early in the day, finished down 1.2%, or 314 points. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.67%.
Scientific-equipment makers like Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) slumped in the selloff. Chip and biotech stocks were among the hardest-hit groups. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slumped more than 3% because so much of chipmakers' business has been tied to growth in sales growth in China. The Nasdaq biotechnology index fell about 2% because of a weak earnings report from Qiagen (NYSE:QGEN).
Banks dropped more than 2%.
 
The decline left the S&P and Dow more than 4% off from their summer peaks.
The Nasdaq is off nearly 6%. In six trading days in October, the S&P 500 and Dow are down 2.8%. The Nasdaq is off 2.2%.
Because of all the volatility that's hit markets in the last 12 months, the S&P 500 is off 1.63% from its 2018 peak, with the Dow off 2.9% from its year-ago peak and the Nasdaq down 3.8%. 
China was the big weight on the market, starting with last night's announcement that the Trump Administration won't let eight Chinese companies and a number of police departments buy technology products that can be used in surveillance.
Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. said it will impose visa bans on Chinese communist party officials linked to abuse in China's Xinjiang province, where some million ethnic Uighurs have been put in detention camps.
The China news offset a positive reaction to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's announcement the central bank will be buying securities to provide enough liquidity in the banking system.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) was the sole Dow stock that showed a gain for the day. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were both down about 1%. Chemical maker Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) was off nearly 3%. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) were off more than 2%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was briefly ahead on the day, but ended down 0.65%. While it announced an order for a single 737 Max jet liner, there's no clarity on when the plane will fly again. At the same time, deliveries were halved because of the grounding of the plane. In addition, Boeing reported cancellations for 22 of its 787 Dreamliners.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 05:03PM ET</span>",Levi Strauss profit declines on trouble in the Americas,"(Reuters) - Levi Strauss & Co (N:LEVI) reported a 4% drop in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, as the denim apparel maker struggled to grow its wholesale business in the Americas, where it generates most of its revenue.
Reduced shipments to off price stores and the impact of a delayed acquisition of a South American distributor drove net revenue down about 3% in the region, the first fall since the 165-year-old company went public in March. 
""U.S. wholesale was challenged... particularly the legacy department stores and chain stores, where (the) much publicized traffic declines have negatively impacted our business,"" Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh said in an interview with Reuters.
The deteriorating retail landscape has forced longstanding brick-and-mortar chains, including J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP), to explore options, as they struggle to boost the profile of their e-commerce business to rival established player Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Bergh said Levi's has been selling less to off price retailers, including TJX Cos Inc's (N:TJX) T.J. Maxx and Ross Stores (O:ROST). 
""We do not make products for that channel the way other apparel manufacturers do. We only sell to that channel... the distressed inventory that we're trying to clear... we don't think its good for the brand,"" Bergh said.
Levi's results were also hit by a delay in the acquisition of its South American distributor, which includes 80 retail stores across the markets of Chile, Peru and Bolivia, and is now expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. 
The company has also been investing in its online and retail business, while expanding in China, Brazil and India among other markets to make up for slowdown in its wholesale business at the cost of lower profits. 
Overall, the wholesale business grew only 1%, drawing strength from Europe and Asia. 
Net income attributable to the company fell to $124.5 million, or 30 cents per share, in the quarter ended Aug. 25, from $130.1 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.
Gross margin declined 20 basis points due to the impact of stronger dollar. 
Still, third-quarter revenue came above Wall Street estimates, as the blue-jeans maker benefits from a resurgence of the denim trend and its move to sell directly to customers in stores and online than through wholesalers. 
This helped revenue in Europe and Asia rise about 14% and 9%, respectively.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday it had approved a final rule simplifying the 'Volcker Rule' ban on proprietary trading, cementing a significant win for banks under the Trump administration.
The Fed was the fifth and final financial regulator to sign off on the changes, which are aimed at making it easier for banks to comply with the rule, established after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, barring them from making profit-seeking trades with customer funds.
The simpler rule takes effect on Jan. 1, 2020, and banks will be given one additional year to comply.
The final version of the rule rewrite is even friendlier to banks than the proposal unveiled in May 2018. After significant industry pushback, regulators agreed to abandon an accounting test aimed at ensuring banks were not engaging in speculative trades. The final version of the new rule drops that test, which banks warned could hinder proper trading in several financial products.

Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who voted in favor of the original proposed rewrite, voted against the final simpler rule on Tuesday. In a statement, she said the final rule ""weakens the core protections against speculative trading within the banking federal safety net.""

575,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 04:46PM ET</span>",Millions of Californians May Go Dark in Biggest Fire Shutoff Yet,"(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp., the California utility giant forced into bankruptcy by two years of devastating wildfires, warned that it may orchestrate its biggest planned blackout yet to keep power lines from sparking more blazes.
PG&E may cut electricity to more than 645,000 customers in the Bay Area and beyond, including parts of Santa Clara and Alameda counties. Shutoffs are set to begin early Wednesday -- when hot, dry winds are forecast to pick up speed -- and may last several days. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) also warned it may cut power to about 106,260 Southern (NYSE:SO) Caliofrnia customers.
Altogether, an estimated 2.25 million people may be affected.
Never before has a utility planned such a widespread shutoff affecting so many customers at once to avoid a wildfire in California. It’s the latest testament to how climate change-driven extreme weather is forcing people and businesses alike to adapt. This week’s outage will mark the first time PG&E has coordinated a blackout in a major metropolitan area. Previous ones involved rural areas prone to wildfires.
The planned shutoff appears to spare most of Silicon Valley’s big tech operations. Mountain View, Santa Clara and most of San Jose were outside of PG&E’s affected zones as of late Tuesday morning. A detailed map posted on PG&E’s website also showed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s Fremont factory lying outside the zones, as well as San Francisco, PG&E’s hometown.
The outage is striking almost two years to the day after a series of deadly wildfires -- most of them blamed on PG&E’s equipment -- broke out across Northern California’s wine country during a fierce wind storm. Then, last year, one of the company’s transmission lines ignited the state’s deadliest blaze yet -- the Camp Fire, which leveled the town of Paradise and killed 86 people. The estimated $30 billion in liabilities from those fires forced PG&E to declare bankruptcy in January.
PG&E and the state’s other utilities are now taking more extreme measures than ever to keep their power lines from sparking blazes. PG&E has begun switching off transmission lines in advance of high winds.
“This is shaping up to be one of the most severe dry wind events we’ve seen in our territory in recent years,” Michael Lewis, senior vice president of PG&E Electric Operations, said in a statement. “It could take several days to fully restore power after the weather passes and safety inspections are completed.”
For PG&E, the stakes are especially high. Another major blaze sparked by its equipment could upend the company’s restructuring plans. Shares were down 3.6% at 3:06 p.m. in New York.
More details on the upcoming shutoffs:
The National Weather Service has posted red flag warnings in parts of six western states, meaning fire danger is high. In California, the warnings ring the Bay Area including Napa County, where the October 2017 Tubbs fire killed at least 22 and destroyed more than 5,600 structures.Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric utility is considering its own shutoffs but hasn’t decided.Oil, natural gas and gasoline pipeline giant  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI). said it’s expecting “minimal” impact from the power cuts. “We are working closely with our customers to mitigate any potential effects,” the company said.PG&E’s service warning includes some of California’s most populous areas, including Santa Clara County’s almost 2 million people and Alameda County’s 1.7 million residents, according to state data.The blackout isn’t expected to shut San Francisco’s main rail service, the Bay Area Rapid Transit System. Although the electrified rail service gets power from PG&E, its own cables can redistribute electricity during a blackout and the agency has set up back-up generators, Bart spokesman Jim Allison said. “We’re like a little grid of our own,” he said.Back-up generator manufacturer Generac Holdings Inc. said it expects to see a spike in consultations and leads following the planned outage. Sales are already higher than they’ve ever been in California, the company said."
576,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 04:39PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
1. Fed Minutes, Powell on Watch
The September Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's participation in a Kansas City Fed event will likely be the main focus ahead of a widely-expected Fed rate cut later this month.
Powell’s speech at 11:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT) and the 2 p.m. ET release of the Fed’s minutes from its September meeting will be closely watched for clues into the central bank’s thinking.
In a Tuesday speech, Powell said the Fed is going to sell some short-term securities to shore up some funding issues in short-term debt markets. He also said the economy was growing nicely and not overheating.
In its September meeting, the FOMC delivered what many saw as a hawkish cut as the central bank signaled that it was unlikely to adopt a prolonged period of easing.
The odds of Fed rate cut have cooled recently, but remained high, with 77% of traders expecting a cut later this month, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
“We expect one more 25 basis point rate cut, most likely in October, as the FOMC navigates a U.S. economy that is slowing and facing elevated downside risks,” Nomura said in a recent note to clients.
2. Labor Market Data Due
Beyond monetary policy, labor market data will also garner attention following last week’s weaker-than-expected, but solid, employment report.
The Labor Department will release its August Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that job openings fell to 7.19 million in August from 7.22 million the prior month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
3. Crude Inventories to Build for Fourth-Straight Week?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report, due Wednesday, will likely provide a timely distraction as crude prices have pressured by rising fears that U.S.-China trade talks set to start Thursday are unlikely to lead to meaningful progress.
The EIA is expected to report a build in crude stockpiles of 1.41 million barrels last week. That would mark the fourth-weekly build in crude stockpiles.
U.S. weekly production, which remains at a record of 12.4 million barrels a day, will likely also attract attention.
Crude oil futures settled down 0.2% to $52.63 a barrel on Tuesday and were at levels last seen in mid-August."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court on Tuesday refused to toss out a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) computer programmer's theft conviction, rejecting his claim that he was wrongly prosecuted twice for the same conduct.
The decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan may be the last in the decade-long legal odyssey of Sergey Aleynikov, 49, who was first arrested in July 2009 for copying Goldman's high-frequency trading code as he prepared to join a Chicago startup.
In a 5-0 ruling, the court found ""no inconsistency"" between its 2017 finding that Aleynikov had made a ""tangible"" copy of the codes when he uploaded them to a German server, and an earlier conclusion by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the codes were ""intangible"" when Aleynikov transported them.
""Accordingly, there was no double jeopardy bar to the state prosecution,"" the Appellate Division said.
Aleynikov's lawyer Kevin Marino said his client intends to ask the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, to review the decision. That court is not required to hear an appeal.
""It's not the end of line,"" Marino said. ""We believe the court misinterpreted New York's double jeopardy statute. He was convicted of making a tangible copy after the 2nd Circuit acquitted him of making a tangible copy.""
Danny Frost, a spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, declined to comment.
A New York state trial judge sentenced Aleynikov to time served last October, after the Appellate Division in 2017 reinstated the second of his two criminal convictions.
Aleynikov spent 11 months in prison before the 2nd Circuit overturned his federal conviction, the first of his convictions, in 2012.
The dual U.S.-Russian citizen has said he intended the code only for his own use. His tale helped inspire Michael Lewis' 2014 bestseller ""Flash Boys,"" on the rise of high-frequency trading in U.S. equities.
Marino said Aleynikov, who has three daughters, works as a computer programming consultant.
The case is New York v Aleynikov, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, No. 4447/12."

Italian state-owned railway group Ferrovie dello Stato, U.S. airline Delta (N:DAL) and infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) have been discussing how to revive Alitalia for months, pushing back various previous deadlines for making a firm proposal.
Patuanelli said in a statement he had met Alitalia's commissioners on Tuesday to discuss the situation.
""The overall situation of the company was examined, and there was an agreement that there are the conditions for a binding proposal to be presented by the buyer consortium by October 15,"" he said, expressing annoyance over the fact that an offer was not yet forthcoming.
""In this context, we call for responsibility on all sides and speedy decisions, given that the Oct. 15 deadline cannot be prolonged,"" he said."

Pompeo is imposing the restrictions on government leaders and Communist Party officials who are found responsible for or complicit in the detention and abuse of Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and other minority Muslim groups in Xinjiang, according to the State Department. Travel by those officials’ family members will also be restricted.
The news rattled American equity investors already on edge over signs tensions between the two countries are rising ahead of the trade talks. The S&P 500 tumbled from session highs to trade lower by almost 1%.
“The Chinese government has instituted a highly repressive campaign against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other members of Muslim minority groups,” Pompeo said in a statement Tuesday. “The United States calls on the People’s Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang.”
The move is authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which lets the secretary of state deny travel visas to people whose entry he determines “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” But the move comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-China relations, with a trade delegation from Beijing due in Washington for talks this week.
State Department officials said U.S. law prevents them from announcing who is on the new visa-restriction list, though they said names were already being added. It was done in coordination with a Commerce Department announcement Monday placing eight of the country’s technology giants on a blacklist over the alleged rights abuses.
“We’re showing that this administration is following through,” Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia David Stilwell said in an interview. “It’s consistent, it’s deliberate and the goal is to get them to reconsider this terrible policy they have.”

The officials said the restrictions and the Commerce Department action are unrelated to trade talks set to begin Thursday, though one of the State Department officials said the U.S. believes Chinese officials don’t come to the table unless they know their negotiating partners are serious.
The Trump administration has steadily turned up the pressure on the Chinese government over Xinjiang, where the U.S. estimates more than 1 million Muslims are being held. The U.S. led an event on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly last month condemning China’s treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang.
QuickTake: Who Are the Uighurs and Why Is China Locking Them Up?
The Xinjiang action is only the latest source of friction between the world’s two largest economies. On Monday, President Donald Trump warned that trade negotiations would suffer if China does anything “bad” to quell protests that have raged for weeks in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, China’s state television has said it will halt airing preseason National Basketball Association games in the country after the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted his support for the demonstrators.
‘Stop Interfering’
The U.S. coordinated the latest move with allies in Europe and in the Muslim world and is pressing them to impose similar restrictions, according to one State Department official. The person said administration officials had been directed to raise the matter in almost all of their meetings during the UN General Assembly last month.
China has responded with outrage to punitive U.S. actions over Xinjiang. Responding earlier Tuesday to the Commerce Department action, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the country urged the U.S. to “immediately correct its mistake, withdraw the relevant decision and stop interfering in China’s internal affairs.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks briefly cut losses in choppy trading on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested openness to further rate cuts and said the time has come to allow the Fed's asset holdings to begin to expand again.
Powell also said the Fed would ""soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time.""
However, indexes soon reversed course to fall further in late trading after the U.S. State Department said it is imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials for treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang.
The interest-rate sensitive financials index (SPSY) was down more than 1%.
Market expectations have increased that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point in October, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
Those bets were bolstered on Tuesday by data that showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in September.
""The overall tone from the Fed is showing a little more concern,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.
""The Fed is trying to send a message of 'we are paying attention and we are on top of this, and we are going to focus on the mission and not the politics,'"" he added.
At 3:17 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 213.3 points, or 0.81%, to 26,264.72, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 31.08 points, or 1.06%, to 2,907.71 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 90.75 points, or 1.14%, to 7,865.55.
A Bloomberg report that Washington was moving ahead with efforts to limit capital flows to China and the inclusion of some top Chinese startups on a blacklist also weighed on stocks.
The trade blacklist was widened to include Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision (SZ:002415) and surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology (SZ:002236) among others, drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) dropped 1.7%.
U.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators were to meet in Washington for a second day of talks on Tuesday, with high-level discussions scheduled to start on Thursday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.22-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

583,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 03:08PM ET</span>","Powell Sees Fed Resuming Balance-Sheet Growth, But It's Not QE","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will resume purchases of Treasury securities in an effort to avoid a repeat of recent turmoil in money markets, while leaving his options open on interest rates weeks ahead of policy makers’ next meeting.
“My colleagues and I will soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time,” he said in the text of a speech to be delivered Tuesday to the National Association of Business Economics in Denver.
He suggested that the purchases would be made up of Treasury bills and stressed the buying should not be seen as a return of the crisis-era quantitative easing programs that the Fed engaged in a decade ago to boost the economy. Three-month bill yields fell on the comments, while U.S. stocks pared losses and the dollar was higher.
“I want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis,” he said. “Neither the recent technical issues nor the purchases of Treasury bills we are contemplating to resolve them should materially affect the stance of monetary policy.”
The Fed has cut interest rates twice this year to shelter the U.S. economy from weak global growth and trade-policy uncertainty. Traders in federal funds futures are betting that the Federal Open Market Committee will reduce rates again at its Oct. 29-30 meeting from the current target range of 1.75% to 2%. Futures were little changed following the release of Powell’s comments.
No Preset Path
Powell was non-committal on what the Fed’s next move would be.
“Looking ahead, policy is not on a preset course,” he said. “The next FOMC meeting is several weeks away, and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information.”
He said the actions that the Fed has already taken “are providing support for the outlook,” which remains favorable but faces risks, principally from global developments such as trade and Brexit.
But he added, “we will act as appropriate to support continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2% objective.”
The economy has recently shown signs of slowing as weakness overseas has spread to the U.S. and moved from domestic manufacturing industries to services.
The job market has also downshifted, even as unemployment has fallen to a half-century low of 3.5%. Nonfarm payrolls grew by an average of 157,000 per month in the third quarter, compared with gains above 200,000 earlier in the expansion.
Powell said that work done by the Fed mining private-sector data suggested the most recent job gains may ultimately be revised lower, but that the pace would still be above the level needed to hold unemployment steady.
Money markets were roiled last month as a combination of corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury debt purchases temporarily sent short-term interest rates skyrocketing.
The Fed announced last week that it will extend through October the ad hoc liquidity lifeline that it’s been offering to U.S. funding markets since then.
“We will not hesitate to conduct temporary operations if needed to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range,” Powell said.
“As we indicated in our March statement on balance sheet normalization, at some point, we will begin increasing our securities holdings to maintain an appropriate level of reserves,” he added. “That time is now upon us.”"

Since Purdue filed for bankruptcy protection in September, Arizona is the first state to switch sides in the looming showdown over the privately-held company's proposed settlement, which it has estimated is worth more than $10 billion. 
Purdue reached the deal last month with 24 states and the local governments that have filed the bulk of the more than 2,600 lawsuits against the company.
The lawsuits allege Purdue and its Sackler family owners contributed to a public health crisis by aggressively marketing opioids while downplaying their overdose risks, which contributed to nearly 400,000 deaths since 1999, according to U.S. statistics. 
Last week, court filings from states and local governments opposing the settlement asserted that Purdue steered up to $13 billion in profits to the Sackler family, more than triple the amount previously cited in litigation. 
A lawyer for some of the Sacklers last week said in a statement that much of the money was paid in taxes and reinvested in businesses that will be sold as part of the proposed settlement. 
Arizona's filing offers little explanation of why the state backed away from its initial support. ""At nearly every turn during the course of subsequent negotiations, debtors have sought to undermine material terms of the deal,"" it said.
Arizona's attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Purdue declined to comment.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, will consider on Friday Purdue's request for an injunction to pause the litigation for about nine months. Purdue said it needs time to try to settle the remaining cases.
Purdue also asked Drain to shield the Sacklers from litigation, even though they have not filed for bankruptcy, partly because the family has proposed contributing at least $3 billion toward the settlement.
Opponents of the settlement accused the family of using Purdue's bankruptcy to shield their wealth from victims.
With Arizona, 25 states now oppose the deal. Kentucky and Oklahoma reached prior settlements with Purdue.

In addition to pursuing a case in state court against Purdue, Arizona is also pursuing a novel lawsuit that it filed directly with the U.S. Supreme Court, saying the unusual move was justified by the national importance of the opioid crisis.

Mohegan, which has partnered with Greek contractor GEK Terna (AT:HRMr), is competing with Hard Rock International in a tender to build and operate for 30 years a casino within a planned 8 billion-euro tourist resort known as Hellenikon, on the site of the former Athens international airport.
The winner of the tender will build a casino of at least 1.2 hectares, with at least 120 gaming tables and 1,200 slot machines, as well as a luxury hotel, entertainment venues, a conference center and a sports center.
Hellenikon has faced delays amid a long-running row with critics who fear it will damage the environment and the country's cultural heritage.
The new conservative government has promised to speed up the process and has said that the winner for the casino is expected to be named next month, opening the way for construction work at Hellenikon to begin.
Mohegan Gaming Chief Executive Officer Mario Kontomerkos said the company has been working on the plan for more than two years and that all costing, land planning and architectural work has been completed.
""We are ready to begin as soon as we receive all the necessary approvals,"" he said. ""We want to start as fast as possible.""
He said that constructions of this type usually take 24 to 36 months and that Mohegan ""will certainly comply within that timeline"".
Mohegan's plan, dubbed Inspire Athens, consists of two skyscrapers which are inspired by Caryatids, female sculptures used to support a temple on the Acropolis Hill.
Greece, which has been recovering after a multi-year economic crisis, saw record tourist arrivals in 2018 of 33 million people and expects a similar number this year.
The casino resort will bring in more tourists in Athens and generate over 7,000 jobs, Kontomerkos said."

(Reuters) - Amag Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:AMAG), whose shares have tumbled more than 45% in the past year, on Tuesday agreed to add two directors proposed by Caligan Partners after the hedge fund pressured the drugmaker to conduct a strategic business review.
Amag, which won U.S. approval for a female libido drug in June, said it will expand its board to 11 people, making room for Caligan Partners' founder David Johnson and Paul Fonteyne, a former head of Boehringer Ingelheim USA.
The hedge fund, which owns a 10.3% stake in Amag, had for months been pressing for changes ranging from cost cuts to possibly splitting up the company or finding partnerships, and had proposed adding four new directors to the board.
Camber Capital Management, Amag's second largest shareholder, also pushed for new board members. Camber did not immediately comment on the settlement.
""As part of Amag's commitment to good corporate governance and ongoing board refreshment, we are pleased to have reached an agreement with Caligan that is in the best interests of all shareholders,"" Gino Santini, chairman of the board, said in a statement on Tuesday.
A Caligan spokesman had no further comment.
Amag shares trimmed some of their losses in early trading after the settlement was announced. Since January its stock price has fallen 22% and was trading at $11.88 on Tuesday, off about 1.6%.
Amag, which has a market value of $410 million, now offers Vyleesi, the only injectable drug on the market for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women. But the company lowered its full-year revenue forecast, hurt by dismal sales in its women's health segment.
For Caligan Partners, a New York hedge fund co-founded two years ago by Johnson, a former executive at The  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), and Samuel Merksamer, who worked for legendary activist investor Carl Icahn, the settlement marks the second activist win this year.
In May, the Knowles Corporation settled with Caligan and two other investment managers and added one director to its board.
Companies have tended to try and settle with activist hedge funds, often offering them a few board seats, to avoid the cost and distraction of going to a vote in the proxy contest, academic research has shown."

At an event in Rome to present the accord, the company behind hit shows ""The Crown"" and ""Stranger Things"" also announced it would open offices and pay tax in Italy, in a boost to local authorities which have pursued big international tech companies on charges of dodging tax. 
The partnership comes amid heightened competition in the crowded European television market which has been squeezed by the growing popularity of on-demand streaming services like Netflix.
The streaming group, in turn, is stepping up strategic tie-ups in Europe to tackle a wave of new rivals, such as  Disney  (N:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) . Last month it signed a deal with France's Canal+ (PA:VIV) to add Netflix subscriptions to TV bundles.
Under the deal, Netflix and Mediaset, which is controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will co-finance seven movies shot in Italy by independent local filmmakers. 
The movies will be available worldwide on Netflix from next year. Mediaset will broadcast the Netflix-branded movies on its free-to-air channels in Italy 12 months later.

The first five films include ""The Divine Ponytail"", a biopic on Italian soccer legend Roberto Baggio, ""Caught by a wave"", a teenage romance set in Sicily and ""The last paradise"", the real life story of a 1950s farmer caught between social reform ideals and his love for a landowner's daughter.
""Alliances among large broadcasters focusing on original productions are one of the most effective answers to changes in the market,"" Mediaset head of content Alessandro Salem said.
Netflix has more than 2 million subscribers in Italy and will invest some 200 million euros in the next two years in Italian productions, though it has no plans to open studios in the near future, Reed said.
Netflix entered the Italian market in 2015. 
Reed said opening offices in Italy will turn the company into a regular taxpayer in the country.
The move comes amid growing pressure from tax authorities on big tech companies, who they accuse of not paying enough tax.
Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri on Tuesday called for ""profits to be taxed where they are made"" and said Rome would implement a tax on some Internet transactions next year.

A source told Reuters last week Italian prosecutors had opened an investigation into alleged tax evasion targeting Netflix following checks by tax authorities. Netflix said it was working with authorities and had paid all taxes due in Italy and other countries.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>","Italian prosecutors seek trial for BT Italy, former executives in fraud case","By Emilio Parodi
MILAN (Reuters) - Milan prosecutors investigating an accounting scandal at the Italian unit of British Telecom have asked for the unit and 23 defendants, including three former top executives, to be sent to trial, three people with knowledge of the case said on Tuesday.
The sources said the document filed by prosecutors, requesting a Milan judge to order a trial, alleges that a network of individuals in BT Italy exaggerated revenues, faked contract renewals and invoices and invented bogus supplier transactions in order to disguise the unit's true financial performance.
One of the three sources said the judge had scheduled a preliminary hearing in mid-December, at the end of which she will decide whether to put BT Group PLC's (L:BT) Italian unit and the defendants on trial on charges of false accounting, issuing invoices for fictitious operations and fraud in public procurement, or whether to dismiss the case.
A spokesperson for British Telecom declined to comment. ""We have not yet had formal notification as to what charges the Milan prosecutor has asked the Court to lay and against whom. Given that, it would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation,"" he said in an emailed statement.
In the past, the company has stated that it cooperated with the Italy judicial authority and believed it was the ""offended party"" of the accounting irregularities in Italy.
The scandal required the company to take a 530 million pound charge in early 2017. For a timeline, click on.
Milan prosecutors wrapped up their preliminary investigation last February, for the first time naming three group executives, all of whom have since left BT, as well as BT Italy itself, among an expanded list of 23 suspects.
Prosecutors cited Luis Alvarez and Richard Cameron, respectively former chief executive and former chief financial officer of BT Global Services, and Corrado Sciolla, formerly BT's head of continental Europe, as suspects of complicity in false accounting. A tax police report included in prosecutors' investigation alleged that top BT employees were at the heart of the problem.
Giuseppe Iannaccone, a lawyer for Sciolla, said he was ""totally confident that the trial will prove the absolute innocence"" of his client. A lawyer for Alvarez declined to comment and one for Cameron did not respond to a request for comment.
All the defendants have always denied any wrongdoing."

Aegis on Tuesday become the latest firm on Wall Street to lower its outlook on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), cutting its price target on the stock to $275 from $310, while maintaining its ""hold"" rating on the stock. Netflix was roughly flat on the day.
""We reduced both our near-term and longer-term sub estimates on Netflix following a 56 country-by-country look at both (daily active users) and (monthly active users), that showed usage weakness in several territories and less than stellar growth trends in others,"" Aegis said, according to Briefing.com. ""The data suggest some level of maturation of growth for Netflix in several key markets such as the U.S., Canada, Brazil, the U.K, Germany and France, while growth looks healthy in Asia and (Middle East and Africa)."" 
The price cut comes just a day after Evercore slashed its price target on the stock to $300 from $380 on worries that rising competition could bring the company’s business model under scrutiny at a time when its net subscriber additions are expected to peak. 
""With net subscriber additions potentially peaking this year, and ahead of a number of new Internet TV service launches from well-capitalized competitors over the coming months, questions about the company's business model now abound,"" Evercore wrote in note. 
Disney is set to launch its Disney+ service on Nov. 12 and Apple TV Plus is slated for launch on Nov. 1. But some on Wall Street do not see the risk of Netflix losing its dominance.
“Our new forecasts imply they are going to respond to content cost acceleration by revving up their own content spend that will allow them to maintain their subscriber growth while pushing back profitability materially,” Pivotal Research Group said in a recent note. 
“In the end our view is that very few players can (or will) keep up with these spend levels and that ultimately this will be a 2-horse race (NFLX and Disney) where both horses can win, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on the periphery and there is a reasonable shot that AT&T (NYSE:T) will screw up HBO as a competitor,” Pivotal said."

Regulators grounded the 737 MAX worldwide following a second fatal crash in March that killed all 157 people on board an Ethiopian Airlines plane, and is fighting to get the jet back in service later this year.
It said on Tuesday that an unidentified business jet customer had ordered one 737 MAX jet.
Boeing's net order tally, including cancellations, was a negative 84 for the first nine months of 2019, also hit by the bankruptcy of India's Jet Airways (NS:JET), which resulted in Boeing removing 210 aircraft from its order backlog.
European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) in contrast has 127 net orders this year and is within reach of its full-year goal of 880-890 deliveries despite factory snags.
Boeing deliveries fell 47% to 302 aircraft in the first nine months of 2019. Deliveries totaled 26 aircraft in September, down from 87 a year earlier.
Prior to the MAX grounding, Boeing, which delivered 806 aircraft in 2018, was targeting 900 aircraft deliveries this year."

LONDON (Reuters) - Want to invest in the habits of thirtysomethings? You've now got an index to track.
Index provider MSCI has launched a new set of thematic indexes for investors looking to focus their exposure on major trends such as millennials or disruptive technology which it expects to shape society and the economy for decades to come.
Equity indexing is big business with providers such as MSCI, FTSE Russell, Nasdaq, S&P and Dow Jones jostling for market share in an investment landscape where replicating lists of securities compiled along certain criteria has become increasingly popular and a benchmark for active investors.
Traditionally, index providers have sliced and diced stocks along sectors, size or geographic lines, but thematic indexing has emerged as a theme in recent years.
MSCI launched its first four thematic indexes with little fanfare as a test balloon late last year. However, those themes ranging from robotics to ageing society were ""not very original"" and addressing mostly already well established trends, said Stephane Mattatia, head of index products EMEA at MSCI.
Now MSCI is ready to push out the boat a bit - identifying five new ones in a pun to help investors catch an upside from a demographic and technological shift.
Apart from disruptive technology and millennials - referring to those born between 1980 and mid-1990s - the new batch of indexes includes smart cities, digital economy and future mobility.
""We are partnering up with external experts, which are not from the financial sphere but experts in their own fields,"" said Mattatia, adding MSCI had worked with author and strategic advisor Lukas Neckermann on the mobility and smart cities index.
""It is difficult for us to make sure that the theme is relevant for the economy and secondly it is difficult for us to find the right parameters for the theme.""
MSCI isn't the only index provider trying to ride the thematic indexing wave: Nasdaq launched a number of artificial intelligence and robotics indexes in recent years. Indexes for clean energy and ESG indexes are proliferating.
For MSCI, choosing index components is a language-based process.
Once a trend has been singled out, MSCI will identify half a dozen defining seed words - for the millennials benchmark, the list contained the likes of ""new generation"" or ""new technology"".
Using those seed words, MSCI derives a list of around 50 keywords, which in this case contains the likes of ""shared economy"", ""organic food"" or ""sport"".
The number of word matches in company results' filings plus other filters provide a score which helps decide index membership, Mattatia explained.
MSCI's millennial index contains 601 constituents and among the top ones are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) , Microsoft (O:MSFT), Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Paypal (O:PYPL)."

LONDON (Reuters) - Three former  Barclays  (L:BARC) executives lied to the market by hiding 322 million pounds ($395 million) in extra fees that the bank paid Qatar in return for vital funding during the global credit crisis, a prosecutor told a London court on Tuesday.
The case, one of the most high-profile brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), revolves around undisclosed payments to Qatar as Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds from investors in 2008 to avert a state bailout.
Opening the case for the prosecution, Edward Brown alleged that Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath pretended commissions paid to Qatar in 2008 were fees for separate, commercially valuable advisory services agreements (ASAs).
""Telling lies in this way, say the prosecution, is a criminal offence,"" Brown told the jury at London's Old Bailey criminal court in a trial scheduled to last up to five months.
""It is committing fraud by false representations. They acted dishonestly, say the prosecution, in order to preserve the future of the bank and to preserve their own positions.""
The men, aged between 60 and 64, deny wrongdoing.
The case hinges on what Barclays told the market in public documents, such as the prospectuses and subscription agreements that outlined the fees and commissions that the bank paid to investors, including former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani.
HIGH STAKES
Brown alleged that Barclays swept aside established banking practices of telling the truth in public documents about the terms on which investors were backing the bank as the credit crunch roiled markets, in order to secure around four billion pounds of investment from wealthy Qatar over 2008.
He alleged that the defendants used a ""carefully contrived mechanism"" to hide the additional fees with two Advisory Service Agreements that were not genuine, but a dishonest way of paying the Qataris extra and hiding the fees from the wider world.
The men sat impassively in the narrow, raised glass-surrounded dock.
The seven-year case is a rare example of a criminal prosecution of senior bankers at a global bank over conduct during the credit crunch more than a decade ago - and a high stakes trial for the SFO.
Jenkins is the former chairman of investment banking in the Middle East and north Africa, Kalaris headed the bank's wealth division at the time and Richard Boath was the investment bank division's head of corporate finance in EMEA.
Jenkins, 64, Kalaris, 63, and 60-year-old Boath are each charged with substantive fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.
The three men each face both charges over the June capital raising, which include an allegation they conspired with former finance director Chris Lucas to make dishonest representations in public documents for profit or to expose others to loss.
Jenkins also faces both charges over the second fundraising four months later.
Lucas has not been charged because he is too ill to stand trial, the jury was told. Qatar, a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday she preferred to use fines or other penalties on rule-busting companies rather than break them up, saying this approach would be less disruptive to the companies and the market.
Vestager is staying on in her job as European Competition Commissioner for another five years and now enjoys additional regulatory power to target the technology industry as part of a broader role ensuring Europe is fit for the digital age. 
Calls from critics and politicians to break up tech giants accused of abusing their position to squash competitors have intensified in recent months, especially in the United States.
Vestager, a former Danish economics minister, has gained a reputation as a tough enforcer, notably with a record fine totaling more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) on Alphabet unit Google (O:GOOGL) for throttling rivals.
Asked if she would consider breaking up companies that violate rules, Vestager told her confirmation hearing at the European Parliament that it was not her favored option.
""Breaking up companies, well, this is a tool that we have available, it can be done. The thing is I have obligation to use the least intrusive tool in order to restore fair competition,"" she told lawmakers in a packed chamber.
""Since it is quite a thing to break up a company, obviously I have an obligation to try what else can be a good tool to solve the situation that we are in,"" she said.
Vestager has in the past years handed out hefty fines as well as ordered companies to change their business practices.
She is expected to order U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (O:AVGO) to suspend some business practices until she completes her investigation into potential anti-competitive business practices, according to a source.
At the hearing, she said such interim measures had benefits. 
""We find it a high priority to speed up what we do,"" she said.
An interim measure against Broadcom expected in the coming weeks would be the European Commission's first in almost two decades. It bans certain activities until the regulator completes its years-long investigations and could pave the way for similar action against other tech companies.
Vestager also dismissed concerns of conflicts between her enforcer and new regulatory role, saying Commission decisions were taken jointly by commissioners and reinforced by independent advice from the EU executive's lawyers and economists.

The Commission as a whole requires EU lawmakers' approval before taking office in November.

The bank also underscored in a statement that a ""substantial"" number of jobs will be cut in Germany, which is ""by far"" Deutsche Bank's largest location.
The lender, which faces a loss for 2019, earlier this year announced sweeping cuts and plans to close down some operations after it called off merger talks with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Executives have said that all parts of the bank would be subject to cuts, without being more specific. The bank employs 91,700 people globally, of which 41,700 are in Germany, according to the bank's 2018 annual report.
Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Tuesday that about half of the 18,000 jobs cuts would occur in Germany as the bank tries to cut costs at its retail division.

""It is too early to comment on specific details. Also we don't comment on specific regions/locations,"" the bank said in an earlier statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock (N:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, is actively investing in companies including Adidas (DE:ADSGn), Tomra (OL:TOM) and  Ball Corp  (N:BLL) through a new circular economy fund that bets on sustainable business.
BlackRock is the biggest investor in fossil fuels and has faced criticism particularly for its continued exposure to coal.
It says much of that is through passive, index-linked investment, which accounts for roughly 90% of its $6.84 trillion in assets under management, and that it is also the biggest investor in renewable energy.
Sumana Manohar, a manager of the new fund which has been launched with charity the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, told reporters in London on Tuesday it was focused on exposure to scrap, recycling and reducing plastic waste, and is actively managed.
Started on Oct. 2 with $20 million of seed capital, the fund is spread over 30 to 50 companies. 
As examples, Manohar cited Adidas, which has committed to using recycled plastic and recycled polyester, Norway's Tomra, which provides what it calls ""reverse vending machines"" that allow consumers to return glass bottles and cans to supermarkets, and U.S. company Ball Corp, which makes recyclable aluminum packaging.
(GRAPHIC - MSCI vs Adidas vs Tomra vs Ball: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/14/8022/8022/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Manohar declined to name any other companies, but said she expected the fund to expand over the coming years and include, for instance, recycling businesses that provide battery minerals. 
Evy Hambro, global head of thematic and sector investing at BlackRock and who is also running the new fund, said the company had been assessing for about three years sustainability as a risk and an opportunity. 
Speaking at a mining conference in Johannesburg last week, Hambro, who co-manages the BlackRock World Mining Trust (L:BRWM), said flows into investment funds labeled environmentally-friendly will increase the cost of capital rises for companies seen as less sustainable.
One result of the analysis of risk and business disruption, Hambro said, had been the partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Named after the British yachtswoman who set a record for circumnavigating the globe, it focuses on shifting the economy to a circular model that eliminates waste.
Andrew Morlet, the foundation's chief executive, said it had previously worked closely with companies, governments and cities and the education system.

""The finance sector is a very important part of accelerating this transition,"" he said.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 10:36AM ET</span>",RBS investors call on new boss Rose to shrink NatWest Markets,"By Sinead Cruise, Simon Jessop and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - With weeks to go until Alison Rose takes over as CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS), shareholders are demanding a shake-up of the state-backed lender, with cuts to its minnow investment bank topping their agenda.
Rose's predecessor Ross McEwan said NatWest Markets was worth keeping for its ability to supply foreign exchange, financing and hedging to the bank's corporate clients but with profits dwindling, investors say it is ripe for cuts.
RBS's investment bank once spanned the globe with assets greater than Britain's GDP, but it also made catastrophic market bets that led to a 45 billion pound ($55 billion) taxpayer bailout during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
Its business is now largely confined to bond trading and earns around a 1% return on equity.
The debate over RBS's investment bank comes at a time when rival  Barclays  (L:BARC) faces pressure from activist investor Edward Bramson to scale back its own trading business.
Five investors told Reuters that Rose should consider shrinking NatWest Markets further as part of her bigger vision for RBS, which should also include detailed plans to tackle the threat from digital banks like Revolut.
""The big thing for me is they should look again at whether it is really worth persisting with NatWest Markets at this scale,"" said a top-10 investor at the bank who said he knows other shareholders who feel the same way.
NatWest Markets tied up around 35 billion pounds or 18.5% of the bank's assets while contributing just 11% of profits in the first half of the year, said Barrington Pitt-Miller, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, which has a small holding in the bank's shares.
Its 1% return on equity in the first half is below the bank's cost of capital, and with financial markets torpid in Europe and client trading subdued, there is little chance of squeezing out more profits.
""For a shareholder, purely staring at balance sheet intensity and returns, it is optically a poor business,"" Pitt-Miller said.
The difference now versus previous calls to scale back the investment bank is that RBS has sufficient capital buffers to absorb the losses crystallized by cutting it back, he said.
Describing NatWest Markets as one of RBS's two ""problem children"", together with Ulster Bank, a second major shareholder said Rose needed to decide if it was possible to improve NatWest Markets' returns ""in a meaningful way ... inside the next 3-5 years"".
""These consume 22% and 8% of the group's capital and basically make no money,"" the shareholder said.
"" (RBS) are clearly doing okay at taking costs out but the revenue environment is tough and volatile. We know how hard Barclays struggles to get a decent return out of their investment bank, and that is clearly a better business than NatWest Markets,"" the first top-10 investor said.
FUTURE IN BALANCE
Senior RBS executives agree decisions on the future for NatWest Markets will likely be taken in the coming months, with Rose broadly expected to lay out her strategy for the bank as a whole when full-year results are published in February.
The business is in the third year of a four-year turnaround, Chief Financial Officer Katie Murray told investors at a conference in September, and at the end of this restructuring its return on equity will be between 5-6%.
""It's not the endgame for where NatWest Markets will need to be,"" Murray said, while pointing out the value of the investment bank to business clients and the importance of continuity of service.
""We'll talk more and see over the coming months what the next stage looks like for NatWest Markets."""

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks sank and major bond yields nudged lower on Tuesday as concerns over China-U.S. trade talks, disappointing European company news and escalating tensions between London and Brussels sparked a flight to safety. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index snapped a two-day winning streak to lose 1%. Germany's trade-sensitive DAX declined 1.1%, with data showing an unexpected rise in industrial output failing to lift the index.
A drop in sterling over a fresh Brexit flare-up cushioned Britain's FTSE, which slipped just 0.3%.
The losses followed mixed messages on trade tensions, with Washington blacklisting eight Chinese tech companies and President Donald Trump suggested a deal to end the trade dispute may not yet be quite in the offing.
On Monday, U.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators launched two days of talks aimed at paving the way for the first minister-level negotiations in months on Thursday and Friday.
""We have a lot of uncertainty still around – last night, Trump said there would only be a deal if he really got his way, the Chinese want to exclude all the disputed topics ... some are cautiously optimistic, other are rather skeptical,"" said Antje Praefcke at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
""We expect that we could see a mini deal with neither Beijing nor Washington interested in letting this escalate. But for a real deal, the positions are too far apart.""
Mixed corporate news added to the downbeat picture, with LSE shares tumbling 5% after Hong Kong pulled out of its takeover bid for the exchange, while German biotech firm Qiagen plunged 20% to three-year lows after a sales warning.
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, slipped 0.1%.
Europe's losses followed healthy gains in Asia, where Japan's Nikkei climbed 1.0% as MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.55%, led by gains in tech shares in South Korea and Taiwan.
Hong Kong extended gains after the territory's leader said she had no plans to use emergency regulation ordinance to introduce other laws. 
Chinese mainland stocks returned from a week-long holiday with a 0.6% rise. The National Holiday celebrations also offered a rare respite to China's retail sector, with spending on goods and dining returning to growth this year.
Yet a private survey showed growth in China's services sector at its slowest in seven months in September, offering little momentum to an economy that has been expanding at its weakest pace in almost three decades. 
With the focus turning to trade talks, Trump also said he hoped Beijing found a humane and peaceful resolution to political protests in Hong Kong, and said that situation had the potential to hurt the discussions. 
An increase in U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 30% from 25%, is scheduled for Oct. 15. Trump has said it will take effect if no progress is made in the negotiations.
""People are hoping Trump may postpone some of the upcoming tariffs,"" said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. ""Nevertheless, you can't ignore that fact that, up until now, the market has underestimated Trump's determination on tariffs.""
U.S. futures pointed to a 0.6% drop on open for Wall Street. On Monday, the S&P 500 lost 0.45%, unable to cling on to gains made after positive tweets and headlines about the trade talks.
LOSING MOMENTUM 
The flight to safety also added to pressure in fixed income markets with German bund yields nudging lower while U.S. Treasuries eased ahead of some $78 billion in note and bond supply slated for auction this week.
Meanwhile in currencies the dollar lost momentum, dipping 0.1% against a basket of rivals after posting its biggest single-day rise in a week in the previous session. The safe-haven yen rose, with the dollar trading at 106.89.
Markets will be keenly watching comments on Tuesday from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after weak data raised concerns the U.S. economy may be heading towards a protracted slowdown.
The euro got a boost from the healthy German industrial output data, rising 0.2% to $1.0983 though not far off the more than a two-year low it hit last week. 
Sterling tumbled to a one-month low against the euro after reports that Brexit talks between Britain and Brussels were close to breaking down.
Tempers flared as the EU accused Britain of playing a ""stupid blame game"" after a Downing Street source said a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands.
""Brexit is back with GBP underperforming other major currencies as the battle lines between the UK and EU have hardened further,"" Ned Rumpeltin, European head of FX Strategy wrote in a note to clients. 
The pound fell 0.5% to a one-week low of $1.2226, and weakened more than 0.7% against the euro, touching a low of 89.93 pence - its weakest since Sept. 9. [GBP/]
In emerging currency markets the focus was on the lira, which was treading water after hitting a five-week low in early trade and a more than 2% tumble on Monday over concerns about a planned Turkish military incursion in northern Syria.
Trump threatened to destroy Turkey's economy if Ankara took those moves too far, after the U.S. leader opened that door by withdrawing U.S. troop from the area.

Worries over the health of the global economy sent oil prices 1.4% lower. Brent crude futures stood at $57.5483 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at $51.99. [O/R]

Under the partnership, consumers browsing toys on the ToysRUs.com website, relaunched on Tuesday, can click on ""Buy now at Target.com"" to complete their purchase.
Shoppers can also take advantage of Target's free two-day shipping, same-day curbside or store order pickup, same-day delivery with Shipt, the retailer said.
""By applying our capabilities in a new way with Toys""R""Us, we can serve even more toy shoppers, drive new growth, and build on our toy leadership,"" said Nikhil Nayar, senior vice president of merchandising at Target.
Retailers like Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Target have been vying for a share of toy sales in the U.S. after the bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation of Toys 'R' Us last year.
The partnership with Tru Kids builds on Target's earlier efforts to boost its toy sales. Earlier this month, Target opened 25 new Disney stores inside select Target locations with a ""shop-in-shop"" layout, near its kids clothing and toy section.
Last year, Target added nearly a quarter of a million square feet of new space to its toy business across 500 of its stores, to notch up more toy sales."
613,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 09:13AM ET</span>",WeWork's financing lifeline hinges on SoftBank talks,"By Anirban Sen and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - WeWork is locked in negotiations this week with its largest shareholder, Softbank Group Corp (T:9984), over a new $1 billion investment to enable the shared office space company to go through a major restructuring, according to sources familiar with discussions.
If the talks are successful, WeWork, which had to abandon an initial public offering last week because of investor concerns about how it was valued and its business model, will seek to negotiate a $3 billion debt deal with JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the sources said.
SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son publicly backed WeWork in an interview with Nikkei Business magazine this week, saying in 10 years the company would be ""making substantial profits.""
WeWork and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests to comment. 
However, SoftBank and its Vision Fund, which controls about 29 percent of WeWork after investing or committing to invest $10.65 billion, are facing unusual crosscurrents as they seek a new deal. 
SoftBank wants to renegotiate a $1.5 billion warrant deal, which was agreed in January based on WeWork being valued at around $47 billion, before providing the additional $1 billion, one of the sources said. WeWork's valuation estimates had fallen to as low as $10 billion to $12 billion around the time that it decided to abandon the IPO, Reuters reported last month.
Normally, SoftBank would be expected to seek as low of a valuation as possible for the renegotiated and new investments so that it can pick up a bigger stake. 
But securities analysts say that if it invests in WeWork at a valuation below about $24 billion-$26 billion, which is the estimated basis for its entire stake, then SoftBank and its Vision Fund could suffer on-paper losses. Those would be large if the valuation were closer to $10 billion.
The success of the talks with both SoftBank and Wall Street is essential if WeWork is going to survive in anything like its current form. 
The company was already expected to pare back its ambitions significantly and to cut several thousand jobs, according to a source familiar with the matter.
WeWork lost $1.9 billion in 2018 and burned through $2.36 billion in cash in the first half of this year, and it could run out of money in the second quarter of 2020 at its current burn rate, according to an analysis last week by securities house Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 
HOPES FOR DEAL NEXT WEEK
WeWork hopes to complete the talks with SoftBank and JP Morgan as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning the plans are subject to change and timetable may still shift.
The bank does not want to get into intensive negotiations over the debt deal until it is sure that SoftBank has reached a new financing deal, one of the sources said. 
It was unclear what kind of collateral the bank would demand.
Originally, a group of banks was prepared to provide WeWork with a $6 billion line of credit provided it raised $3 billion in the IPO.
JPMorgan declined to comment. 
SoftBank has been reluctant to plow more cash into WeWork but now concludes that a fresh investment is necessary in order to have any hope of salvaging the investment it has already made, according to one source. 
In the run-up to the planned IPO, investors raised concerns about WeWork's ballooning losses and the potentially risky way in which it operates by signing long-term leases and then renting out spaces short term. 
In recent weeks, global credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings have also downgraded WeWork's credit ratings deeper into junk territory, while the company's junk bond is trading at a record low.
WeWork last month replaced co-founder Adam Neumann as CEO with insiders Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham taking on the joint CEO roles. 
The pair have talked about the need to return to WeWork's core business of renting out trendy office space to freelancers and enterprises. That would pull the company back from the fringe activities Neumann had forayed into, such as a school, apartment buildings and various businesses.

The firm expects to tell staff about jobs cuts and planned divestments as early as next week, hoping the news will coincide with a new financing deal being in place, the sources said, again cautioning that the timeline is subject to change.

Calvey and other executives at private equity group Baring Vostok were detained in February. 
They deny wrongdoing and say the charges against them are being used to pressure them in a business dispute over control of mid-sized bank Vostochny.
The court's decision to keep Calvey and French Baring Vostok executive Phillipe Delpal under house arrest was ""groundless"", Baring Vostok said in a company statement. 
""The court is following the lead of the investigation, which is delaying the case in order to put pressure on our employees, and completely ignores the position of the defense,"" it said. 
""The criminal case was brought against them to exert pressure in a commercial dispute and is completely untenable.""
Calvey and Delpal were first detained in February after investigators accused them and others of embezzling 2.5 billion roubles ($38.31 million). They denied wrongdoing. 
Calvey was placed under house arrest in April, after two months in jail, while Delpal was moved from jail to house arrest in August.

""We are convinced that our colleagues' innocence will eventually be established,"" Baring Vostok said in its statement.

Branson founded space ventures like Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit to cash in on rising demand for space travel and launch services for a boom in the number of smaller satellites.
Reuters earlier reported Virgin Galactic's plans for going public by the year-end.
Boeing would receive new shares of Virgin Galactic in return for the investment made by its venture capital arm Boeing HorizonX Ventures.
In February, the company took a step closer to its goal of suborbital flights for space tourists when its rocket plane soared to the edge of space with a test passenger for the first time. 
Virgin Galactic has so far invested $1 billion to develop spaceflights that will fly people into space and can be reused.
Branson's ambitious timeline for taking customers into space has suffered delays and setbacks since the company's inception.

Hundreds of people from 60 countries, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber, have paid or put down deposits to fly on one of Virgin's suborbital flights. Some of Virgin Galactic's ticket holders have been waiting over 14 years for their trip.

The company also replaced its three- to five-year forecast with a shorter-term outlook which included lower percentage growth targets than those given previously for the longer period.
It said it now expects same-store sales at its U.S. stores to rise 2% to 5% and its international segment to grow 1% to 4% in two to three years, compared with a previous 3% to 6% growth at either segment over three to five years.
The pizza chain, one of the modern faces of pizza delivery, faces competition from the aggressive promotions and wider range of food offered by aggregators such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, Postmates and GrubHub (N:GRUB). 
Same-store sales at restaurants open for more than an year in the United States rose 2.4% in the quarter, its slowest growth in at least 15 quarters. Analysts had estimated a 2.84% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The slowdown in the market came despite the company offering half-off on online orders for a week in August and launching a 20% off offer for late-night orders in September.
Domino's is also one of the largest chains to stay off third-party delivery apps altogether, as more restaurant chains become heavily dependent on meal-delivery companies to boost sales at the cost of lower profit margins.
Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Domino's has also been aggressively opening new restaurants in a move it calls ""fortressing"" to facilitate faster delivery to locations beyond homes and offices, ranging from beaches to bus stops.
Its international business, whose performance has been mixed against market expectations in recent quarters, saw same-store sales grow just 1.7%, missing estimates of a 2.86% rise.
The company's net income rose to $86.4 million, or $2.05 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 8, from $84.1 million, or $1.95 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.07 per share.

Total revenue rose 4.4% to $820.8 million, missing analysts' estimate of $823.9 million.

Tear, who will replace Henrik Clausen, told Reuters he would continue with an existing turnaround plan, which aims to boost margins by cutting the company's distribution network and leaving it with fewer selling points. 
""In Logitech we managed to get a positive growth mindset throughout the organization, and I hope to do the same with B&O, focusing more on the financial results when executing our strategy,"" said Tear, who was vice president at keyboard and mice maker Logitech until April. 
Shares in B&O are down more than 70% over the past year as it has struggled with weak demand for its TVs and repeatedly cut sales and profit forecasts. 
The stock rose as much as 9.5% at the market open and was 3.3% higher at 1138 GMT. 
ABG Sundal Collier analyst André Thormann said investors were reacting positively to the change in leadership, but doubted whether it would be enough on its own. 
""People are important, but it is hard to tell whether a new CEO will be enough to turn things around as the company has already been trying to face its product challenges and transform the business,"" Thormann said. 
B&O's biggest shareholder is Chinese investor Qi Jianhong, who owns just under 15% in the company through his Sparkle Roll companies, according to Refinitiv data. In April 2016, B&O rejected a takeover bid from Sparkle Roll.
B&O Chairman Ole Andersen said in August, after the company's third profit warning, that ""the warning bells"" were starting to ring and that the board would listen if approached by a buyer.

The company, whose televisions can sell for up to 96,000 Danish crowns ($14,123), was founded in 1925 and built its initial success on innovative audio technology.

RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi central bank is vetting local lenders' exposure to Saudi Aramco ahead of an initial public offering (IPO) of the state-oil giant that will likely see large numbers of Saudi investors seek loans to buy its stock, three sources familiar with the matter said.
The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, or SAMA, contacted Saudi banks last week, asking them a series of questions about their lending exposure to Aramco, two of the sources said.
Saudi investors are expected to be large buyers of Aramco shares, partly because of a ""patriotic"" push to own a piece of the kingdom's crown jewels after an attack on oil facilities last month crippled Saudi crude production and exposed the country's defense vulnerabilities.
SAMA is checking whether local banks have the capacity to handle demand for loans linked to the IPO, one of the sources said. Up to 6-7 million local investors are expected to participate in the listing, he added, but it is not clear how many of them will use credit to finance their share purchases.
The authority is assessing ""risk weighting and wants to ensure there will be no (regulatory) breaches"", a second source said.
The source said SAMA's questions - via telephone and email - were around how banks classify their exposure to Aramco, including its subsidiaries.
""Aramco has so much ownership in so many entities ... it's hard to say how much exposure it comes to,"" he said.
The world's most profitable company, Aramco dominates the local economy with over a dozen domestic subsidiaries in addition to partial ownership in joint ventures including power generation companies and large petrochemical firms such as Petro Rabigh (SE:2380).
Saudi banks have been under pressure in the past few years from a slowdown in the construction and retail sectors, but ""funding and liquidity remained sound, with deposit and loan growth roughly in line, and capital ratios solid"", Fitch rating agency said this summer.
The central bank's governor, Ahmed al-Kholifey, said last month that he did not expect the IPO to affect liquidity in the Saudi banking sector, but that SAMA may revise its lending regulations to facilitate availability of liquidity to investors before the IPO.
SAMA and Aramco did not respond to requests for comment.
PRESSING AHEAD
Saudi Arabia is pressing ahead with plans to sell between 1% and 2% of its oil company, the world's largest, through a local listing, which might be followed by additional share sales locally and internationally.
Aramco has approached wealthy Saudi families in recent weeks as part of wider efforts to build a large investor base to achieve the $2 trillion valuation targeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, two sources previously told Reuters.
The local listing – crucial to Prince Mohammed's plans to wean the Saudi economy off its oil dependence – could raise more than $20 billion in its initial phase.
Aramco has been meeting analysts over the past few weeks to market the company ahead of the listing. Analysts' reports are expected to be released on Oct. 20.
The company's main advisers last week started pre-IPO meetings with potential investors in the United States, Europe and Asia, to gauge demand for the deal, two sources said.
An IPO prospectus in Arabic could be released to investors on Oct. 25 and an English one for the wider market on Oct. 27, the sources said.
This week, Fitch downgraded Aramco by one notch to an 'A' credit rating, citing last month's attacks and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
Riyadh has blamed adversary Iran for the attacks, a charge Tehran denies.
Aramco's bonds fell after the rating announcement, which was widely expected as it followed a similar downgrade of the sovereign on Sept. 30."

(Reuters) - SparkCognition Inc, a U.S. start-up that builds artificial intelligence technology for the industrial sectors and counts  Boeing Co  (N:BA) among its investors, said on Tuesday it raised $100 million in a new private funding round.
Led by Santa Monica, California-based venture capital firm March Capital Partners, the fundraising values SparkCognition at more than $725 million, according to Pitchbook. Singapore state investment company Temasek also invested in the company.
Former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO) former CEO John Chambers,  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) Co former CEO Andrew Liveris, and the former president of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and current  Barrick Gold Corp  (TO:ABX) chairman John Thornton were among the investors in the latest round, the company said.
Austin, Texas-based SparkCognition announced last year it would partner with Boeing in a joint venture to create a routing system for self-driving planes using artificial intelligence.
""You hear a lot of about self-driving cars. But why can’t every industrial vehicle drive itself? Why can’t every industrial asset maintain itself? That’s the runway we’re talking about,"" Amir Husain, SparkCognition’s founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview.

Rothschild has been brought in to handle the deal, the people said. 
Blackstone and Kirkbi, the owner of the Lego toy brand, declined to comment, as did Rothschild.
The investors had bought the company from private equity firm Charterhouse in 2015 for 960 million euros.
Based in Muenster, Germany, Armacell operates 25 manufacturing facilities around the world and employs 3,000 staff. It specialises in flexible insulation foams used to lag pipes and ductwork in buildings. 
Armacell is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 130 million euros this year and could be valued at 10-12 times that, the sources said. 
Listed peers Rockwool (CO:ROCKb) and Kingspan (I:KSP) trade at 6.4 and 15 times their expected core earnings, respectively.
Armacell was founded in 2000 as part of a buyout of the insulation activities of U.S.-based floorings maker Armstrong World Industries (N:AWI) by investors Gilde und CVC. It was sold to buyout firm Investcorp before Charterhouse acquired it in 2013.

Since the takeover by Blackstone and Kirkbi, Armacell has made five acquisitions of its own. In 2018, the company posted an EBITDA of 106 million euros on sales of 610 million.

623,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 07:59AM ET</span>",Special Report: Index funds invest trillions but rarely challenge management,"By Tim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - Index funds now control half https://tmsnrt.rs/2Mhmc6L the U.S. stock mutual fund market, giving the biggest funds enormous power to influence decisions and demand better returns at the companies in which they invest trillions of dollars.
But the leading U.S. index fund firms, BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), Vanguard Group and  State Street  Corp (N:STT), rarely use that clout. Instead, they overwhelmingly support the decisions and pay packages of executives at the companies in their portfolios, including the worst performers, according to a Reuters analysis of their shareholder-voting records.
The three fund firms, for instance, supported doubling the pay of the chief executive at California utility PG&E Corp (N:PCG) after its stock plummeted over potential liability from maintenance problems linked to California wildfires. The funds supported big pay packages for executives at beauty products company  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) - including nearly $500,000 for their children’s tuition - as the company struggled to digest its acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business. And all three cast pivotal votes against the proposed reform of splitting the CEO and chairman roles at  General Electric  Co (N:GE) after a decade of poor performance.
Such votes reflect a larger trend of deference to management, according to an analysis of proxy voting at 300 of the worst-performing companies in the Russell 3000 index, as measured by three-year returns through the end of 2018. The analysis was conducted for Reuters by shareholder-voting data firm Proxy Insight. 
The study looked at the 300 worst performers who held proxy votes in 2018. It found that BlackRock voted with management 93% of the time, followed by Vanguard at 91% and State Street at 84% during the proxy year ended June 30, 2018. The analysis showed that the three index fund firms supported management at the worst-performing Russell 3000 firms only slightly less often than they did for all companies in the index, regardless of performance.
“If we think that informed and engaged shareholders play an important role in disciplining company management, the rise of index investing is a problem,” said Dorothy Lund, a law professor at USC’s Gould School of Law and an author of several published corporate-governance studies.
Actively managed funds also routinely support management in proxy ballots. But their voting records are not directly comparable to those of index funds because active managers routinely signal their displeasure with company management by simply dumping a stock or never buying it. Index funds, by contrast, are prevented from active trading by their own rules because they aim to match, rather than beat, the market. They are required to own all the companies in the index they track, such as the Russell 3000 or the S&P 500 - high-flyers and dogs alike.
That leaves proxy voting as the primary leverage for index funds firms to hold companies accountable for practices that undermine shareholders’ interests, such as exorbitant executive pay. But the index providers face powerful disincentives in confronting management at the companies in their portfolios, industry experts said. 
With no mission to outperform market indices, the funds lack a financial incentive to ensure that portfolio companies are well-run, Lund said. Their business models also rely heavily on recruiting everyday investors away from actively managed mutual funds with the promise of lower fees. And large companies - like the ones in major stock indexes - are key to acquiring new customers for the big fund firms: BlackRock, Vanguard and rival firms count on corporations to offer their funds to employees in retirement plans, which often limit the options workers can select.
Those vital business relationships mean index funds treat their portfolio companies more like clients, Lund said in an interview.
“The problem is going to be greater as these index funds get more money,” she said.
The index fund firms say they take seriously the watchdog role that institutional investors have historically played in the stock market. Proxy voting, they say, is only a small part of their regular engagement with companies, and they prefer to address problems privately.
“Continuing to have a dialogue without airing all of our dirty laundry” helps maintain long-term relationships, said Glenn Booraem, who oversees Vanguard’s proxy voting and its interaction with portfolio companies.
BlackRock said it talks or emails with executives and directors - sometimes for years - before voting against them. “A vote against management is a sign of a failed engagement,” Michelle Edkins, who oversees BlackRock’s proxy voting, said in an interview.
“It’s wrong to measure the effectiveness of BlackRock’s investment stewardship efforts solely by our proxy voting record,” BlackRock said in a statement. “That fails to recognize our process of engaging directly with companies to enhance the long-term value of our clients’ assets.”
BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard all declined requests to discuss their votes on specific proxy proposals at poor-performing firms, or to provide details of their private interventions at laggard companies. State Street declined to make executives available for comment.
“We use our voice and vote to influence companies on long-term governance and sustainability issues,” State Street spokeswoman Olivia Offner said in an email.
Proxy votes on proposals by the company or its shareholders, influence key issues of executive pay, director appointments and strategic plans, along with a company’s actions to address controversial issues such as climate change or gender pay equity.
BlackRock opposed executive pay just 3% of the time in 2018 at Russell 3000 companies and Vanguard opposed pay 5% of the time, according to Proxy Insight. State Street funds did not support pay 9% of the time in that group of companies, according to Proxy Insight. The figure includes a small number of abstentions by State Street.
Compare that to America’s largest public retirement funds. The $378 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System opposed executive pay 53% of the time in the first seven months of 2019 at U.S. companies, according to its latest report.
The $210 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund opposed executive pay packages 27% of the time last year at U.S. companies, a spokesman for the fund said. The $200 billion retirement system run by the Florida State Board of Administration voted against executive compensation 64% of the time among 2,226 U.S. companies during the twelve months ended June 30, Jacob Williams (NYSE:WMB), the system’s corporate governance manager, told Reuters. 
(For a graphic comparing how large index firms and pension plans voted in 2018, see: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/INDEX-FUND-SUPPORT/0H001QX7W8HL/index.html )
Some activist investors cite the low rate of negative votes by top investors as a reason for the persistence of unpopular corporate practices, such as rich executive compensation and poor disclosure of climate impacts. Median CEO pay rose 25% to $12.1 million in 2018 from $9.7 million in 2014 at the 500 largest publicly-traded U.S. companies by revenue, according to the latest disclosures analyzed by executive pay researcher Equilar.
Company leaders usually won’t even discuss an issue unless about a third of investors cast opposing votes, said Tim Brennan, who until June oversaw proxy votes and resolutions as chief financial officer for the Unitarian Universalist Association.
“The votes definitely matter,” he said.
CalPERS investment director Simiso Nzima said CEO pay design would improve if other big investors voted more critically.
“Talking to companies behind the scenes on this particular issue is a bit like trying to boil the ocean,” Nzima said. 
‘EXCESSIVELY DEFERENTIAL’
Few foresaw an investing revolution when Jack Bogle of Vanguard introduced the first index fund, now called the Vanguard 500 fund (N:VOO), in 1976. Rather than trying to beat the market, Bogle simply sought to match it - while chopping fees to investors. Bogle, who died in January, often recalled how early index funds were disparaged as mediocre, even called “un-American.”
After the 2008 financial crisis whipsawed retirement account balances, many investors stopped trying to beat the market and embraced the lower fees of passive funds. At the end of August, passive U.S. stock funds managed $4.27 trillion - up from less than $1 trillion before the crisis, and slightly more than the $4.25 trillion in actively managed U.S. stock funds, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. 
Challenging company management in proxy votes creates adversarial relationships that do not serve the business interests of the index funds, Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard University corporate governance scholar, wrote in a May research paper. The index fund firms are “excessively deferential” to the managers of their portfolio companies, he wrote, because that approach better serves their corporate mission to grow their assets-under-management - and the fees that come with managing those assets. Bebchuk and several other academics say the index fund providers do not want to rankle senior management at publicly traded U.S. corporations because they also want to make money selling index funds to their employees through company retirement plans.
Effectively monitoring the thousands of firms in stock-market indexes would also require considerable staff and resources with little tangible payoff to an index fund’s bottom line. Because the funds all own the same stocks – under formulas calibrated to track a broad index – they can’t compete with one another on market performance. Instead, they compete with aggressive discounting of fees. 
Those low costs are also the biggest selling point of all index funds over their actively managed competitors, which must charge more to pay for teams of managers who constantly research companies and cull low performers from their portfolios.Index funds’ business model and cost pressures don’t allow for much company research, said Ron Gilson, a professor at the law schools of Columbia University and Stanford University who follows the industry.
“There’s not much room for them to be investing in stewardship, particularly when real stewardship is expensive and you’re charging some customers close to a zero management fee,” Gilson said in an interview. 
BlackRock, for instance, has 45 people on its team that handles proxy votes, according to a company report in August. The votes cover about 16,000 corporate meetings per year. Last year, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) moved about $10 billion in equity index assets into accounts that would allow the retirement plan to take over proxy voting – and take it away from external portfolio managers including BlackRock, according to publicly available meeting minutes.
With expanded voting power, LACERA’s support for management proposals dropped to 80% in 2018 from 93% the previous year, when BlackRock had more sway, according to LACERA board presentations. Support for shareholder proposals rose to 74% in 2018, up from 56% support in 2017. LACERA declined to comment.
BACKING EXECUTIVE PAY
During the 2018 proxy season, top index fund providers supported corporate leaders through some trying times for shareholders of the companies in the bottom 10% of the Russell 3000 index.
The three funds’ backing of a big raise for PG&E chief executive Geisha Williams - to $8.6 million in 2018 from $4.2 million the year before - came after the company suspended its dividend. The executive pay package received overwhelming support from other investors, even though a stable dividend is a key reason for owning utility stocks. PG&E stock lost a quarter of its value in 2017. The utility sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after severe wildfires in 2017 and 2018 resulted in more than $30 billion in liabilities amid investigations into whether the utility’s equipment had caused the blazes. 
When the index fund companies helped defeat the proposal to split the chairman and CEO roles at GE in 2018, their huge stakes in the company allowed them collectively to cast 1.3 billion votes against the measure out of a total of 2.8 billion votes in opposition. Investors supporting the measure cast nearly 2 billion votes in favor, hoping to curb the power of GE’s CEO in the boardroom.
In November 2017, the three index fund firms unanimously backed the pay packages at beauty products company Coty Inc (N:COTY), one of the worst performers in the Russell 3000 index after losing 72% of its value in the three years ended in 2018. The nearly $500,000 in tuition payments for executives’ children – an unusual perk – came as part of pay packages that ranged from $3 million to $12 million. The Florida State Board of Administration was one of the few dissenters to vote against Coty’s pay arrangements.
The large index funds also backed the re-election of Coty Chairman Lambertus Becht, who received a special $3.6 million payout for his work on the company’s $12.5 billion acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business in 2016. Top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services said Becht’s total compensation of $4.6 million “significantly exceeds market norms for non-employee director pay.” Other major investors voted in favor of Becht’s re-election, but some dumped Coty’s stock as it struggled to digest the acquisition.
Spokespeople for PG&E, General Electric and Coty declined to comment for this story.
It’s rare in proxy voting for a majority of investors in a company to oppose executive pay packages. Even in such cases, BlackRock usually supports management. In 2018, among the 57 companies in the Russell 3000 that failed to win a majority of investor support for their pay plans, BlackRock sided with management about 60% of the time, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy and company voting records.
BlackRock supported rich pay packages for directors at Clovis Oncology, who each earned about $500,000 a year despite the firm’s modest market capitalization of $1.4 billion. That’s twice the typical pay of directors at the 500 largest U.S. companies by revenue, according to Equilar. Vanguard and State Street sided against BlackRock. In all, 58% of votes cast were against a proposal to ratify director pay. Clovis, which declined to comment, responded by cutting director pay by one-quarter after taking into account the low support and investor feedback, the company said in its 2019 proxy.
 Switch  Inc (N:SWCH) CEO Rob Roy received nearly $100 million in compensation in 2017 when he took the Las Vegas-based data center operator public. The following year, BlackRock backed the election of three directors on Switch’s compensation committee who had awarded Roy his big pay package. State Street backed two of them. Vanguard voted against all three on the compensation committee.
“The awards are unusual, and the complete lack of performance-vesting criteria heightens concern,” proxy advisory firm ISS wrote in a May 2018 research report. Each of the three Switch directors received 97% of votes cast.
Switch shares lost about two-thirds of their value in the 15 months after its October 2017 initial public offering. Switch and CEO Roy declined to comment.
ALL ABOARD FOR AN $84 MILLION PAYOUT
In one case, BlackRock noted concerns about a big payout to an executive but voted for it anyway. 
In February 2017, legendary railroad executive Hunter Harrison demanded $84 million in upfront money to join CSX Corp (N:CSX) as CEO. BlackRock balked at the size of the payment and cited investor concerns about Harrison’s health, according to a June 2017 BlackRock report on proxy voting. Before investors voted on his pay package, a Wall Street Journal story detailed how an undisclosed medical condition forced Harrison to work from home, breathing with the help of an oxygen machine.
BlackRock, which owned a 6% stake in the rail firm, put aside its concerns and supported the pay package, which received 93% support from all investors. Vanguard, with a 7% stake, and State Street, with around 4%, also voted in favor. Several months later, in December 2017, Harrison died.
CSX adopted a rule requiring its next CEO to submit to a physical examination. The resolution that prompted that change at CSX was filed by Virginia attorney John Fishwick Jr., and it was adopted by the company before any vote. He said he was surprised none of the big fund managers stepped up with their own proposal. CSX declined to comment on Harrison’s pay.
“These funds talk a big game, using a lot of flowery language,” Fishwick told Reuters in a phone interview. “I have not seen that they’ve done much.”

624,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 07:59AM ET</span>",PG&E Warns of Huge Power Shutoff as California Becomes Tinderbox,"(Bloomberg) -- Bankrupt utility owner Pacific Gas & Electric Co (NYSE:PCG) issued an unprecedented warning that it may cut power in almost 30 California counties to avoid wildfires as hot, arid winds leave the region dry as a tinderbox.
The move may affect more than 600,000 customers across Northern and Central California, including Santa Clara, San Mateo, Napa and Alameda counties, according to a statement Tuesday. The shutoff could begin when winds peak early Wednesday and last through mid-Thursday.
“This is shaping up to be one of the most severe dry wind events we’ve seen in our territory in recent years,” Michael Lewis, senior vice president of PG&E Electric Operations, said in the statement. “It could take several days to fully restore power after the weather passes and safety inspections are completed.”
PG&E and other California utilities have been taking aggressive measures to keep equipment from sparking blazes after power lines ignited catastrophic fires in 2017 and 2018. For PG&E, the stakes are especially high. It already faces an estimated $30 billion in wildfire liabilities. Another major blaze sparked by its equipment could upend the company’s restructuring plans.
The National Weather Service has posted red flag warnings in parts of six western states, meaning the fire danger is high. In California, the warnings ring the Bay Area including Napa County, where the Tubbs fire killed at least 22 and destroyed more than 5,600 structures in October 2017.
A low-pressure system sweeping in from the north will pass east of the region, driving winds off the Sierra Nevada mountains that become hotter and drier as they approach the Pacific Ocean. It’s a common weather pattern this time of year, and September and October are historically the height of California’s fire season.
“The worst of it could very well be tomorrow, but some threat continues probably through Thursday,” said Marc Chenard, a senior branch forecaster with the U.S. Weather Prediction Center.
The risk of fire will also be high Thursday in portions of Southern (NYSE:SO) California, which has suffered its own deadly blazes in recent years.
PG&E’s service warning includes parts of California’s most populous areas, including Santa Clara County’s almost 2 million people and Alameda County’s 1.7 million residents, according to state data.
The company began proactively cutting electricity last year to head off fire risk, and this would be the biggest shutoff to date based on the number of counties potentially affected."
625,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 07:41AM ET</span>",White House Zeroes In on Limit to Chinese Stocks in Pension Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a particular focus on investments made by U.S. government pension funds, people familiar with the internal deliberations said.
The efforts are advancing even after American officials pushed back strongly against a Bloomberg News report late last month that a range of such limits was under review. Trump officials last week held meetings on the issue just hours after White House adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the report as “fake news,” and zeroed in on how to prevent U.S. government retirement funds from financing China’s economic rise, the people said.
The office of Larry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, convened a policy-coordination committee meeting last Tuesday, which also included officials from the National Security Council and the Treasury Department, the people added. An NEC spokesman declined to comment.
The yen strengthened against the dollar, U.S. stock futures went lower and bond yields extended declines.
According to people familiar with the meeting, the administration’s focus is now on ways to further scrutinize index providers’ decision to add Chinese firms they consider a material risk for American investors. It’s still unclear what legal authority the White House would rely on to force major indexes to drop certain Chinese companies.
At least one of the issues under consideration is time-sensitive. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board in 2017 made a decision that by mid-2020 the international fund offered to workers in the government’s pension would mirror the MSCI All Country World Index, which captures emerging markets, including China.
Some U.S. lawmakers and China hawks outside the government have pushed the board to reverse that decision and, if necessary, have the administration use executive power to protect U.S. government workers. They argue that Americans are harmed by channeling money into Chinese firms that are allegedly involved in human-rights violations and at the center of U.S. national security concerns.
The change would expose almost $50 billion in retirement assets of federal government employees, including members of the U.S. Armed Forces, to severe and undisclosed material risks associated with many of the Chinese companies listed on the index, opponents argue.
Blacklist
The Commerce Department on Monday put a number of Chinese entities -- including surveillance technology company Hikvision -- on an export blacklist that prohibits American firms from doing business with them unless they have a U.S. government license to do so. Hikvision, which is listed on the MSCI All Country World index, has been cited by Trump’s advisers as one of several Chinese companies that presents a threat to American investors.
In response on Tuesday, a Chinese official warned it would retaliate.
As with most policy discussions in the Trump administration, the president’s advisers have a range of opinions on the matter and haven’t agreed on a path forward yet, people close to the deliberations said. The officials do seem to agree, however, that there’s a political upside to engaging on the issue, the people added.
The White House is citing investor protection as the main reason for taking action and is carefully working to keep the matter separate from the ongoing trade negotiations that are set to resume in Washington this week.
“What we’re looking at is U.S. investor protections, transparency and compliance with a number of laws,"" Kudlow told reporters Monday. “There’s been complaints by the stock exchanges about this, the SEC has heard complaints, so we’ve opened up a study group to take a look at it, but we’re very early in our deliberations.”
Trade Talks
Any action on capital flows could undoubtedly be seen as a negotiating chip by President Donald Trump, who has in the past put other issues on the table in the talks with Beijing.
The Office of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer isn’t playing a key role in the discussions around capital flows because they are separate from the trade talks, two of the people said. A spokesman for Lighthizer didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Lighthizer, however, is Trump’s point person in talks for a trade deal and any Chinese reaction to the investment limit plans would likely be taken to him in the context of the negotiations.
The options for investment limits that were initially discussed included forcing a delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges, imposing limits on investments in Chinese markets by U.S. government pension funds and putting caps on the value of Chinese companies included in indexes managed by U.S. firms, according to people familiar with and involved in the discussions.
Capital Controls
Since the deliberations first became public, administration efforts around delisting Chinese companies have been put on hold for now, the people said. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said Sept. 28 that option was not being contemplated “at this time.’’ She didn’t address any of the other possibilities being examined and declined to offer any further details.
Kudlow on Monday also told reporters delisting plans were “not on the table.”
While the value of the pension fund and the money it would funnel into China’s market next year is relatively small compared with the overall market and the value of Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges, the action has symbolic importance and could be interpreted as the first step in the U.S. government moving toward capital controls.
It’s also a domestic winner for the White House, which would be able to claim that it stopped American armed forces and government workers’ dollars from funding the rise of Chinese companies that Washington alleges have stolen intellectual property from U.S. firms to advance their technological lead over America. That fight is at the heart of Trump’s trade war with Beijing.
Some Trump officials are still pushing for limits on the Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms, though it’s still an open question how that goal could be achieved. The hard-line advisers are concerned about indexes loading up on Chinese shares of companies that are subject to U.S. sanctions and therefore prohibited from doing business with the government. Those advisers consider it troubling that Americans aren’t made aware of that material risk, people briefed on the talks said."

WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The U.S. government widened its trade blacklist to include some of China's top artificial intelligence startups, punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities and ratcheting up tensions ahead of high-level trade talks in Washington this week.
The decision, which drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing, targets 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd. 
The action bars the firms from buying components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval - a potentially crippling move for some of them. It follows the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] for what it says are national security reasons.
U.S. officials said the action was not tied to this week's resumption of trade talks with China, but it signals no let-up in U.S. President Donald Trump's hard-line stance as the world's two biggest economies seek to end their 15-month trade war.
The Commerce Department said in a filing the ""entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.""
""The U.S. Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,"" said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.
China said the United States should stop interfering in its affairs. It will continue to take firm and resolute measures to protect its sovereign security, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular media briefing without elaborating. 
Hikvision, with a market value of about $42 billion, calls itself the world's largest maker of video surveillance gear. [L3N26T1DD]
SenseTime, valued at around $4.5 billion in a May 2018 fundraising, is one of the world's most valuable AI unicorns while Megvii, backed by e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), is valued at around $4 billion and is preparing an IPO to raise at least $500 million in Hong Kong.
The other companies on the list are speech recognition firm iFlytek Co, surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology, data recovery firm Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co, facial recognition firm Yitu Technology and Yixin Science and Technology Co.
STRONG OBJECTIONS
A U.S. Hikvision spokesman said the company ""strongly opposes"" the decision and noted that in January it retained a human rights expert and former U.S. ambassador to advise the company on human rights compliance.
""Punishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the U.S. government, hurt Hikvision's U.S. businesses partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy,"" the company added.
Hikvision also said that it was assessing the potential impact of the blacklisting and was working on contingency plans. 
John Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia Corp, Ambarella Inc,  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be ""devastating"".
The blacklisting of Huawei has hurt many of its U.S. suppliers that depended on the world's largest telecommunications company for revenue and made it difficult for Huawei to sell new products.
Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas.
SenseTime said in a statement it was deeply disappointed by the U.S. move, that it abides by all relevant laws of the jurisdictions in which its operates and that it has been actively developing an AI code of ethics to ensure its technologies are used responsibly. 
Megvii said it strongly objected to being placed on the blacklist and that it required its clients not to weaponize its technology or use it for illegal purposes.
IFlytek said its placement on the blacklist would not affect its daily operations, while Xiamen Meiya said its overseas revenue was less than 1% of total revenue and that most of its suppliers were domestic companies.
IFlytek fell 2.7% and Xiamen Meiya lost 1.8% on Tuesday as investors factored in their limited exposure to overseas markets and the potential for the U.S. action to speed up restructuring, analysts said.
""China's stock market has become increasingly immune to bad news from the trade war. No more panic selling,"" said Stephen Huang, vice president of Shanghai See Truth Investment Management.
Hikvision and Dahua were suspended from trade at the companies' behest. U.S. supplier Ambarella fell 12% in after-hours trading.
In August, the Trump administration also released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.

Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government's restrictions.

China suspended broadcasts of NBA games in the country after Commissioner Adam Silver defended Houston Rockets General Manager Dave Morey tweeting his support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. 
The move came hours after the U.S. blacklisted 28 Chinese entities, including surveillance camera maker Hikvision, for their role in China’s alleged repression of Muslim minorities. 
Meanwhile, the chance of avoiding a Hard Brexit also fell after German Chancellor Angela Merkel told U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson that his proposals to avoid border infrastructure on the island of Ireland were unworkable.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 06:31AM ET</span>","Qiagen CEO quits amid genetic sequencing U-turn, shares tumble","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Qiagen's (DE:QIA) longtime CEO Peer Schatz resigned after the German genetic testing company disclosed a reversal of its genome sequencing strategy and a slump in its Chinese business, sending its shares tumbling 20%.
In a surprise announcement late on Tuesday, the maker of diagnostic kits for cancer and tuberculosis said it would stop developing its next-generation genome sequencing machines and instead collaborate with industry leader Illumina (O:ILMN).
For the third quarter,  Qiagen  cut its forecast for sales growth, adjusted for currency swings, to about 3%, down from a previous outlook of 4%-5%, with its China business turning out significantly weaker than expected.
It expected to report adjusted third-quarter earning-per-share of $0.35-0.36, in line with its previous forecast.
Qiagen plans to take a pre-tax restructuring charge of about $260-$265 million, mainly to write down assets linked to the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) instruments.
It also cited an overhaul of its global manufacturing network and possible job cuts for the writedown.
The company said Thierry Bernard, the head of the group's molecular diagnostics business, would now take over as interim boss until a permanent CEO was found.
Shares plunged 20% to 23.47 euros at 0848 GMT, with the group losing close to 1.4 billion euros ($1.54 billion) in market value, after already shedding about 17% over the previous three months.
""The fall from grace of Qiagen shares since June suggests that the market was already positioning for an unfavorable Q3, but the CEO's departure will come as a surprise,"" said Berenberg analyst Scott Bardo, adding the business nevertheless held the promise of attractive underlying growth.
Qiagen's core work includes making diagnostics kits that test for a single genetic mutation to help decide on treatment. But in recent years the company has developed into a smaller NGS player, where a wider range or all genes are sequenced.
As part of a 15-year collaboration deal with NGS pioneer Illumina (O:ILMN), Qiagen will rely on its genetic diagnostic products running on its new partner's hardware.
Schatz, who will become a special adviser to the supervisory board, had been with the company for 27 years. Since he started as finance chief in 1993, Qiagen has grown from $2 million in annual revenues to $1.5 billion in 2018."

Global companies are walking a tightrope in their marketing campaigns, fearing a backlash from Chinese customers if deemed to be expressing solidarity with the anti-government protests that have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis in decades.
The U.S. luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) deleted a twitter advertisement posted on Monday showing a female model with her hand covering her right eye, which some people interpreted as supporting the protesters.
Vans last week invited the public to vote for their favorite sneaker design from more than 100,000 submissions from around the world in a Vans Global Custom Culture competition.
Media reported that a design from a Canada-based competitor named Naomiso won the online vote before it was taken down on Saturday. 
The design featured a red bauhinia, a flower that symbolizes Hong Kong and is on its flag, and a yellow umbrella, a nod to 2014 protests that some refer to as the umbrella revolution. A group of people wearing helmets, masks and goggles can be seen on the side of the sneaker design. 
""Based on the global competitions guidelines, Vans can confirm that a small number of artistic submissions have been removed. This decision was taken to uphold the purpose of Custom Culture,"" Vans, a unit of VF Corp (NYSE:VFC), said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) statement.
Vans did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday.
A search of the username Naomiso on the Custom Culture's website did not yield any result on Tuesday. 
Some people in Hong Kong have called for a boycott of the sneaker brand on Facebook while some retailers have suspended sales of Vans products.
""Starting from today, every branch of our company will suspend sales of all Vans products,"" said Search Sneaker Shop, one of the best-known sneaker stores in Hong Kong, in a Facebook post on Saturday.
EYE OF A STORM
However, mainland Chinese users on the Weibo social media platform praised Vans for getting rid of the design, after being enraged by it at first. 
""Please everyone let's support Vans this time. The Hong Kong losers are starting to boycott Vans, but the mainland market will lift it up,"" said one Weibo user.
Another company dicing with Chinese anger is Tiffany & Co which deleted a twitter advertisement on Monday showing a female model with a hand covering an eye. 
A female medic was hospitalized after being hit by a pellet in the eye during protests. She became a symbol for what protesters say is excessive police force.
The advertisement has not created waves on China's social media. Tiffany & Co did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday. 
Blizzard Entertainment, a U.S. video game developer, said on Tuesday it had removed video-on-demand (VOD) replay of a Hearthstone match, after a masked Hong Kong player called for the liberation of the region in a post-game interview. 

Chinese state television, meanwhile, said it would not air NBA exhibition games played in the country this week, heaping pressure on the U.S. basketball league after a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive backing the Hong Kong protests.

632,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 06:11AM ET</span>",Recruiters pummeled by widespread economic angst,"By Uday Sampath Kumar and Yadarisa Shabong
(Reuters) - Britain's PageGroup (L:PAGE) and Robert Walters (L:RWA) warned on Tuesday that profit will be hit by a global recruitment squeeze as continuing geopolitical issues such as Brexit and the U.S.-China trade conflict dent economies.
Shares in Robert Walters, which has a presence in more than 30 countries, fell by 10.4% while larger PageGroup plunged nearly 13% to its lowest in nearly three years.
The deepening crisis over when, how or if Britain leaves the European Union has hit every sector of the UK economy, with many businesses calling a halt to hiring until they have a clearer picture of what a divorce deal will look like.
Demand for new staff at British companies in September increased at the weakest rate in almost eight years, a survey showed on Tuesday.
Companies presented with a negative backdrop will think hard about their spending, and that includes staff costs, said AJ bell investment director Russ Mould.
“The first step in a bleak situation is normally to hold off replacing staff who have moved on to another job. The second step is to make actual job cuts, and it feels like we may be seeing the first small signs of that, given talk of HSBC slashing 10,000 positions,"" Mould said.
Robert Walters said its gross profit in the UK fell 11% in the third quarter, while PageGroup's second profit warning of the year followed a 4.1% drop in quarterly earnings in its home market.
The news pushed shares of other recruitment companies lower, with  Hays  (L:HAYS),  Sthree  (L:STHR) and Swiss-listed  Adecco  Group (S:ADEN) all down in early trade.
DARK CLOUDS
Fears of a global recession has been a particularly dark cloud hanging over the recruitment industry as the protracted U.S.-China trade war and a weakening German economy keep companies on edge.
The flagging Chinese economy is also having a ripple affect on hiring in countries such as Australia as its export-focused commodities sector goes through a slowdown, Robert Walters finance chief Alan Bannatyne told Reuters.
PageGroup and Robert Walters said business in Hong Kong is also being hurt by the continuing violent protests by pro-democracy activists.
""Looking ahead, the deterioration in trading conditions seen during Q3 across the majority of our regions is anticipated to continue,"" PageGroup said.
The company forecast 2019 operating profit in a range of between 140 million pounds ($172.2 million) and 150 million pounds, down from previous guidance of 156.5 million to 168 million pounds.
Robert Walters said it expects annual profit in line with the last year and that it has cut its global headcount by 2% to 4,258.
Bannatyne did say he expects business in the UK to bounce back when Brexit developments give companies and candidates some clarity about the future.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31 come what may, despite parliament passing a law ordering him to seek a delay if he cannot secure a new transition deal."
633,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 06:04AM ET</span>",Hong Kong bourse pulls plug on $39 billion play for London Stock Exchange,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's bourse has scrapped its unsolicited $39 billion approach for  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE) after failing to convince LSE management and investors to back a move that could have transformed both global financial services giants.
Last month's surprise cash-and-shares approach threatened to upend the LSE's $27 billion plan to buy data and analytics firm Refinitiv. The Hong Kong exchange had said the LSE would have to ditch the Refinitiv deal for its offer to go ahead.
LSE shares slid 6% by 0848 GMT, close to their lowest since Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) (HK:0388) announced its approach on Sept. 11. Shares in the Hong Kong bourse were up 2.3% near the end of its trading day.
HKEX chief executive Charles Li wrote in a blog post: ""We still believe the strategic rationale for the combination of our two businesses is compelling and would create a world-leading market infrastructure group."" 
""Despite a huge amount of work and discussions with a broad set of regulators and extensive shareholder discussions, the level of engagement from LSEG led us to conclude that the continued pursuit of a combination of the two businesses would not be in the best interests of our own shareholders,"" he said.
LSE said in a statement it remained ""committed to and continues to make good progress on its proposed acquisition of Refinitiv"".
Investors were due to vote on the Refinitiv deal next month and the transaction was expected to close in the second half of 2020, the LSE said, subject to regulatory approvals.
Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI) which owns Reuters News. 
SLIM CHANCE
On the HKEK offer, one LSE investor told Reuters it would have been ""very, very hard to get the LSE board to engage as they rebutted the offer on grounds of strategy, not price."" The investor spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Analysts had viewed HKEX's chance of success as slim after it was rejected by the LSE just two days from the HKEX going public with its interest. Political turmoil engulfing Hong Kong and perceptions of Beijing's growing influence over the city, were seen as another key obstacle to any deal. 
Subsequent efforts by HKEX officials to engage with LSE shareholders had also met with resistance. Some investors told Reuters the HKEX would have to raise its offer by at least 20%, mostly in cash, to tempt LSE shareholders.
""The price tag from the Hong Kong exchange perspective was getting a bit too high, so it's good for the shareholders that they decided to walk away,"" said Hao Hong, head of research at broker BOCOM International.
Since the HKEX announced its interest in mid-September, its shares had fallen 8%, compared with a 5% drop in the Hang Seng benchmark index.
WHAT NEXT?
The failure of the bold move leaves open the question of what Li might try next to fulfill the HKEX's strategy of being ""China-anchored and globally connected"".
The HKEX has been the world's largest capital-raising venue in five of the past 10 years, but has been working to diversify its equities focus, launching a bond trading platform with China and buying the London Metal Exchange in 2012 for 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion).
""HKEX will continue to try other things. Charles Li has done a lot of deals, most notably the London Metal Exchange. It may not be a stock exchange, but other related areas,"" said Bocom's Hong.
Under British takeover rules, the HKEX had until Oct. 9 to make a binding offer for LSE. The withdrawal of the approach means it cannot bid again for the LSE for at least six months unless the LSE's management agreed to an offer, another group made a bid for the London exchange operator, or other events were deemed to be a material change in the LSE's circumstances.
""If the Refinitiv deal surprisingly fails to get approval, I think we could see HKEX come again,"" said China Galaxy Securities analyst Chi Man Wong.
""The (LSE) shareholder meeting (to approve the Refinitiv purchase) has been tentatively set for November but there is no firm date. If that deal fails then HKEX will be there.""
Analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said investors had been worried that the HKEX's pursuit of a deal could have led the exchange to raise fresh funds - weighing on the price of existing shares.

""We think there may still be questions as to why HKEX proposed the acquisition when it seemed somewhat challenging to bring to fruition, but we believe investors will likely focus more on the fundamentals of the company and the market in Hong Kong,"" they said in a research note.

Javid's predecessor, Philip Hammond, said the appointment would be made this autumn, but members of parliament's Treasury Committee wrote to Javid last month with concerns that the process had become delayed.
""You asked for an update on this important recruitment process. It is on track. In terms of the appointment itself, we will make an announcement in due course, ahead of the start of the next Governor's term on 1 February 2020,"" Javid wrote to the committee in a letter released on Tuesday.
The British parliament's Treasury Committee typically questions senior BoE staff before they take office, and although it lacks a formal veto, it can pressure officials to step down, most recently with BoE chief operating officer Charlotte Hogg.
""I would like to assure you that the Committee will have the opportunity and time to scrutinize the successful candidate after the appointment has been made but before the individual has taken up the role,"" Javid wrote."

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets retreated in early trade on Tuesday after China responded vigorously to the U.S.’s decision to blacklist some of its high-tech companies, casting an ever longer shadow over this week's trade talks.
China’s state broadcaster CCTV said it will stop showing the National Basketball Association’s games after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver gave an interview supporting Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
“As a values-based organization that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,” Silver told Kyodo News in Japan.
""CCTV sports channel of China Media Group has suspended the broadcast of NBA games and voiced strong dissatisfaction and opposition to NBA commissioner Adam Silver’s remarks regarding #HongKong,"" the People's Daily tweeted in response.
Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), the NBA’s biggest partner outside the U.S., had already said it would stop streaming games in the wake of Morey’s tweet. Tencent signed a five-year deal worth an estimated $1.5 billion with the NBA earlier this year.
The latest exchange of restrictive measures comes only two days before top-level trade representatives are due to resume talks on resolving the trade dispute between the two countries.
However, the latest actions illustrate how the task of resolving commercial disputes is being complicated by other antagonisms rooted in politics and conflicting world views. 
Although not directly related, China’s move comes within hours of the U.S forbidding its companies to do business with 28 Chinese technology companies due to their role in facilitating alleged human rights violations in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang.
“The U.S. government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that was a million miles away from concerns about trade imbalances. “This action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenceless minority populations.”
Europe’s economy has proved itself more vulnerable to this rivalry than investors had thought possible this year. While the Chinese and U.S. economies have slowed, it’s the euro zone which is sliding into recession first – a 0.3% rise in German industrial production in August, reported this morning, is unlikely to stop that.
With the commercial boycotts now appearing to make a breakthrough at this week’s talks a forlorn hope, European markets have lost one of their key short-term supports. The Stoxx 600 was down 0.3% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT) at 381.66, giving up around half of Monday’s gains. The trade-sensitive German DAX was down 0.4% while the FTSE 100 eked out a 0.1% gain due to more sterling weakness. "

In a ruling seen by Reuters on Tuesday, the court said the reasons for its decision would be announced in the next 30 days.

(Reuters) - European shares gave up early gains on Tuesday as worries about upcoming high-level U.S.-China trade negotiations build, while the  London Stock Exchange  was on course for its worst day since 2016 after Hong Kong's bourse abandoned its bid for the company.
All but one of the major European subsectors were trading lower by 0815 GMT. 
The technology index (SX8P) was up about 0.2%, buoyed by Nordic telecom companies Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) and Ericsson (ST:ERICb) after a report said the U.S. government had suggested issuing credit to help the two companies compete with China's Huawei.
""You can't read too much into markets ebbing and flowing in either direction,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets. ""Some traders are going to be sitting on their hands until we hear more from the situation with the U.S. and China.""
The United States expanded its trade blacklist to include some of China's top artificial intelligence startups on Monday, a day after a report said China might not agree on a broad trade deal. 
The negative headlines dampened optimism fueled by tariff concessions from both sides last month and kept investors on edge ahead of trade talks scheduled for this week.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) slipped 0.3%, with Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) among the biggest decliners.
An unexpected rise in monthly industrial output in Germany had earlier provided a shimmer of hope that an expected contraction in Europe's biggest economy in the third quarter would not be steep.
""There is certainly no reason to give the all-clear, but to breathe a sigh of relief, at least,"" said Andreas Rees, economist at UniCredit. ""After all, it has not become even worse in the already battered German industrial sector.""
Shares of London Stock Exchange Group (L:LSE) dropped 6.2% to a near one-month low after Hong Kong's bourse (HK:0388) dropped its unsolicited $39 billion bid for the company.
 Qiagen  (DE:QIA) tumbled 20%, the most on the benchmark index, after the German biotech company said its CEO would step down and warned that third quarter preliminary sales will fall short of expectations.

In an upbeat spot were shares of Airbus (PA:AIR), which rose 1.4% after the planemaker reported higher orders for the first nine months of the year, putting it well ahead of U.S. rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA).

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German government has started preparations to sell state financier Depfa as it seeks to draw a line under the country's largest bailout of the financial crisis a decade ago, people close to the matter said.
Ireland-based Depfa is a former unit of Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which Germany nationalized in 2009. An attempt to sell Depfa for 320 million euros was scrapped in 2014 and the lender was instead transferred to the HRE bad bank FMS Wertmanagement (FMSW).
FMSW has mandated  Barclays  (L:BARC) to find a buyer for Depfa, which has a book value of about 900 million euros ($988 million) and could be valued at 0.6-0.8 times that in a potential deal, the people said.
FMSW and Barclays declined to comment.
FMSW Chief Financial Officer Christoph Mueller said in April that a sale of Depfa could be launched in 2020.
The lender is expected to attract interest from banks, which can make use of Depfa's strong capital basis - the result of de-risking its portfolio over the last decade.
FSMW will likely market Depfa to German public-sector bank Helaba, which bought municipal lender Dexia Kommunalbank in 2018, as well as to Austrian infrastructure lender Kommunalkredit and private equity firms such as Lone Star.
Germany nationalized Hypo Real Estate in 2009 after injecting 10 billion euros of capital and providing 145 billion euros in liquidity guarantees. The bank collapsed due to massive writedowns among other things on Depfa's holdings of mortgage-backed securities, which slumped in value after the failure of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.
Depfa, which had been bought by Hypo Real Estate for 5.2 billion euros in 2007, stopped underwriting new business on EU demands after the HRE bailout and focused on winding down its assets and shrinking its capital base.
In the first six months of 2019, Depfa posted a pre-tax loss of 67 million euros. Total assets stood at 14.4 billion euros and its core equity tier 1 ratio at 144% at the end of June, according to its half-year report."

Effective this year, companies eligible for the government's Principal Hub (PH) incentive will be able to enjoy a 10% tax rate for their operations instead of the wider corporate tax rate of 24%, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) said.
Earlier companies eligible for the PH incentive could opt for the 10% tax rate only on income over and above the money they made the year before joining the program, according to a MIDA official.
Companies that have yet to establish a presence in Malaysia can apply for tax rates of 0% and 5% for 10 years based on their investments and job-creation commitments. Previously the tax rates for such companies were 0%, 5% and 10%.
""This enhancement of the PH tax incentive is timely as Malaysia continues to innovate its policies and strategies to attract investments so that the country will be strongly integrated into the region as well as other markets,"" MIDA said in a statement.
""The review aims to make Malaysia competitive with other countries in the region as the optimal headquarters hub in Asia Pacific.""
It said the PH incentive, first introduced in 2015, had helped Malaysia attract local and multinational companies to establish their hubs in the country.
Along with Vietnam and Thailand, Malaysia has been one of the main beneficiaries of companies trying to move some of their production out of China to escape higher U.S. tariffs."

The rally has since petered out after President Donald Trump said he won’t seek an interim agreement and global growth showed further signs of deterioration as the year-long trade war dragged on. Impeachment proceedings have also spurred concern that it may hinder Trump’s hand in the negotiations.
Below are comments from investors and analysts:
Sergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Union Investment in Frankfurt:
Expectations for a breakthrough are “very low,” though it will be important to see how the meeting will end and the mood during the meetingFuture steps are also crucial, such as when the next round of talks will beDergachev said he’s positioned “mildly defensive,” and is focusing on the credit quality of his holdingsWerner Gey van Pittius, co-head of emerging-market fixed income at Investec Asset Management in London:
The trade war will last longer than what the market is hoping because it’s not just about trade. There’s an element in the U.S. that is afraid of “the geopolitical rise of China” and that is much bigger than just trade right nowChina is preparing for the next decade and trying to reduce the impact of the trade war by opening up their markets, attracting capital, and moving away from U.S. influence by selling Treasuries and buying gold. Their time horizon is beyond the U.S. electionsHe is taking a long duration strategy in his bond portfolio as the trade war raises the risk of a recessionCarter at BNP Paribas Asset:
Politics are driving the negotiations, and not economicsThe upcoming 2020 presidential election, and impeachment investigations in the House, are the dominant context for the trade meetingCarter said he plans to continue cutting exposure to junk-rated bonds even if there was a positive outcome from the meeting. That’s because the firm doesn’t expect any comprehensive agreement will be reached that would reverse the negative economic effects of the trade warStuart Ritson, emerging-market bond fund manager at Aviva Investors in Singapore:
It is hard to be too optimistic on the outcome of trade talks given the narrow scope of the discussionsThe firm’s local-currency bond portfolio is “relatively defensive” at the moment, given the weak global growth backdrop. It is also positioned for further easing by EM policy makers and has increased exposure to the yen, given its anti-cyclical properties, and still attractive valuationsRobert Carnell, chief economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Singapore, writes in a note:
China may see it as advantageous to keep the trade war alive, but under control, pending political developments in the U.S.For the U.S., the benefits of fighting China on trade may now be outweighed by the short-term hit to the economy, in terms of popular support and potential votes for Trump at next year’s presidential election"
642,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 03:52AM ET</span>",Brexit Currency Wobbles May Hit More U.K. Energy Suppliers,"(Bloomberg) -- Britain’s consumer energy suppliers are already being squeezed by regulators and tight margins in the electricity market. Brexit may add to that pain.
Efforts by the U.K. to exit the European Union have depressed the value of the pound, adding to the cost utilities pay for importing supplies from the rest of Europe. A further drop could worsen the finances for the companies that sell power and natural gas at the retail level -- at least 16 of which have folded since the Brexit vote in 2016.
“Currency risks are the biggest short-term risks, rather than security of supply,” said Jeremy Nicholson, corporate affairs officer at Alfa Energy Ltd., a London-based consultant that handled about $2 billion of energy trading last year. Alfa advises on energy purchases for airlines, schools, housing companies and manufacturers.
That view, echoed by regulators and other industry participants, highlights the risks of unintended consequences from Brexit unraveling government efforts to spur competition in the electricity business. Dozens of companies from Ovo Energy Ltd. to Bulb Energy Ltd. have sprung up in the U.K. as the Conservative government sought to bring even more players to into energy markets dominated by big utilities.
While the incumbents have more sophisticated trading floors and hedging operations to anticipate market swings, the smaller players have been caught out in recent months. Two went bust in August alone.
That makes the small suppliers one of the only potential victims of Brexit in the energy industry, where executives anticipate power and gas will keep flowing regardless of how trade rules change.
The pound has dropped about 15% since the 2016 Brexit vote. Wholesale power prices are lower than the four-year average because natural gas prices have dropped. While customer bills are only adjusted once a year or less, market prices can change overnight. Companies must cope with those fluctuations.
“There are a range of shocks -- wholesale prices could be affected by exchange rate moves,” Joe Perkins, the chief economist at regulator Ofgem, said in an interview in London. “We do monitor that pretty closely.”
The U.K.’s biggest utilities include   Centrica   PLC (LON:CNA) Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF), Innogy's (DE:IGY) Npower unit, Iberdrola's (MC:IBE) ScottishPower business and E.ON (DE:EONGn).
The companies in the next tier down are boosting share. That group includes Bulb and Ovo, which is buying the retail arm of SSE PLC (LON:SSE).
It’s the smaller suppliers that are most at risk, with some exiting the market after they failed to hedge wholesale price risks properly when they surged early 2018 because of cold snaps dubbed “beasts from the east,” Ofgem said in a report last week. Medium-sized utilities have fared better in the market than the smallest new entrants, it said.
Robin Hood Energy Ltd., which owes Ofgem 9.4 million pounds ($11.5 million) under a program to enforce more use of renewables, said “we operate in a tough market, but we remain on track to report a surplus for this financial year and next.”
A no-deal Brexit is one of many possibilities Robin Hood is preparing for at the end of the month, according to head of marketing and acquisitions, Richard Johnson.
“There’s the potential of a general election, the potential of a no-deal Brexit - all of that could or could not potentially affect trading,” he said by phone.
The uncertainty around Brexit is limiting opportunity for Brits Energy Ltd., chief executive officer Ahmad Mohseni said by phone. Currency fluctuations “will definitely have an impact,” he said.
“If the value of sterling goes down we’d still have an opportunity to export, but imports may not be as attractive,” he said. “I guess when Brexit happens we’re going to take some pain but it’ll subside after a few years.”
The government has held discussions with industry groups around the country to prepare businesses for Brexit. “Smaller energy firms are still finding it challenging to prepare themselves though, as they often don’t have the resources or financial support,” said Tanisha Beebee, a senior energy adviser at the CBI, Britain’s main business lobby group.
There are currently five interconnectors that enable electricity trade between Britain and other jurisdictions. In the first quarter, electricity imports through those links hit a record 7% of total demand. Six new links -- with Denmark, France, Ireland and Norway -- are under construction, which should about double import capacity.
Because the U.K. and its neighbors rely on each other as they use cross-border trade to help keep power and gas prices low, analysts are not expecting supply disruptions. Still, the utilities themselves and the regulator are mindful of price surges.
For U.K. energy suppliers as a whole, the most “problematic” issue is that the entire industry bears some of the cost of failures in the system, said Ofgem’s Perkins. The regulator is looking at whether to make it harder for new businesses to enter the market, which may ensure that future suppliers are more financially robust.
“We are thinking of changing essentially the license conditions for suppliers, which will hopefully make sure suppliers are very protective of consumers’ interests and perhaps more fiscally prudent as well,” Perkins said."

647,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 02:11AM ET</span>",The end of Libor: the biggest banking challenge you've never heard of,"By Sinead Cruise and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - On June 30, British bank NatWest (L:RBS) sent out an arcane-sounding press release - bus operator  National Express  (L:NEX) had become the first company to take out a loan based on Sonia, a replacement for scandal-hit interest rate benchmark Libor.  
It was billed as the first switch of thousands that British firms would make by end-2021, when the benchmark is set to be decommissioned.
Four months on, NatWest's trailblazing Sonia switch has been followed by only one other loan, when the bank struck a deal with utility South West Water on Oct. 2.
The slow progress highlights the challenge banks and borrowers face as regulators attempt to end the use of Libor, a benchmark embedded in as much as $340 trillion financial contracts worldwide from home loans to complicated derivatives.
Libor, once dubbed the world's most important number, was discredited after the 2008 financial crisis when authorities in the United States and Britain found traders had manipulated it to make a profit.
But replacing Libor is proving expensive and tricky with concerns that, if mishandled, it could trigger credit market confusion and waves of lawsuits, finance industry sources said.
With no obvious alternative, some countries are adopting their own benchmarks. The United States is leading the way with a booming trade in derivatives linked to its new Sofr rate, while the European Central Bank started publishing Estr, its new interest rate benchmark, earlier this month.
In Britain, professional investors such as hedge funds and pension insurance clients are also already writing and trading derivatives contracts linked to Sonia. But companies which make up the so-called Libor ""cash"" market of sterling-denominated loans are dragging their feet or are even not aware of the shift.
At least two banks in Britain have shifted staff from teams preparing for Brexit to specialist Libor taskforces in the past quarter as the issue becomes more pressing, industry sources said.
""Part of the market is very educated and smart on this and part of the market is not even aware that Libor is going,"" said Phil Lloyd, head of market structure & regulatory customer engagement at NatWest Markets.
Lloyd said banks like NatWest are battling to allay concerns among corporate borrowers that the Sonia benchmark will make it harder for them to know how much interest they owe because the rate is backward looking.
Sonia, the sterling overnight index average, is based on the average of interest rates banks pay to borrow sterling from one another outside market hours, and is published at 9:00 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) daily, after the transactions have been vetted by the Bank of England.
Borrowers taking out Sonia loans will in effect not know exactly how much interest they owe until they are required to pay.
In contrast, loans linked to Libor can have forward-looking term rates, meaning borrowers have greater certainty over their future liabilities and can manage cash flows more easily.
Bankers and consultants said the market was exploring a forward-looking Sonia term rate by mid-2020 to appease borrowers but not everyone is in favor.
The overnight Sonia rate, based on actual transactions, is seen as more robust and less vulnerable to the kind of manipulation that affected Libor, which was based on rates submitted by banks.
The Libor rigging scandal saw billions of dollars in fines levied on major banks and jail sentences for traders convicted of manipulating the benchmark for profit.
Some banks and lawyers fear the creation of a Sonia term rate, which would likely be based on forward-looking estimates from banks as opposed to past transactions, could undermine the security of the benchmark and even spawn legal dangers for banks.
Murray Longton, a consultant at Capco who advises financial firms on Libor transition, said banks were fearful of lawsuits, as the proliferation of alternative Sonia term rates offered by different lenders could spark allegations of mis-selling.
""If you get this wrong, this is PPI for investment banking- if you haven't communicated properly and you move a customer (on to Sonia) and benefit, there could be a case where this gets reviewed and you owe your client a lot,"" he said.
The Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal in Britain has cost banks more than 43 billion pounds in compensation after the contracts were retrospectively deemed to have been mis-sold.
""A lot of the corporate market are waiting for a few things of which one is a term rate. And if they never get a term rate, then waiting will lead to them still executing Libor, and not being ready for Sonia. The clock is ticking,"" Lloyd said.
""And the other point about having a term rate is you're starting to get back into a world where you are really recreating a new version of Libor.""
COSTS AND CONSEQUENCES
But the reluctance of corporate borrowers to buy into Sonia is not the only reason for the slow progress.
Banks face large costs for adapting systems and educating thousands of relationship managers on the merits of Sonia over Libor.
Fourteen of the world's top banks expect to spend more than $1.2 billion on the Libor transition, data from Oliver Wyman show, with the costs for the finance industry as a whole set to be several multiples of that sum.
Much of this cost is linked to the arduous task of changing the terms of contracts tied to Libor whose duration extend beyond the 2021 deadline. Progress has been held up not only by nervous borrowers but also by banks in loan syndicates which may not always agree on the new wording required to adapt existing loan agreements to the new benchmark.
""You need unanimous agreement to change the baseline product, so what are the chances if you've got 10-15 participants (in a syndicate) that they will all agree on the same thing?,"" Capco's Longton said.
Some corporate borrowers are also playing a wait-and-see game to see whether they can benefit financially from Libor's slow death spiral. But this could have costly consequences, depending on the so-called ""fallback"" language in contracts for their existing loans.
These fallbacks - originally designed to kick in if Libor was temporarily unavailable - usually stipulate alternative rates, such as calling other banks for a quote or using the last published Libor rate. But the fallback clauses were not designed to cope with Libor ceasing to exist indefinitely.
That could create big risks for borrowers, for example, by potentially converting a ""floating rate"" loan, tied to the fluctuations of Libor into a fixed-rate one.
Serge Gwynne, a partner at consultant Oliver Wyman, said regulators could do more to help banks manage the transition away from Libor, starting with much harder deadlines on when it would formally cease to exist.
""Libor is embedded everywhere in the plumbing of the financial world, that's why this is such a big challenge,"" said Longton.
""You are changing a product that has been used to create markets for a long time. You are not just taking one thing out and putting one thing in but changing the whole dynamic of how this works."""

“The trends that drive Thai baht appreciation aren’t easy to combat by central bank policies,” Birgit Hansl, the World Bank’s country manager for Thailand, said in an interview Monday in Bangkok. The jump is part of a global picture, which nations with small, open economies have “limited ability” to change, she said.
The baht has emerged as a haven for some investors, underpinned by a current-account surplus and $220 billion of foreign reserves. The currency’s near 7% climb against the dollar this year, the best in Asia, contributed to a slowdown in the trade-led Thai economy by hurting export competitiveness.
The resilience of the baht is a “double-edged sword” but a high level of economic stability is more important for long-term investors, Hansl said.
“In that regard the Thai baht is a good sign,” she said. “Investors are seeing Thailand as stable and safe place.”
The Bank of Thailand said last month that speculation on the baht has subsided after an interest-rate cut and steps to curb some inflows.

Other speculators including trading advisers have not followed the global macro hedge funds in their bullishness on Asian stocks, and a lot depends on how the trade war pans out, Takada wrote.

Khan will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and business executives in his third visit to Beijing within a year. He’ll likely discuss railway projects and trade curbs with the officials, while also addressing concerns around the contested region of Kashmir ahead of Xi’s visit to India later this week.
Pakistan has been one of the largest beneficiaries of China’s Belt & Road Initiative, Xi’s flagship program to build a network of railways, ports, pipelines and highways linking Asia, Europe and Africa. China has financed billions of dollars of power and road projects in Pakistan, boosting infrastructure in the South Asian nation but also saddling it with debt.
While most of the early projects have now been completed, the second phase of the program has been slow to start. Official data shows foreign direct investment from China plunged 77% to $461 million in the fiscal year through June from $2 billion in the previous year.
Pakistan’s debt problems, which led the government to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund once again, have also prompted the nation to scale back some projects. The South Asian nation owes China more than double what it owes the IMF over the next three years.
China has sought to tighten oversight of Belt and Road projects amid growing concerns the program is loading poorer nations with unsustainable debt. China’s ambassador to Pakistan, Yao Jing, recently said the economic corridor projects between the two nations are “running according to our satisfaction and there is no slowdown in it.”
Pakistan has reduced its Chinese loans to upgrade a colonial-era railway by $2 billion to $6.2 billion, and wants to cut it down by another $2 billion, according to the nation’s railways minister. Khan will likely discuss the project during his trip to Beijing this week, as well as Chinese curbs on agricultural exports from Pakistan, including on rice, wheat, corn, soybean, sugar and tobacco, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
Kashmir Tensions
Regional security will also be on the agenda, with Khan expected to discuss the situation in Kashmir with Xi before the Chinese leader visits Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this week in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.
India scrapped decades of autonomy in the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir, straining relations with Pakistan. Kashmir, in the Himalayas, has been divided between India and Pakistan since independence from British rule, and is claimed by both. Two of the nations’ three wars were fought over the territory. China also claims part of the area.
Burzine Waghmar, a member of the Centre for the Study of Pakistan at SOAS University of London, said Khan will unlikely get strong assurances from Beijing on Kashmir.
“Xi will definitely not publicly proclaim questionable objections about Article 370 and Kashmir on the eve of his informal working visit to Tamil Nadu on the heels of hosting Khan,” he said."

Trade tension between the two sides intensified lately amid reports that Washington is considering ways to limit American investors’ portfolio flows into China, including potentially delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. 
Bloomberg reported that eight Chinese technology companies were placed on a U.S. blacklist on Monday amid accusations of being implicated in human rights violations against Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang province. 
China’s markets traded higher after re-opening following a week-long public holiday. The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were up 0.8% and 0.9% respectively by 10;30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). While not a directional driver, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.3 in September, compared to August’s 52.1.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.5%. Violence in the city escalated during the weekend after the government invoked a colonial-era emergency law to impose a ban on protesters wearing face masks. The decision further angered protestors, who destroyed China-owned banking facilities and retail outlets across the city.
U.S. President Donald Trump earlier warned China that if the country does anything “bad” to quell protests in Hong Kong, trade talks could suffer. 
“They have to do that in a peaceful manner,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 1.1%. 
South Korea’s KOSPI also climbed 1.1%. Index heavyweight   Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   (KS:005930)’s shares gained 1.2% even after the company said its third-quarter operating profit dropped by more than half from a year ago.
The company said its consolidated sales over the three months was 62 trillion won, down about 5.3% from a year ago.

(Reuters) -  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) plans to hire nearly 2,000 additional workers as part of an aggressive plan to roll out its cloud computing services to more locations around the world, its cloud chief told Reuters on Monday.
Seeking to better compete with bigger rivals Amazon Web Services (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), the move will also help transition Oracle's business software for finance, sales and other functions to new systems over the next year.
Jobs will be added in Oracle's software development hubs in Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area and India, as well as near new data centers, said Don Johnson, executive vice president of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure unit.
By the end of next year, Oracle plans to open 20 more cloud ""regions"" - places where Oracle operates data centers so customers can safely stash data for disaster recovery or to comply with local data storage laws.
The company currently has 16 such regions, a dozen of which it opened in the past year. New locations will be built out in Chile, Japan, South Africa and United Arab Emirates as well as elsewhere in Asia and Europe.
As of May 31, Oracle had some 136,000 full-time staff, of which 18,000 were employed in cloud services and license support operations.
The fiercely competitive market where big businesses pay a cloud provider to handle their computing and storage tasks instead of building out their own data centers is estimated by Gartner to be worth $38.9 billion in 2019.
Amazon is the largest player, but Microsoft has staked its turnaround strategy on the services. Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) are also pouring resources into the fight.
Under Johnson, who joined Oracle in 2015 after seven years in Amazon's cloud unit, Oracle has built out its second generation of cloud infrastructure after a rocky first attempt.
This time, Oracle will run its cloud software applications, which compete with the likes of (N:CRM) and SAP SE (DE:SAPG), on the same cloud system it offers outside customers - a strategy long employed by firms such as Amazon and Google.
""We're driving this very, very aggressively,"" Johnson said. ""We are very rapidly converting what's a complex footprint to be a very simple footprint: Everything everywhere runs on our generation two cloud infrastructure.""
Oracle is also aiming for a piece of the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, a $10 billion contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. The award of that contract was put on hold for review after Oracle expressed concerns about the process, which left Amazon and Microsoft finalists.
Johnson said the job additions were not related to the JEDI project, but added that Oracle is continuing to build out data centers for potential government customers."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eased on Monday as reports on the U.S.-China trade front kept investors cautious ahead of scheduled talks later in the week.
A report that Beijing was increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by President Donald Trump weighed on sentiment early.
But White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow helped ease some anxiety, saying it was possible U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators could make progress when they meet in Washington, and said the United States was open to looking at what proposals Beijing brought.
Stocks briefly traded higher in the afternoon after a Fox reporter tweeted that the Chinese commerce ministry said China is ready to do a deal with the United States on parts of negotiations.
U.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators launched a new round of talks on Monday aimed at resolving the two nations' 15-month trade war, while the White House officially confirmed that the high-level talks, involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would begin on Thursday.
""The markets are trying to come up with some expectation for the outcome of trade talks and figure out where and how they want to price it in,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 95.7 points, or 0.36%, to 26,478.02, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 13.22 points, or 0.45%, to 2,938.79 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 26.18 points, or 0.33%, to 7,956.29.
Tariff concessions from the United States and China last month had fueled hopes of a resolution to the prolonged dispute.
Anxiety over the trade war and mixed economic indicators has been offset by increased expectations of a third interest rate cut this year by the Federal Reserve.
""We had a pretty good rally back from the lows on Friday, and we're sort of back into the middle of the recent trading range,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""Investors are trying to balance what seems like a weaker economy with low interest rates. What could change it could be something coming out of the talks with China this week.""
Investors will soon turn their focus to third-quarter earnings, which begin next week with U.S. banks reporting, and many hope to see more clarity on the impact of the trade war on corporate America.
Analysts expect the lowest quarterly profit performance since 2016, with S&P 500 earnings seen falling nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.
General Motors Co (N:GM) eased 0.5% after the UAW rejected the carmaker's latest offer of a four-year labor contract.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 30 new highs and 91 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.73 billion shares, compared with the 7.23 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."

The probe of Facebook, announced in September, is led by New York and includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.
Some states, particularly New York and Nebraska, have raised concerns that Facebook and other big tech companies engage in anti-competitive practices, expose consumer data to potential data breaches and push up advertising prices.
Several state attorneys general met on Monday with officials from the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
The group met with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to discuss the Facebook probe, as well as with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Makan Delrahim, who heads the department's Antitrust Division, two sources said. 
""Today, we held bipartisan conversations with attorneys general from around the country and key officials at both the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission about our investigation into Facebook,"" James said.
Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson was also present and issued a similar statement. 
Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, whose state is one of the leads on the probe, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, and Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller also attended the meetings, their offices said.
The meeting came after Reuters and other outlets reported on Sept. 25 that the Justice Department would open an antitrust investigation of Facebook, which also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.
Following the meetings with top Justice Department officials, the state attorneys general met with department staffers, one source said.
Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users, agreed in July to pay a $5 billion FTC settlement for various privacy violations.
Reuters and others reported in June that the Justice Department and FTC had divided responsibility for the companies being investigated, with the Justice Department taking Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms, which would include Facebook.

The Washington Post was first to report that the group was likely to expand sharply.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 08:04PM ET</span>","GE to freeze, pre-pay pensions to save up to $8 billion, cut debt","By Alwyn Scott and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co said on Monday it would freeze pensions for about 20,000 salaried U.S. employees and take other related moves to help the ailing conglomerate cut debt and reduce its retirement fund deficit by up to $8 billion.
Analysts said the move would largely offset the rise in GE's pension obligations due to lower interest rates and was in line with other steps Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp has taken over the past year to raise cash and pare down $105.8 billion in debt. 
Culp has slashed GE's quarterly dividend to a penny and has sold - or announced plans to sell - non-core businesses, slimming the once-sprawling company to focus just on power plants, jet engines and windmills, plus related equipment and services.
GE's pension plans are among its biggest liabilities and were underfunded by about $27 billion at the end of 2018. U.S. employees facing the pension freeze will be moved to a defined-contribution retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, in 2021.
The company has struggled to boost profits amid a slump in demand for its gas-fired turbines for power generation. It also faces potential costs of more than $1 billion in its jet engine unit from the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX airliner. 
GE also is likely to set aside about $11 billion to cover liabilities for its long-term care insurance business.
By freezing the U.S. pensions, pre-paying about $4.5 billion in contributions due in 2021 and 2022 and offering lump sums to about 100,000 retirees, GE said it expects to cut pension underfunding by $5 billion to $8 billion.
William Blair & Co. analyst Nicholas Heymann said there was no immediate net reduction in GE's pension liabilities given the 90 basis-point decline in long-term interest rates since the end of last year, which has caused its pension liabilities to creep up to about $34 billion from $27 billion toward the end of 2018. 
""The impact is being offset now, rather being reduced. So it is possible that investors are not cheering,"" Heymann told Reuters. He added, though, that Culp “is setting up (GE for) much better performance next year."" 
GE's shares were down 0.2% at $8.55 in afternoon trading, after rising 2.6% to $8.79 in premarket trading. 
The pension freeze takes effect Jan. 1, 2021.
The moves also are expected to help lower GE's net debt by $4 billion to $6 billion, the Boston-based company said, adding that there would be no change for retirees already collecting pension benefits. 
GE's industrial net debt stood at $54.4 billion as of June 30.
""Returning GE to a position of strength has required us to make several difficult decisions, and today's decision to freeze the pension is no exception,"" GE Chief Human Resources Officer Kevin Cox said in a press release.
GE's pension plan has been closed to new entrants since 2012. The company had about 283,000 employees at the end of 2018, about 97,000 of them in the United States.
GE expects to record a non-cash pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter, but did not specify the amount.
The company also said it would pre-fund about $4 billion to $5 billion of its requirements for 2021 and 2022 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by using a portion of the $38 billion in cash it is collecting from the sale of various businesses.

GE said it was on track to hit its target of less than 2.5 times net-debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, by the end of 2020.

661,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 06:48PM ET</span>",Southwest pilots sue Boeing for misleading them on 737 MAX,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Pilots Association (SWAPA) said on Monday it had filed a lawsuit against Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co alleging that the planemaker ""deliberately misled"" the airline and pilots about its 737 MAX aircraft.
The grounding of the 737 MAX in March has wiped out more than 30,000 Southwest Airlines flights, causing over $100 million in lost wages for pilots, the union said. 
Southwest is the largest operator of the MAX with 34 jetliners in its fleet when the aircraft was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes that together killed 346 people.
The lawsuit, filed in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, alleges that Boeing ""abandoned sound design and engineering practices, withheld safety critical information from regulators and deliberately misled its customers, pilots and the public about the true scope of design changes to the 737 MAX.""
Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said: ""While we value our long relationship with SWAPA, we believe this lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it.""
The planemaker will continue to work with Southwest and its pilots on efforts to safely return the MAX to service, he said.
Boeing is under pressure to deliver updated software and training to regulators in order for the aircraft to fly again, and has been negotiating compensation with customers like Southwest over the financial hit from the grounding. 
""We have to be able to trust Boeing to truthfully disclose the information we need to safely operate our aircraft. In the case of the 737 MAX, that absolutely did not happen,"" said SWAPA president, Captain Jon Weaks. 
He said it is ""critical"" that Boeing takes whatever time is necessary to safely return the MAX to service, but added that pilots ""should not be expected to take a significant and ever-expanding financial loss as a result of Boeing's negligence."" 
Southwest, with around 10,000 pilots represented by SWAPA, had 41 more MAX jets on order for this year alone. The budget-friendly carrier is scheduling without the MAX until at least early January, pending regulatory approval for commercial flight.
Pilots at American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group, which so far has canceled MAX flights through early December, have also demanded compensation for lost pay related to the 737 MAX grounding, but have not filed a lawsuit. 

Last month Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly promised the airline would share any reimbursement from Boeing over the MAX grounding with its employees.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 06:04PM ET</span>","Kroger, Walgreens to stop sales of e-cigarettes amid U.S. vaping crackdown","(Reuters) - Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc said on Monday they would stop selling e-cigarettes at their stores, amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of the product and reports of lung disease and some deaths linked to vaping.
Their move comes weeks after Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said it was pulling the plug on e-cigarette sales, citing growing federal, state and local regulatory complexity and uncertainty.
E-cigarettes and other vaping products have been linked to a mysterious lung illness that is reported to have led to 18 deaths as of last week, with the number of confirmed and probable cases of the condition exceeding 1,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Kroger said it would discontinue sales of e-cigarettes at its stores and fuel centers after selling through its current inventory.
Walgreens said it had decided to stop selling e-cigarette products at its U.S. stores as the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health officials continue to examine the issue.
The drugstore chain, which earlier this year set a minimum age to sell tobacco products at 21 years, said the decision was also reflective of developing regulations in a growing number of states and municipalities.
New York and Michigan have already banned the sales of flavored vaping products, while the Trump administration has announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.

Kroger operates more than 2,700 stores, including over 1,500 fuel stations, while Walgreens runs nearly 10,000 drugstores in the United States.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 05:51PM ET</span>",Explainer: Disruptions in the global shipping industry,"(Reuters) - Oil shipping rates are soaring following a series of sanctions on a Chinese transportation giant and limitations placed on movement of Venezuelan crude oil tankers.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SHIPPING RATES?
The cost of chartering a supertanker to send crude oil from one country to another is rising sharply. A South Korean importer paid more than $12 million in shipping costs for one crude shipment from the U.S. Gulf Coast. This was followed by Friday's tentative charter of another crude vessel by Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) for $13.25 million to ship in November.
WHAT IS AFFECTING THE COST OF SHIPPING?
The United States in late September imposed sanctions on two units of China's COSCO (SS:600026) for their alleged involvement in bringing crude oil from Iran. U.S. Gulf Coast exporters, in turn, have held back from chartering COSCO-linked vessels. COSCO operates more than 50 supertankers, the largest vessels for carrying crude oil or fuel products.
HOW IS VENEZUELA INVOLVED IN THIS?
Last week,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) banned the use of vessels linked to oil flows from Venezuela in the last year, affecting some 250 ships. Exxon is the largest U.S. oil company and a major shipper, and its move caused rates to rise further, market sources have said. The move comes several months after the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela in an attempt to cut off the nation's oil revenue in a bid to oust President Nicolas Maduro, who is accused of human rights violations and rigging the 2018 presidential election. Maduro calls opposition leader Juan Guaido a U.S. puppet.
DO THE ATTACKS ON SAUDI ARAMCO'S FACILITIES HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?
A small amount. After those attacks last month, shippers worldwide scrambled to secure cargoes for big buyers in Asia, and many of them turned to the United States. That boosted rates, though the current surge is tied more to sanctions on COSCO and Exxon's moves.
WHAT ELSE IS CONTRIBUTING TO RISING RATES?
New maritime rules capping the amount of sulfur used in fuels for shipping have added to rising rates, because they raise the cost for shipowners who had in the past relied on ""bunker fuel"" - and as of Jan. 1 will have to switch to cleaner-burning marine fuel or diesel fuel."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it was putting 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including video surveillance company Hikvision (SZ:002415) - on a U.S. trade blacklist over Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.
Those added to the so-called ""Entity List"" include the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region People’s Government Public Security Bureau, 19 subordinate government agencies and eight commercial firms, according to a Commerce Department filing. The companies include Zhejiang Dahua Technology (SZ:002236), IFLYTEK Co (SZ:002230),  Xiamen Meiya Pico Information  Co (SZ:300188) and Yixin Science and Technology Co.
Reuters reported on the planned additions earlier Monday, before the Commerce Department made it official.
The department filing said the ""entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.""
U.S. officials said the announcement was not tied to this week's resumption of trade talks with China. Being added to the ""Entity List"" bars companies or other entities from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.
The Commerce Department previously added Huawei Technologies Co and more than 100 affiliates to the Entity List.
Hikvision, officially known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, with a market value of about $42 billion, calls itself the world’s largest video surveillance gear maker. Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas.
Hikvision did not immediately comment on the Commerce Department's move.
John Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia, Ambarella,  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagates as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be “devastating."" Shares in Ambarella fell more than 9% on the news.
In August, the Trump administration released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.
Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government's restrictions."
667,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 05:13PM ET</span>","U.S. Blacklists China's Hikvision, 7 Others on Rights Violations","(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration placed eight Chinese technology companies on a U.S. blacklist on Monday, accusing them of being implicated in human rights violations against Muslim minorities in China’s far-western province of Xinjiang.
The companies include two video surveillance companies -- Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. – that by some accounts control as much as a third of the global market for video surveillance and have cameras all over the world.
The move, which was announced after U.S. markets closed, came on the same day negotiators from the U.S. and China began working-level preparations for high-level talks due to begin on Thursday in Washington. Entities on the list are prohibited from doing business with American companies without being granted a U.S. government license.
“Specifically, these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups’’ in Xinjiang, the U.S. Commerce Department said in a federal register notice published on Monday.
China Talks
The news broke just as President Donald Trump was attending the signing of a partial trade agreement with Japan and predicting a big week of talks with China.
""We think there’s a chance that we could do something very substantial,’’ he told reporters of the China talks. “I think they’re coming to make a deal, we’ll see whether or not a deal can be made.’’
Besides Hikvision and Dahua, the companies put on the blacklist include artificial intelligence companies iFlytek, Megvii Technology, Sense Time, Yitu Technologies.
Also included are Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co. Ltd, which bills itself as an “expert in digital forensics and cybersecurity in China,” according to its website, and Shanghai-based Yixin Science and Technology, a supplier of micro and nano fabrication equipment.
The move targets Chinese surveillance companies involved in the crackdown in Xinjiang, where as many as a million Uighur Muslims have been placed in mass detention camps, prompting criticism from around the world.
The blacklisting of these firms has been long in the making and national security advisers for months have been pushing for the president to move forward on the plan. But the timing is highly provocative, coming just days before China’s Vice Premier Liu He is schedule to arrive in Washington for high-stakes trade talks being watched by financial markets around the world.
The White House in May had readied the sanctions package for surveillance technology companies accused of human rights violations but decided to hold back because of the ongoing trade negotiations.
The Trump administration in June again considered the sanctions and had planned to roll them out with a human rights speech by Vice President Mike Pence on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) massacre, Bloomberg has reported. The speech was postponed indefinitely -- at the request of Chinese officials -- so that President Trump could secure a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Osaka.
Also to be placed on the Commerce Department’s “entity list” are the Xinjiang region’s public security bureau and 18 other municipal and county public security bureaus as well as the province’s police college."

As a result, stocks slipped on the day. The S&P 500 was off 0.45%. The Dow Jones industrials  were down 0.36% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.33%. Telecom and communications services stocks were among the few sectors showing gains. Energy and staples stocks were lower.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit a 52-week high, but then fell back to a tiny gain and was one of just eight Dow stocks ahead on the day..
While the changes were small, there were some sizable swings for the indexes. The Dow fell as many as 149 points and gained as many as 82. The Nasdaq was up nearly 31 points and down more than 40 points.
As a result, the day had to be a disappointment after the big gains seen at the end of last week, especially Friday, after a bullish jobs report. The Dow was up 495 points over the two days -- after falling 838 points Tuesday and Wednesday.
Driving the market's volatility is the U.S.-China trade battle. China, for now, wants a stripped-down agreement, like buying more soybeans and pork, while the Trump Administration wants a comprehensive deal, including changes in Chinese law to stop theft of intellectual property. That is proving a major sticking point.
The trade talks will command a lot of attention because there are few important economic reports this week, except minutes from the Federal Reserve's August meeting. 
The U.S. and China have been wrangling for more than a year, with both sides boosting tariffs on products imported from the other and affecting both countries' economies and global trade as well. 
The swings in stocks were evident as well in swings in oil prices as traders tried to figure out how a U.S. withdrawal from parts of Syria and the trade battles would play out.
But both West Texas Intermediate and Brent  futures ended down slightly. WTI ended at $52.75 a barrel. Brent fell 2 cents to $58.35. The declines hit shares of oil-and-gas exploration-and-production companies hard. Apache (NYSE:APA) and   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN) both fell more than 3%. 
The 10-Year Treasury  yield was at 1.565%, up from 1.514% on Friday. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) had a good day, rising 2.7%, tops among S&P 500 stocks. It was followed by financial services software company Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY),   Align Technology   (NASDAQ:ALGN), which makes equipment used in orthodontics and biotech company Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB). 
Consumer stocks didn't fare well. Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), Chinese internet company Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) were among the worst S&P 500 performers. 
Gold futures moved lower as well."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rebecca Thornton will become the head of JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) director advisory services group, a unit of the U.S. bank that helps source members for corporate boards and provides advice to them, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Thornton, who joined JPMorgan from executive recruiting firm Spencer Stuart last year, succeeds Karen Simon, a veteran of the bank who is retiring. Thornton is an expert in corporate governance across industries who has helped build out the boards of private equity-owned companies and has bolstered those facing pressure from activist investors.
Corporate boards of directors are under increasing scrutiny as investors press them on the diversity of their of their members, their view on environmental risks facing companies and their independence from management. Investors are pushing back against some companies with governance practices they view as sub-par, such as co-working space landlord The We Company, which recently shelved plans to go public.
Since joining JPMorgan, Thornton has helped the group expand its referral network, according to the internal memo.
JPMorgan's director advisory services group has worked with more than 300 corporate clients and placed 23 directors, according to the internal memo. The group also has a network of more than 700 candidates.
Rod Reed, JPMorgan's vice chairman of investment banking, will also serve as senior adviser to Thornton and her team, according to the memo."

672,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 03:54PM ET</span>",Union Says Talks With GM Have ‘Taken a Turn for the Worse’,"(Bloomberg) -- The strike at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). entered its fourth week with the United Auto Workers union and the carmaker at an impasse over investment in U.S. factories, overshadowing progress made in recent days on other key issues.
The union made an offer to GM on Saturday evening, and the company’s response Sunday morning didn’t address some issues, especially job security, Terry Dittes, a UAW vice president, wrote in a letter to members. “Negotiations have taken a turn for the worse,” he wrote.
GM shares were little changed at $34.89 as of 1:15 p.m. Monday in New York. The stock has dropped about 10% since the walkout began.
“They reverted back to their last rejected proposal and made little change,” Dittes wrote, in reference to GM. “It did nothing to provide job security during the term of this agreement.”
A spokesman for GM said the automaker is continuing to negotiate in good faith. The company is “committed to continuing discussions around the clock to reach a resolution,” the spokesman said in an email. The two sides resumed negotiations Monday morning.
The strike that took effect Sept. 16 has cut GM production by more than 8,000 vehicles a day, according to calculations by analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and IHS Markit. The cost to the automaker has exceeded $1 billion, with GM losing about $82 million of potential profit in North America every day of the strike, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote last week.
Fallout from the strike widened on Monday, with GM temporarily halting production of a V-8 engine and a transmission at its plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, due to the lack of components coming from an idled U.S. factory.
The walkout has the attention of the Trump administration. Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, told Fox News on Monday he’s concerned about the slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and said the GM strike is “not helping.”
Tense Talks
In a sign of how tense the talks got on Sunday, Dittes sent a letter to Scott Sandefur, vice president of labor relations for GM North America, to scold him for a lack of response to the union’s offer.
In a letter, he criticized Sandefur for not having the “professional courtesy to explain why you could not accept or why you rejected our package proposal for each item we addressed.”
“We expect the company to respond and discuss the package proposal we presented yesterday,” he wrote.
In the past week, the two sides have agreed on health care, which will remain mostly untouched from from the current plan, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday. They’ve also agreed on one of the biggest outstanding issues: how to give temporary workers a path to full-time employment, the people said.
Job Security
Progress toward a deal broke down over investment in U.S. plants. GM has offered to build its electric trucks in a plant that straddles the line between Detroit and the town of Hamtramck, which is scheduled to be idle in January when the sedans it builds go away. But there is no promise for GM’s idled compact car plant in Lordstown, Ohio.
The UAW wants GM to allocate new work for those factories, even if it means moving the assembly of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer and GMC Terrain sport utility vehicles from a plant in Mexico, one of the people said.
The pressure for a deal has been increasing, on both sides, and the issues are complex. They include corruption investigations of union leaders; the shift from traditional engines to electric powertrains; and the possibility that the economy could flip into recession with damage of a longer strike at a company like GM.
The fight won’t be over once an agreement is reached, since the deal must be ratified by all members. After four years of record profits for the company, workers want a share of the spoils, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the labor and economics group and the Center for Automotive Research. “They will have to sell it,” she said.
If a tentative deal is signed, union workers may stay on strike until they vote to ratify the four-year deal. UAW local leaders nationwide will convene in Detroit to decide whether to remain out of work until that ratification vote is completed.
Outstanding Issues
GM and the UAW continue to debate over a boost to retirement accounts for older workers with pensions and newer hires with 401(k) plans. Another outstanding issue is pay progression for temporary workers.
The people didn’t say how much of a raise workers will get. GM originally wanted to give workers 2% raises in two of the contract’s four years, interspersed with 2% lump sum payments in the other two years. UAW leaders want 4% raises in two years and 4% lump sums.
For temporary workers, negotiators have discussed a path to full-time employment after three years. The two sides debated whether a temp who was laid off could claim the accumulated time once called back, one of the people said. The union also wants more vacation time and better health care for temps.

The study is the first to link vaping nicotine to cancer.


The amount of smoke the mice were exposed to was similar to what a human would inhale if they vaped regularly for about three to six years, estimated Moon-shong Tang, a professor at the NYU School of Medicine.

.Tobacco companies are under regulatory fire as lawmakers attempt to stop underage vaping, which has been linked to a series of deadly lung disease. Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) fell 1%, while Altria (NYSE:MO) was up 1.3%.

674,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 03:44PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com -- Here's a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Wholesale Inflation 
Wholesale inflation figures arrive Tuesday, providing traders with further insight into the pace of price pressures. 
The Labor Department will issue the producer price index (PPI) report at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). On average, economists expect the PPI rose 0.1% in September, the same as it rose the month before. 
The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.2% last month, from 0.3% in August, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would bring year-over-year PPI growth to 1.8% and core PPI growth up 2.3%, unchanged from a month earlier. 
The PPI is considered a leading indicator, measuring the input prices for goods sold at a retail level.
2. U.S. Crude Oil Inventories Set for Another Surprise Build?
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data will be closely watched for signs on whether domestic crude inventories will continue to shrink following a draw last week. 
API data last week showed inventories fell 5.9 million barrels, though that differed from the 3.1 million build reported by the Energy Information Administration. 
Oil prices reversed early gains to settle roughly flat at $52.75 per barrel amid worries of U.S. and China trade talks, slated for later this week.
3. Levi Strauss, Domino's Pizza to Deliver Quarterly Earnings
Levi's (NYSE:LEVI) is set to report earnings on Tuesday after U.S. markets close. 
The report comes as analysts are keen to establish whether the apparel retailer's efforts to expand beyond its native men’s jeans business and its direct-to-consumer push have helped it to offset the sluggish retail backdrop that has weighed on its peers' margin growth.
The direct-to-consumer approach has gathered importance recently as department stores – who some merchants like Levi's have relied on for sales - come under pressure. 
Annual sales at U.S. department stores fell 20% from 2017 to 2018, and are on pace to decline further this year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Levi's is expected to report earnings of 28 cents per share on sales of $1.44 billion, according to estimates from Investing.com. 
Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) delivers results Tuesday before the market open, with the company expected to report earnings of $2.07 per share on sales of $824 million. 
Beyond earnings, same-store sales, which have been slowing for several quarters, will also come under the spotlight.
The company’s sales have taken a hit from growing competition from third-party delivery providers such as Uber Eats, DoorDash and Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB)."

Cecily Dumas of BakerHostetler was comparing that expectation with the maximum of $8.4 billion PG&E has proposed for paying victims of the wildfires in 2017 and 2018 in Northern California that forced it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.
At the time, PG&E said it expected wildfire-related liabilities topping $30 billion.
The utility has already struck settlements worth a combined $12 billion to resolve claims of a group of public entities hit hard by the blazes and insurers who had made payments for wildfire-related claims."
676,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 03:11PM ET</span>",U.S. Equities Slump as China Trade Meeting Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equity indexes slumped as traders tried to gauge the outlook for a trade deal between China and the Trump administration. Treasuries slipped and the dollar gained.
The S&P 500 Index headed lower in the afternoon after veering between small gains and small losses for most of the day in light volume. Sentiment got a boost on speculation that China is ready to do a deal, while pessimists focused on a report that senior Chinese officials have indicated the range of topics they’re willing to discuss at upcoming talks has narrowed considerably.
The Stoxx Europe 600 index climbed as foodmaker and telecom companies advanced. The pound dipped as European leaders cast doubt on reaching a Brexit agreement in time for the U.K.’s Oct. 31 deadline. The dollar strengthened.
In the wake of a slew of weak data and with protectionism portrayed as the main impediment to global growth, investor focus will return to foreign trade this week as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and an entourage of officials head to Washington to resume talks with their U.S. counterparts. As economic indicators flash warnings, traders have ramped up bets for further Federal Reserve rate cuts. They’ll search for new clues on the policy path when minutes from the latest Fed meeting are released in coming days.
“Given the high level of uncertainty that’s out there and the cross-currents -- the cross-currents being escalating geopolitical risks on the one hand and increased monetary easing on the part of the world’s global central banks -- it’s really difficult at this point to determine which force is going to gain the upper hand,” said Ed Campbell, a portfolio manager and managing director at QMA.
Japanese equities closed little changed, while Shanghai markets are yet to re-open after holidays. Hong Kong was also shuttered for a holiday, leaving traders with limited options to respond -- or not -- to escalating violence in the city, where protesters set fires and vandalized train stations and banks over the weekend. The yuan dropped in offshore trading by the most since late September.
Elsewhere, West Texas-grade oil steadied following its biggest weekly decline since July.
Here are some key events coming up this week:
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He visits Washington for trade talks with his U.S. counterparts.Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks Tuesday on the final day of NABE’s annual conference in Denver; on the following day, minutes are released on the last policy meeting of the Fed’s rate-setting committee.Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly will meet at an unofficial summit.The U.S. releases a key measure of inflation on Thursday.Here are the main moves in markets:

The S&P 500 Index slipped 0.4% as of 2:53 p.m. New York time.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.7%.
Japan’s Topix index was little changed.

 

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2%.
The pound slipped 0.3% to $1.2299.
The euro was little changed at $1.0975.
The Japanese yen slipped 0.3% to 107.29 per dollar.
The offshore yuan weakened 0.2% to 7.1292 per dollar.

677,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 02:34PM ET</span>",Nissan board set for tense meeting as alleged split over future leadership emerges,"By Maki Shiraki, Norihiko Shirouzu and Gilles Guillaume
TOKYO (Reuters) - The board of Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) will meet on Tuesday as a split has emerged over the scandal-hit automaker's next CEO, putting the head of the nominations committee at odds with an influential executive, people familiar with the matter said.
Directors, which include those from top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), will also discuss the future of another Nissan executive, Hari Nada, multiple people said. 
Nada helped oust former Chairman Carlos Ghosn but has since been hit by allegations of overpayment himself. Renault may back a proposal calling for his exit, a source close to the French automaker said. 
Nissan and Renault declined to comment. Nada did not respond to requests for comment about the allegations. 
The board discord at Japan's second-largest carmaker illustrates how the turmoil that followed Ghosn's downfall last year deepened with the departure of former CEO Hiroto Saikawa last month. Saikawa was forced to step down after he admitted to being improperly overpaid.
The internal strife also has implications for Nissan's often difficult relationship with Renault. 
Tension has since emerged between Masakazu Toyoda, the Princeton-educated former trade ministry official who chairs the nominations committee, and Hitoshi Kawaguchi, who is responsible for external affairs and is seen as having close ties to government, four people familiar with the situation said. 
""The relationship is strained,"" said one of the people, all of whom declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Toyoda and another outside director, Motoo Nagai, were against Saikawa's abrupt resignation last month, given that the board had not yet found a replacement, the person said. 
The Toyoda camp believes that Kawaguchi played a role in helping to set the stage for former CEO Saikawa's departure, the person said. Kawaguchi is also seen as being supportive of acting chief executive Yasuhiro Yamauchi getting the job on a permanent basis, the person said, adding that Toyoda was cautious about Yamauchi.
FOCUS ON NADA
The nominations committee is due to meet earlier in the day at Nissan's Yokohama headquarters, with the board itself due to meet in the afternoon.
Nada has come under increasing scrutiny after the New York Times reported on Sunday he had received ""unjust enrichment,"" citing a review by an external law firm hired by the automaker. 
The Wall Street Journal has reported that some Nissan lawyers said that Nada, who oversees Nissan's legal department and had previously worked closely with Ghosn on sensitive matters, needed to do more to avoid potential conflicts of interest. 
A Nissan spokesman declined to comment on both reports.
""If the Nissan board proposes calling for (Nada's) exit, Renault representatives will probably vote in favor of the proposal,"" said the source close to Renault. The French company has a 43.4% stake in Nissan.
Reuters reported last month that Saikawa's fate was sealed by two external directors who persuaded the board to oust the former Ghosn protege and spare the company more reputational damage.

The race for the CEO job has been narrowed down to a contest between Yamauchi and former Nissan China chief Jun Seki, who are seen as front-runners, although India-born Ashwani Gupta and a possible external candidate remain in the mix, Reuters reported this month.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A surprise $1.9 billion investment by Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) in LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) is likely to fire up competition in South America as the weakest U.S. carrier in the region joins up with the strongest homegrown player.
Atlanta-based Delta had long struggled to get a better foothold in the Latin American market, lagging United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL), whose longtime partnership with LATAM gave it a comfortable lead.
With the Delta deal, that reigning power couple has split.
Dominance in Latin America — an air travel market expected to double in the next decade — has been fiercely disputed by the top three U.S. carriers for good reason. Eight of every 10 passengers in Latin America traveling outside the region are bound for North America, according to industry group ALTA.
Following its breakup with Chile-based LATAM last month, American Airlines quickly announced new flights next year from Miami to Chile and Peru — destinations where the two had been coordinating their routes with regulatory approval.
""This shows you that the (American-LATAM) partnership ultimately ended up undermining supply,"" said Carlos Ozores, a principal at consulting company ICF. ""There was no competition because these were two carriers that coordinated their fares and worked as one.""
American said it had ""expanded routes and lowered prices"" as a result of its coordination with LATAM in Chile and Peru.
The combined strength of LATAM and American ultimately doomed their partnership, as Chile's top court ruled in May that they could not expand their cooperation on travel to the United States.
By contrast, Delta's historic weakness in the region has become a distinct advantage, allowing it to leapfrog competitors without facing as much regulatory scrutiny.
""American and LATAM had a number of overlaps that created issues,"" Delta Chief Legal Officer Peter Carter told investors last month. ""And we just don't have that here.""
LATAM declined to comment.
American said in a statement it ""remains the largest U.S. carrier to both Latin and South America and we look forward to competing and growing in this region of the world.""
American also announced an additional daily flight from Miami to Sao Paulo starting in 2020, a market where it did not have the level of coordination as in Chile or Peru. This will create stiffer competition, especially in Miami, a hub for both LATAM and American and a top destination for Latin Americans.
""It's a very risky move because Delta is not very strong in Miami and American is very strong there,"" said Luis Felipe Oliveira, ALTA's executive director.
BEYOND BRAZIL
Delta has worked for much of the past decade to improve its standing in Latin America, investing in Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas (SA:GOLL4) in 2011 and Grupo  Aeromexico  (MX:AEROMEX) the next year. In 2016, it made an offer for Colombia's Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p), but was rebuffed in favor of United.
In recent years, Delta has grown frustrated with the Gol partnership, which did little for its South American push beyond Brazil. LATAM and Avianca have broader regional ambitions, investing in domestic airlines outside their home markets.
""So the natural thought is ... that produces a return that's below your average return,"" Glen Hauenstein, Delta's president, told investors last month regarding the prior regional strategy.
Delta is in the process of selling its stake in Gol, and redoubling efforts in Colombia, Chile and Peru, which account for a combined 45% of South American travel to the United States, compared with just 29% percent from Brazil.
Air traffic in each of the three countries is expected to more than triple between 2020 and 2040, according to a forecast prepared by CAF, a Latin American development bank owned by countries in the region.
Colombia even rivals Brazil for U.S. travel. Last year, 3 million travelers flew between Brazil and North America, compared with 2.7 million who flew between Colombia and North America, according to worldwide industry group IATA. Colombia, which has a quarter of the population of Brazil, is also expected to grow its economy more quickly than its larger neighbor.
""The major market that we want to be in is Colombia,"" Delta's Hauenstein said.
LATAM is already making ambitious moves there. In May, it announced a $300 million investment in Colombia aimed at challenging market leader Avianca, which has allied with United and Copa Holdings (N:CPA) in their own regional play.
Delta is hoping it is arriving in time to reap the benefits of LATAM's groundwork."

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc is seeking to raise $1.5 billion for its third special situations fund, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
KKR Special Situations Fund III, which was registered with regulators in June, will acquire distressed debt at a discount, said three sources who requested anonymity to discuss the matter.
KKR, which has not announced the fundraising target, declined to comment. It told investors during its second-quarter earnings call in July that it was fundraising for a special situations fund.
New York-based KKR closed its first special situations fund after raising $2 billion from investors in 2014. Its second closed with $3.35 billion in 2016.
Special situations funds invest in the bonds of companies about to go bankrupt, with hopes of earning substantial gains when the firms return to financial health.
KKR's special situations investments include Gibson, a Nashville-based guitar manufacturer, and Telepizza, a pizza delivery company based in Madrid.
U.S. private equity firms are expected to raise about $220 billion this year, according to data provider Pitchbook, as institutional investors continue to seek returns not available in public markets.

BMO analysts Tamy Chen and Peter Sklar lowered their sales and cash-flow forecasts for pot stocks, forecasting that producers will cut prices on middle-tier flower inventory ahead of new products like edibles, vapes and beverages, which are expected to launch in December.
The analysts reduced thier 2021 sales forecast for Aurora by 22% C$543 million ($425.2 million), cut Canopy sales forecast by 23% for 2021 to C$566 million, lowered their 2020 sales forecast for Cronos Group by 26% to C$174 million and lowered Tilray's sales forecast by 15%, to C$306 million.
  Canopy Growth   (NYSE:CGC) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) were among the biggest decliners, both down more than 1%. Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), meanwhile remained in the green, up about 0.3%.
“Given the elevated inventory level currently held by provinces, which we have anecdotally heard is largely the ‘mid-range’ flower category, we believe provinces and retailers will likely implement price markdowns to accelerate product sell-through,” Chen and Sklar said.
But not all producers are in the firing line, with smaller-scale producers such as Cronos, Sundial, and Supreme expected to steal share from their more illustrious rivals, according to the note. 
“We believe their flower products should have some quality differentiation relative to the over-saturated ‘mid-range’ flower segment,” the analysts said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court kicked off its new nine-month term with a flurry of activity on Monday, hearing arguments in three cases and rejecting numerous appeals that piled up over the summer.
With conservative Justice Clarence Thomas absent due to an unspecified illness, the court began hearing its first argument in a case focusing on whether states can discard the so-called insanity defense in criminal prosecutions. The case involved a man sentenced to death in Kansas for fatally shooting four family members while suffering from severe depression.
In remarks from the bench before the first argument, Chief Justice John Roberts said Thomas, the court's longest-serving justice, was ""indisposed"" due to illness but would still participate in deciding the three cases.
Details of Thomas' illness were not immediately disclosed. Thomas, one of the nine-justice court's most conservative members, is 71 and has served on the court since 1991.
In another action of note, the court said it would go ahead and hear a challenge to New York City restrictions on handgun owners transporting their firearms outside the home.
The city had argued over the summer that because the measure - challenged by gun owners and the state's National Rifle Association affiliate - was recently amended, the case before the justices was moot and there was no reason for the Supreme Court to hear the matter.
The justices in a brief order said they would consider that argument when they hear the case on Dec. 2, leaving open the possibility they will toss the case later.
The court hears its first major case of the term on Tuesday on whether a landmark decades-old federal anti-discrimination law that bars sex discrimination in the workplace protects gay and transgender employees.
Abortion rights also will figure prominently for the justices in the coming months. The court on Friday agreed to take up a major case that could lead to new curbs on access to abortion as it considers the legality of a Republican-backed Louisiana law that imposes restrictions on abortion doctors.
Another major case to be heard on Nov. 12 is over Trump's move to end a program created by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants - mostly Hispanic young adults - who were brought into the United States illegally as children.
The other two oral arguments scheduled on Monday are on whether the U.S. Constitution requires unanimous jury verdicts and on fees in patent litigation.
The court will issue rulings in all its cases by the end of June.
The court declined to hear several appeals. One involved Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com's bid to avoid a lawsuit seeking to ensure that warehouse workers for the e-commerce giant get paid for the time it takes them to go through extensive post-shift security screenings.
It also refused to hear Las Vegas sports gambler William ""Billy"" Walters' appeal of his 2017 insider trading conviction that landed him a five-year prison sentence in a case that also drew attention because of his ties to billionaire investor Carl Icahn and golfer Phil Mickelson.
The court declined to hear a bid by Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric Co to recover $379 million from customers related to damages it was forced to pay out in litigation after the deadly 2007 California wildfires that burned hundreds of homes.
It opted not to hear Acorda Therapeutics Inc's appeal of a lower court ruling that allowed generic versions of its multiple sclerosis treatment Ampyra and caused the drug's sales to plummet.
The justices refused to hear a bid by the University of Wisconsin's patent licensing arm to reinstate its legal victory against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in a fight over computer processor technology that the school claimed the company used without permission in certain iPhones and iPads.
They also declined to take up a dispute over the assets of Puerto Rico's largest public sector pension fund."

After early trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 109 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was down 11 points, also a decline of 0.4%. The Nasdaq 100 fell by a slightly gentler 0.3%.
A weekend report from Bloomberg suggesting that the two sides are far away from resolving their trade dispute has hit sentiment, given the role played by trade uncertainty in slowing down the global economy.
“A U.S. recession remains unlikely, as manufacturing only accounts for around 10% of the economy and sector sentiment is still in expansion territory, but we think it is unlikely stocks will move much higher from here without better economic data or a ceasefire in the trade situation,” said UBS Global Wealth Management chief investment officer Mark Haefele in a weekly preview.
Market participants appeared unwilling to make big new bets ahead of the talks on Thursday, and ahead of the start of an earnings season where S&P 500 companies are expected to report a year-on-year decline in profits. There had been similar fears about the second quarter which ended, however, with the majority of companies faring better than expected.
Among individual stocks,   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) lost early momentum to trade only 0.1% higher after it announced a freeze to its U.S. pension plan, affecting 20,000 employees. It said the move would cut the group’s pension deficit by between $5 billion and $8 billion, and cut net debt by up to $6 billion.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) fell 1.0% as its strike entered a fourth week. At the weekend, the UAW said negotiations had taken “a turn for the worse” due to what it said was management’s failure to provide job guarantees for U.S. workers. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) rose 1.5% after analysts at   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) upheld their price target of $45 for the stock. Its decline since IPO means that that’s now a ‘buy’ at Citi.
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) was 1.2% higher after announcing it would buy back $3 billion of stock next year. It also raised its quarterly dividend by over one-third to 42 cents, citing strong cash flow.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were set to slip at the opening bell on Monday as investors braced for U.S.-China trade talks later in the week, after a rollercoaster start to the month on fears that the world's largest economy could be sliding into a recession.
Tariff concessions from the United States and China last month fanned hopes of a dissolution to a prolonged trade war, but market participants have grown nervous about the outcome of high-level negotiations that begin on Thursday.
Chinese officials signaled they were increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by U.S. President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported over the weekend.
""Right now, investors are more focused on an actual outcome from these talks, but a majority have become somewhat skeptical that there will be something concrete this week,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, New Vernon, New Jersey.
Wall Street logged a choppy start to the month as concerns fueled by a contraction in U.S. factory activity and weaker-than-expected services sector data were countered by rising bets of a third interest rate cut this year by the Federal Reserve.
Traders see a 77.5% chance of the Fed cutting rates by a quarter percentage point at its policy meeting later this month, up from about 40% a week ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
After losing about 3% earlier in the week, the S&P 500 (SPX) and Dow Jones (DJI) indexes gained more than 1% on Friday after a report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 136,000 last month and the unemployment rate dropping to a 50-year low.
Investors will now turn to the third-quarter earnings season, which kicks off next week with U.S. banks reporting results, probing the impact of the trade war on Corporate America.
Analysts expect the lowest quarterly profit performance since 2016, with S&P 500 earnings falling 2.7% from a year ago, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.
At 8:57 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 53 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 7.75 points, or 0.26% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 25.25 points, or 0.33%.

Ride-hailing company  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) also rose 3.2% as  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) upgraded its shares to ""buy"".
General Motors Co (N:GM) dropped 1.3%, after the UAW rejected the carmaker's latest offer of a four-year labor contract and as its striking workers took a ""turn for the worse"" on Sunday.
 Align Technology  (O:ALGN) shares fell 1.8%, after Guggenheim downgraded shares of the orthodontic device maker to ""neutral"" on rising competition.

The plan represents the lender's most ambitious attempt in years to cut costs, the newspaper said https://www.ft.com/content/b43e7b3e-e6c7-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59, citing two people briefed on the matter. It said the cuts will focus mainly on high-paid roles.
HSBC declined to comment on the FT report.
The bank had 237,685 full-time employees at the end of June 2019, according to its 2019 interim report.
HSBC could announce the beginning of the latest cost-cutting drive and job cuts when it reports third-quarter results later this month, the FT said, citing one person briefed on the matter.
Quinn became interim CEO in August after the bank announced the surprise departure of John Flint, saying it needed a change at the top to address ""a challenging global environment.""
Flint's exit was a result of differences of opinion with chairman Mark Tucker over topics including approaches to cutting expenses, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters in August.
Any job cuts implemented as part of the latest plan would come on top of the redundancies announced earlier, the FT said. 
HSBC said it would be laying off about 4,000 people this year, and issued a gloomier business outlook due to an escalation of a trade war between China and the United States, an easing monetary policy cycle, unrest in its key Hong Kong market and Brexit.
Former HSBC Group CEO Stuart Gulliver announced plans to cut 30,000 jobs when he took the job in 2011 as part of a program to cut $3.5 billion in costs over three years and raise the bank's return on equity to 12-15%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest asset manager has appointed Manish Mehta as global head of human resources effective immediately, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Monday.
Mehta, previously the global head of ETFs and Index Investments (EII) Markets and Investments at BlackRock, replaces Rob Fairbairn who took over the role of head of human resources on an interim basis in July after the abrupt departure of then HR head Jeff Smith.
Following Smith's departure, BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink met with a number of internal and external candidates before settling on Mehta, Fink said in the memo.
""Through his work in EII, Manish has garnered experience across a range of BlackRock functions, from markets and investments to technology and operations,"" Fink said in the memo.
Fairbairn will assist with the transition before refocusing on BlackRock's most important global clients, Fink said.
Mehta, who will also join BlackRock's global executive committee, will report to Fink.
Mehta's predecessor Smith left BlackRock after more than a decade at the firm because ""he failed to adhere to company policy,"" the asset manager said in July.
Samara Cohen and Alan Mason will succeed Mehta as co-heads of EII Markets & Investments, BlackRock said on Monday.
In April, BlackRock made several changes to its senior leadership ranks aimed at winning more business from top institutional clients and boosting growth of its alternative investing business. 
BlackRock, whose shares are up about 9% this year, is expected to report third-quarter results on Oct. 15.

696,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 09:02AM ET</span>",A Banker Reveals the Bonus Culture Behind a $220 Billion Scandal,"(Bloomberg) -- Between 2009 and 2015, Mihhail Murnikov spent his days handling as many transactions as he could at the non-resident unit of   Danske Bank   A/S (CSE:DANSKE) in Estonia.
Roughly a year after Danske admitted that those transactions were part of a $220 billion money laundering scandal, prosecutors from Tallinn to Washington D.C. are still trying to get to the bottom of what really happened. The Danske case recently made headlines again after the man who used to run the bank’s Estonian operations committed suicide.
Murnikov, who like most of the 14 people who worked in Danske’s international banking unit in Tallinn is now a suspect in the case, says his time there was spent trying to live up to targets set by his bosses in order to earn a bonus.
“The whole non-resident business was built on one principle: Everyone was making money on cross-border transactions because non-residents had to pay $90 per transaction,” Murnikov, who is now 37, said in an interview in Tallinn. Danske’s costs associated with each transaction amounted to $1, he said.
By 2013, when profits peaked, Murnikov says Danske’s Estonian bankers were told to process close to half a million transactions for 4,000 non-resident clients, mostly from the former Soviet Union. That year, returns at the non-resident unit hit 402%, compared with about 7% for the whole Danske Bank group.
“I had a clear plan,” Murnikov said. With the 300 clients he had, the former banker says he needed to “make 40,000 transactions a year so I could get a bonus.” He says the only metric Danske used to determine an employee’s bonus was the number of transactions he or she handled.
“You were directly motivated by getting as many clients as possible. Everything else wasn’t important,” he said.
In an emailed comment sent on Sunday, a Danske Bank spokesman said, “As authorities are still investigating the matter, we cannot comment further beyond what we disclosed in the report of September 2018. As we have previously said, we should have never had the now closed portfolio of non-resident customers in Estonia.” The bank shuttered the non-resident unit in 2015 and has repeatedly said it’s cooperating with the authorities.

Danske started liquidating its Estonian operations this month, after being thrown out by the regulator. Its logos are now being expunged from the landscape, including from the building in downtown Tallinn that used to house the local head office.
The picture painted by Murnikov of the culture that dominated the non-resident unit fits largely with evidence provided by the Danske whistle-blower, Howard Wilkinson. As head of Danske’s Baltic Markets division in Tallinn, he had repeatedly warned senior management in Copenhagen that the transactions being handled looked suspicious.
Danske admitted in September last year that a “large part” of the $220 billion in non-resident flows that went through the Estonian unit between 2007 and 2015 were suspicious. It’s under criminal investigation in Denmark, Estonia, France and the U.S.
The affair has had disastrous consequences for many of the top bankers associated with the case. Danske’s former chief executive officer, Thomas Borgen, has had preliminary criminal charges brought against him since being fired last year. Estonian police have detained numerous former bankers and Aivar Rehe, the unit’s CEO until 2015, took his life almost a year to the day after the full scope of the laundering scandal became public. Police said he wasn’t a suspect, but Rehe had told local media earlier this year that he felt “responsible.”
For shareholders, finding out who knew what, and when, is key as Danske faces several class-action lawsuits. The laundering scandal has decimated the bank’s market value, with the share price plunging almost 50% in 2018. So far this year, shareholders have lost another 30%."

While such a scenario would be bullish for domestic British companies, a strengthening of the pound would take away much of the upside for U.K. equities, strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. Euro-zone shares, however, would be a “big potential indirect beneficiary,” they said.
JPMorgan on Monday reiterated its overweight stance on euro-area equities, while maintaining an underweight position on U.K. shares. In addition to a potential Brexit-deal boost, euro-area stocks are under-owned and trading cheaply on most valuation metrics, while speculation is mounting for fiscal stimulus in the region, the strategists said.
The U.K.’s benchmark FTSE 100 Index has tended to move inversely to the pound since the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union, thanks to a heavy weighting of exporters that benefit from a weaker currency. Last week, a stronger pound and a slump in commodities dragged the gauge to its worst drop in almost a year.
JPMorgan’s base case is for the Oct. 31 deadline to be pushed out to January-February, with early elections likely, but the strategists cautioned that “one shouldn’t ignore the likelihood that Boris Johnson gets his deal through in October.”
Prospects of a breakthrough ahead of the deadline faded again over the weekend as talks between the two sides stalled. The EU has indicated that proposals made by Prime Minister Johnson last week to resolve the impasse won’t cut it.
The FTSE 100 has underperformed the Euro Stoxx 50 Index this year amid lingering uncertainty about the timing and details of Brexit."
699,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 08:17AM ET</span>",Hong Kong faces more protests after night of violence,"By Simon Gardner and Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters gathered in Hong Kong shopping malls on Monday demanding ""freedom"" ahead of expected new protests after overnight turmoil in the Asian financial hub brought a warning from the last British governor that people could be killed.
Protesters formed large circles inside multi-level shopping malls and chanted ""disband Hong Kong police force"", ""fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong"" and ""I have the right to wear a mask"", as shoppers on a public holiday looked on.
The introduction of colonial-era emergency powers on Friday banning face masks, which protesters use to hide their identity, has sparked some of the most violent clashes in four months of demonstrations.
""Before long, unless we are very, very lucky, people are going to get killed, people are going to be shot,"" former British governor Chris Patten told Sky News. ""The idea that with public order policing you send police forces out with live ammunition is preposterous."" 
Two protesters have been shot, one in the chest and one in the leg. Authorities said the shootings were not intentional but occurred during skirmishes between police and protesters.
Many protesters, police and journalists have been injured in clashes, with police using rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against demonstrators, some of whom throw bricks and petrol bombs.
A journalist working with Hong Kong's public broadcaster was recovering in the hospital on Monday after being hit by a petrol bomb on Sunday night.
On Monday, Hong Kong's metro rail system, which typically carries about 5 million passengers a day, was only partially operating due to what authorities said was ""serious vandalism"" on Sunday night. Some stations were torched in the protests.
Many shops and Chinese banks were also extensively damaged.
The Sunday night protests, the second night of violence since the imposition of emergency laws, saw scores of protesters arrested and the first warning from Chinese military personnel stationed in the territory.
The protests have plunged the former British colony into its worst political crisis in decades and pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
What started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing's increasing grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a ""one country, two systems"" status promised when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.
China dismisses such accusations, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment. 
'IMPORTANCE OF DIALOGUE'
A 38-year-old woman and an 18-year-old man were charged on Monday for violating the emergency laws. They were also charged with unlawful assembly.
Tens of thousands of protesters, many families with children, marched peacefully through the center of Hong Kong on Sunday, most wearing face masks in defiance of the threat of a maximum one year in prison for doing so.
Police fired tear gas and charged with batons in an attempt to disperse protesters across the city and the rallies deteriorated into running clashes as night fell. 
China's Hong Kong military garrison warned protesters on Sunday they could be arrested for targeting its barracks with lasers - the first direct interaction between the People's Liberation Army and protesters.
Carrie Lam, the city's Beijing-backed leader, has said the face mask ban was necessary to end the violence by militant activists. But it has been criticized by human rights groups and the United Nations.
""She would have to be crazy to be making these decisions on her own without being pressured into them. The face mask business, absolutely madness,"" said Patten, who handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.
""I fear for the future, unless Carrie Lam actually intervenes and understands the importance of dialogue.""
The city government said in a statement ""public safety has been jeopardized and the public order of the whole city is being pushed to the verge of a very dangerous situation"".
Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade with the protests damaging tourism and retail sectors.
Protesters are demanding an independent inquiry into police action. 
Some protesters said an inquiry, which Patten also called for Lam to allow, was key to ending the protests.
""Hong Kong is part of China, no doubt. We don’t want independence. But we do want our freedoms that we are used to,” said Kong, 57, who works in finance, as he watched hundreds of protesters chanting in a shopping mall on Sunday.
""If they hold an independent inquiry, that would do it. Half of these people would go home. That is the key,” Kong said.
But others are worried the emergency powers are just the beginning of more erosion of their rights.

""The government can use the emergency law to enact other evil laws,"" said student Isaac Shum, 19, at one shopping mall protest.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks edged up globally on Monday as broadly positive U.S. jobs data from last week quelled some fears about an economic slowdown, but nervousness over U.S.-China trade talks persisted and more weak European economic data trickled in.
European shares gained despite falling German industrial orders data, which underscored concerns about a looming recession in Europe's largest economy. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.54% by midday in London. (EU)
Stocks worldwide took a battering last week, falling to their lowest in more than a month on fears of a U.S. economic slowdown. But positive U.S. jobs data on Friday helped spark a turnaround.
""I think the fact that the U.S. jobs report was broadly positive really put the brakes on the fear factor that was circulating last week - that the U.S. has been hit hard by the trade war,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets in London.

Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) opened higher but reversed course and declined 0.2%. A key Japanese economic index fell in August and the government downgraded its outlook for the economy to ""worsening,"" suggesting export-reliant Japan could slip into recession.
MSCI's All-Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares across 47 markets, moved into positive territory, up 0.1% after hovering between flat and negative for most of morning trade.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) rose 0.5%, shrugging off data that showed industrial orders fell slightly more than expected in August.
Morale among investors in the euro zone dropped in October to its lowest in more than six years as stimulus measures taken by central banks failed to allay recession fears, a survey by the Sentix research group showed.
Besides the steady trickle of weak economic data, investors also had their eyes on U.S.-China trade talks. Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are signaling they are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The report briefly lifted the safe-haven Japanese yen and gold.
An impeachment drive by U.S. Democrats arising from a whistleblower's allegations that Trump leveraged $400 million in aid to secure a promise from Ukraine's president to investigate Trumps's political rival Joe Biden will continue this week. Several U.S. diplomats will head to Capitol Hill for closed-door testimony.
On Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate the first complaint from an unnamed U.S. government official, which touched off the investigation.
""I think it's fair to say the second whistleblower coming forward will be an issue for Trump. This strengthens China's bargaining position in the trade war,"" Madden said.

702,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 07:37AM ET</span>",American Railroads Are Already in Recession With No End in Sight,"(Bloomberg) -- This year’s railroad slump is getting worse as a slowdown in manufacturing threatens broader weakness in the U.S. economy.
There’s no bottom in sight as the decline in carloads for large U.S. railroads widened to 5.5% in the third quarter, the biggest drop in three years, according to weekly reports from the Association of American Railroads. Shipments are down for autos, coal, grain, chemicals and consumer goods, with crude oil the only bright spot.
The rail downturn underscores the damage from the U.S.-China trade war, which is making shippers more cautious and crimping freight -- validating earlier warnings from railroad executives. Companies that stocked up on inventory last year amid President Donald Trump’s tariff threats are now working it off. Adding to the cargo drop, a brief rise in coal exports has fizzled and bad weather has delayed crop harvests and dragged down grain carloads.
“What’s quite clear is that we’re not yet at a trough. Trains have not yet bottomed,” said Ben Hartford, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. “We need to have some clarity in trade policy.”
While a railroad recession doesn’t necessarily presage a broader slump, it’s a dramatic turn from a year ago when rising shipments of autos, coal, lumber, chemicals and other commodities spurred U.S. rail carloads to rise 3.6% in 2018. Last year’s hot freight market jacked up trucking prices, and transportation costs spiked for companies including  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS). and Procter & Gamble Co.
‘No Pockets’
Now, “there are no pockets of growth,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lee Klaskow, who sounded the alarm about a “railroad recession” in a recent report. “There’s really nothing that’s tapping me on the shoulder saying, ‘Hey look at me. I’m going to be your next growth engine.’”
A rail recession isn’t necessarily a harbinger of a general economic downturn, Klaskow said. The U.S. economy continued to expand when carloads fell 2.1% in 2015 and 4.5% in 2016, after a crude-by-rail boom went bust.
Investors are partially insulated from the recent drop because earnings are holding up at the four large publicly traded railroads in the U.S., which have adopted an efficiency strategy developed by Hunter Harrison. The industry guru died in 2017 after overhauling CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) with his “precision scheduled railroading” approach.
CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) is the only major U.S. railroad that is poised to see earnings drop in the third quarter from a year earlier. Increases are expected at   Union Pacific   Corporation (NYSE:UNP),   Norfolk Southern   (NYSE:NSC) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), which adopted the efficiency techniques after CSX and are still reaping the rewards. That’s shoring up the railroads’ shares, although only Kansas City Southern is outperforming a Standard & Poor’s index of U.S. industrial companies.
Factory Slump
Cargo volumes have held up better at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and Canadian National Railway Co., as more maritime cargo from Asia shifts to Canadian ports. But in the U.S., sagging freight shipments are taking a toll.
The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index slipped to 47.8 in September, the lowest since June 2009. It was also the second straight month the index was below 50, which signals contraction.
Truckers are also feeling the pain. Less-than-truckload cargo, which tends to be tied to industrial production, plummeted 12% in August from a year earlier. Freight carried by long-haul trucking is still growing as consumer spending holds up. Truck cargo prices, though, have dropped.
Cheaper trucking rates are pulling some freight from rails. But even if that trend moderates next year and the decline in rail carloads slows, there’s no guarantee of growth -- especially if the factory weakness drags down consumer spending.
“That’s the risk at this point in time, that the consumer does begin to show impacts from the pain that we see on the manufacturing side,” Hartford said. As for rail freight, “when is it going to turn? I honestly have no idea.”"
703,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 07:06AM ET</span>","Global ad spending dented by weaker British, German economies","(Reuters) - Global advertising spending in 2019 is expected to grow lower than a previous estimate, hurt by recession fears in the United Kingdom and Germany, despite strong growth in digital ad budgets in the United States.
Industry forecaster Zenith cut its forecast to 4.4% growth from 4.6%, blaming a weaker trading globally and slowdowns in Europe and Asia. Global ad spending rose 6.7% in 2018.
With major European economies teetering on a recession, owing to trade tensions and the uncertainty around Brexit, businesses have tightened their purse strings, in turn hurting advertising budgets.
Zenith, owned by French advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP), forecast that global ad spending will reach $640 billion this year, with a 4.3% rise in 2020 and 4.4% in 2021, down from previous forecasts of 4.4% growth in 2020 and 4.3% in 2021.
The forecaster said it would normally expect an increase in ad spending in 2020, benefiting from U.S. elections, the Summer Olympics and the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament.
""But given current political and economic uncertainty, brands are being cautious about committing to extra spending at the moment,"" it added.
Zenith forecast a 0.6% decline for ad spending in Germany this year, down from a prior expectation of fall of 0.4%. It also reduced its growth forecast for the UK to 3.3% from 3.9%, its slowest rate of growth since 2011.
German industrial orders fell more than expected in August on weaker domestic demand, data showed on Monday, adding to signs that a manufacturing slump is pushing Europe's largest economy into recession.
Expenditure on advertising in China, the world's second biggest spender after the United States, is also slowing.
However, small and medium-sized companies advertising for the first time on  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Google (O:GOOGL) are continuing to drive growth in the United States, where consumer spending chugs along at a steady pace.
""Small businesses in the U.S. are spending heavily on social media and paid search, and are fuelling much of the global growth of these channels,"" Zenith researchers said.
The firm said ad spending on social media is expected to grow 20% in 2019, overtaking print to become the third-largest advertising channel."

Talks between the two sides' top trade negotiators are due to resume on Thursday, but Bloomberg cast doubt on any major progress, saying that the Chinese position had hardened and that it is no longer minded to make concessions on key issues such as subsidies to state-owned enterprises. It's unclear however, how serious Beijing had ever been about making such concessions. 
By 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), Dow futures were down 44 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down in parallel.
Tech stocks in general, and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) in particular, were set to face fresh pressure after a report that the EU's antitrust authorities are set to step up their clampdown on what they see as abuse of market power by U.S. tech giants. 
The Financial Times reported that the EU is set to issue ""interim"" measures forcing Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to suspend sales practises it suspects of being anti-competitive, even before the European Commission's investigation into the issue has run its course. In Broadcom's case, this refers to contractual requirements which stop Broadcom's customers from buying chips elsewhere.
Elsewhere, GM stock is also likely to be in focus after battle-lines hardened in the company's strike, which is now entering a fourth week. United Auto Workers representatives said negotiations between the two sides had ""taken a turn for the worse,"" with GM refusing to make assurances of job security for its U.S. workforce as it divvies up future production between the U.S. and Mexico.
ADRs in two major European banks will also be under the spotlight later. HSBC was reported over the weekend to be planning 10,000 job cuts - some 4% of its global workforce - as it tries to shore up profitability by paring back its operations in Europe. Meanwhile   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) Group, which only last week drew a line under a reputation-damaging investigation into former Global Wealth head Iqbal Khan, is reportedly facing up to $1.4 billion in legal damages for mis-selling mortgages prior to 2008 - more than twice what it has set aside.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 06:39AM ET</span>",Harley struggles to fire up new generation of riders with electric bike debut,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) is betting on electric motorcycles to attract the next generation of younger and more environmentally conscious riders to reverse declining U.S. sales.
But as Harley ships its first ""LiveWire"" bikes - priced at $29,799 - to dealers, there is little evidence the 116-year-old brand is catching on with new young customers.
The problem lies mostly with this ""super-premium"" product's price. The bike costs nearly as much as a Tesla Model 3, and aims for a market that does not really exist: young, ""green"" and affluent first-time motorcyclists.
The sleek sport bike has been available for preorder in the United States since January. However, the bulk of the orders are coming in from existing and old riders, according to interviews with 40 of the 150 dealerships nationwide that are carrying the bike this year.
The dealers Reuters spoke with account for little over a quarter of LiveWire dealerships and are spread across Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, California, Nevada, New Jersey and New York.
Harley has for years failed to increase sales in the United States, its top market accounting for more than half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-boomer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is finding it challenging to woo new customers. 
In 2018, Harley posted the steepest sales decline in four years in the United States. U.S. sales are tipped to fall again this year.
(Graphic on Harley's U.S. Retail sales: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/HARLEY%20DAVIDSON-ELECTRICBIKE/0H001QXBS8SB/index.html)
The heavyweight motorcycle maker's stock price has declined by 42% in the past five years. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) has gained 47%.
PRICE BARRIER
When Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich announced LiveWire's launch last year, his hope was the ease of riding motorcycles with no gears or clutch would help attract young and environmentally conscious urban riders.
In an interview with Reuters in February 2018, Levatich said the bike would help address Harley's demographic problem. 
""It is more about the next century than the last century,"" he said at the time. 
The preorders, thus far, have belied those hopes, according to the dealers.
""It is appealing to a demographic that is already riding,"" said Gennaro Sepe, a sales manager at a Harley dealership in Chicago. His store has received four preorders for the bike. All of them are from existing riders.
Harley declined to comment on LiveWire preorders. 
The motorcycle maker is not the only company investing in battery-powered transportation. 
Tougher emissions rules in Europe, China and the United States are forcing auto companies to switch to electrified models. A survey of U.S. millennial motorcyclists, published in February by the Motorcycle Industry Council, found 69% of the riders interested in electric motorcycles.
Harley's dealers said they are getting inquiries from young customers, but are struggling to translate them into sales. A key reason: LiveWire's retail price.
""Interest is very high,"" said a sales manager at a New Jersey-based dealership, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media. ""But once you get to pricing, interest is thrown out of the window.""
Over half of young college graduates in America, whom Harley is courting with battery-powered bikes, are saddled with student loans that entail average repayment of $200 to $300 per month.
Harley is not offering any discount or incentives to push the sales, either, the dealers said. 
In an interview with CNBC television in May, Levatich called LiveWire ""one of the best engineered products on the market"" and said it was worth its price. 
Gary Jon Prough, general sales manager at a dealership in Countryside, Illinois, said the vast majority of millennials cannot afford the bike as LiveWire is targeted at young and affluent customers with incomes above $100,000 a year. 
TESLA'S WAY
To drive up sales, Prough and other dealers expect Harley to go Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) way: launch more affordable battery-powered vehicles after creating a buzz with the premium model.
Tesla's first electric car cost over $100,000, but prices came down with subsequent models. Its Model 3 now comes with a base price of $35,000 and was instrumental in lifting its vehicle deliveries to a record level in the latest quarter. 
Traditional Harley Davidson entry-level bikes cost about $6,900.
The motorcycle maker has plans to bring out four more electrified models in the mid-power, low-power, e-bicycles and kids' two-wheeler segments by 2022. 
But unlike Tesla, Harley does not enjoy the true first mover's advantage. 
California-based Zero Motorcycles is already selling electric bikes in the United States with retail prices ranging from $8,500 to $21,000. Its top-end bike - SR/F - is similar to LiveWire, but costs nearly $9,000 less. 
Still, Bob Clark, a dealer for Zero's bikes in Chicago, says he has not yet sold one SR/F to riders under the age of 35. All three electric bikes he sold to young riders this year were in the $10,000 price range.
""Young riders are environmentally conscious, but are also very price-sensitive,"" Clark said.
It is not just pricing. LiveWire's limited range is also hampering its sales.
The bike can travel 146 miles (235 km) in the city or 95 miles in combined city and highway riding per charge. An ordinary household outlet can provide an overnight charge, while Level 3 direct current fast chargers stationed at Harley dealers will fully charge the bike in 60 minutes.
This renders LiveWire less effective for longer-distance rides, limiting its appeal among rural riders who prefer touring bikes.
Seven Harley dealerships told Reuters they have not even bothered ordering the bike, which would require investing in a Level 3 charging station and training staff. 
An Ohio-based dealer, who had initially signed up for LiveWire, said he pulled out at the last minute as he was not sure of the bike's demand in his area.
DELAYED ARRIVAL
A delay in LiveWire's arrival in stores has left the dealers in the Midwest and the East Coast with hardly a month to aggressively push the bike before the snow season sets in. Winter generally means a lull for motorcycle sales. 
When dealers began taking preorders, the delivery was expected in August, but was later shifted to September. On Sept. 30, the dealers Reuters spoke with were still waiting for the first bike. 
In a Twitter post on Oct. 2, Harley said the bikes are starting to arrive at authorized dealers. The tweet also carried a picture of the first LiveWire that was ""rolled off the line"" at its York, Pennsylvania, facility in late September.
With the demand rather limited, the dealers said, Harley has decided to keep the supplies tight in order to protect the bike's brand value and prevent any price-discounting pressure. The dealers said they are all expecting to receive less than 10 LiveWires this year.
James Hardiman, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, reckons Harley would sell between 400 and 1,600 LiveWires in the first year. That is not even 1% of the 228,051 bikes it sold worldwide last year. 

""This is going to be largely a rounding error certainly this year and even next,"" Hardiman said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - IKEA brand owner Inter IKEA could be ordered to pay millions of euros in Dutch back taxes by the end of the year, two people familiar with the matter said, as EU competition enforcers push on with their crackdown against unfair tax deals granted to multinationals.
The European Commission is now racing to wrap up the two-year investigation into the brand owner of IKEA, known for giant out-of-town budget furniture stores, but the timing may still slip as it weighs the scope of the case, the people said.
The EU executive declined to comment. 
Launched in 2017, the EU's investigation focuses on Inter IKEA Systems in the Netherlands, which operates IKEA's franchise business and records all revenue from its franchise fees worldwide collected from IKEA shops.
The Commission said at the time its investigation was triggered by a 2016 report from European Parliament green lawmakers which estimated that IKEA avoided 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in taxes over the course of six years. 
Inter IKEA said in an emailed comment on Monday: ""Just like all other companies working under the IKEA trademark, Inter IKEA Systems B.V. is committed to paying taxes in accordance with laws and regulations wherever we operate. We believe that we also in these cases have paid the correct amount of tax.”
The spotlight is on two tax rulings granted by the Dutch tax authorities in 2006 and 2011, which the European Commission said have significantly reduced Inter IKEA Systems' taxable profits in the Netherlands and given it an unfair advantage.
The EU competition enforcer said the first tax ruling, which covered 2006 to 2011, resulted in a significant part of Inter IKEA Systems' franchise profits shifting to a Luxembourg unit where it was not taxed.
A 2011 ruling allowed a substantial part of the company's franchise profits after 2011 to be transferred to its Liechtenstein parent.

The EU order comes after Europe's second-highest court last month backed the EU executive's methodology in its cases against Fiat and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).

(Reuters) - India and Taiwan equities received strong foreign inflows in September due to some local factors, but other regional markets saw outflows on concerns over the U.S.-China trade war and slowing economic growth.
Last month, Taiwan's markets received about $2.9 billion of foreign investment, on optimism over its economy, as a growing number of local firms were shifting their factories back home from mainland China, seen as aiding their export revenues.
Indian equities attracted about $1.1 billion worth of foreign inflows thanks to a corporate tax cut announced by the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to boost manufacturing and private investment.
However, investors withdrew money from other markets on concerns over slowing global trade and the prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war.
South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand recorded outflows of $874 million, $519 million and $379 million, respectively, last month, the exchange data showed.
Philippines and Vietnam were the other markets which saw outflows in September.
Investors' focus has shifted to the next round of U.S.-China trade negotiations in Washington on Oct. 10-11 to see if the two sides can end a bruising trade war that has raised fears of recession.
""Uncertainty is high and news flow has been mixed, with China’s new purchase of U.S. agriculture products coming together with speculation on a potential U.S. crackdown on portfolio flows into China,"" said J.P.Morgan in a report on Monday.
At the end of last month, Reuters reported that President Donald Trump's administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.
Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist with financial services firm IG, expects further turbulence in Asian stocks, saying a lack of positive news from the trade talks may
be seen by investors as opening the way for more tariffs.
Washington had delayed an Oct. 1 tariff hike as a goodwill gesture ahead of the talks, but has said it would go ahead with the plan from Oct. 15, with another move slated for Dec. 15.
""From a valuation perspective, Asia markets should have room to gain. That said, the event risks this month are in abundance which could keep foreign investors on the sidelines until the end of the month when there could be greater clarity,"" she added."
709,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 05:22AM ET</span>","StockBeat: HSBC's Mooted 10,000-Job Cull Is the Latest Blow to Europe Banks","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- When HSBC broke with a long tradition to oust John Flint as chief executive, many wondered just how bad things had got at the bank. News out late Sunday provides the answer.
An unconfirmed report by the Financial Times said that Flint’s replacement, Noel Quinn, is preparing to cut another 10,000 jobs from the lender. Given that Quinn is only in the position on an interim basis, that’s a powerful statement.
It also adds substance to the narrative around Flint’s departure – the board was too polite to spell it out explicitly at the time – namely, that the HSBC lifer was too tender-hearted to make the sort of cuts that the board felt were necessary to shore up profits.
The FT’s report indicates where those cuts might be felt. The bank’s global retail operations are set to bear the brunt, especially in the euro zone, where sub-zero interest rates have crushed profitability. With many expecting more aggressive quantitative easing and even lower interest rates from the European Central Bank when Christine Lagarde takes over next month, the logic of hanging on and waiting for things to get better has worn thin. HSBC’s network in France is reported to be under particular scrutiny.
HSBC is far from alone in facing an unmanageable two-way squeeze of costs and revenues – the infamous ‘Jaws’ that Flint and his cohorts have had to talk about in recent years.   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) unveiled 18,000 job cuts earlier this year in a major strategic rethink, the big difference being that its problems were most acute in the U.S., the one major developed market where banking is still reasonably profitable.   Societe Generale   (PA:SOGN) and   Barclays   (LON:BARC) have also been trying hard to prune staff.
HSBC hopes that the cuts will create some space for it to hire more people in Asia, where the opportunities are greater. However, 10,000 is still barely 4% of the bank’s workforce. Given the long-term pressure on profits (the home market of the U.K. is also edging closer to cutting interest rates, increasing the squeeze on what is already a mortgage-heavy, low-margin franchise), it would be a surprise if Quinn’s successor, whoever he or she may be, turns out to have plenty of work still to do. 
Deutsche has yet to reap much reward from its boldness (the external circumstances having moved against it in the meantime), but HSBC outperformed its peers slightly on Monday in an otherwise directionless market. The shares were down 0.4% by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), while the FTSE 100 was down less than 0.1%. The broader Stoxx 600 index was effectively unchanged. Germany’s DAX was down 0.1% after another decline – albeit a gentler one – in factory orders in August."

SoftBank's latest move underscored the Japanese conglomerate's move to add mobility-related business to its portfolio.
Softbank has stakes in companies such as  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cruise self-driving car, China's Didi Chuxing, Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing firm Grab and Colombian delivery-app Rappi.

721,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 12:37AM ET</span>","As Softbank's Oyo booms, some Indian hotels cry foul and check out","By Sachin Ravikumar and Chandini Monnappa
BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's Oyo Hotels and Homes shot out of nowhere to become one of the world's largest hotel chains with a simple promise of ""hassle-free"" online booking, transparent pricing and cheerful lodging.
But as the Softbank-backed (T:9984) startup pushes toward profitability, an increasing number of Indian hotel operators who have partnered with it are complaining about being blindsided by fee increases.
The backlash against Oyo - while limited to a small share of the more than 10,000 hotel owners in India who work with it - comes at a crucial time for an emerging-market unicorn valued at $10 billion and its major investor.
Softbank, which has invested nearly $1 billion in Oyo, through its Vision Fund, is struggling to raise funding for a second investment fund in the wake of the failed offering of office-rental company WeWork and amid questions about the path to profitability of other marquee investments like Uber (N:UBER).. Oyo has not yet turned a profit.
In the background of the discontent is the disruption Oyo has brought to India's lodging market – often to the delight of India's middle-class travelers and to the dismay of hotel owners who have seen room rates driven down at a time when economic growth has slowed.
Oyo charges hotels a roughly 20% franchise fee on room revenues when hotels join its network, but some Indian hotel operators say the startup often ends up taking half or more of revenues through fees that were not initially disclosed.
A group representing hotel operators in Bengaluru called for a criminal probe into Oyo last month, saying the company was withholding money because of unfair fee increases.
Two hoteliers in the southern state of Karnataka filed separate police complaints last month accusing Oyo of deceitfully increasing commissions, and accusing Oyo's 25-year-old founder and CEO Ritesh Agarwal of fraud.
Agarwal successfully appealed to the Karnataka High Court for a stay order on one case in Bengaluru, the court website shows, and a police official said the order barred police from investigating.
In the other complaint, in the town of Chikkamagaluru, police are investigating, an official there said.
Oyo has denied the allegations and said Agarwal declined comment on the legal complaint. The company said it operates with a high level of ""integrity, transparency and commitment"" with its partners.
Agarwal said hotel operators who have raised complaints represent a tiny fraction of Oyo's network and were seeking to drive prices higher at the expense of consumers.
""On an annual basis, Oyo is able to retain 99% of its asset owners. If, for instance, people were unhappy, our retention rate would have been lower,"" he told Reuters.
Softbank, which owns a roughly 45% stake in Oyo, declined to comment.
'PLATFORM FEE' AND 'VISIBILITY BOOST'
Oyo says it is in constant contact with its hotel partners. ""We have always disclosed any changes applicable to contracts with asset owners,"" Oyo said in a statement.
For their part, owners and managers say Oyo has introduced fees - including a ""platform fee"" and a fee for a ""visibility boost"" - which they only discovered in monthly statements.
Reuters interviews with 22 hotel owners and managers who run hotels under the Oyo brand in 10 Indian cities suggest the discontent has grown since late last year.
Several hotel groups have organized protests. Amitabh Mohapatra, head of one such group in northern India, says over 300 hotels have quit Oyo's India network this year, while Kunal Rajpara, who heads another group in western India, said a few dozen hoteliers from Ahmedabad ditched Oyo last month.
""The situation with Oyo has gone from bad to worse,"" said P.C. Rao, president of the Bruhat Bangalore Hotels Association. ""We want to make sure the business of small hoteliers isn't hurt.""
Some hotel operators say Oyo continued to list their properties on its mobile app with a ""sold out"" banner after they asked Oyo to sever ties.
Three hotel operators in Ahmedabad said they had e-mailed Oyo representatives on Sept. 23, asking to be removed from the platform but received no response. Reuters found all their properties still listed on Oyo's app with ""sold out"" messages even though the hotels had rooms available.
Oyo says once a hotel has served a 30-day notice period and accounts are settled, the property is typically delisted within 72 hours. It tags all properties serving their notice period that may deny check-ins to customers as ""sold out"", the company said.
'IT ISN'T SOMETHING OYO CAN IGNORE'
Founded in 2013, Oyo started by aggregating bookings for India's budget hotels, promising a standard of service in a market where that was more often the exception. Oyo has expanded to China, Europe and the United States, calling itself the world's fastest growing hotel chain.
Many hotel owners in India were upbeat when Oyo gave properties in smaller cities visibility but began to raise concerns when profits failed to improve, said Darshini Kansara, a hospitality industry analyst at CARE Ratings in Mumbai.
""It isn't something Oyo can ignore as they look to capture more market share.""
Based in Gurugram, near New Delhi, Oyo signs up hotels as franchisees by rebranding them and upgrading amenities and then charges fees from the owners.
Oyo says hotels are updated on any new contract terms on a tablet-device at the hotel that Oyo provides to manage bookings.
But some hotel owners say the devices are operated by junior staff, leaving them in the dark until fees have been charged. Ashraf Ali, a hotelier in Mumbai, said a notification offering new terms would keep showing up on the tablets until the hotel employee hit accept.
Bengaluru hotelier Vikrant Singh says his 50-room hotel swung from making monthly profits of nearly $7,000 in late 2016 to a loss of more than $2,000 this January. He blames Oyo for the reversal.

""Our profits went down due to the high commissions Oyo was charging,"" said Singh, who withdrew his hotel from Oyo in March.

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc is seeking to raise $1.5 billion for its third special situations fund, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
KKR Special Situations Fund III, which was registered with regulators in June, will acquire distressed debt at a discount, said three sources who requested anonymity to discuss the matter.
KKR, which has not announced the fundraising target, declined to comment. It told investors during its second-quarter earnings call in July that it was fundraising for a special situations fund.
New York-based KKR closed its first special situations fund after raising $2 billion from investors in 2014. Its second closed with $3.35 billion in 2016.
Special situations funds invest in the bonds of companies about to go bankrupt, with hopes of earning substantial gains when the firms return to financial health.
KKR's special situations investments include Gibson, a Nashville-based guitar manufacturer, and Telepizza, a pizza delivery company based in Madrid.
U.S. private equity firms are expected to raise about $220 billion this year, according to data provider Pitchbook, as institutional investors continue to seek returns not available in public markets.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) has lost at least one major pension contract while other companies are reviewing their relationship with the wealth manager, which has struggled to stem a client exodus following revelations of serious misconduct.
Two sources told Reuters that grocery wholesaler and distributor Metcash (AX:MTS) had dropped its long-term pension contract with AMP, while other client and market sources said at least four other companies were reviewing their contracts.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Amatil Ltd (CCA) (AX:CCA), an AMP client since 2005, confirmed its mandate was currently out to tender.
All the sources requested anonymity because the information is not yet public.
Under Australia's compulsory pension system, companies must select a ""default"" pension fund to receive 9.5% of a worker's salary if the worker does not nominate their own fund, representing strong fee income to the selected wealth manager.
In the last 12 months, more than 10 companies have removed AMP as their preferred fund, including apparel retailer Glassons and Australia Post, and switched to rival AustralianSuper, a source with direct knowledge of the mandate changes told Reuters.
The exits follow harsh criticism of AMP at a government-ordered Royal Commission inquiry into misconduct in the financial sector. AMP was singled out in evidence for wrongfully charging fees to clients and attempting to mislead regulators.
The reputational fallout and an unusually large number of ongoing reviews by long-term clients has weighed on AMP's share price, which has lost two thirds of its value over the past 18 months.
AMP said in an emailed statement on Thursday that the ""significant majority"" of major clients that have formally reviewed their mandates over the past year had stayed with AMP.
AMP ""supported"" more than 53,000 large and small Australian businesses with their employees' superannuation arrangements, the statement said.
AMP last month told the market it had retained more than 20 large corporate mandates, without adding details.
Grocery retailer Woolworths (AX:WOW), one of AMP's largest corporate clients, had retained its mandate following a recent review, while oil supplier Caltex Australia (AX:CTX) also remained a client, sources said.
CLIENTS DRIVE HARD BARGAIN
Still, the exits are being used by some clients to drive a better bargain, putting further pressure on AMP's already shrinking margins.
""AMP is trying very, very hard to keep our business,"" said one executive whose company is reviewing a pension mandate. ""We will consider what they have gone through and their brand, but if we stay it will be on a substantially better deal.""
AMP's flagship wealth management unit reported A$3.1 billion ($2.1 billion) in net outflows, 13% of which were from its corporate superannuation business, in the six months to June. It forecast further corporate outflows of about A$700 million in the short term.
Morningstar estimated the unit has seen net outflows worth close to 4% of assets under management since the Royal Commission started uncovering poor business practices in mid-2018.
Metcash, which has more than 6,300 employees, has replaced AMP with appointed SunSuper, the two sources with knowledge of the mandate said. Metcash and SunSuper declined to comment. The size of the mandate has not been disclosed.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2019 01:34PM ET</span>",Capital spending outlook another worry ahead of earnings,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are preparing for more cautious capital investment outlooks from U.S. companies as worries mount heading into earnings season about the possibility of an economic recession.
Capital expenditure increases have been weaker than last year, when corporate tax cuts helped to bolster spending, and some strategists say they may even fall short of Wall Street's expectations given the concerns about the economy and a prolonged trade war between the United States and China.
Less spending on technology, machinery and other equipment would suggest corporate executives are less confident in the economy than they had been, another potential negative for the stock market, which has fallen this week amid a series of weak economic reports.
Capital expenditures are expected to have increased just 3.0% in the third quarter from a year ago, which would be the lowest since the second quarter of 2017, when capex declined slightly, according to data based on analysts' estimates compiled by Refinitiv's research senior manager, David Aurelio.
That estimate drops to 1.1% in the fourth quarter, and year-over-year declines are projected in some quarters of 2020.
""It's very likely that capex spending is going to be below expectations,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. ""We are in a state of heightened economic policy uncertainty. That tamps down business investment.""
Strategists said spending plans will be of particular interest as S&P 500 (SPX) companies discuss their results for the third quarter in the weeks ahead.
The reporting period begins with big banks including JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and others reporting on Oct. 15.
Results overall are expected to be relatively weak, with analysts forecasting earnings for S&P 500 companies to have declined 2.7% in the third quarter from a year ago, based on Refinitiv's data.
Recent dismal economic indicators have fueled concerns that the United States was flirting with a recession.
Upbeat jobs data offered some relief for investors on Friday, but it came on the heels of a report this week showing manufacturing activity plunged to a more than 10-year trough in September. Other data showed U.S. services sector activity slowed to a three-year low in September.
""There is a correlation between CEO confidence and capex. And right now we've seen CEO confidence decrease, so again it's going to be a challenging environment for companies to go ahead and spend,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
While the trade war has eroded business confidence, easing monetary policy is expected to help because it reduces borrowing costs for businesses.
The U.S. central bank cut rates last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008. Bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month by 25 basis points were at about 77% on Friday, compared to 39.6% on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
""This talk of whether or not we're going into a recession, that enforces prudence"" by companies, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU), based in Newark, New Jersey. ""Ultimately what they're worried about is revenue growth."""
725,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2019 01:33PM ET</span>",Credit Suisse clears its CEO in spying scandal that rocked Swiss banking,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Michael Shields
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) cleared its CEO on Tuesday of snooping on a star wealth manager in an episode that saw suicide, scandal and espionage invade the secretive world of Swiss private banking.
The spying on ex-wealth management chief Iqbal Khan after he left the bank for arch-rival UBS (S:UBSG), and the suicide of a private investigator involved in organizing the surveillance, has badly tarnished the reputation of the Swiss bank and its top managers.
""I've not come across anyone who is not shocked by what is happening,"" a person familiar with Credit Suisse's management said. ""The shock is big. What you've seen in the media over the last 10 days has had a massive impact on the staff here.""
Khan, who left Switzerland's second-biggest bank in July and began work on Tuesday at UBS, was under surveillance by private detectives hired by Credit Suisse from Sept. 4 to Sept. 17, when he spotted them.
News of a rift between Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam and Khan prior to the latter's departure has prompted speculation over reasons for the surveillance, which has roiled Switzerland's financial center, triggered a criminal investigation and hurt the image of everyone involved.
A private investigator who organized the surveillance of a senior former Credit Suisse manager committed suicide last week,
a lawyer for the security firm at the center of the spying case said.
The bank's chairman, Urs Rohner, said on Tuesday that a personal dispute between Khan and Thiam, which had made it impossible for the two to work together, had prompted Khan's departure but had been unrelated to the hiring of detectives.
The bank's internal probe carried out by law firm Homburger found Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee alone initiated observation of the former wealth management executive to see if he was trying to poach former colleagues to join him at UBS.
The investigation found no evidence that Khan had attempted to poach employees or clients from Credit Suisse.
Bouee - whose professional life has closely tracked Thiam's, having worked together at McKinsey,  Aviva  (L:AV) and  Prudential  (L:PRU) before moving in 2015 to Credit Suisse - stepped down from his role to take responsibility for the matter, the bank said on Tuesday.
Bouee and Thiam had been close associates since the McKinsey days, with Bouee described as more abrasive than Thiam by one source who previously worked with them both in Britain.
""He was bad cop to Tidjane's good cop,"" the person said, adding that the two usually spoke together in French.
A second banker who worked with both added that, while Thiam and Bouee had a good working relationship, Thiam did not maintain an inner circle of closer contacts amongst his team.
Rohner told a news conference on Tuesday that Thiam still enjoyed the full confidence of the board. ""We have absolutely zero evidence that he was informed about it,"" he said, while apologizing to Khan and his family for the incident.
The board called the spying operation ""wrong and disproportionate"" in a statement, adding it had caused severe reputational damage for the bank.
The criminal investigation of the spying operation continues.
Rohner and John Tiner, head of the board's audit committee, batted back questions about the credibility of the probe's findings, saying the incident was unusual and insisting Thiam was on top of what was happening at the group.
Only two employees - Bouee and the security boss under him, who also resigned - knew of the surveillance, the probe found.
However, deleted messages sent on secure platform Threema used by Bouee and security personnel had limited the scope of the findings, Homburger managing partner Flavio Romerio said.
Messages between Bouee and Thiam from Aug. 22 onward, which were sent via company email and messaging platform WhatsApp, had been reviewed and found not to be relevant, he added.
Thiam did not attend the news conference.
Two big investors said last week that they wanted Thiam, architect of a sweeping three-year revamp at the bank, to stay unless it was shown he broke the law, but shareholders largely remained silent on Tuesday as Credit Suisse's shares reversed early gains to close down 2.9%.
BAD BLOOD?
Khan was known as a smooth and ambitious manager putting life into Thiam's strategy of reshaping the bank into a wealth management juggernaut to rival bigger peer UBS.
Under his watch, the International Wealth Management business he led more than doubled profits and sharply boosted the client assets it handles.
The abrupt departure of Pakistan-born Khan, who moved to Switzerland when he was 12, exposed his falling out with Thiam, the 57-year-old Franco-Ivorian executive who revamped a stagnant Credit Suisse by cutting thousands of jobs, scaling back investment banking and bolstering its balance sheet.
Rohner said a heated exchange that took place between the two in January prompted the chairman to get involved.
""The decisive question for me was whether the differences between the two gentlemen... would impact their cooperation going forward,"" Rohner said, adding their performance was unaffected at first. ""But it became apparent that a long-term, trusting and mutual cooperation was no longer possible and that Mr. Khan wanted to leave the bank.""
Khan's switch to co-head of wealth management at market leader UBS sealed the divorce.
Khan, 43, went to the police after the Sept. 17 confrontation with at least one detective who was shadowing him and his wife as they drove through Zurich. Conflicting versions have emerged of how the incident unfolded.
A spokesman declined comment on behalf of Khan, stating that ""Mr. Khan being now with UBS will not comment on today's announcement of Credit Suisse"". UBS also declined to comment."
726,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2019 01:33PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs poised to lead Airbnb's listing - sources","By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Short-term home rental company Airbnb Inc is set to hire  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) as joint lead advisers on its planned stock market flotation next year, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The appointments would represent another high-profile assignment for the storied investment banks, albeit potentially less lucrative than usual. This is because Airbnb is leaning toward going public through a direct listing, rather than an initial public offering (IPO), sources have said.
In an IPO, shares are sold by the company or its investors in a process managed by the investment banks as underwriters. In a direct listing, however, no new shares are sold, and the role of the investment banks is more of one advising on market conditions, as opposed to underwriting.
As a result, companies can save on the investment banking fees they pay through a direct listing.
Airbnb is considering going public around the middle of 2020, one of the sources said, a timeline that would help it avoid any stock market volatility in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November of next year.
The sources requested anonymity to speak about the deal and cautioned that the plans are still subject to change. Airbnb, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Airbnb said last month it planned to become a publicly listed company in 2020, marking it out as one of the biggest names to pursue a stock market float next year.
Airbnb was valued at $31 billion in its most recent private fundraising round, according to data provider PitchBook. The company sold shares in the private market earlier this year at a valuation of roughly $35 billion around the time it purchased HotelTonight, Vox reported.
Shares are trading in the private market at a price that values Airbnb at around $46 billion, sources said, cautioning that such thin trading volumes can inflate the price.
By comparison, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Marriott International Inc have market capitalizations of around $26 billion and $40 billion, respectively.
With a direct listing, Airbnb would follow the route taken by music streaming company Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology SA and workplace messaging firm Slack Technologies Inc in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Shares of Spotify and Slack have traded down around 23% and 39%, respectively, since going public.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co were the three investment banks that advised on both the Spotify and Slack listings.
Slack expected to pay $22.1 million in fees to its three financial advisers. By comparison, the more than two dozen banks on the 2017 IPO of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), which was worth about $31 billion at the time of its public listing, earned a total of $85 million in commissions.
An Airbnb listing next year would follow a mixed 2019 for tech listings, with the likes of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) struggling since going public. Earlier this week, WeWork's parent, The We Company, also filed to withdraw its IPO after investors raised concerns about its burgeoning losses and the tight grip of its co-founder on its governance.
Airbnb took in more than $1 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2019, the second time it exceeded that level in its decade-plus history, the company said last month. It gave no details on profitability.
Last month, Airbnb said that as of Sept. 15, its hosts had earned more than $80 billion by sharing their homes and spaces on the app, and as of June 1, it had collected over $1.6 billion in transient occupancy taxes.
It also said it passed a milestone of having more than 7 million Airbnb listings in over 100,000 cities around the world."
727,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2019 01:33PM ET</span>","Sacklers reaped up to $13 billion from OxyContin maker, U.S. states say","By Mike Spector and Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP steered up to $13 billion in profits to the company's controlling Sackler family, according to U.S. states opposing efforts to halt lawsuits alleging the company and its owners helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic.
The wealthy Sacklers received the money from Purdue during an unspecified time frame, according to court documents and portions of a deposition filed in the drugmaker's bankruptcy proceedings this week.
Purdue ultimately transferred $12 billion or $13 billion to the family, a company adviser testified in the deposition. The deposition, taken last week, was revealed in court filings on Thursday and Friday.
The financial figure is significantly larger than the roughly $4 billion previous lawsuits have alleged the Sacklers took out of Purdue, and was cited as part of coordinated legal broadsides this week against the company's attempts to shield itself and the family from sprawling opioid litigation.
Many states want the Sacklers to contribute more than an initial $3 billion they have pledged toward resolving the lawsuits as part of a settlement Purdue has proposed.
Attorneys general from 24 states and the District of Columbia on Friday objected to Purdue's September request that a U.S. bankruptcy judge halt more than 2,600 lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in damages, and they raised financial transfers to the Sacklers in their legal arguments.
So, too, did lawyers representing 500 cities, counties and Native American tribes, according to an earlier court filing.
""The distribution numbers do not reflect the fact that many billions of dollars from that amount were paid in taxes and reinvested in businesses that will be sold as part of the proposed settlement,"" said Daniel S. Connolly, a lawyer for family members facing lawsuits who are related to the late Raymond Sackler, one of the modern Purdue's co-founders, in a statement.
A spokesman for relatives of another deceased company co-founder, Mortimer Sackler, who also face litigation, had no immediate comment.
Purdue had no immediate comment on the payments. The company and family have denied allegations they contributed to the U.S. opioid crisis.
The lawsuits, largely brought by state and local governments, allege Purdue and the Sacklers contributed to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people since 1999 by aggressively marketing opioids while downplaying their addiction and overdose risks.
""The Sacklers are billionaires, they are not bankrupt,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, among the officials opposing Purdue's efforts to halt lawsuits, told Reuters in an interview. ""They should not be allowed to use the filing to shield their assets.""
Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month after reaching a deal it valued at more than $10 billion that would resolve the bulk of the cases against the company and the Sacklers.
The company contends it needs the litigation against it and the Sacklers paused for about nine months so it can attempt to settle with hold-out plaintiffs and preserve money that would otherwise be spent fighting the cases.
Purdue said the costs of continued litigation were ""staggering,"" putting its legal expenses this year at nearly $250 million.
""Without a stay of the litigation, only lawyers will win,"" the company said in a statement.
Typically, a bankruptcy filing triggers an ""automatic stay"" of all litigation without a specific order from a judge.
However, Purdue is seeking an injunction to stop the lawsuits because the Sacklers did not seek bankruptcy protection and there is an exception to the automatic stay for government actions that seek to enforce laws related to public health and safety.
Healey said the exception gives the states a strong argument to move forward with their cases against the OxyContin maker. ""We're exercising our police power and have the right to do so,"" she said.
The Sacklers have offered to cede control of Purdue to the plaintiffs and contribute $3 billion, and potentially more through the sale of another pharmaceutical business they own, toward the proposed settlement. Purdue is also in discussions to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe that could carry a financial penalty.
Healey said the Sacklers should increase their contribution and she criticized the structure of the deal, which is premised in part on the continued sale of OxyContin, a drug that critics say helped launch the nation's opioid addiction crisis."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. tax reform is finally catching up with the college financial aid process, and the synchronization is off to a rocky start.
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the 2010-2021 academic year became available on Oct. 1. This form, the first since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect, requires information from 2018 tax returns.
Tax law changes figure into the calculation of the Expected Family Contribution, which is the all-important bottom line amount colleges want families to pay toward tuition.
Six new schedules are incorporated into the main 1040 tax form, while the 1040EZ and 1040A forms have been eliminated. Tax data can be culled electronically to the FAFSA through the IRS's Data Retrieval Tool if applicants sign up for that process.
However, the system does not pull in the schedules, particularly Schedule 1, which lists items like capital gains, unemployment payments, student loan interest paid or the teachers' deduction for supplies. Instead, there are prompts asking if you filed that form.
The FAFSA system does not alert you if any schedules are skipped, said Charlie Javice, the founder and chief executive of Frank Financial Aid, a free app that helps students file the FAFSA.
""You could be providing half the information, and nobody is telling you if it's accurate or not,"" said Javice.
The risk is that students could miss out on aid because certain income and deductions are not counted. They could make math mistakes when inputting the data by hand, or their applications could be incomplete, resulting in a laborious verification process.
Families tend to give up when the process gets too cumbersome, Javice said.
""If normally you'd qualify for a variety of financial aid benefits, and this change puts it at risk, you may want to run that by somebody,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, head of tax at Betterment.
HOOPS FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS
The forms 1040EZ and 1040A used to automatically qualify low-income students for an Auto-Zero Expected Contribution or the Simplified Needs Test. The Department of Education said the added Schedule 1 question serves this purpose.
But in August, 10 senators sent a public letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos seeking clarification (https:// ""We are concerned that mistaken answers to this complicated question could lead to eligible students losing access,"" they wrote.
A spokesman for the Education Department responded to Reuters that the changes to the tax law have not affected the function of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.
What is the best way for families filing the FAFSA form? Either use the IRS tool and try to verify that schools receive the pertinent information, or not use the tool and enter all their information manually, experts advised.
Javice chose the latter. The Frank app scans the tax forms of applicants and extracts tax information.
Skipping the IRS tool is risky because you are more likely to be selected for the verification process, which is lengthy and time-consuming, warned college finance expert Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of savingforcollege.com.
""The data retrieval tool has always had issues,"" Kantrowitz said.
For low-income students, the new tax structure just makes things more complicated.
""It's a big step backwards in terms of college access,"" Javice said."

ZURICH/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The announcement by Julius Baer this week that it had hired five senior bankers from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) underscores the challenge facing Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam as he seeks to reassure staff and investors in the wake of a spying scandal.
Preventing staff defections was at the heart of a decision by Credit Suisse to put former international wealth-management head Iqbal Khan under surveillance. But that move -- which spilled into the open when Khan had an altercation on the street with the men who were trailing him -- has by the bank's own admission caused severe reputational damage.
The team joining Julius Baer had left Credit Suisse before the espionage scandal broke but the debacle and the bank's efforts to draw a line under it have enthused rivals to accelerate their poaching efforts, headhunters say.
Wealth managers are the lifeblood of private banking, one of the fastest growing businesses in the global financial sector, holding the keys to close client relationships worth millions or billions in assets.
""A lot of people are uncertain about...the (bank's) ability to attract new bankers,"" said Rahul Sen, a London-based global leader for private banking at headhunter Boyden. ""They botched up the entire Iqbal Khan situation.""
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the staff departures and any measures it was deploying to retain top talent.
Credit Suisse's probe into the spying scandal, which exonerated Thiam of any involvement, has failed to quell staff disquiet, particularly when it emerged Thiam and Khan had a personal dispute which prompted the former wealth management chief to leave.
Under Khan's watch, profits at Credit Suisse's wealth management business had more than doubled. He joined arch-rival UBS as co-head of the wealth management business this week.
Credit Suisse's investigation into its surveillance of Khan concluded that Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee had initiated it to see if Khan was trying to poach former colleagues to join him at UBS.
No evidence emerged that he had attempted to take employees or clients from Credit Suisse.
Since his departure, however, others have pounced and while job-hopping is common in the private banking sector, the exit of senior managers adds to the pressure on Thiam, who has to deal with tough market conditions and continue to manage costs after seeing through a three-year restructuring period.
Recent losses include a Dubai-based senior private banker who is expected to take at least three team members to a rival, and a Hong Kong-based China banker who will be taking along a dozen of his colleagues at Credit Suisse to a European peer next month, people with knowledge of the matter said. Another senior banker, who managed about 700 million Swiss francs ($701 million) of client assets in Portugal and Brazil, left last week and will be joining a rival toward the end of this year, one of the people said.
Britain's  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Julius Baer hired a total of 14 bankers from Credit Suisse's International Wealth Management business, they announced last month."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Talks for a new four-year labor contract between General Motors Co (N:GM) and its striking workers took a ""turn for the worse"" on Sunday after the United Auto Workers rejected the largest U.S. automaker's latest offer but the two sides were still talking.
GM made an offer to the union that basically repeated one the UAW had previously rejected, Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the GM department, said in a letter to members. The union provided a copy of the letter to Reuters.
""These negotiations have taken a turn for the worse,"" he said.
""We, in this union, could not be more disappointed with General Motors,"" Dittes said. ""The company has shown an unwillingness to fairly compensate ... the UAW.""
Dittes said the UAW made an offer on Saturday to GM that covered wages, signing bonuses, job security, profit sharing and other issues. He said GM responded on Sunday morning with its counteroffer, which ""did nothing to advance a whole host of issues.""
GM said in a statement that it was committed to negotiating ""around the clock"" to reach a deal.
""We continue to negotiate in good faith with very good proposals that benefit employees today and build a stronger future for all of us,"" the company said in the statement.
The GM strike began on Sept. 16 with its 48,000 UAW members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the automaker's profit and protection of healthcare benefits. The sides have been meeting daily. 
One key issue is around assembly of future vehicles. The UAW wants GM to make commitments on future products it would build in various plants beyond what has currently been offered, said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified.
GM officials previously said the Detroit company's labor rates are the highest in the industry and it needs the ability to build some vehicles in other markets to keep costs down. 
Just before the strike began, GM, the largest U.S. automaker by vehicle sales, said that its offer to the UAW included plans to invest more than $7 billion in its U.S. plants over the life of the deal. 
GM also said then it had ""solutions"" for the Lordstown, Ohio, and Detroit assembly plants that it had previously said would cease making vehicles. Sources said at the time those plans included a battery plant in Ohio and building an electric truck in Detroit. 
The UAW has previously said it wants GM to shift vehicle assembly work back from other countries like Mexico and China. The source said that remains an issue in the talks.
Through August, 526,000 of the 573,000 vehicles GM exported from Mexico were sent to the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump and many Democrats have urged GM to shift production to unused or underused U.S. plants. 
Other issues remaining in the talks include wages and pensions, the source previously said. 

Analysts estimate the strike has cost GM over $1 billion, while LMC Automotive estimated on Thursday that GM has lost production of 118,000 vehicles through Oct. 2.

Carmakers have been forced to consider upgrading exhaust treatment systems on older cars after German cities started banning heavily polluting diesel vehicles to cut fine particulate matter and toxic nitrogen oxides. 
Daimler launched a website this week to process applications for financial support, as German motor authority KBA seeks to approve an after-market kit to upgrade the exhaust systems on various Mercedes diesel passenger vehicles.
The company has offered the subsidy to customers in German regions that face potential driving bans, the carmaker said. For a factbox about possible diesel bans, click:. 
The first retrofit kit for Mercedes cars with ""Euro 5"" diesel engines, including the best-selling E220 and E250 models, has been developed by Dr Pley SCR Technology, a Bavaria-based, family-owned business. 
It will cost around 3,000 euros to buy and install. 
German carmakers initially offered software updates and shied away from endorsing hardware retrofits, instead lobbying for customers to buy new cars with cleaner engines.
But consumer groups pressured carmakers to endorse retrofits as a more cost-effective measure. 

""We have known right from the start that retrofits are feasible and have now proved this to the carmakers,"" said Thomas Steinbrueckner, head of development at Dr Pley SCR Technology.

The GM strike began on Sept. 16 with the 48,000 UAW members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker's profit and protection of healthcare benefits. The sides have been meeting daily and talks continued on Saturday, and representatives for both sides declined to discuss details.
One of the major remaining issues includes the UAW's desire to reduce the time it takes newer hires to earn the top wage scale of about $31 an hour from the current eight-year period, said the source, who asked not to be identified because the talks are ongoing. 
Another issue is a desire by the union for a higher pension payout, meaning an enhanced formula for those members hired before 2007 who would be covered by a pension, and a higher contribution to the 401(k) plans of members hired after 2007, the source said.
The UAW said late Friday it had made ""good progress"" in the negotiations on such issues as health care and the status of temporary workers.
The focus on fewer issues indicates the talks could be nearing a resolution as the dispute is taking a toll on both the automaker and striking UAW workers, whose individual compensation of $250 a week from the union strike fund is a fraction of their normal pay.

Analysts estimate the strike has cost GM over $1 billion, while LMC Automotive estimated on Thursday GM has lost production of 118,000 vehicles through Oct. 2.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators said on Friday they were reviewing whether Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc should have recalled 2,000 of its electric cars in May instead of issuing a software upgrade to fix a potential defect that could have resulted in battery fires.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it opened a review to evaluate claims made in a petition about Tesla's handling of the software upgrade in Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2012-2019 model years. The agency said the petition's claims cover about 2,000 Tesla vehicles.
Tesla, headed by billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has also been sued over updates to its battery-charging software, and this week faced complaints involving vehicles that crashed in parking lots while using a self-driving feature.
The 2,000 vehicles covered by the petition to the NHTSA received a battery management software upgrade in May in response to a potential flaw that could trigger non-crash-related fires. The petition was filed Sept. 17 by the offices of California lawyer Edward C. Chen on behalf of Tesla owners.
It said the software update was believed to have reduced the driving range of the affected vehicles by 25 miles or more per charge.
Chen said Friday that he strongly believes ""and various reliable sources have indicated that this number is much larger than 2,000.""
The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tesla shares closed down 0.7% at $231.43 on Friday.
In August, a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in California on behalf of a Tesla owner by Chen claimed that Tesla knew some vehicle batteries were defective and ""pushed out software updates despite knowing that the class vehicles would suffer from loss in range and performance.""
The suit alleges Tesla's aim was ""to avoid providing warranty battery replacements to rightful customers.""
Tesla told Reuters in August that ""a very small percentage of owners of older Model S and Model X vehicles may have noticed a small reduction in range when charging to a maximum state of charge following a software update designed to improve battery longevity.""
The lawsuit alleges Tesla placed a software-induced limitation on battery charging and other changes that make batteries charge more slowly. It also cites more than a dozen reports of Tesla's vehicles catching fire over the past six years.
Tesla has not yet responded to the lawsuit in court.
After a Model S caught fire in Hong Kong, Tesla said it was revising charge and thermal management settings on Model S and X vehicles via an over-the-air software update out of an ""overabundance"" of caution. The goal was “to help further protect the battery and improve battery longevity,” it said.
Tesla later said it planned to improve the software update after some owners complained.
The National Transportation Safety Board and the NHTSA are investigating several battery fires in Tesla vehicles. The NHTSA has previously investigated other battery and charging system issues with Tesla vehicles."

(Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have requested information from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) critic Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) as part of an antitrust probe, according to two sources briefed on the investigation into allegations the iPhone maker engages in anti-competitive behavior to support its own apps.
The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee reached out to the music streaming service with broad requests for information, according to one source, who added the request to the company was narrowed in follow up telephone calls.
 Spotify Technology  SA filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union in March, but the contact with the committee marks its first known participation in congressional inquiries into the iPhone maker, whose Apple Music streaming service is Spotify's biggest rival.
Spotify and other developers have alleged that Apple engages in anticompetitive behavior by imposing rules that hamper distribution via its App Store, the only way for third-party developers to reach more than 900 million iPhone users.
At the same time, Apple sometimes copies the features of their apps for its own offerings, developers have said. Multiple apps in the App Store offered female cycle tracking before Apple added the same feature to its own health tracking app this fall, for example.
Apple has said it acts in the best interests of its users and treats all developers equally. It has denied Spotify's claims and says its streaming music rival is seeking to pay it nothing and play by a different set of rules than the millions of other apps on its App Store.
Spotify has been pressing for antitrust action against Apple for several years.
Its representatives have met with Justice Department officials, as well as members of the FTC's Technology Task Force, a group of some 17 attorneys that was set up in February to focus on online platforms and other Internet competition issues, according to one source.
App developers also complain that Apple's Siri, which responds to verbal commands and can control Apple's own apps, has long had limited functionality with the vast majority of non-Apple apps, including Spotify.
Apple announced an update to its software in June that would allow Siri to access Spotify and other music services.
Beyond Spotify, the congressional probe has tapped many companies for details on the four big tech firms.
In addition to the Judiciary Committee probe, the big tech companies face a plethora of other antitrust investigations.
The Justice Department is probing Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple while the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Groups of state attorneys general have also been formed to probe Google and Facebook.
Spotify has complained also about the 30 percent fee that Apple charges outside app developers who sell so-called digital goods such as music or e-books on the App Store, using Apple's in-app billing system. Apple bars app makers for collecting payment any other way on the App Store or showing users links or buttons to other ways to pay.
At one point, Apple told Spotify to stop sending emails to users who had just signed up for a free version of its streaming music prompting them to upgrade to the paid service, Spotify has said. Apple has said those emails were a workaround strategy to solicit payments outside its App Store system, violating the spirit of rules that all other app makers must follow.
Spotify has said the shifting rules, and Apple's threats to block routine app updates, have made it difficult to compete with Apple's own music service on a level playing field.
Asked for comment, Apple referred to its previous responses, published in March, to Spotify's claims. The company says it enforces its App Store rules evenly among all developers and that more than eight out of every 10 apps are free and pay nothing to Apple. Apple has said Spotify pays nothing for users of its free service or for paid Spotify members who signed up outside the App Store.
Apple has said Spotify pays a revenue share on about half a percent of its 108 million premium users, paying 15% fees on roughly 680,000 customers that Spotify acquired between 2014 and 2016 when it used Apple's payment systems.
""Even now, only a tiny fraction of their subscriptions fall under Apple’s revenue-sharing model. Spotify is asking for that number to be zero,"" Apple said in response to Spotify's claims it published in March."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Harvard Business School is known for guiding the next generation of financial leaders through compelling case studies in management, innovation and global intelligence. Now the curriculum includes impact investing, which incorporates positive environmental, social and governance values into investment decisions.
Vikram Gandhi, a senior lecturer, developed the course ""Investing in the 21st Century: Return, Risk and Impact"" based on years of experience working at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), as well as founding his own company, Asha Impact.
Reuters spoke with Gandhi, a Harvard Business School graduate himself, about teaching the next generation.
Q: Why do emerging business leaders need to learn about impact investing?
A: There has to be a way to do good at the same time as investing. This is not about creating less wealth or making poor investments. You can you make a difference and also bring in returns. Financial return is critical, but social and societal returns are equally important.
Q: Is it hard to teach?
A: It's an evolving field. There's no defined framework on how to bring it in and measure it. How do you compare impact across investment like you compare returns? A lot of our teaching is not about imparting conclusions, but it's putting out alternatives and case studies and having a debate on that.
Q: You break down one particular exchange-traded fund in a case study, the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF, otherwise known as SHE, which holds stocks of companies that have gender diversity in their senior leadership. How does that work?
A: The students may have had some exposure to ETFs. In this case, we go into a deep-dive into how ETFs are created - who are the players, how is stock aggregated? Then we also go into constructing the ETF, what is the data required.
Q: How do you measure an ETF that has a specific focus?
A: You can ask: Is investing in the ETF going to make a difference? Will it change behavior?
Like with most cases, there's no correct answer. Financial monitoring happens – it will be relative to some index. The goal is that companies which are not in the ETF will say, ""Let's push to have more female representation in leadership in order to be included."" If large pools of capital get behind it, it can change behavior.
Q: What do you expect your students to do with the knowledge gained from your course?
A: It's two-fold. Some people want to go into impact investing as a professional career. The other category will not go into it per se, but into investing generally. But they are keen to know about impact investing, because over the next 10 years, impact will be integrated into the investment process. Learning about that upfront is important.
Some students will go into development – government or non-profit – where measuring impact and making every dollar spent more effective is important."

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) cleared its CEO on Tuesday of snooping on a star wealth manager in an episode that saw suicide, scandal and espionage invade the secretive world of Swiss private banking.
The spying on ex-wealth management chief Iqbal Khan after he left the bank for arch-rival UBS (S:UBSG), and the suicide of a private investigator involved in organizing the surveillance, has badly tarnished the reputation of the Swiss bank and its top managers. 
""I've not come across anyone who is not shocked by what is happening,"" a person familiar with Credit Suisse's management said. ""The shock is big. What you've seen in the media over the last 10 days has had a massive impact on the staff here.""
Khan, who left Switzerland's second-biggest bank in July and began work on Tuesday at UBS, was under surveillance by private detectives hired by Credit Suisse from Sept. 4 to Sept. 17, when he spotted them.
News of a rift between Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam and Khan prior to the latter's departure has prompted speculation over reasons for the surveillance, which has roiled Switzerland's financial center, triggered a criminal investigation and hurt the image of everyone involved.
A private investigator who organized the surveillance of a senior former Credit Suisse manager committed suicide last week,
a lawyer for the security firm at the center of the spying case said.
The bank's chairman, Urs Rohner, said on Tuesday that a personal dispute between Khan and Thiam, which had made it impossible for the two to work together, had prompted Khan's departure but had been unrelated to the hiring of detectives.
The bank's internal probe carried out by law firm Homburger found Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee alone initiated observation of the former wealth management executive to see if he was trying to poach former colleagues to join him at UBS.
The investigation found no evidence that Khan had attempted to poach employees or clients from Credit Suisse.
Bouee - whose professional life has closely tracked Thiam's, having worked together at McKinsey,  Aviva  (L:AV) and  Prudential  (L:PRU) before moving in 2015 to Credit Suisse - stepped down from his role to take responsibility for the matter, the bank said on Tuesday.
Bouee and Thiam had been close associates since the McKinsey days, with Bouee described as more abrasive than Thiam by one source who previously worked with them both in Britain.
""He was bad cop to Tidjane's good cop,"" the person said, adding that the two usually spoke together in French.
A second banker who worked with both added that, while Thiam and Bouee had a good working relationship, Thiam did not maintain an inner circle of closer contacts amongst his team.
Rohner told a news conference on Tuesday that Thiam still enjoyed the full confidence of the board. ""We have absolutely zero evidence that he was informed about it,"" he said, while apologizing to Khan and his family for the incident.
The board called the spying operation ""wrong and disproportionate"" in a statement, adding it had caused severe reputational damage for the bank.
The criminal investigation of the spying operation continues.
Rohner and John Tiner, head of the board's audit committee, batted back questions about the credibility of the probe's findings, saying the incident was unusual and insisting Thiam was on top of what was happening at the group.
Only two employees - Bouee and the security boss under him, who also resigned - knew of the surveillance, the probe found.
However, deleted messages sent on secure platform Threema used by Bouee and security personnel had limited the scope of the findings, Homburger managing partner Flavio Romerio said. 
Messages between Bouee and Thiam from Aug. 22 onward, which were sent via company email and messaging platform WhatsApp, had been reviewed and found not to be relevant, he added. 
Thiam did not attend the news conference.
Two big investors said last week that they wanted Thiam, architect of a sweeping three-year revamp at the bank, to stay unless it was shown he broke the law, but shareholders largely remained silent on Tuesday as Credit Suisse's shares reversed early gains to close down 2.9%. 
BAD BLOOD?
Khan was known as a smooth and ambitious manager putting life into Thiam's strategy of reshaping the bank into a wealth management juggernaut to rival bigger peer UBS.
Under his watch, the International Wealth Management business he led more than doubled profits and sharply boosted the client assets it handles. 
The abrupt departure of Pakistan-born Khan, who moved to Switzerland when he was 12, exposed his falling out with Thiam, the 57-year-old Franco-Ivorian executive who revamped a stagnant Credit Suisse by cutting thousands of jobs, scaling back investment banking and bolstering its balance sheet.
Rohner said a heated exchange that took place between the two in January prompted the chairman to get involved.
""The decisive question for me was whether the differences between the two gentlemen... would impact their cooperation going forward,"" Rohner said, adding their performance was unaffected at first. ""But it became apparent that a long-term, trusting and mutual cooperation was no longer possible and that Mr. Khan wanted to leave the bank.""
Khan's switch to co-head of wealth management at market leader UBS sealed the divorce.
Khan, 43, went to the police after the Sept. 17 confrontation with at least one detective who was shadowing him and his wife as they drove through Zurich. Conflicting versions have emerged of how the incident unfolded.

A spokesman declined comment on behalf of Khan, stating that ""Mr. Khan being now with UBS will not comment on today's announcement of Credit Suisse"". UBS also declined to comment.

ZURICH/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The announcement by Julius Baer this week that it had hired five senior bankers from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) underscores the challenge facing Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam as he seeks to reassure staff and investors in the wake of a spying scandal.
Preventing staff defections was at the heart of a decision by Credit Suisse to put former international wealth-management head Iqbal Khan under surveillance. But that move -- which spilled into the open when Khan had an altercation on the street with the men who were trailing him -- has by the bank's own admission caused severe reputational damage.
The team joining Julius Baer had left Credit Suisse before the espionage scandal broke but the debacle and the bank's efforts to draw a line under it have enthused rivals to accelerate their poaching efforts, headhunters say.
Wealth managers are the lifeblood of private banking, one of the fastest growing businesses in the global financial sector, holding the keys to close client relationships worth millions or billions in assets.
""A lot of people are uncertain about...the (bank's) ability to attract new bankers,"" said Rahul Sen, a London-based global leader for private banking at headhunter Boyden. ""They botched up the entire Iqbal Khan situation.""
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the staff departures and any measures it was deploying to retain top talent.
Credit Suisse's probe into the spying scandal, which exonerated Thiam of any involvement, has failed to quell staff disquiet, particularly when it emerged Thiam and Khan had a personal dispute which prompted the former wealth management chief to leave.
Under Khan's watch, profits at Credit Suisse's wealth management business had more than doubled. He joined arch-rival UBS as co-head of the wealth management business this week.
Credit Suisse's investigation into its surveillance of Khan concluded that Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee had initiated it to see if Khan was trying to poach former colleagues to join him at UBS.
No evidence emerged that he had attempted to take employees or clients from Credit Suisse.
Since his departure, however, others have pounced and while job-hopping is common in the private banking sector, the exit of senior managers adds to the pressure on Thiam, who has to deal with tough market conditions and continue to manage costs after seeing through a three-year restructuring period.
Recent losses include a Dubai-based senior private banker who is expected to take at least three team members to a rival, and a Hong Kong-based China banker who will be taking along a dozen of his colleagues at Credit Suisse to a European peer next month, people with knowledge of the matter said. Another senior banker, who managed about 700 million Swiss francs ($701 million) of client assets in Portugal and Brazil, left last week and will be joining a rival toward the end of this year, one of the people said.

Britain's  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Julius Baer hired a total of 14 bankers from Credit Suisse's International Wealth Management business, they announced last month.

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc is seeking to raise $1.5 billion for its third special situations fund, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
KKR Special Situations Fund III, which was registered with regulators in June, will acquire distressed debt at a discount, said three sources who requested anonymity to discuss the matter.
KKR, which has not announced the fundraising target, declined to comment. It told investors during its second-quarter earnings call in July that it was fundraising for a special situations fund.
New York-based KKR closed its first special situations fund after raising $2 billion from investors in 2014. Its second closed with $3.35 billion in 2016.
Special situations funds invest in the bonds of companies about to go bankrupt, with hopes of earning substantial gains when the firms return to financial health.
KKR's special situations investments include Gibson, a Nashville-based guitar manufacturer, and Telepizza, a pizza delivery company based in Madrid.
U.S. private equity firms are expected to raise about $220 billion this year, according to data provider Pitchbook, as institutional investors continue to seek returns not available in public markets.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) has lost at least one major pension contract while other companies are reviewing their relationship with the wealth manager, which has struggled to stem a client exodus following revelations of serious misconduct.
Two sources told Reuters that grocery wholesaler and distributor Metcash (AX:MTS) had dropped its long-term pension contract with AMP, while other client and market sources said at least four other companies were reviewing their contracts.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Amatil Ltd (CCA) (AX:CCA), an AMP client since 2005, confirmed its mandate was currently out to tender. 
All the sources requested anonymity because the information is not yet public.
Under Australia's compulsory pension system, companies must select a ""default"" pension fund to receive 9.5% of a worker's salary if the worker does not nominate their own fund, representing strong fee income to the selected wealth manager.
In the last 12 months, more than 10 companies have removed AMP as their preferred fund, including apparel retailer Glassons and Australia Post, and switched to rival AustralianSuper, a source with direct knowledge of the mandate changes told Reuters.
The exits follow harsh criticism of AMP at a government-ordered Royal Commission inquiry into misconduct in the financial sector. AMP was singled out in evidence for wrongfully charging fees to clients and attempting to mislead regulators. 
The reputational fallout and an unusually large number of ongoing reviews by long-term clients has weighed on AMP's share price, which has lost two thirds of its value over the past 18 months.
AMP said in an emailed statement on Thursday that the ""significant majority"" of major clients that have formally reviewed their mandates over the past year had stayed with AMP.
AMP ""supported"" more than 53,000 large and small Australian businesses with their employees' superannuation arrangements, the statement said.
AMP last month told the market it had retained more than 20 large corporate mandates, without adding details. 
Grocery retailer Woolworths (AX:WOW), one of AMP's largest corporate clients, had retained its mandate following a recent review, while oil supplier Caltex Australia (AX:CTX) also remained a client, sources said.
CLIENTS DRIVE HARD BARGAIN
Still, the exits are being used by some clients to drive a better bargain, putting further pressure on AMP's already shrinking margins.
""AMP is trying very, very hard to keep our business,"" said one executive whose company is reviewing a pension mandate. ""We will consider what they have gone through and their brand, but if we stay it will be on a substantially better deal.""
AMP's flagship wealth management unit reported A$3.1 billion ($2.1 billion) in net outflows, 13% of which were from its corporate superannuation business, in the six months to June. It forecast further corporate outflows of about A$700 million in the short term.
Morningstar estimated the unit has seen net outflows worth close to 4% of assets under management since the Royal Commission started uncovering poor business practices in mid-2018.
Metcash, which has more than 6,300 employees, has replaced AMP with appointed SunSuper, the two sources with knowledge of the mandate said. Metcash and SunSuper declined to comment. The size of the mandate has not been disclosed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled nearly $14 billion out of mutual fund and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks last week, ending what had been the largest surge into domestic stock funds since December 2016, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute. 
The retreat from U.S. stocks came during a week in which Democratic lawmakers moved to launch formal impeachment proceedings that could end with a vote to remove President Donald Trump from office and the White House released a summary of a telephone call between Trump and Ukraine's president that is at the center of the inquiry. 
Last week's losses sent the year to date outflows from U.S. stock funds to $91.1 billion as investors have shied away from domestic stocks despite a more than 15% rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index. 
Investors continued to seek the perceived safety of bonds by sending slightly more than $6.9 billion into taxable and municipal debt funds. For the year-to-date, the category has garnered more than $319 billion in new inflows. 

World stock funds, meanwhile, posted a three-week losing streak by dropping another $1.8 billion in outflows. That sent the year to date loss for the category to $37.9 billion.

(Reuters) - Short-term home rental company Airbnb Inc is set to hire  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) as joint lead advisers on its planned stock market flotation next year, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 
The appointments would represent another high-profile assignment for the storied investment banks, albeit potentially less lucrative than usual. This is because Airbnb is leaning toward going public through a direct listing, rather than an initial public offering (IPO), sources have said.
In an IPO, shares are sold by the company or its investors in a process managed by the investment banks as underwriters. In a direct listing, however, no new shares are sold, and the role of the investment banks is more of one advising on market conditions, as opposed to underwriting. 
As a result, companies can save on the investment banking fees they pay through a direct listing.
Airbnb is considering going public around the middle of 2020, one of the sources said, a timeline that would help it avoid any stock market volatility in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November of next year. 
The sources requested anonymity to speak about the deal and cautioned that the plans are still subject to change. Airbnb, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
Airbnb said last month it planned to become a publicly listed company in 2020, marking it out as one of the biggest names to pursue a stock market float next year.
Airbnb was valued at $31 billion in its most recent private fundraising round, according to data provider PitchBook. The company sold shares in the private market earlier this year at a valuation of roughly $35 billion around the time it purchased HotelTonight, Vox reported. 
Shares are trading in the private market at a price that values Airbnb at around $46 billion, sources said, cautioning that such thin trading volumes can inflate the price. 
By comparison, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Marriott International Inc have market capitalizations of around $26 billion and $40 billion, respectively. 
With a direct listing, Airbnb would follow the route taken by music streaming company Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology SA and workplace messaging firm Slack Technologies Inc in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Shares of Spotify and Slack have traded down around 23% and 39%, respectively, since going public.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co were the three investment banks that advised on both the Spotify and Slack listings. 
Slack expected to pay $22.1 million in fees to its three financial advisers. By comparison, the more than two dozen banks on the 2017 IPO of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), which was worth about $31 billion at the time of its public listing, earned a total of $85 million in commissions.
An Airbnb listing next year would follow a mixed 2019 for tech listings, with the likes of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) struggling since going public. Earlier this week, WeWork's parent, The We Company, also filed to withdraw its IPO after investors raised concerns about its burgeoning losses and the tight grip of its co-founder on its governance.
Airbnb took in more than $1 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2019, the second time it exceeded that level in its decade-plus history, the company said last month. It gave no details on profitability.
Last month, Airbnb said that as of Sept. 15, its hosts had earned more than $80 billion by sharing their homes and spaces on the app, and as of June 1, it had collected over $1.6 billion in transient occupancy taxes.

It also said it passed a milestone of having more than 7 million Airbnb listings in over 100,000 cities around the world.

745,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2019 01:22PM ET</span>",Your Money: U.S. tax reform further complicates federal student aid form,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. tax reform is finally catching up with the college financial aid process, and the synchronization is off to a rocky start.
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the 2010-2021 academic year became available on Oct. 1. This form, the first since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect, requires information from 2018 tax returns.
Tax law changes figure into the calculation of the Expected Family Contribution, which is the all-important bottom line amount colleges want families to pay toward tuition.
Six new schedules are incorporated into the main 1040 tax form, while the 1040EZ and 1040A forms have been eliminated. Tax data can be culled electronically to the FAFSA through the IRS's Data Retrieval Tool if applicants sign up for that process.
However, the system does not pull in the schedules, particularly Schedule 1, which lists items like capital gains, unemployment payments, student loan interest paid or the teachers' deduction for supplies. Instead, there are prompts asking if you filed that form.
The FAFSA system does not alert you if any schedules are skipped, said Charlie Javice, the founder and chief executive of Frank Financial Aid, a free app that helps students file the FAFSA.
""You could be providing half the information, and nobody is telling you if it's accurate or not,"" said Javice. 
The risk is that students could miss out on aid because certain income and deductions are not counted. They could make math mistakes when inputting the data by hand, or their applications could be incomplete, resulting in a laborious verification process.
Families tend to give up when the process gets too cumbersome, Javice said.
""If normally you'd qualify for a variety of financial aid benefits, and this change puts it at risk, you may want to run that by somebody,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, head of tax at Betterment.
HOOPS FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS
The forms 1040EZ and 1040A used to automatically qualify low-income students for an Auto-Zero Expected Contribution or the Simplified Needs Test. The Department of Education said the added Schedule 1 question serves this purpose. 
But in August, 10 senators sent a public letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos seeking clarification (https:// ""We are concerned that mistaken answers to this complicated question could lead to eligible students losing access,"" they wrote.
A spokesman for the Education Department responded to Reuters that the changes to the tax law have not affected the function of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.
What is the best way for families filing the FAFSA form? Either use the IRS tool and try to verify that schools receive the pertinent information, or not use the tool and enter all their information manually, experts advised.
Javice chose the latter. The Frank app scans the tax forms of applicants and extracts tax information.
Skipping the IRS tool is risky because you are more likely to be selected for the verification process, which is lengthy and time-consuming, warned college finance expert Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of savingforcollege.com.
""The data retrieval tool has always had issues,"" Kantrowitz said.
For low-income students, the new tax structure just makes things more complicated. 

""It's a big step backwards in terms of college access,"" Javice said.

746,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>",Tesla automated parking problems seen liability of app 'driver' for now,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc owners summoning their driverless cars in parking lots are likely liable for crashes, lawyers said after a series of internet videos showed problems with cars running new software. 
If the accidents pile up, though, Tesla itself is sure to be brought into a legal fight, insurance industry experts said.
The incidents highlight a shifting landscape for long-held assumptions about auto insurance and accident blame as more car manufacturers offer features that can automate parallel parking, avoid collisions, and take over steering during traffic, among other things.
A Tesla software update last week added a so-called Smart Summon feature for some customers. When the car is within 200 feet and in their line of sight, they can use a phone app to summon the vehicle in a parking lot. Users start the car by holding down a button and stop the car by releasing it, Tesla said in instructions, warning users to be careful.
U.S. regulators are looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla cars driving themselves to their owners, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday.
""This was an interesting one to explain to my insurance,"" wrote one user in YouTube and Twitter video posts of a Tesla scraping against a garage door frame while exiting in summon mode. ""Silly feature cost me time and money.""
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment but Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday tweeted that there were more than 550,000 Smart Summon uses in the first few days.
Insurance claims for such incidents will go through the car owner's traditional auto coverage, said Jennifer Dukarski, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who represents automotive suppliers in disputes about safety and autonomous car technology. 
""But as the number of incidents build, you’ll find someone who will entertain a class action [lawsuit] dealing with a product defect,"" Dukarski said.
Automated features also raise the question of whether the owner or the auto manufacturer is at fault when accidents occur.
""The rationale for the owner being responsible is that the laws have not caught up to autonomous vehicles,"" said Keith McKenna, an insurance lawyer in New York who represents corporate policyholders.
If fully-automated cars someday becomes the norm, liability will shift to manufacturers and their insurance, McKenna said. 
The technology is not sophisticated enough to be deemed ""driverless"" under California's motor vehicle rules, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said, essentially leaving the app user outside of the car responsible for accidents.
Still, limitations to the app and other features make Tesla more responsible when accidents occur, said Mike Morgan, a Florida personal injury lawyer. His firm sued Tesla last year on behalf of a client who blames Tesla for his car crashing into a disabled vehicle.
“You are still responsible for your car and  must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles,"" Tesla said in instructions for the new feature.
But it may be too late to avoid a crash when a user attempts to stop the car, Morgan said.

""These vehicles provide a false sense of human control,"" Morgan said.

The launch of the app, which like Snapchat and Instagram is centered around photos but is more focused on keeping users connected with small groups of friends, knocked 5% off Snap Inc's shares in afternoon trading. 
Through Threads, users can upload status, share location and battery status with their close friends on Instagram, the social media company said in a blog https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/10/privacy-matters-threads post.
Facebook has been focusing on Instagram, its fastest-growing revenue generator, as its core platform has been under scrutiny from regulators regarding privacy and spread of misinformation or fake news. 
Users can also enable ""auto status"" feature, which would automatically update their battery life and status based on current location, the company said, adding that the feature is an opt-in.
Precise location information collected for auto status will be specific to Threads and will not be used for ads, Facebook said.
""The way we use data from other parts of Facebook and Instagram to deliver relevant ads to you remains the same,"" the company said.
Instagram launched ""Close Friends"" feature in November last year, allowing users to share their stories with a smaller group of people. (https://reut.rs/30EVhHv)

The UAW said late Friday it had made ""good progress"" on health care and the status of temporary workers but still has unresolved issues like ""wages, job security, skilled trades and pension.""
Talks will continue over the weekend in an attempt to reach a deal.
The GM strike began Sept. 16 with workers seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker’s profit and protection of healthcare benefits.
Analysts estimate the strike has cost GM over $1 billion, while LMC Automotive estimated on Thursday GM has lost production of 118,000 vehicles through Oct. 2.

Earlier this week, the strike forced GM to halt production at its pickup and transmission plants in Silao, Mexico, resulting in temporary layoffs of 6,000 workers.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>","Sacklers reaped up to $13 billion from OxyContin maker, U.S. states say","By Mike Spector and Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP steered up to $13 billion in profits to the company's controlling Sackler family, according to U.S. states opposing efforts to halt lawsuits alleging the company and its owners helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic.
The wealthy Sacklers received the money from Purdue during an unspecified time frame, according to court documents and portions of a deposition filed in the drugmaker's bankruptcy proceedings this week.
Purdue ultimately transferred $12 billion or $13 billion to the family, a company adviser testified in the deposition. The deposition, taken last week, was revealed in court filings on Thursday and Friday.
The financial figure is significantly larger than the roughly $4 billion previous lawsuits have alleged the Sacklers took out of Purdue, and was cited as part of coordinated legal broadsides this week against the company's attempts to shield itself and the family from sprawling opioid litigation.
Many states want the Sacklers to contribute more than an initial $3 billion they have pledged toward resolving the lawsuits as part of a settlement Purdue has proposed.
Attorneys general from 24 states and the District of Columbia on Friday objected to Purdue's September request that a U.S. bankruptcy judge halt more than 2,600 lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in damages, and they raised financial transfers to the Sacklers in their legal arguments. 
So, too, did lawyers representing 500 cities, counties and Native American tribes, according to an earlier court filing.
""The distribution numbers do not reflect the fact that many billions of dollars from that amount were paid in taxes and reinvested in businesses that will be sold as part of the proposed settlement,"" said Daniel S. Connolly, a lawyer for family members facing lawsuits who are related to the late Raymond Sackler, one of the modern Purdue's co-founders, in a statement.
A spokesman for relatives of another deceased company co-founder, Mortimer Sackler, who also face litigation, had no immediate comment. 
Purdue had no immediate comment on the payments. The company and family have denied allegations they contributed to the U.S. opioid crisis. 
The lawsuits, largely brought by state and local governments, allege Purdue and the Sacklers contributed to a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people since 1999 by aggressively marketing opioids while downplaying their addiction and overdose risks.
""The Sacklers are billionaires, they are not bankrupt,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, among the officials opposing Purdue's efforts to halt lawsuits, told Reuters in an interview. ""They should not be allowed to use the filing to shield their assets.""
Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month after reaching a deal it valued at more than $10 billion that would resolve the bulk of the cases against the company and the Sacklers.
The company contends it needs the litigation against it and the Sacklers paused for about nine months so it can attempt to settle with hold-out plaintiffs and preserve money that would otherwise be spent fighting the cases.
Purdue said the costs of continued litigation were ""staggering,"" putting its legal expenses this year at nearly $250 million.
""Without a stay of the litigation, only lawyers will win,"" the company said in a statement.
Typically, a bankruptcy filing triggers an ""automatic stay"" of all litigation without a specific order from a judge.
However, Purdue is seeking an injunction to stop the lawsuits because the Sacklers did not seek bankruptcy protection and there is an exception to the automatic stay for government actions that seek to enforce laws related to public health and safety.
Healey said the exception gives the states a strong argument to move forward with their cases against the OxyContin maker. ""We're exercising our police power and have the right to do so,"" she said.
The Sacklers have offered to cede control of Purdue to the plaintiffs and contribute $3 billion, and potentially more through the sale of another pharmaceutical business they own, toward the proposed settlement. Purdue is also in discussions to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe that could carry a financial penalty. 

Healey said the Sacklers should increase their contribution and she criticized the structure of the deal, which is premised in part on the continued sale of OxyContin, a drug that critics say helped launch the nation's opioid addiction crisis.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",PG&E says it has $34.45 billion in debt financing for reorganization,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - PG&E Corp said in court papers on Friday it has debt financing commitments of $34.35 billion for a planned Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, countering a group of noteholders that has proposed its own reorganization plan for the California power producer.
PG&E in a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco said the commitments are from leading money center banks and have terms superior to those in the plan the noteholders want to file.
The commitments will ""fully fund"" a reorganization plan so PG&E can have one confirmed by June 30, 2020, the company said.
PG&E has also obtained more than $14 billion in equity commitments from other investors and has struck an $11 billion settlement with an insurers group and a $1 billion settlement with a group of local governments and public entities hit hard by the wildfires that pushed the company to file for bankruptcy.
San Francisco-based PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January in the aftermath of blazes in 2017 and 2018 blamed on its equipment.
At the time, PG&E anticipated wildfire-related liabilities of more than $30 billion.
A group of PG&E noteholders, including Apollo Capital Management and Elliott Management Corp among others, last week unveiled a revised version of their proposed reorganization plan. It would put $29.2 billion in new money into PG&E, up from a prior $28.4 billion offer, in exchange for new debt and a controlling equity stake.
The committee representing individual wildfire victims in PG&E's bankruptcy supports the noteholders' plan as it would create a $14.5 billion trust to pay their claims.
PG&E has proposed funding a trust to compensate the victims capped at $8.4 billion.
Lawyers for the wildfire victims committee and the noteholders group will ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali at a hearing on Monday for an order that would allow the noteholders group to file its reorganization plan.
PG&E in its filing on Friday objected to that request, arguing it should remain the only party in its bankruptcy with the right to file a reorganization plan, adding its plan will pay the company's debtholders in full.
The power provider also proposed a mediator be appointed to help it and its stakeholders try to craft a plan they can all support.
If PG&E resolves its bankruptcy by the end of next June, it can participate in a recently enacted, $21 billion state fund to help California's investor-owned utilities pay for future wildfires liabilities.
PG&E has said that taking part in the fund, which the utilities would help support with contributions, will enhance its finances over the long term.

Lenders putting up debt financing for PG&E's planned reorganization are JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Bank NA, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) NA, BofA Securities Inc,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank PLC,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Inc, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, according to a commitment letter attached to Friday's filing.

751,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Regulators weigh 'startle factors' for Boeing 737 MAX pilot training - Transport Canada executive,"By Allison Lampert and Tracy Rucinski 
MONTREAL/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global regulators are looking at ""startle factors"" that can overwhelm pilots as they consider revised protocols for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, Nicholas Robinson, the head of civil aviation for Transport Canada, told Reuters on Friday.
Boeing Co's fastest-selling jetliner, the 737 MAX, was grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes that killed a total of 346 people within five months.
Pilot overload appears to have played a role in both crashes, in which crews struggled to regain control of the airplane while a new flight control system repeatedly pushed the nose down amid a series of other audio and sensory alarms and alerts. 
""What we need to do is ensure that the aircrew in the MAX are able to handle that environment,"" Robinson said in an interview with Reuters. 
Transport Canada is among a core group of regulators that is evaluating the requirements for the 737 MAX to fly again after a seven-month grounding.
It has been convening weekly by phone, video conferences or face-to-face with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and its counterparts in the European Union and Brazil, Robinson said.
Their decisions could lead to sweeping changes to pilot flight operating manuals and classroom instruction and even mandates for costly simulator training, industry sources have said.
However, no training decisions can be made until Boeing submits software updates to the FAA for review and approval, Robinson said. 
Transport Canada is closely aligned with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency on return to service demands and has also raised questions over the architecture behind the 737 MAX's angle of attack system.
""We continue to look for a solution proposed by the manufacturer and the FAA on that area,"" he said.
Still, Canada's goal is for the MAX to return in countries across the globe simultaneously, or at least in close succession.
""It's not a necessity, but it's a goal,"" Robinson said. 
PILOT WORKLOAD
A startle or surprise in the cockpit can endanger a pilot's ability to maintain control of the aircraft and was said to play a role in earlier air crashes like Air France flight 447 in 2009.
The same year, Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger safely landed a US Airways flight on the Hudson River in New York after a bird strike disabled the engines. He told lawmakers in June that the 737 MAX crew could have been confused as they struggled to maintain control of the aircraft.
""I can tell you firsthand that the startle factor is real and it's huge. It absolutely interferes with one's ability to quickly analyze the crisis and take corrective action,"" Sullenberger said.
Under new simulator scenarios, 737 MAX pilots worldwide may be trained on runaway stabilizer, a loss of control that was triggered in both 737 MAX crashes, coupled with some kind of unexpected malfunction.
""The only way to effectively deal with the physical and mental reactions of 'startle effect' is to have previously been exposed to it,"" said Captain Larry Rooney, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations.
The goal of introducing startles is to teach pilots how to respond to ""fight, flight or freeze"" instincts in an environment where the effects are not life threatening, said Rooney. The only way to train for startle is in a simulator or in real life.
Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg on Wednesday acknowledged that Boeing's flight control software, activated off faulty data from a key airflow sensor, contributed to a broader chain of events that created more workload for the pilots in 737 MAX crashes.

The planemaker, which is targeting a 737 MAX return to service in the fourth quarter, has started showing pilots and regulators its proposed software update and training program at information sessions in Miami, London, Istanbul, Shanghai and Singapore scheduled to run through mid-October.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that his administration has a ""very good chance"" of making a trade deal with China, and insisted there were no links between China talks and his desire for Beijing to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
Trump, speaking to reporters before departing the White House, said negotiations to end the U.S. trade war with China were separate from any investigation into Biden, whom Trump has accused of foreign corruption. 
""One thing has nothing to do with the other,"" the Republican president said when asked whether he would be more likely to make a deal with China if it investigated Biden. ""I want to do a trade deal with China, but only if it's good for our country.""
Top-level U.S.-China trade talks are scheduled to resume next Thursday and Friday, when Chinese Vice Premier Liu He meets with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington
The talks will be preceded on Monday and Tuesday by deputy-level discussions, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said earlier.
Trump has waged a two-year effort to change China's trade, intellectual property and industrial policy practices, which he has long said are unfair and have cost millions of U.S. jobs.
His administration is seeking stronger protections of U.S. intellectual property, an end to forced transfers of American technology to Chinese firms, curbs to industrial subsidies and increased access to China's largely closed domestic markets.
In a trade war that has lasted 15 months, the United States and China have heaped hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs 
""I view China as somebody we're trying to make a deal with, we have a very good chance of making a deal with,"" Trump said. Right now, we're in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal. If we make it, it will be the biggest trade deal ever made."" 
On Thursday Trump publicly urged Beijing to investigate Biden, a Democrat, again raising concerns that he has invited foreign interference in the U.S. presidential election. Last week Trump released a transcript of a call where he asked Ukraine's president to also look into Biden, a request that has triggered an impeachment inquiry by House of Representatives Democrats.
FINANCIAL SERVICES HOPES 
Kudlow, in television interviews, held out hope for progress in opening China's financial services markets to American companies in next week's talks, adding the U.S. team was heading into them ""open-minded.""
""Everything's on the table, we'd love to go back to where we were in May when we were a lot closer,"" Kudlow told Bloomberg TV.
The Trump trade team hoped to revisit a mostly agreed text from which China had backtracked in May, causing talks to break down, he said. 
The text at that time included an agreement negotiated by Mnuchin that involved the lifting of foreign ownership caps on financial services firms in China.
""I'm not giving you news. I'm just saying we had some pretty good things last spring, like financial services opening - that could be extended,"" Kudlow said in a subsequent interview on Fox Business Network. ""I say 'could' and the president would have to sign off on it, but don't rule out the possibility of good news.""
Kudlow declined to make any predictions about the talks but said there had been a ""softening of the psychology on both sides"" over the past month, with the United States delaying some tariff increases and China making some modest purchases of American farm products.
Kudlow also said the impeachment inquiry was unlikely to affect the trade talks with China. 
""I don't think that's an impact right now. I think maybe it has only the tiniest, tiniest effect, maybe occasionally on stock market psychology,"" Kudlow said. 

However, he said the Trump administration continued to monitor freedom and democracy protests, which he said could have an impact on the talks, without specifying how. China-backed Hong Kong authorities have struggled to curb anti-government protests that have continued for four months.

753,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",Capital spending outlook another worry ahead of earnings,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are preparing for more cautious capital investment outlooks from U.S. companies as worries mount heading into earnings season about the possibility of an economic recession.
Capital expenditure increases have been weaker than last year, when corporate tax cuts helped to bolster spending, and some strategists say they may even fall short of Wall Street's expectations given the concerns about the economy and a prolonged trade war between the United States and China.
Less spending on technology, machinery and other equipment would suggest corporate executives are less confident in the economy than they had been, another potential negative for the stock market, which has fallen this week amid a series of weak economic reports.
Capital expenditures are expected to have increased just 3.0% in the third quarter from a year ago, which would be the lowest since the second quarter of 2017, when capex declined slightly, according to data based on analysts' estimates compiled by Refinitiv's research senior manager, David Aurelio.
That estimate drops to 1.1% in the fourth quarter, and year-over-year declines are projected in some quarters of 2020.
""It's very likely that capex spending is going to be below expectations,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. ""We are in a state of heightened economic policy uncertainty. That tamps down business investment.""
Strategists said spending plans will be of particular interest as S&P 500 (SPX) companies discuss their results for the third quarter in the weeks ahead.
The reporting period begins with big banks including JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and others reporting on Oct. 15.
Results overall are expected to be relatively weak, with analysts forecasting earnings for S&P 500 companies to have declined 2.7% in the third quarter from a year ago, based on Refinitiv's data.
Recent dismal economic indicators have fueled concerns that the United States was flirting with a recession.
Upbeat jobs data offered some relief for investors on Friday, but it came on the heels of a report this week showing manufacturing activity plunged to a more than 10-year trough in September. Other data showed U.S. services sector activity slowed to a three-year low in September.
""There is a correlation between CEO confidence and capex. And right now we've seen CEO confidence decrease, so again it's going to be a challenging environment for companies to go ahead and spend,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
While the trade war has eroded business confidence, easing monetary policy is expected to help because it reduces borrowing costs for businesses.
The U.S. central bank cut rates last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008. Bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month by 25 basis points were at about 77% on Friday, compared to 39.6% on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""This talk of whether or not we're going into a recession, that enforces prudence"" by companies, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU), based in Newark, New Jersey. ""Ultimately what they're worried about is revenue growth.""

754,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",EU report to lay out options for development financing overhaul: sources,"By Marc Jones and Jan Strupczewski
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A European Union review of how to deploy the bloc's international lending firepower will be delivered to finance ministers next week, sources have told Reuters, with three options for a major overhaul of its current set-up.
The report by a ""wise persons"" group led by former senior EU official Thomas Wieser proposes ways to build a more effective EU development bank that also cuts the current overlap between the European Investment Bank in Luxembourg and London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Options put forward include making the EBRD the EU’s external development bank focused primarily on Africa, and the EIB its internal lender, according to three sources with knowledge of the report who spoke on condition of anonymity.
A second possibility would be to use the EIB, or a subsidiary of the EIB, while third option is for new entity that would be something of a joint venture between both the banks as well as national development banks.
""The message in the report is about sub-Saharan Africa and the climate,"" one of the sources said. ""It is also the European response to what is happening in the global development space where countries like China are becoming much more aggressive.""
A spokesman for the EIB said it was ""looking forward to the final report and discussing its implications with European finance minister's next week."" 
An EBRD spokesman declined to comment. 
The sources said that all three options laid out in the report had benefits but also challenges.
Including Britain, the EBRD is currently 62% owned by EU countries, but other G7 countries have large stakes. The United States is its largest shareholder but it would lose that position if EU governments pump in more money and increase their own stakes. 
A U.S. Treasury spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A new standalone bank would be complex, while utilizing a new EIB overshoot, as has been floated by the bank itself over the last couple of years, would raise questions about the EBRD's future purpose especially if EU grants were funneled away from it into the EIB.
All the options would also require changes to the EBRD and EIB's current charters.
EU capitals are expected to get the final version of the report in the coming days and finance ministers will be presented with it at their regular Ecofin meeting in Luxembourg next week.
Discussions around the options as well as the technicalities and legalities would then have to be hammered out before formal changes can be agreed either later this year or next year.
""From a development perspective, I think the first option would be the more attractive option. But it's a more difficult option politically,"" one of the sources said, referring to the EBRD's non-EU shareholdings.

A rally in technology stocks led by Apple Inc (O:AAPL) also helped lift the benchmark indexes at the end of a rollercoaster week. After losing about 3% over Tuesday and Wednesday, the S&P 500 (SPX) on Friday logged its biggest one-day gain since Aug. 16, thanks in part to a late-session surge.
Still, for a third consecutive week the Dow and S&P 500 lost ground.
The Labor Department's report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a 50-year low, but manufacturing payrolls declined for the first time in six months.
""It's sort of a Goldilocks report: it's not strong enough to move the Federal Reserve away from cutting rates at the end of October, but it's not weak enough to make you concerned about the labor market or the consumer,"" said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management in New York.
Bets that the Fed will cut interest rates have surged this week after a dramatic contraction in U.S. manufacturing, cooling private sector hiring, and a fall in service sector activity pointed to widening fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.
Traders see a 77.5% chance that the central bank will lower borrowing costs at its policy meeting later this month, up from 40% on Monday. The Fed cut rates in September for the second time this year and said future reductions would be ""data-dependent.""
With fears related to the trade war and its effect on the U.S. economy weighing on sentiment, the S&P 500 is up 2% over the past 12 months, and about 2% off its record high close in July.
""Although market participants have been selling stocks and buying bonds, at the end of the day you say, 'Gee, I still have to have some return for my investment, and that's going to come from stocks,'"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments. 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares rose 2.8% after a report that the company would ramp up production of iPhone 11 models.
The S&P information technology index (SPLRCT) climbed 1.7%, while the Philadelphia chip index (SOX) advanced 1.9%.
All 11 major sector indexes rose, led by a 1.9% jump in the S&P financials (SPSY).
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) jumped 1.42% to close at 26,573.72 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) also surged 1.42%, finishing at 2,952.01.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 1.4% to end at 7,982.47.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was light at 5.9 billion shares, compared with the 7.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
For the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.3%, the Dow lost 0.9% and the Nasdaq added 0.5%. 
During Friday's session, HP Inc (N:HPQ) tumbled 9.6% after the computer maker said it would cut up to 16% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan that would result in an overall charge of $1 billion.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.26-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 70 new lows.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 05:56PM ET</span>",Meat industry sues California for animal protection 'overreach',"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - California was sued on Friday by the largest U.S. trade group for meat packers and processors, which wants to block enforcement of a voter-approved measure requiring farmers to provide more space for animals being raised for food.
The North American Meat Institute, whose members include processors such as  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), said enforcing Proposition 12 would hurt producers and consumers by significantly increasing their costs.
It also said the measure, which passed last November with 63% of the vote, was an ""overreach"" that violated the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause by requiring out-of-state producers to comply with California's rules or face a sales ban.
""Prop 12 hurts the family on a budget with higher prices for pork, veal and eggs, and unfairly punishes livestock producers outside of California by forcing them to spend millions more just to access California markets,"" Meat Institute President Julie Anna Potts said in a statement.
Spokesmen for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and the state's Department of Food and Agriculture did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the state's Department of Public Health declined to comment.
In its complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court, the Meat Institute is seeking an injunction against the sales ban targeting out-of-state veal and pork.
The group's more than 700 members also include packers and processors such as Cargill, JBS USA, Smithfield Foods and Wegmans, as well as Chipotle,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com's Whole Foods.
Proposition 12, or the Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals Act, sets minimum space requirements for calves raised for veal, breeding pigs and egg-laying hens, and bans the sale of raw veal, pork or eggs from animals enclosed in too little space.
Calves must have 43 square feet (4 square meters) of floor space by 2020, pigs must have 24 square feet by 2022, and hens must have one square foot by 2020 and be ""cage-free"" by 2022.
Proponents said the measure would phase out extreme means of confining animals.
Animal rights groups were split. The Humane Society of the United States backed the measure, while People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals opposed it, saying it did not go far enough.

The case is North American Meat Institute v. Becerra et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 19-08569.

Anastasia Amoroso, a global investment strategist at JPMorgan in New York, said probable Federal Reserve rate cuts in October and December will buoy stocks. The Trump administration, under pressure to lift the slowing U.S. economy, may strike a more conciliatory tone with China in next week’s trade talks, she said during a panel discussion on Bloomberg TV.
BlackRock’s Rick Rieder, speaking on the same panel, said he agreed that equities will probably grind higher.
“You have most investors who’ve been through 2008 and they see crises and they always err on the side of the next one is coming,”said Rieder, the firm’s New York-based chief investment officer for fixed income. “I actually don’t think that’s right.”
Amoroso and Rieder are endorsing stocks even as other investors and strategists sound the alarm on risk assets, citing a global economic slowdown, intensifying U.S.-China trade war and geopolitical risks from North Korea to Turkey and Argentina. Still, they’re both encouraging a selective approach. Neither identified specific markets.
For Amoroso, the priority is quality, yield and secular growth in technology and health care assets. There’s also value in some short duration high-yield debt, she said. Rieder, meantime, said the front-end of the U.S. Treasury yield curve offers “great risk-reward,” although he’s more cautious on the riskiest bonds.
“You have to be really careful in the high-yield market,” he said."

Following are some of the top charts that appeared on the Bloomberg terminal and Bloomberg.com this week. The scope of this weekly series, grouped by region, is a graphical depiction of an evolving world economy. Chart selection is based on financial market and national economy relevance, shifts in demographics and geopolitical events.
America’s once-red hot labor market is gradually losing steam, although the unemployment rate at a fresh five-decade low indicates lingering tightness.
A weak reading of activity in the U.S. services industry and a similar downbeat report for manufacturing, along with purchasing managers’ disappointing assessments of employment, significantly boosted the odds traders are placing on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut later this month.
Europe
Germany’s economic woes are becoming more pronounced, with a sharp slowdown in services suggesting the pain from its industrial crisis is spreading.
The Trump administration’s plan to impose tariffs on EU airplane exports -- after a record WTO award -- is a serious blow to Europe’s aircraft industry and also hits export orders for U.S. manufacturers.
At a time of diminished monetary policy ammunition, incoming ECB President Christine Lagarde says Germany isn’t the only country with room for fiscal stimulus.
Pakistan needs to repay China more than double the amount it owes the International Monetary Fund in the next three years, as loans racked up to boost foreign exchange reserves and bridge a financing gap become due.

760,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 03:58PM ET</span>",Stocks – Market Sees Biggest Rally Since Early September,"Investing.com – Stocks enjoyed their best day since early September Friday as Wall Street was cheered by a solid jobs report that saw the unemployment rate hit a milestone low.
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials jumped 1.42% each. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indices added 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively.
The S&P 500's point gain was its best since Aug. 13. The gains for the Dow – about 372 points – and Nasdaq were their best since Sept. 5. The rally cut the Dow's and S&P 500's losses for the week to 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively. The Nasdaq finished up 0.5% for the week.
The market managed to weather selloffs on Tuesday and Wednesday that saw the Dow fall more than 838 points. From a low on Thursday as the market reacted to a weaker-than-expected report on the services report, the Dow gained more than 847 points at its Friday peak.
The rally was largely computer-driven: The uniformity of the gains and the speed with which they occurred was a clear signal of across-the-board blanket buying.
The rally was set off by the jobs report that showed payrolls increasing by 136,000 last month and the unemployment rate falling to 3.5%, the lowest in at least 50 years. Bullish as the report sounds, the employment gain was smaller than expected and wage growth fell back slightly.
Still, the jobs report was a big relief after early reports this past week suggested a stagnating economy getting close to a recession.
The Dow was led by a 2.8% gain for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and a 2.73% gain for pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK). Chemical maker Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) was the one decliner for most of the day but finally finished up slightly.
Among the Nasdaq 100 stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), along with Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), contributed more than 47 points to the index's 116-point gain.
Interest rates fell even as stocks climbed, in part because Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he is looking for ways to boost inflation. The 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 1.531% from Thursday's 1.536%.
Crude oil moved higher. West Texas Intermediate was up 36 cents to $52.81. Brent futures, the global benchmark, rose 66 cents to $58.37. They were off 5.5% and 4.4% respectively for the week.
Gold futures were down slightly at $1,512.90, but up 0.4% on the week.
Chip maker Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), insurance giant Chubb (NYSE:CB), biotech company Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) and ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) were among the top S&P 500 performers. 
Computer maker HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), oil-and-gas producer Apache (NYSE:APA), seed-producer   Corteva   Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) and beauty products retailer Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ:ULTA) were among the worst S&P 500 performers. "
761,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 03:56PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hackers apparently linked to Iran tried to intrude in Trump 2020 campaign: sources,"By Christopher Bing and Raphael Satter
(Reuters) - A hacking group that appears to be linked to the Iranian government attempted to break into U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign but were unsuccessful, sources familiar with the operation told Reuters on Friday.
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) said earlier on Friday that it saw ""significant"" cyber activity by the group which also targeted current and former U.S. government officials, journalists covering global politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran, the company said in a blog post Republican Trump's official campaign website is the only one of the remaining major contenders' sites that is linked to Microsoft's cloud email service, according to an inspection of publicly available mail exchanger records.
The Trump campaign's Director of Communications Tim Murtaugh said, ""We have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.""
In a 30-day period between August and September, the group, dubbed ""Phosphorous"" by the company, made more than 2,700 attempts to identify consumer email accounts belonging to specific customers and then attacked 241 of those accounts.
""Four accounts were compromised as a result of these attempts; these four accounts were not associated with the U.S. presidential campaign or current and former U.S. government officials,"" the blog post said. ""Microsoft has notified the customers related to these investigations and threats and has worked as requested with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them.""
Microsoft's blog post did not identify the election campaign whose network was targeted by Phosphorous hackers. Nineteen Democrats are seeking their party's nomination to run for president in the November 2020 election. Three Republicans have announced their candidacy to challenge Trump in the party's nominating contest.
Hacking to interfere in elections has become a concern for governments, especially since U.S intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a hacking and propaganda operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump become president. Moscow has denied any meddling.
Tensions between the United States and Iran have risen since May 2018 when Trump withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions. Trump has since reinstated U.S. sanctions, putting increased pressure on the Iranian economy, including its oil trade.
The Iranian government did not issue any immediate comment through state-run media on Microsoft's statement.
Phosphorus is also known as APT 35, Charming Kitten, and Ajax Security Team, according to Microsoft.
The Redmond, Washington-based company said Phosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts.
The attacks were not technically sophisticated, the blog said. Hackers tried to use a significant amount of personal information to attack targets, it said.
""This effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering,"" the blog post said.
Microsoft has been tracking Phosphorus since 2013 and said in March that it had received a court order to take control of 99 websites the group used to execute attacks https://
A computer network used by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-democrats-investigation-idINKCN10B033 was hacked in a cyberattack on Democratic Party political organizations in that U.S. election.
Big tech companies are under pressure to ramp up security for next year's U.S. elections and others around the world.
Companies including  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), Microsoft and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) met with U.S. intelligence agencies earlier in September to discuss security strategies.
Microsoft had said in a blog post in July that about 10,000 customers were targeted or compromised by nation-state attacks in the past year. Most of the activity originated from hackers in three countries: Iran, North Korea and Russia, the company said."

763,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines grapple with 'unfair tax' that adds to aircraft supply disruption,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski 
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are scrambling to digest a new 10% tariff on European-made Airbus (PA:AIR) planes that threaten additional havoc in a market already reeling from frozen deliveries of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX.
In a statement late on Thursday, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) called the proposed levy on aircraft from Europe that are already under contract for purchase ""an unfair tax on U.S. consumers and companies.""
The tariff on Airbus planes creates uncertainty for aircraft delivery terms much like the global grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX in March after two fatal crashes and comes at a time of threats to international air travel demand in the midst of slowing global economic growth and trade disputes. 
No. 2 U.S. carrier Delta is not a 737 MAX customer but with some 266 Airbus orders is the most exposed to aircraft levies due to take effect on Oct. 18 after the World Trade Organization gave Washington the right to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods annually in a long-running case. 
Click here for an interactive graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VkiSfy
Although the overall value of trade hit by sanctions was in line with expectations reported by Reuters, percentage tariffs were less than expected with Airbus planes initially subject to a tenth of the 100% rival Boeing had recommended.
Market sources said this was enough to disrupt trade in the cut-throat plane business but low enough to tempt some airlines to negotiate for Airbus to absorb some of the cost, squeezing its margins.
""10% is a deal breaker for airlines,"" an industry source said, noting that planes liable to the tariff may have to be delayed. Planemakers are typically reluctant to absorb such costs, the source added.
Airbus declined to comment on commercial negotiations.
On a positive note aircraft parts were spared from tariffs, which means independent repair shops, some feeling pain from the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, will continue to function.
That will benefit Boeing and Airbus fleets equally, industry sources said.
AIRLINES REACT
Delta spokeswoman Lisa Hanna called on the Trump administration and EU to resolve the 15-year trade dispute ""in a manner that respects existing contractual rights."" Still, it welcomed Washington's decision to exempt aircraft production and deliveries from Airbus' plant in Mobile, Alabama.
The exemption means that the impact for U.S. airlines with orders for Airbus aircraft assembled in Alabama can be mitigated, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said, pointing to no-frills carrier  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) as one carrier whose order book would mostly come from Alabama.
Shares of U.S. airlines rebounded on Friday after two days of losses.
Airbus' Alabama plant produces four A320-family narrowbody jets a month, and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Jose Caiado estimated that the plant could fulfill at least half of the U.S. backlog over the next year at a rate of five jets per month.
Most of budget-friendly carrier JetBlue Airways' (O:JBLU) orders for narrowbody A321s and A220s would also be among those exempt, but the carrier still warned of a hit to travelers and commercial aviation.
""We are concerned about the detrimental impact aircraft tariffs will have on the ability for low-cost carriers like JetBlue to grow and compete, which will harm customers who rely on us to offer competitive, low fares,"" spokesman Derek Dombrowski said.
JetBlue continues to advocate for a resolution, he said.
Delta and JetBlue, with the second-largest Airbus order among U.S. carriers, had both lobbied for the tariffs to be applied only to new orders.
Delta and United Airlines (O:UAL) have the most orders for A350 and A330neo widebody jets, which Airbus cannot finish in Alabama. Widebody jets, with more premium seats, tend to have higher margins for airlines.
Just last week Delta pledged to buy 14 more A350s as part of a strategy to grow in Latin America through the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM).
 American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) and  Alaska Air  Group (N:ALK) also have Airbus orders, as do lessors like  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL).
Most aircraft leases place the burden of taxes, maintenance and insurance on the operator, Macquarie analyst Sarah Stein said, but noted ""it is unclear as to how far reaching the definition of taxes are in lease agreements in a unique scenario such as this one.""

The head of Ireland's Ryanair (I:RYA) urged the United States and European Union to pull back from a tariff war over aircraft subsidies and said he would ask Boeing to ""eat"" any counter-tariffs imposed on the U.S. company by the EU.

Cedar Fair rejected the offer as it believes it fails to compensate shareholders for giving up on the company’s tax-advantageous publicly traded partnership, Reuters said. 
The partnership allows the company to pay out the bulk of its earnings to shareholders without first paying U.S. federal or state income taxes.
With Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) reportedly not expected to table a new offer, Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN) fell 4% to $58.60, though remained above the price (about $58) seen when the story of the merger offer first broke.
Six Flags' interest in Cedar Fair comes as the company seeks to expand its footprint to bolster ticket pricing. Some on Wall Street had talked up the benefits to Six Flags of a tie-up with Cedar. 
“We think there are numerous ways that an acquisition of FUN would benefit SIX,” Janney said in a note to clients. “While it is difficult to put exact numbers around a deal, we see benefits in three main buckets (1) general and administrative savings, (2) revenue synergies, and (3) other cost savings.”"

The European Commission said the deal would remove world No. 3 player Embraer from the commercial aircraft industry while potential rivals from China, Japan and Russia would be unable to fill the gap in the next decade because of the high barriers to entry.
The EU competition enforcer said both companies engage in head-to-head competition in terms of price and other parameters worldwide and in Europe. The deal would also remove Embraer from the overall single aisle plane market.

The third vote will come from Commissioner Brendan Carr and could see the FCC approve the deal in ""coming days."" The three votes came from Republican members of the commission.

Sprint and T-Mobile have agreed not to close the deal until after a December trial in a suit brought by multiple states charging the merger will reduce competition and raise consumer prices.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 12:51PM ET</span>",Technical buying could spur significant rally for U.S. stocks: JPM,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - There is more behind the recent slide in U.S. stocks than weak data, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase's head of quantitative and derivatives research, who says options hedging and technical selling contributed to the gyrations and could help the market reverse course and rally.
Even Friday's modest positive move could spur technical buying and spell good news for equity bulls, Marko Kolanovic wrote in a note published as the market rallied on encouraging U.S. employment data.
The benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) shed 3% over the first two days of October, logging its worst two-day performance since early August, after employment and manufacturing data revived worries that the U.S.-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the U.S. economy.
Dismal manufacturing data on Monday dragged the S&P down past several technical levels, prompting dealers who had earlier sold options to add to the selling pressure as they hedged their positions, Kolanovic said.
When investors buy S&P 500 put options, they are buying insurance against a drop in the market. Dealers who sell this insurance are on the hook if the index drops sharply.
To counter this exposure, they sell increasing amounts of S&P 500 futures as the index falls, thereby adding to selling pressure.
In addition to this options-related selling, the recent sharp drop in the S&P also prompted selling by commodity trading advisors (CTA) - firms that follow trends and are specialists in the futures markets.
""Technical flows likely drove more than about $100 billion of equities selling in a 48-hour period,"" wrote Kolanovic.
However, that may be set to change.
The S&P gained 26.35 points, or 0.90%, at midday after September U.S. employment data offered some relief from the week's spate of dismal economic indicators.
If stocks end the day more than half a percent higher, the near-term outlook would brighten significantly, Kolanovic said.
""It could spark a significant rally driven by the trend followers (CTAs) and the same put options that helped push the market lower earlier in the week,"" he said."

772,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 11:36AM ET</span>",Former top Barclays bankers face fraud trial over 2008 Qatar rescue,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Three former  Barclays  (L:BARC) executives face a London jury in a high-profile criminal trial over how the British bank secured billions of pounds from Qatari investors and averted a taxpayer-funded bailout during the global financial crises in 2008.
Roger Jenkins, a former chairman of investment banking in the Middle East; Tom Kalaris, who headed the wealth division at the time; and Richard Boath, who led the European corporate finance business, are charged with fraud offences in a trial scheduled to begin next week and last up to five months.
The men deny wrongdoing.
The case is a rare example of a criminal prosecution of senior bankers at a global bank over conduct during the credit crunch more than a decade ago - and a high stakes trial for the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which is prosecuting the case.
The taxpayer-funded SFO defied its critics, who have accused it of failing to pursue top executives and companies, by criminally charging Barclays Plc and four senior bankers in 2017, one month after the ruling Conservative Party pledged to roll the agency into a broader crime-fighting force.
But the ambitious, seven-year case, for which the investigator and prosecutor have received millions of pounds in extra government funding, has proved tricky.
Former Barclays chief executive John Varley, once the highest-ranking defendant in the case, was acquitted in June after judges ruled there was insufficient evidence against him. The SFO's criminal proceedings against the bank were also dismissed by a court last year.
Varley and Barclays had each denied wrongdoing.
The case revolves around undisclosed payments to Qatar as Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds ($13.5 billion) from investors in two cash injections in June and October 2008, allowing the bank to become one of the few major British banks to survive the credit crisis without direct government aid.
It hinges on what the bank told the market in public documents, such as the prospectuses and subscription agreements that outlined the fees and commissions that Barclays paid to investors, including former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani.
Jenkins, 64, Kalaris, 63, and 60-year-old Boath are each charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation.
The three men each face both charges over the June capital raising, which include an allegation they conspired with former finance director Chris Lucas to make dishonest representations in public documents for profit or to expose others to loss.
Jenkins also faces both charges over the second fundraising four months later.
Lucas has not been charged and Qatar, a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing.
The trial, which will be heard at London's Old Bailey central criminal court, kicks off on Oct. 7 with jury selection."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal by Dominion Energy Inc (N:D) and President Donald Trump's administration of a lower court ruling that halted construction on a natural gas pipeline due to run underneath a section of the popular Appalachian Trail in rural Virginia.
The administration and companies involved in the project have asked the justices to overturn a ruling that found that the U.S. Forest Service lacked the authority to grant a right of way for the pipeline. Environmental groups had sued to stop the pipeline after the Forest Service gave the green light for the project through protected National Park Service land.
The December 2018 ruling by the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put a stop to construction of the 600-mile (965-km) Atlantic Coast Pipeline, intended to run from West Virginia to North Carolina.
At issue is the Forest Service's decision to allow the pipeline to cross underneath the 2,200-mile (3,500 km) long Appalachian Trail - a popular hiking route in the eastern United States stretching from Georgia to Maine - in the George Washington National Forest.
A ruling is due by the end of the court's new term, which starts on Monday and ends in June. The Supreme Court's eventual ruling may also affect the proposed 300-mile (480-km) Mountain Valley Pipeline, which is intended to run from West Virginia to southern Virginia and crosses the trail in the Jefferson National Forest.
After a lengthy application process involving multiple federal agencies, the Forest Service granted the consortium a right of way under the trail in January 2018, prompting environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the Cowpasture River Preservation Association to file a lawsuit. 
The 4th Circuit ruled that the Forest Service did not have the power to grant a right of way under a federal law called the Mineral Leasing Act. The court cited a section of the law that says federal agencies can grant rights of way for pipelines on ""federal lands"" but specifically excludes land that is part of the federal National Park system like the Appalachian Trail.
The Trump administration disputed that interpretation, with Solicitor General Noel Francisco saying in court filings that the National Park Service has only limited authority to maintain the trail and that the Forest Service has the authority to approve rights of way across it.
Lawyers for the pipeline consortium noted that more than 50 pipelines already cross under the trail. The 4th Circuit's ruling has the effect of ""rendering the footpath a 2,200-mile barrier separating resource-rich areas to its west from consumers to its east,"" the consortium said in court filings.

The environmental groups have said the project could go ahead under a different route that does not cross the trail on federal land. State and private landowners have the authority to grant rights of way under the trail, the groups added.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 09:56AM ET</span>",More pain for Europe Inc as earnings drought seen spilling over into 2020,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Joice Alves
LONDON (Reuters) - With markets taking fright again this week over trade tariffs and a faltering global economy, investors are braced for weak third quarter results in Europe and high expectations going forward could come crashing down to earth.
There have been a slew of profit warnings in recent weeks which have stirred worries that the earnings slowdown will spill over into next year as companies grapple with weaker economic growth stemming from trade spats and the uncertainty caused by the UK's delayed exit from the European Union.
Markets were rattled this week by U.S. manufacturing and services data that fell below expectations, a move by Washington to hit European products with tariffs and worries over Brexit.
It could be the worst week in a year for the pan European STOXX 600 (STOXX) while the euro-zone benchmark (STOXXE) is heading for its biggest weekly fall in two months.
After falling into a so-called corporate recession in the second quarter after two straight quarters of profit decline, European companies are expected to report in the coming weeks a 2.2% drop in profits in the third quarter, their worst quarter in three years, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.
While 4% earnings growth is seen as achievable for the United States in the fourth-quarter, interviews with investors, analysts and strategists and companies paint a different picture for Europe for the remaining months of 2019 and into next year.
(GRAPHIC - U.S. versus Europe earnings growth: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/14/7815/7815/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Companies are taking measures such as cutting costs to shore up profits, but a harder-to-fix drop in demand for products is expected to be evident in company revenues for the July-September quarter, which are seen falling 0.3%, the first quarterly turnover drop since early 2018.
There is room for much disappointment given that consensus profit estimates for the fourth quarter and 2020 are still high at around 10% growth and analysts say expectations could be brought back down to reality over the coming months.
""The big hurdle for this year would be the fourth quarter, not the third quarter,"" said Fabio Di Giansante, head of large-cap European equities at Europe's top asset manager Amundi with 1.43 trillion euros ($1.6 trillion) in assets under management.
""I would expect more warnings after last week,"" Di Giansante said, following the earnings downgrades by  Pearson  (L:PSON), Imperial Brands (L:IMB), British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) and Carnival Corp (N:CCL) that knocked billions of pounds off their market value.
At best, Di Giansante expects profit growth to flatline in 2020 while UBS has pegged a 4% drop.
(GRAPHIC - Earnings downgrades: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/14/7529/7529/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
ROTATION INTO VALUE
A shift by investors into beaten-down stocks that look value for money in September has caught some investors off-guard, who were heavily invested in momentum stocks - rapidly expanding companies - but ahead of the results season value stocks are likely to be seen as a shelter, giving less of a shock if a company misses estimates.
MSCI global basket of value stocks rose 4%, while the momentum stocks slipped 1% last month. Before the rotation, momentum stocks had surged 20% as of August-end, while value stocks were up just 7%.
Di Giansante is among those that have sought safety in cheaper stocks.
""In a normal world, if you're cheap and you miss, in theory you should have more downside protection, but that hasn't been the case in the last year-and-a-half,"" he added.
For these stocks, ""you need to see an inflection point around the corner, if you keep missing, it is postponed"".
DEJA VU?
The final quarter of 2018 also started with major stock indexes close to current levels and earnings growth expectations for the year ahead around 10%.
(GRAPHIC - 2020 earnings growth: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/14/7528/7528/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Analysts ended up slashing earnings growth estimates for 2019 to low single digits and the toxic mix of an uncertain macro environment and earnings downgrades led to one of the steepest sell offs in stock market history in late 2018.
But this time could be different, some market experts said, as central banks are more dovish now, providing monetary stimulus and interest rate cuts that have supported stock markets.
Equity strategists do not expect 2020 earnings to be as bad as 2019.
""You start with 10% ... the question is not where you start, but where you're going to end up,"" Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivates strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said. He expects earnings to rise 6% next year.
Aside from the battering stocks received last week, the STOXX 600 index remains on track for its best annual performance in six years."

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to give the go-ahead for British power companies to receive a total of roughly one billion pounds to help them bear the cost of maintaining extra generation in case of outages, three sources said on Friday.
The payments were delayed after a Luxembourg-based European court ordered the Commission, the EU executive, to get more details on elements of the British capacity mechanism, which pays utilities to make electricity available at short notice.
Shares in British power company  Drax  (L:DRX), which had won several contracts under the scheme, were up more than 14% by 1312 GMT following the news.
Shares in SSE (L:SSE), which last week said it was unable to recognize payments worth 148 million pounds in the first half of the year from the scheme, were up 2%.
Officials have said the Commission was confident the British plan was now compliant following an indepth investigation and that any legislative breach had been largely procedural.
Three sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they expected a decision this month, although a delay was possible.
""There is a decision in the pipeline,"" one said.
Another said the Commission was keen to finalize the decision, given the amount of work done and the uncertainty surrounding Britain's departure from the European Union scheduled for Oct. 31. Although payments promised so far would be released, any future aid could have different conditions attached.
The British government has said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, in which Britain leaves the bloc without further agreements, national legislation concerning state aid - under which capacity auctions take place - becomes law.
Some non-governmental groups and those working in the industry are seeking to disrupt the scheme, which they say has illegally subsidized fossil fuels and made insufficient allowance for more innovative ways of providing support for the power grid. 
A final decision is expected from the European Court of Justice next year, and separate court action is taking place in Britain and in Poland over its capacity mechanism plans. 
Britain's department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy did not respond to requests for comment.

The British government previously said it expected the scheme would be reinstated and that companies would receive retrospective payments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Okapi Partners, a proxy solicitor that has long worked for activist hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value, is hiring a senior executive from an advisory firm to help expand its business with corporate clients, three people familiar with the matter said this week.
Okapi, which specializes in guiding clients through shareholder votes on proxy contests at companies like  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB) and planned mergers like this year's Bristol-Myers Squibb (N:BMY) takeover of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), recruited Mark Harnett, an industry veteran, to join later this month.
Harnett,60, most recently worked at public relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co's corporate governance advisory unit, Strategic Governance Advisors, which was launched by former Institutional Shareholder Services executive Chris Cernich in 2016. Harnett's last day at Strategic Governance Advisors was Thursday. He joined Sard's public relations business in 2015.
The bulk of his career was spent counting votes in corporate battles at MacKenzie Partners, the proxy solicitor he co-founded with Daniel Burch in 1992. He worked there until 2015.
After a few years of advising corporate clients on how to engage with activist investors, Harnett was ready to return to his roots and the nitty-gritty work of vote counting, the sources said.
Okapi was founded by Bruce Goldfarb and Patrick McHugh, who worked together at proxy solicitor Georgeson Inc., at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 when activism was finding fresh traction. The firm has a reputation for working with activists like Elliott and Starboard but it also has other types of clients such as mutual fund firms.
Since its founding, pressure from activists on companies has steadily increased. Last year, for example, was a banner year for activists who put more capital to work than ever before, targeted a record number of companies and won a record number of board seats, data from Lazard show. While many activists lost money last year, their returns have largely rebounded this year with a handful including Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management, ValueAct Capital, Trian Fund Management and Starboard Value posting double digit returns in the first half, according to investors."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, other business groups and companies including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) have filed a brief at the U.S. Supreme Court opposing President Donald Trump's effort to end a program that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought into the United States illegally as children. 
The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Nov. 12 over Trump's 2017 plan to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama in 2012. Trump's move to rescind DACA was blocked by lower courts. The immigrants protected under the program often are called ""Dreamers.""
In the brief filed on Thursday, the business groups said Trump's move would harm individual companies that employ DACA recipients and the U.S. economy as a whole.
The program currently shields about 700,000 immigrants, mostly Hispanic young adults, from deportation and provides them work permits, though not a path to citizenship.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook filed a similar brief earlier in the week.
A Supreme Court decision is due by the end of June, in the thick of next year's presidential race in which Trump is seeking re-election. Democratic presidential candidates including Joe Biden have pledged actions to protect the Dreamers and offer them citizenship.
Trump, Republicans in Congress and Democratic lawmakers have been unable to hammer out a legislative deal to protect ""Dreamers."" The Trump administration has argued that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers when he bypassed Congress and created DACA.
The legal question before the Supreme Court is whether the administration properly followed a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act in Trump's plan to end DACA. 

Under Trump's September 2017 decision to rescind DACA, protections for Dreamers were to have begun phasing out in March 2018. But lower courts directed the administration to continue processing renewals of existing DACA applications while the litigation was resolved.

(Reuters) - Glass Lewis & Co is planning to grow its business abroad in the face of newly introduced curbs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the proxy advisory firm's new executive chairman Kevin Cameron told Reuters in an interview.
Cameron, who co-founded Glass Lewis in 2003, took over leadership of the San Francisco-headquartered firm last month, a few weeks after the SEC announced new oversight rules for proxy advisers, which make recommendations on how shareholders should cast their corporate ballots.
The SEC said proxy advisers like Glass Lewis cannot distribute inaccurate information, potentially making them legally liable if they do. It also clarified that investors have no obligation as shareholders to vote their shares, which could reduce their reliance on proxy advisers.
Cameron's mission is not just to help Glass Lewis navigate this new regulatory environment, but to also win market share over larger competitor Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS). He said he wanted to grow Glass Lewis' international footprint to help achieve this.
""We want to keep expanding globally, including in Asia where we historically haven't been as strong,"" Cameron said, adding ""Europe will also see growth, building on the investment we've made building out our presence there in recent years.""
As a member of Glass Lewis' Research Advisory Council from 2007 to 2019, Cameron had remained involved with the firm since retiring as president in 2007.
Last month, Glass Lewis also hired Gordon Seymour as its special counsel for public policy to help deal with the new regulatory landscape, Cameron said. Until last year, Seymour, a lawyer, was general counsel of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which oversees audits of public companies, and had worked at the SEC earlier in his career.
Carrie Busch, who had been with Glass Lewis at its start and led its international proxy research and new business initiatives units, returned last month as president. For the last decade, she worked at an investment firm and in finance at a pharmaceutical company.
Cameron took over from Glass Lewis CEO Katherine Rabin, who stepped down last month after 12 years at the helm. A former business journalist, Rabin will serve on Glass Lewis' advisory council, which guides the firm's proxy voting policies and guidelines.
Her years of experience in corporate governance could make her an attractive director candidate for a variety of public companies, Cameron said. Rabin declined to comment.
Glass Lewis has been owned by two Canadian pension funds, the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board and Alberta Investment Management Corp, since 2007 and 2013, respectively. Private equity investors often seek to cash out after three to seven years of ownership. However, Cameron said there were currently no plans for Glass Lewis to go up for sale.
Together, Glass Lewis and ISS have a 97% market share in the proxy advisory market, according to industry data. But they don't split the market evenly; ISS provides recommendations to shareholders on 40,000 meetings, while Glass Lewis takes on about 20,000, according to a report from Stanford University.
ISS supplements its revenue from proxy recommendations by offering companies consulting services to improve their corporate governance. Glass Lewis has never offered consulting services to companies, fearing it could open it up to accusations of conflict of interest, and has no plans to change its policy, Cameron said."

782,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 07:42AM ET</span>","Stop penalizing loyal customers, UK regulator tells car and home insurers","By Huw Jones and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog threw down the gauntlet to car and home insurers on Friday, saying they could avoid mandatory pricing restrictions if they voluntarily stop penalizing loyal customers.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in long-awaited interim conclusions from a study launched a year ago into how car and home insurers treat customers, said on Friday firms use complex pricing practices that allow them to raise prices for consumers that renew with them year on year, known as ""price walking"".
""Remedies are inevitable,"" Christopher Woolard, the watchdog's executive director for competition, told reporters.
""Whether those are remedies imposed through FCA rules, to some extent is up to industry. They can be remedies that are agreed on a voluntary basis,"" Woolard added. 
The watchdog is not interested in extended dialogue with insurers over changes, Woolard said.
""The ball is now very much in the hands of the industry.""
The Association of British Insurers said it agreed home and motor insurance markets could work better for customers who do not shop around at renewal, and that it would work with the regulator on the issue.
Six million car and home insurance policyholders paid high prices in 2018 in the 18 billion pound ($22 billion) market, the watchdog said. If they had paid the average price for a policy, they would collectively have saved 1.2 billion pounds.
This includes one in three people whose financial position is potentially vulnerable.
""It is shocking that insurance firms have got away with increasing prices for those customers who are least able to switch,"" said Helen Undy, chief executive of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute.
The FCA is considering curbs on firms charging higher prices to consumers who do not switch, for example, by restricting or banning ""margin optimisation"" based on consumers’ likelihood of renewing.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove analysts said the FCA scrutiny would ""act as an overhang"" on general insurers, highlighting  Direct Line  (L:DLGD),  Saga  (L:SAGAG), and Admiral as most at risk.
Shares in Saga, which offers insurance and travel to the over-50s, tumbled as much as 11% after the watchdog announced its proposals, before recouping some losses. Direct Line Insurance,  Aviva  (L:AV) and Hastings (L:HSTG) also dropped.
""At the moment these are just proposals. The FCA must now follow through on these bold ideas to stop loyal insurance customers being penalized,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of consumer group Citizens Advice.
Citi analysts said the report was ""frustratingly light on actual suggestions and is more of a rehash of the options ... available"". 
Insurers have already been drawing up new policies on how to deal with vulnerable customers, one industry source said.
More than 45 million home and motor insurance policies were written in 2018, and home and motor insurance generated 18 billion pounds in gross premiums last year. The FCA said 82% of adults in Britain have at least one general insurance policy.
It plans to publish a final report and consultation on remedies in the first quarter of next year.
Woolard declined to comment on potential enforcement action.

""There is no suggestion in this of an industry that has been breaching rules on a wholesale basis,"" he said.

Airbus, which already supplies larger A320-family jets to the airline, declined to comment.
Low-cost carrier Interjet is one of the main foreign operators of Russia’s first post-Soviet passenger jet, which entered service in 2011.
The European planemaker no longer publishes list prices but such a deal would be worth about $1 billion at the most recent catalogue value, with net prices said to be significantly lower after unpublished discounts.
No comment was immediately available from Interjet.

Industry publication Flightglobal reported earlier this year that two thirds of the carrier’s Superjet aircraft were idle because of a lack of spare parts and that the airline planned to withdraw the model from service.

Hiring in the U.S. economy is expected to have increased by a net 140,000 in September, up from 130,000 in August but still running at a clip well below that seen in recent years. Fears of a weaker number have risen after surveys of both manufacturing and services industries showed activity to have slowed sharply last month, with direct negative impacts on hiring. The numbers are due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). 
By 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), Dow futures were down 94 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 futures contracts was down 12 points, likewise a drop of 0.4%. Nasdaq 100 Futures were down in line with their old-economy counterparties.
This week's data have forced market participants to drastically rethink the outlook for monetary policy, with many pricing in additional rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said that he'll ""act as appropriate"" to sustain the economy and keep a long expansion on its legs. Powell is due to speak later at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT).
""If jobs growth can remain robust, this may reassure markets on the growth outlook and could cause Powell to defer further easing until the December meeting,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, in a note to subscribers. ""However, any suggestion that the slowdown in manufacturing and business investment is causing hiring to slow and businesses to shed jobs could be a clear catalyst for additional action on the monetary policy front.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian low-cost carrier SpiceJet Ltd (NS:SPJT) may consider taking some of the Boeing 737 MAX planes that were due to be delivered to now bankrupt Jet Airways (NS:JET) but are still sitting in Seattle, its chairman said on Friday.
""Lessors are in touch with us for MAX aircraft including those. There is an opportunity to backfill, to make up for some of the lost time,"" SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh told Reuters in an interview in New Delhi on Friday.
SpiceJet has already agreed to take four Jet 737 MAX planes on the ground in India, he said. More remain on the ground in Seattle, having not been delivered due to payment issues or because they were produced after a global grounding of the 737 MAX fleet in March after two fatal crashes.
SpiceJet, India's second-largest airline by market share after IndiGo, has more than 100 of the planes on firm order, as did Jet, but not all of SpiceJet's planes are ready yet. The grounding of MAX planes has hurt SpiceJet's capacity expansion and international plans and raised costs, Singh said.
SpiceJet currently has 13 737 MAX planes grounded in India and another 8-9 are sitting ready in Seattle but will be delivered only once the ban is lifted, Singh said.
Boeing (N:BA) has said it expects the 737 MAX could return to service in the United States by the end of the year but Singh said it could take until January before its planes start flying again as the Indian regulators would also need to certify it.
BACK-UP PLAN
SpiceJet, which is talking to Boeing about compensation, is also speaking to Airbus SE (PA:AIR) about potential orders as a back-up plan, Singh said.
He told Bloomberg last month that the airline was weighing an order for 100 Airbus long-range A321 planes.
""It depends on what happens with the MAX. Airbus is telling us they have the A321 for which there is no Boeing equivalent and we should look at it independently as well,"" he said on Friday.
""We are evaluating it,"" Singh said, adding that he would prefer the MAX because the company's engineering setup and pilots are already geared for it.
Despite the groundings, SpiceJet has expanded rapidly, taking advantage of Jet's collapse in April to take up over 30 of its rivals former 737 NG planes, flying more passengers and raising fares.
In August SpiceJet reported its biggest-ever quarterly profit, and its market value has soared to $1.2 billion.
SpiceJet has also received some of Jet's domestic and international airport slots on a temporary basis, but Singh said that as far as he was concerned they have now become permanent as per aviation rules."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks were slightly higher on Friday, clawing back some ground lost in their worst week for months, and safe haven assets rose ahead of a key jobs report as investors hoped this week's dismal data would trigger more U.S. interest rate cuts.
Trading overall was subdued after a bruising week for assets considered riskier in times of economic and political stress following a slew of week economic data that revealed a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and services.
But a fragile optimism emerged that evidence showing the trade war has dented the world's top economy may spur U.S. President Donald Trump toward a more conciliatory stance over the dispute with China as campaigning for next year's election ramps up.
It may also prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again.
MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, eked out small gains, up slightly at 0905 GMT and reversing earlier losses in Asia as investors looked to a key U.S. job report that could determine whether the Federal Reserve cuts rates further. 
Taking comfort from gains on Wall Street overnight, European bourses were all higher, with the pan European STOXX 600 and euro-zone benchmark up 0.2%.
""(The) market has very quickly reversed to the 'bad news is good news' model and rallied on increased rate cut expectation,"" said Marija Veitmane, multi-asset senior strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
Still the global index was on track for a 1.8% drop on the week, its worst in two months, hurt by a drum roll of weak global data, political uncertainty in the United States and Hong Kong, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Brexit.
Europe, and in particular London's FTSE 100, has lagged the global market, bearing the brunt of woes from a global manufacturing recession to growing trade conflicts and uncertainty over the Britain's exit from the European Union.
On Wednesday, Washington said it would impose 10% tariffs on European-made Airbus planes (PA:AIR) and 25% duties on European products such as French wine, as punishment for illegal EU aircraft subsidies, opening a new front on the global trade spat.
U.S. stock futures were lower, signaling a weaker open later and reversing a 0.80% increase in the S&P 500 on Wall Street overnight on hopes that future Fed rate cuts will support corporate profits.
Talks between Beijing and Washington resume next week, aimed at agreeing a truce over the protracted trade spat between the world's two largest economies, although hopes of a definitive agreement are pretty low. 
Global equities could fall as much as 15-20% if negotiations break down and Trump follows through with his threat of car imports tariffs, UBS global chief investment officer Mark Haefele warned on Friday.
The Swiss bank reckons there's a 50% probability that additional duties will be announced by the year-end, potentially pushing global growth down to 3% next year, the slowest pace since the global financial crisis.
""Without a resolution to the U.S.-China trade dispute, we see limited upside for stocks in the near-term, and given the risks of further escalation we hold a modest tactical underweight on equities,"" he said.

SAFE HAVENS
Signs the U.S. economy was losing momentum, and nerves ahead of key jobs numbers later in the day, sent investors into safe haven asset such as government bonds and gold.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls data is expected to show the world's top economy added 145,000 new jobs in September, more than an increase of 130,000 in the previous month.
Euro-zone government bond yields were lower in early European trading and spot gold was up 0.3%, on course for a 0.75% weekly gain. 
U.S. Treasury prices fell slightly overnight but two-year yields,which track expectations for U.S. monetary policy, remained near the lowest in two years.
The dollar index steadied after hitting a 2-1/2-year high this week. It was down 0.3% on the week.
Traders see a 85.2% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points to 1.75%-2.00% in October, up from 39.6% on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. 
The Fed has already cut rates twice this year as policymakers try to limit the damage caused by the bruising Sino-U.S. trade war. 
The dollar edged down to 106.81 yen , close to a one-month low of 106.48 yen reached on Thursday. The euro (EUR=EBS) was a shade higher at $1.0974, near a one-week high. 
For the week, the dollar was down 1.04% versus the yen and off 0.3% against the common currency.
U.S. crude (CLc1) rose 0.3% to $52.76 a barrel, while Brent crude rose 0.7% to $58.11 per barrel. For the week, crude futures were on course for a steep decline, their worst performance since July 19.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 05:31AM ET</span>",Greece's Eurobank struggles to flip loan-recovery unit to PIMCO: sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Valentina Za and George Georgiopoulos
LONDON/MILAN/ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's Eurobank (AT:EURBr) is struggling to finalize a deal to sell a majority stake in its loan-recovery business to U.S. money manager PIMCO, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, after a Sept. 30 deadline passed with no agreement.
The sale is a key component of clean-up efforts at Greece's third-biggest bank, which has pledged to quickly cut the problem loans that comprise more than a third of its total lending.
On July 1 Eurobank picked PIMCO, its sixth-biggest investor, as the preferred bidder for an 80% stake in its Financial Planning Services (FPS) unit, setting a three-month deadline to reach an accord.
One of the sources said Eurobank valued FPS at about 300 million euros ($329 million) and was struggling to bridge a valuation gap with PIMCO, which judged the unit's worth at well below that threshold.
Eurobank is keen to finalize the sale of FPS, sources at the bank said, and is continuing talks with PIMCO despite diverging views on the value of the unit.
European Central Bank supervisors have been pushing southern European banks to shed loans that turned sour during the last recession. Now that economic growth in the bloc is faltering again, they are keen for lenders to step up their efforts.
Big portfolio sales have opened up a lucrative market for investors in risky assets.
Loan recovery units such as FPS, which carry with them long-term debt collection contracts, are particularly sought after, and banks have been selling them together with bundles of loans.
RIVAL BIDDERS
FPS had drawn interest from an investment consortium consisting of U.S. activist fund Elliott, U.S. buyout fund Bain and Italian credit management group Cerved (MI:CERV).
Italy's biggest bad-loan specialist, doValue (MI:DOVA), owned by SoftBank-backed (T:3248) Fortress Investment Group, also made a preliminary bid this year but failed to enter exclusive talks.
Verona-based doValue has operations in Greece and last year clinched a deal with Eurobank and three other lenders to manage 1.8 billion euros in soured corporate loans.
Set on pursuing expansion abroad, doValue this year bought Spanish bad-loan manager Altamira.
The two bidders remain interested in buying FPS and are trying to match Eurobank's price expectations, three sources said, with one adding that Eurobank may consider relaunching the process in coming weeks.
All interested parties declined to comment.
Greek banks hold 75 billion euros in impaired loans and are seen following in the tracks of their Italian rivals, which in recent years have almost halved soured debts on their balance sheets from a post-crisis peak of 350 billion euros.
Unpaid loans weaken the banking system by hurting profits and lifting funding costs due to investors' heightened risk perception, ultimately restricting the ability to lend."
789,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 05:28AM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. helps Mastercard, Visa score victory in Indonesia in global lobbying effort","By Gayatri Suroyo, Aditya Kalra and Fanny Potkin
JAKARTA/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials, at the request of card networks Mastercard (N:MA) and Visa (N:V), convinced Indonesia late last year to loosen rules governing its new domestic payment network, according to Indonesian government and industry sources, and emails reviewed by Reuters.
The change will allow the U.S. companies to process credit card transactions without having to partner with a local company in Indonesia, the sources said.
Indonesia's decision represented a major lobbying victory for U.S. payment companies in efforts to beat back a host of new regulations in Asia and elsewhere around data storage or the promotion of local payment networks over foreign ones.
The lobbying effort in Indonesia was detailed in more than 200 pages of email communications between U.S. trade officials and executives of card companies that Reuters obtained under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.
The emails, dated between April 2018 and August 2019, also showed that Mastercard lobbied the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to oppose new data rules and local payment systems in India, Vietnam, Laos, Ukraine and Ghana. Visa was looped into several of the discussions, the emails showed.
While American firms often lobby the U.S. administration on business issues, those discussions usually happen behind closed doors and are not made public.
The Indonesian rules would have required foreign firms to process credit and debit card transactions onshore in partnership with a domestic partner under Indonesia's payment network, known as the National Payment Gateway (NPG). The decision would have hit the companies by reducing their earnings in Indonesia, especially on the more lucrative credit card fee.
U.S. trade officials made changing that rule a top demand if Indonesia were to retain a privileged trade status known as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), three Indonesian officials and two industry sources involved in the negotiations told Reuters. GSP gives Indonesia lower tariffs on exports to the United States worth $2 billion annually. 
As a result, Indonesia's central bank agreed to exclude all credit card transactions from the NPG, the sources said.
""The U.S. side made clear the National Payment Gateway was a main demand if Indonesia wanted GSP. The U.S. side was dead-set on this,"" said one of the industry sources.
The decision to exclude credit cards from the NPG has not previously been made public. 
Indonesia now expects to retain its GSP status, officials said, though negotiations are ongoing. A spokesman for Indonesia's central bank said its role in the GSP talks was over and credit cards would not be regulated under the new system in the near term.
The spokesman did not comment on the U.S. pressure. But Rizal Affandi Lukman, an Indonesian deputy minister involved in the negotiations, said the decision was taken independently, adding that the central bank can't ""be steered by the U.S.""
The office of the USTR in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.
Mastercard and Visa did not answer questions from Reuters on their lobbying efforts. In a statement, Mastercard said any change in the regulatory environment in Indonesia ""to support global partners participating is a result of conversations between the U.S. and Indonesian governments as part of their ongoing negotiations"".
Visa said it ""routinely engages with governments around the world to promote the value of digital payments and to advocate for open markets, free trade, and global competition.""
USTR has long advocated for Mastercard, Visa and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) to have unrestricted access to developing countries, particularly in China, where they cannot operate independently in the yuan currency card market.
China's unwillingness to grant the U.S. card firms licenses to operate is one of many market access issues now under discussion in the U.S.-China trade talks led by USTR.
LOBBYING SUCCESS, FAILURES
Governments around the world say regulations aimed at boosting local data storage help protect privacy of their citizens and support legal investigations. Financial firms, however, say such measures are protectionist and lead to higher costs, and also weaken global fraud detection tools.
Countries such as Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous, offer massive growth opportunities for companies as the use of digital payments booms. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates card usage for online spending in Indonesia will grow 39% a year to 2021.
Mastercard's recommendation that the extension of Indonesia's GSP status should be contingent on changing the NPG rules came in an email sent to a USTR official by the company's public policy executive in Indonesia, Wilson Siahaan, on Nov. 2.
""If the GSP were to be signed, it should include notes on some key open items,"" according to a Mastercard briefing document sent by Siahaan that listed ""exclusion of credit card"" among pending issues.
On Nov. 28, Siahaan learned Indonesia had decided to exclude credit cards from the NPG and sent a thank you note. The decision is ""great news and we appreciate your help,"" he wrote in his e-mail to the USTR official, sending a copy to Visa.
Siahaan did not respond to a request for comment.
In contrast to the success in Indonesia, companies including Mastercard and Visa failed to convince India's central bank to relax rules that force them to store data locally, Reuters reported last year.
The United States in June stripped India's special trade privilege citing ""a wide array of trade barriers"", though it did not specifically cite its concerns over data storage rules.
Mastercard also opposed a sweeping cybersecurity law in Vietnam, which was approved in 2018 and requires companies to set up local offices and store user data locally.
Mastercard's vice president for public policy, Sahra English, told the USTR in one of the emails seen by Reuters that Vietnam's localization requirements could cost the company ""tens of millions"" of dollars because it would require the company to localize systems and processes.
It is not clear to what extent the USTR lobbied Vietnam. But the agency told Mastercard and Visa executives in an email that, in regards to a separate payments regulation, Vietnam's central bank had agreed to defer by a year, to 2020, a provision forcing foreign card companies to route transactions through a firm approved by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). 
""SBV hopes that the extension of the effective date will facilitate the two sides having enough time to work out appropriate technical solutions,"" a USTR official wrote in an e-mail on Nov. 14, 2018.
A Mastercard executive responded: ""Many thanks for this piece of info and your relentless support"". 

Vietnam's foreign ministry and central bank did not respond to requests for comment.

Investing.com -- To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to lose one highly respected FTSE 100 CEO may be regarded as misfortune, but to lose three in a week is enough to send any Brexit conspiracy theorist into spasms.
Bob Dudley is to step down from the chief executive job at   BP   (LON:BP) after nearly a decade in the job, only a day after Big Tobacco’s longest-serving boss Alison Cooper was forced out from Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) and three days after Dave Lewis announced he’d be leaving supermarket giant   Tesco   (LON:TSCO) next summer.
Dudley’s departure has much more in common with Lewis’s than with Cooper’s. Like Lewis, he took over at a time of unprecedented crisis, and like Lewis, he has managed to stabilize the ship and turn it around, if with (another parallel with Tesco’s savior) less obvious momentum than it had before: the shares have only eked out a modest 4% in the last three years. 
In Dudley’s case, the crisis was the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 people and created the greatest oil-related environmental catastrophe in history. After his predecessor Tony Hayward’s crass failure to recognize the gravity of the situation, Dudley acknowledged BP’s responsibility and, while he defended its shareholders’ interests legitimately in court, has complied with enough grace to at least ensure that the company can keep operating in the U.S., its most important market. Had he not done so, it's hard to see how BP would have been allowed to buy BHP Billiton's U.S. shale assets, as it did for $10.5 billion last year.
It’s hard to argue with the company’s statement on Friday morning that Dudley “rebuilt BP as a stronger, safer company ... This company, and indeed the whole industry, owes him a debt of gratitude.""
His management of the Deepwater Horizon affair has, inevitably, overshadowed his other achievements, nowhere more than in Russia. Here Dudley made a virtue out of necessity, selling its joint venture stake at a top-of-the-cycle valuation to raise money to cover the Deepwater liabilities. He was forced to cede direct control of the company’s best cash cow, but still kept a deep and close relationship with Rosneft – including a 19.75% stake that has enormous latent value, if ever Russia is inclined to replace its current management with one more enlightened.
A further parallel with Tesco – not to be understated - is that the succession has again been smoothly planned, with a hand-picked successor – upstream operations head Bernard Looney - already in place. The key difference here is that Looney is a BP lifer, while Tesco went for an outsider in Walgreens’ Ken Murphy. Keeping an upstream expert at the very top goes against the grain these days in Big Oil, but makes plenty of sense in BP’s case, given the uniqueness of the Deepwater Horizon legacy.
BP shares were up 1.1% by 5:30 AM ET, on a day when most European stock indexes were content to wait for the monthly U.S. payrolls report. The FTSE 100 was up 0.3%, while the Stoxx 600 was up 0.1%."

(Reuters) - European stocks hovered in positive territory on Friday, propped up by hopes of easing measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve, but gains were slim as markets threatened to log their worst weekly performance in a year.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.3% after three straight sessions of declines that erased about 4% of value. Sectors considered stable during times of economic uncertainty such as healthcare, telecoms and food and beverage, were among the prominent gainers.
Technology stocks (SX8P) rose 0.4%, with chipmakers jumping after a report said Apple Inc (O:AAPL) would increase its iPhone 11 production. Shares of chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn), STMicro (PA:STM) and Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) jumped between 1% and 3.4%.
With corporate news light, investors now wait for the latest U.S. payrolls data, due at 12:30 GMT, to gauge the health of the world's largest economy - particularly after a dismal set of data this week bolstered hopes of an interest rate cut in October from the Fed.
""If we have a soft number today, that's going to trigger another sell-off. This will be confirmation that the slowdown is real,"" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London.
In a turbulent week for markets roiled by weak readings on factory and services sector activity in the United States and the euro zone, as well as U.S. tariffs on European Union goods, the STOXX 600 was on course to post its worst weekly performance in about a year.
London-listed shares (FTSE), also on course for their worst weekly performance in a year, took the biggest hit due to fresh Brexit worries and recession fears, while eurozone shares (STOXXE) were set to post their biggest weekly decline in two months.

The move, first reported by the BBC, highlights the pressure UK retailers are under in the face of subdued consumer spending, the structural shift to online shopping and with Brexit looming.
John Lewis is part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership, which said on Tuesday it was seeking to save 100 million pounds ($123 million) through a major management restructuring.
Service charges are the fees retailers pay, in addition to rent, for services such as heating, cleaning, maintenance and security. John Lewis said these charges had risen regularly and landlords had not cooperated in trying to reduce costs.
A spokeswoman for the chain said it was withholding 20% at around 20 covered shopping centers. It has 50 UK department stores in total.
""At a time when we are doing everything we can to reduce our cost base, we have unfortunately been faced with regular increases to the service charges we pay for some of our shops in shopping centers,"" John Lewis said.
Over the last three years it has seen an increase in service charges of 20%.
""These continued increases are simply not acceptable particularly in the absence of strenuous efforts by landlords to work collaboratively with us to reduce these costs,"" it said.
""We are investing more in our current shop estate than ever before to do everything we can to encourage customers and grow footfall and we hope that our landlords will support us in continuing to do this.""
Asked if the move could leave John Lewis open to legal action from landlords, the spokeswoman said: ""We are looking to work with our suppliers, so those conversations have started.""
 Hammerson  (L:HMSO) and  Intu Properties  (L:INTUP) are among John Lewis' biggest landlords.
Last month, John Lewis reported a 61.8 million pounds loss for the six months to July 27. Its sales are down 2.1% over the 35 weeks to Sept. 28.
Britain's department store sector has been under intense pressure from weak demand and rising costs for several years.
BHS went bust in 2016, House of Fraser was bought out of administration last year by Mike Ashley's  Sports Direct  (L:SPD) and Debenhams went into administration in April and is now owned by its lenders. Debenhams secured major rent reductions in May when creditors approved a restructuring."
794,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 04:27AM ET</span>",Green Utilities Are Starting to Outperform,"(Bloomberg) -- Concern about an economic slowdown has struck equities hard in the past three days. Amid the bloodbath, utilities -- perceived as safer -- have fared better than others. While the sector is up 17% for the year, it masks strong winners and losers within it. Renewables in particular have outperformed, given that many European governments are looking to boost spending on tackling climate change.
Government policies globally are increasingly supporting net-zero carbon targets, underpinning the growth ambitions of utilities including Orsted, RWE,  Enel , SSE and EDPR, which are poised to benefit from structurally growing capex pipelines, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) says. The analysts estimate renewable players will enter a “golden age” with investments doubling from current levels to 60 billion euros per year.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts are on the same page and said back in August that “climate champions” will benefit from an unprecedented growth to 2030, a call they reiterated last week after the announcement of the German climate package. They forecast a 9% to 12% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for those stocks. In a highly fragmented renewable market Goldman has a clear preference for six utility plays: RWE (MI:RWE), Oersted (CSE:ORSTED), EDP (SIX:EDP),   EDP Renovaveis   (LS:EDPR),  Enel  (MI:ENEI), SSE (LON:SSE) and   Iberdrola   (MC:IBE). They see the “pioneering” German plan to act as a “blueprint” for the rest of the world.
Valuation could put off investors, though. Orsted and EDPR are the two largest pure-play stocks of the sector but they’re also the most expensive. Overall, analysts on average are struggling to find some upside for renewables after the recent rally. UBS analysts turned cautious on Orsted and Iberdrola last month, saying fundamentals are no longer supportive. They prefer other players including Enel and RWE.
Some caution might also be needed on German utilities as the government allocated less money in its budget for closing coal-fired power plants than the companies that own them expected.
Climate change remains the number one ESG issue for investors, according to BofA. They estimate $70 billion of assets are tied to ESG strategies in the U.S. alone, while $3 trillion of assets currently use climate change and carbon footprint as one of the ESG criteria in their investment process.
Among European countries gearing up spending on tackling climate change, Germany already announced it will spend more than 100 billion euros to reduce carbon emissions between 2020 and 2030, with half of the amount in the first three years.
With 77 countries now committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, and 87 large companies with a similar pledge, BofA analysts estimate there may be a need to triple the current capacity of renewable projects, as over 75GW of green power purchase agreements (PPA) should be generated.
Renewables might be one of the few beneficiaries from the German package, because the country may not commit to much more fiscal spending beyond this new ""green"" deal, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) economists."

LONDON (Reuters) - Auditors are being blamed too much when a company collapses rather than actions taken by company directors, the head of an inquiry into Britain's audit sector said on Friday.
The collapse of construction company Carillion and retailer BHS has fueled calls from Britain's parliament for a shakeup of the audit market to spot problems earlier and avoid thousands of employees losing their jobs.
Britain's accounting regulator this week began investigating EY's audit of travel company Thomas Cook, which collapsed last month.
Donald Brydon, former London Stock Exchange chairman, has been asked by Britain's business ministry to look at how to improve the quality and effectiveness of the audit market.
Brydon said it was not auditors that cause companies to fail, but the actions of directors.
""And I am a little troubled by the current mood that reaches for a shotgun aimed at auditors every time there is a corporate problem,"" he told an audience at the ICAEW, a professional accounting body.
""I am mindful that audit needs to be an attractive profession that attracts the brightest and best who can have confidence that good professional work will not be misdescribed at moments of stress,"" Brydon said.
Brydon will make recommendations by the end of the year on what can be done about the gap between what investors want from an audit and what accountants can deliver.
Brydon said 2,500 pages of submissions to his review were strongly of the view that change is needed, though he stressed that he would not be ""redesigning Western capitalism"".
There are frustrations with what people see as the currently ""narrow, backward-looking and increasingly rules-obsessed approach to audit"" and wanted more forward-looking aspects of a company covered as well.
""I do believe that in seeking to improve the impact and quality of audit, we must look not just to auditors, but to audit committees, boards and managements too,"" Brydon said.
The government has yet to say to what extent it will implement two other reviews in the past year that recommended creating a more powerful regulator, and requiring big companies to hire two auditors and separate their consulting and audit operations.
Many of the recommendations need legislation at a time when parliament is consumed with Britain's departure from the European Union."
797,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 03:51AM ET</span>",Norwegian Air's Sept passenger income up less than forecast,"By Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air's (OL:NWC) income per passenger rose less than expected in September, although its aircraft were more full than at the same time last year, the airline's monthly traffic report showed on Friday.
The company's yield, or revenue per passenger carried and kilometer flown, rose to 0.39 Norwegian crowns ($0.0428) in September from 0.38 crowns a year earlier, below the 0.40 crowns seen in a Reuters poll.
The loss-making airline is on track to reach its target of cutting costs by 2 billion crowns this year, acting Chief Executive Geir Karlsen said in a statement.
""The outlook going forward is promising, and for the upcoming winter season, we have adjusted our route portfolio and capacity to ensure that we are well positioned to meet the actual demand,"" Karlsen said.
Norwegian filled 89.9% of available seats last month, up from 88.8% a year earlier and in line with analysts' average forecast.
The company's shares were up 2.2% at 0705 GMT, partly reversing Thursday's fall of almost 5% and outperforming a 0.8% rise in Norway's benchmark stock market index.
Europe's third largest budget carrier switched this year to prioritizing profits over growth, but has been hampered by the grounding of Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft and technical problems with Rolls Royce (L:RR) engines on Boeing 787s.
It used its low-fare, high-volume model to grab market share from incumbent transatlantic carriers, and last year overtook British Airways as the largest non-U.S airline on routes between Europe and airports in the New York area.
But the breakneck expansion left it with high debts, leading to a sharp strategy change. The airline's capacity expansion, as measured by available seat km (ASK), peaked at 51% growth year-on-year in June 2018 but has since plummeted, hitting just 1% last month amid the focus on preserving cash and cutting costs.
Analysts in the Reuters poll had forecast ASK would show no growth at all in the year to September.
Norwegian's bondholders agreed last month to postpone repayments on $380 million of outstanding debt for up to two years, in the company's latest bid to sort out its finances.

A string of European airlines have folded in the last two years, including recent collapses of Aigle Azur, Adria Airways and travel firm Thomas Cook, but loss-making Norwegian has secured funding from shareholders to stay in the air.

The boost would add 7 million to 8 million units to what the Cupertino, Calif.-based company had initially planned on, the Nikkei cited anonymous sources as saying. Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers from Murata Manufacturing (OTC:MRAAY) and Alps in Tokyo to AAC Technologies Holdings (HK:2018). in Hong Kong climbed after the report. An Apple spokesperson in Japan declined to comment.
It is not unusual for Apple to gradually ramp up orders as it gauges demand after launch and builds up to the holiday shopping season. The U.S. company has stuck with a previous projection for sales of up to 75 million new iPhones in the second half, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing internal estimates.
But Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has telegraphed strong initial sales of his company’s most profitable product, spurring expectations that demand for the iPhone 11 will hold up despite global smartphone malaise. The CEO told French daily Les Echos on Friday he foresaw a new growth cycle in the market.
Major improvements to the iPhone’s camera, including the addition of a new ultrawide lens for better architectural and tourist photos, alongside better battery life and improved durability may have resonated with consumers. And a decision to lower the iPhone 11’s starting price by $50, to $699, may also have drawn in more budget-conscious consumers in a weaker global economy."

Hong Kong tycoons and property developers have come under pressure from Beijing for not doing enough to alleviate housing problems in the Chinese-ruled city.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) was planning a fresh inquiry into barriers to entry in retail banking, a sector dominated by the country's ""Big Four"" banks.
The regulator confirmed that an inquiry was under consideration and said it was considering which stakeholders to engage with, but declined to give details.
""We are currently discussing potential options for our next inquiry, including the various approaches we might take,"" an ACCC spokeswoman said.
Australia's four largest banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), ANZ Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) - dominate about 80 percent of the retail banking sector.
They are facing increased regulatory scrutiny after the sector-wide Royal Commission inquiry last year found they had pursued profit ahead of customers' interests. A separate inquiry by the Productivity Commission also found the sector lacked competition.
The four banks have booked expenses of over A$8 billion ($5.4 billion) to refund customers for overcharged fees, miss-sold products and non-compliant financial advice in the wake of the Royal Commission, with NAB this week doubling its compensation pot.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he would give a new inquiry his consideration but added: ""Right now I'm not focused on new inquiries"".
""I'm focused on implementing the recommendations of the most comprehensive inquiry, namely the Royal Commission that we have just had,"" he told reporters.
Citing internal ACCC documents, The Sydney Morning Herald reported the regulator planned to meet executives of  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA) and  Macquarie Group  Ltd (AX:MQG), both of which are trying to expand their retail banking businesses in Australia.
The documents showed some members of the ACCC's Financial Services Board were concerned about a lack of government support for a new inquiry, and opposition from the banks.

The personal computer giant said it will cut 7,000 to 9,000 positions through firings and voluntary early retirement. The job reductions will help save about $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2022, the Palo Alto, California-based company said Thursday in a statement. HP had 55,000 employees as of a year ago, the last time it disclosed the figure.
HP also announced it expects profit, excluding restructuring costs and other items, to be $2.22 to $2.32 a share in fiscal 2020. Analysts, on average, estimated $2.23 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HP’s shares slid more than 5% in after-hours trading.
The company released the projections as it faces a number of uncertainties. Dion Weisler, the chief executive officer who has shepherded the company since its 2015 split with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., is stepping down Nov. 1 due to family health reasons. The incoming CEO, Enrique Lores, is a longtime HP executive. The company’s printing business, a major source of profit, has seen falling sales and recently was dubbed a “melting ice cube” by analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein. And an activist investor may be building a stake in the company, a Gordon Haskett analyst speculated Wednesday.
“We see ourselves starting a new chapter for HP and we will be announcing bold moves to support that statement,” Lores said in an interview. “We have spent a lot of time building this plan. We can embrace the changes we see happening in the market and that can help us position the company for the future.”
HP’s reorganization will cost $1 billion, resulting in charges of $100 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, $500 million in fiscal 2020 and the rest split between fiscal 2021 and 2022, the company said.
“The bulk of the savings will be in corporate functions, back-office support,” Chief Financial Officer Steve Fieler said about the job cuts in an interview.
HP’s board boosted the company’s share repurchasing plan by an additional $5 billion. The company had $1.7 billion remaining on its existing plan. HP said it will also boost its stock dividend by 10%. The company’s shares have declined 10% this year, closing at $18.40 on Thursday in New York.
The company said it expects at least $3 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2020, and will return 75% or more of that money to investors.
Along with financial metrics, the company said it would make changes to its printing unit to focus on providing more services. HP will raise prices for printers that can be used with non-HP ink cartridges, so that the hardware is more profitable. Currently, printers are sold cheaply and the unit’s operating profit margin is padded by the ink supplies. HP will offer some lower-priced printers, but employ new technologies to ensure they are only compatible with HP ink.
HP will also start selling the underlying technology of its ink jet printing, known as microfluidics, to the health-care and cosmetics industries, among others.
“We are really confident about the future of the company,” Lores said.

Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (HK:0027) lost 1%, while   Sands China Ltd   (HK:1928) dropped 1.1%. 
Figures from Macau’s Public Security Police showed that visitor arrivals to Macau during the first two days of the Golden Week holiday were up by 8.8% from the same period in 2018. 
Number of mainland visitors in those first two days stood at approximately 257,600, up by 9.6% year-on-year, data showed. The figures sent Hong Kong-listed casino stocks higher initially, with Galaxy up almost 3% while Sands gained as much as 1.8% earlier in the day. 
But stocks in Hong Kong turned lower after traders digested reports that the government may ban face masks at public gatherings as a way to deter protesters.
It will be the first time in more than half a century to ban face masks at public gatherings.
Some legal experts pointed out that invoking the emergency law would further polarise society and pave the way for more draconian regulations, as the law gives the city’s leader the authority to “make any regulations whatsoever which he, or she, may consider desirable in the public interest” in case of “emergency of public danger.”"

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia's (AX:CBA) life insurance arm has been charged with 87 counts of unlawfully offering to sell products via unsolicited telephone calls - the first criminal prosecution against a major bank following a sector-wide misconduct inquiry.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)has accused Colonial Mutual Life Insurance Society Ltd, known as CommInsure, of unlawfully selling life insurance policies via unsolicited phone calls between October and December 2014.
CBA could be fined as much as A$21,250 for each charge or up to A$1.8 million, the regulator said in a statement, adding that matter was being prosecuted by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.
CBA agreed to sell its life-insurance business to Hong-Kong based AIA Group (HK:1299) in September 2017 but the deal has yet to be completed due to a prolonged regulatory approval process.
CBA said in a statement it was considering the matter and did not plan to comment further at this time.
CommInsure was also criticized at the inquiry into financial sector misconduct last year after it was shown to have rejected a payout to a heart attack victim because it was using outdated assessment criteria."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New 25% U.S. tariffs on Italian cheese, French wine, Scotch whisky, British biscuits, Spanish olives and thousands of other European food products will lead to higher prices ahead of the holiday season and cost American jobs, trade groups said on Thursday.
The U.S. Trade Representative's Office said on Wednesday it was imposing tariffs on hundreds of European products after the World Trade Organization gave the green light to the action in response to EU subsidies on large aircraft.
The Specialty Food Association said in a statement the tariffs would decrease sales and adversely impact U.S employment at 14,000 specialty food retailers and 20,000 other food retailers across the United States. The impact would be ""dramatic,"" the trade group said. 
Higher prices ""will hit Americans in the wallet just as the holiday season is approaching,"" the group said. ""The cheese/charcuterie board that currently cost you $45 will put you back $60 after tariffs. The treats you provide your family to celebrate Thanksgiving and the year-end holidays may become out of reach.""
Single-malt whisky represented over half of the total value of British products on the U.S. tariff list, amounting to over $460 million, according to the Scotch Whisky Association. 
Shares in European luxury goods, including British fashion brand  Burberry  Group Plc (L:BRBY), and drinks companies, such as France’s  Remy Cointreau  SA (PA:RCOP), rose on Thursday, after the tariffs excluded cognac, Champagne and leather goods.
This week's tariffs on Scotch whisky, liqueurs and cordials, and wine could affect nearly $3.4 billion in imports ""and could lead to a loss of approximately 13,000 U.S. jobs, including truckers, farmers, and bartenders and servers in the hospitality industry,"" the Distilled Spirits Council said.
José Andrés, a Spanish-born Michelin-starred chef who has helped provide millions of meals in areas hit by natural disasters and owns more than a dozen U.S. restaurants, criticized the tariffs on Twitter on Thursday, saying it ""will affect not only rural economies in Europe, but thousands of small American businesses all over!""
He urged U.S. President Donald Trump to reconsider: ""You are a Deal Maker? A businessman! If you can negotiate with enemies, do it with allies first.""In June 2018, the EU imposed 25% tariffs on American whiskey in response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs. The EU is now considering more tariffs on additional U.S. spirits and U.S. wine as part of a separate WTO civil aviation investigation.

Since the new EU tariffs, American whiskey exports have declined 21 percent.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 07:16PM ET</span>",CVS drug coverage plan based on outside pricing review is off to a slow start,"By Caroline Humer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) health plan that uses an outside drug pricing group to help it decide whether to cover certain new medicines has gained little traction with customers, according to its top medical executive, and has drawn fierce criticism from patient advocacy groups.
The company has held back on marketing the pharmacy benefit plan while it talks to these groups, CVS said.
The plan, launched a year ago, is based on analyses by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a Boston-based group that assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices.
Using ICER's cost effectiveness assessment, CVS decides whether to include second or third medicines entering the market if there are already similar ones in the plan.
Opposition to the CVS plan is part of much broader concerns cited by drug companies and advocacy groups, many of which receive funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Some say that ICER's analysis based on additional years of ""quality life"" gained from a given treatment is arbitrary and disregards the costs of drug development and patient needs.
More than 50 groups, including drugmakers, PhRMA, the industry's main lobby group, and other advocacy groups, have provided comment during a public input period included in a review by ICER of its assessment methods. Many asked ICER to eliminate price recommendations from its efficacy analyses.
ICER has defended its methods, which are based on a widely-used cost effectiveness analysis.
The soft rollout of CVS' ICER-related product comes as employer health plan sponsors - its biggest clients - are showing increased concern over their cost for new high-priced drugs, and are considering refusing to pay for them at all, CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said in a recent interview.
If corporate customers follow through on that threat, CVS said it could change tactics with the plan.
Rising drug prices, particularly for expensive specialty treatments for severe or deadly conditions, have pushed annual U.S. healthcare spending to $3.65 trillion, and made them unaffordable for many individuals.
Earlier this year,  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) launched Zolgensma, a more than $2 million gene therapy for a rare but deadly disease called spinal muscular atrophy.
The new CVS program, cited as an example of ICER's growing influence on U.S. drug pricing, would not apply to such a breakthrough treatment. It is a tiny plan by CVS standards as the company manages pharmaceutical benefits for more than 102 million people and also owns Aetna (NYSE:AET) insurance and a national pharmacy chain.
NOT WIDELY PROMOTED
The plan's scope is limited to so-called me too drugs, those where similar effective treatments already exist, and aims to pressure drugmakers to set lower prices. For example, two of three very similar drugs for migraine approved in 2018 could have been excluded, but drugmakers set prices ICER deemed cost effective.
CVS has limited sales and marketing for the plan while it talks to patient groups who oppose it. About 240,000 CVS employees and a few large clients' employees are enrolled thus far. The company declined to comment on exact membership.
""We are not widely promoting this program,"" Brennan said, adding that CVS is working to address patient groups' concerns.
Meanwhile, Brennan said some employers are considering refusing to pay for million-dollar treatments like gene therapy. They are saying, ""I'm not going to cover these kinds of therapies no matter what their comparative effectiveness is if they've got a really high cost.""
Large healthcare consultant and brokerage Mercer said it has begun to field similar concerns.
""We have certainly gotten some plan sponsors saying 'What if we don't cover specialty drugs?'"" said David Dross, who runs Mercer's managed pharmacy practice. Two years ago, it never received any such questions, he said.
Steve Wojcik, an executive with the National Business Group on Health which represents large employers, said he does not believe many will take that drastic step.
Still, ICER President Steven Pearson said employers tell him they worry about their ability to cover everything and have suggested they might drop some high-cost treatments. He said employers can use cost effectiveness analysis to help them manage their spending.
ICER has responded to outside criticism by meeting with patient advocates and by adding new measurements for a drug's effectiveness, such as the value of life years gained, which does not focus on quality of life improvements, Pearson said.
Since 2015, ICER has published up to a dozen reviews each year of drugs and classes of medicines.
Most U.S. private insurers now use ICER clinical and cost analyses to inform coverage negotiations with drugmakers. ICER funding primarily comes from a non-profit foundation, but drug companies and health insurers provide some funds for ICER-related activities."
817,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 07:06PM ET</span>",Behind the GM strike: Declining productivity at U.S. operations,"By Ankit Ajmera and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) U.S. workforce productivity has declined since the automaker recovered from a 2009 bankruptcy, even as its profit per employee has risen, a Reuters analysis shows.
Those trends point to some of the root causes of the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike that has shut down the automaker's U.S. manufacturing plants for 18 days, already costing the company about $100 million a day.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker wants to boost productivity to offset financial pressure from a slowing global economy and investments in electric vehicles. The UAW is focused on increasing the share of profit going to workers, and closing wage gaps between full-time and temporary employees in GM factories. 
GM's unionized workers in the United States build some of the company's most profitable truck and sport utility vehicles.
GM does not publish direct measures of U.S. productivity. But the number of vehicles the Detroit automaker built in the United States per U.S. employee fell to about 19 in 2018, down 13.5% from the 2010 level.
The Reuters calculation is based on GM annual production numbers sourced from research firm Wards Intelligence and the U.S. employee count in GM's annual filings.
A GM spokesman declined to comment on the analysis, saying that the automaker was ""focused on negotiating a new labor agreement that builds a stronger future for the company and our workers.""
The UAW said it believes GM's productivity is better since 2010 and the data would be more accurate based on total hours worked rather than employment.
Between 2010 and 2018 GM's estimated U.S. profit per employee surged 40% to about $94,097 last year, based on analysts' assumptions that U.S. operations generate about 90% of the automaker's North American operating profit disclosed in GM filings.
Click here for an interactive graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2p5MGjW
However, productivity and operating profit per worker have both slipped at GM between 2017 and 2018. 
A broader measure of productivity in the U.S. auto sector shows declining productivity starting in 2013, according to data published by the Center for Automotive Research, an Ann Arbor, Michigan, industry research group. 
One possible reason for the broad productivity declines at manufacturers including GM is the increasing complexity of vehicles and the federally mandated items, which result in more work elements, industry experts say.
Increasing production of large pickup trucks and SUVs is another factor causing potential productivity declines.
""The mix change to SUVs and pickups requires more work,"" said Ron Harbour, senior vice president for global automotive manufacturing at consulting firm Oliver Wyman. ""Pickups for example are the most complex vehicles to build these days.""
GM's U.S. vehicle production increased 15.5% to about 1.99 million vehicles in 2018, compared with the 2010 level. GM's U.S. hourly employment remained largely stable or fell slightly during that period, while the number of U.S. salaried jobs rose and eventually exceeded hourly workers.
The company's salaried hiring was part of a recovery from bankruptcy, as it added a finance arm and information technology staff.
GM's salaried employees - engineers, accountants, HR managers, marketers and other staff - nearly doubled to 53,000 in 2018 from 2010, lifting overall U.S. worker numbers by 34% to 103,000 last year. 
NORTH AMERICAN JOB CUTS
Last November, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra ordered 15,000 jobs cut from GM's North American workforce to boost profitability at a time when the company is spending billions to develop next-generation technologies.
GM also said at the time that five North American factories had no future product assignments and could be shut down, including car assembly plants in Lordstown, Ohio; Detroit-Hamtramck, and Oshawa, Ontario.
""These are things we are doing to strengthen our core business,"" Barra said in November. ""We are right-sizing capacity for the realities of the marketplace."" 
GM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are $13 an hour higher than competing nonunion auto plants in southern U.S. states. 
UAW said hourly labor costs equate to just 5% to 6% of the price of a vehicle. 
Reuters arrived at the productivity figures by looking at GM's annual U.S. vehicle production as reported by Wards Intelligence and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes from the automaker's annual reports, and dividing those by GM's total U.S. salaried and hourly employees combined.
However, when GM's U.S. salaried employees, which include workers not directly involved in the manufacturing process, are left out of the equation, the company's productivity per employee rose between 2010 and 2016, while slightly dipping year-over-year in 2017 and 2018.

Costco and other U.S. grocers are slashing prices while investing heavily in stores and online operations to defend their share of the market as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart (N:WMT) expand aggressively.
The membership-only retailer is expanding internationally, opening its first warehouse in China about two months ago, where overcrowding and traffic jams in the neighborhood forced the retailer to limit the number of shoppers in the store.
Costco had record membership sign-ups in Shanghai, partly helped by its social media presence, with over 20,000 registered members, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti told analysts on a post-earnings call.
The company said it plans to open its second Shanghai store in 2021.
Costco's entry into China came amid trade tensions between Beijing and Washington that has burdened U.S. companies with additional tariffs on Chinese imports ranging from footwear, whiskies to televisions. 
""We are working with suppliers daily. We've gone to pretty much every supplier on every item to see what we can do to both reduce cost and figure out how to do that. In some cases, we've reduced our commitments on certain items,"" Galanti said.
Shares of the Issaquah, Washington-based company, which have risen more than 40% so far this year, fell nearly 2% in extended trading after missing comparable-store sales estimates for the reported quarter. 
Comparable-store sales, or those recorded at Costco's e-commerce platform and warehouses open for more than a year, rose 5.1%, excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations. Analysts estimated a 5.25% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In the United States, comparable store sales, excluding fuel, rose 5.2%, also missing the estimate of 5.32%. 
The company's total revenue rose about 7% to $47.50 billion helped by sales of big-ticket items like diamond rings and Kitchen Aid mixers, but fell short of estimates of $47.57 billion.

Excluding one-time items, the Issaquah, Washington-based company earned $2.69 per share, 15 cents above expectations.

Three months ago, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced plans to launch a digital currency in June 2020, in partnership with other members of the Libra Association set up by the U.S. tech giant to manage the project.
When asked whether Apple would follow suit, Cook told Les Echos daily newspaper it was not on his agenda. 
""No. I really think that a currency should stay in the hands of countries. I'm not comfortable with the idea of a private group setting up a competing currency,"" he said. 
""A private company shouldn't be looking to gain power this way.""
Facebook's attempt to drag cryptocurrencies into the mainstream has since met with regulatory and political scepticism globally, with France and Germany pledging to block Libra from operating in Europe.
Facebook's move led analysts to speculate whether other large technology companies such as Apple, which has a range of financial services such as a credit card and phone-based payment system, would similarly launch digital currencies.
That speculation grew in September when an Apple executive told CNN Business that Apple was ""watching"" cryptocurrency.
Cook appeared to put that notion to rest on Thursday. 
""Currency, like defence, needs to stay in the hands of countries, that's the heart of their mission,"" Cook said.

""We elect our representatives to assume their governmental responsibilities. Companies aren't elected and should not be going in this direction.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has ordered a half-dozen e-cigarette companies to turn over sales and advertising data, the federal regulator said on Thursday, in the first sign of a likely probe of their marketing practices. 
The announcement comes the same day the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of confirmed and probable cases of lung illnesses associated with vaping had reached 1,080 in the United States. The CDC also said on Thursday that 18 people have died due to the lung illnesses. 
The FTC order was sent to JUUL Labs Inc, RJ Reynolds Vapor Company, Fontem US Inc, Logic Technology Development LLC (PK:LOGQ), Nu Mark LLC and NJOY LLC, the FTC said in a statement. 
The FTC is seeking annual sales data and information on giveaways, data on product placement and flavors, as well as information on the companies' use of celebrities as internet influencers and marketing on college campuses to sell the electronic smoking devices. The first order was sent about a month ago, an FTC official said. 
 Altria Group  Inc (N:MO), which owns Nu Mark and has a 35% stake in Juul, will comply with the FTC request for information on Nu Mark, a company spokesman said. A Juul spokesman said the company will fully cooperate with the FTC.
A Fontem Ventures spokeswoman said the company has been working with the FTC and will meet the request's deadline. Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) said it is reviewing the request, while Japan Tobacco said it is looking forward to continuing its dialogue with the FTC. 
The FTC order comes a week after a U.S. House of Representatives panel asked Fontem Ventures, Reynolds American, NJOY and Japan Tobacco (T:2914), which owns Logic, to stop all advertising of their products in the United States. Juul had said the same day that it would pull its ads.
The CDC has urged people to stop using e-cigarettes or vaping products, including those containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.

The Trump administration has announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarette products from the market in the United States amid concerns that flavors like mint and mango attract children to the products.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The implosion of office space company WeWork this week is being digested as a lesson for Silicon Valley startups - in what not to do.
WeWork’s parent The We Company on Monday filed to withdraw its initial public offering, a week after the SoftBank-backed startup ousted founder Adam Neumann as its chief executive officer and as its potential IPO valuation dropped as low as $10 billion, from $47 billion in January.
The consensus among venture capital investors at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference and elsewhere was that unlimited power and money were not good for building companies. Some of the problems were blamed on Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), a backer of WeWork that has become one of the most powerful tech investors globally. SoftBank declined to comment on the criticism.
“If a founder is not being responsible - and you know we are fiduciaries at the end of the day to all common shareholders, including employees - we have to do the right thing,” said Neeraj Agrawal, General Partner of Battery Ventures.
He spoke during a TechCrunch session and later told Reuters that founders' power has grown as money has poured into the tech world.
While interest rates remain low, don't expect the flow of money to stop, said David Golden, managing partner at Revolution Ventures. He noted that big checks from investors could inflate values, making it more difficult to raise funds later - another issue highlighted by WeWork's recent valuation struggles.
Big SoftBank investments sometimes unnerve investors, Golden said. ""We call the other early stage investors and say, 'Hey, congratulations, you just got a great markup in that deal. You look really smart.' And to a fault they would say, 'We're screwed because no one's going to buy this company now the price has been set too high.'""
Ned Desmond, the Chief Operating Officer of tech media, data, and events company TechCrunch said competition among big name venture capitalists was fiercer than ever to get into some of the early-stage companies at the conference.
And at the conference, the general mood among the startups was upbeat. Garry Drummond, the CEO of 802 Secure, who was showing off his cyber security hardware on the floor, said he was raising up to $8 million in a series A round and that the WeWork debacle was not having any impact. 
""Nobody's saying no to us,"" he said. 
But the wealth of funding has a third problem, also seen in WeWork, of undermining spending discipline.
“Without that capital you are forced to be a little more disciplined on where you get bang for the buck,"" said Sameet Mehta Managing Partner at Granite Hill Capital Partners. 
We Company, in fact, is slashing spending and divesting secondary businesses as it tries to win back investors' confidence following its botched attempt to go public.

“I wish they weren’t writing quite such big checks,” said Megan Quinn General Partner of Spark Capital about SoftBank during a session at TechCrunch. “It does feel like a lot of companies have raised more capital than they really know what to do with responsibly.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla's (O:TSLA) stock dropped 6% on Thursday after the electric car maker's quarterly deliveries underwhelmed investors already concerned about slowing revenue growth and ongoing losses.
While Tesla delivered a record 97,000 cars, it missed Wall Street estimates of 97,477 vehicles and - more importantly - fell short of 100,000 deliveries that CEO Elon Musk said the company had ""a shot"" at in an email leaked last week.
Tesla has set a target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, which means it must deliver almost 105,000 vehicles in its final quarter to meet the low end of its full-year forecast.
While supporters view Tesla as a growth stock, analysts on average expect the company to report a 7% drop in revenue and a non-GAAP loss of $82 million for the September quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Full-year revenue is seen increasing 15%, far less than Tesla's revenue growth of over 80% in 2018. 
""Given the decelerating revenue growth in 2019 and ongoing gross margin pressure, we expect net losses to exceed the losses in 2018, placing more pressure on what we see as an already expensive valuation,"" Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill wrote in a client note on Thursday.
The Model 3 sedan was meant to propel Tesla to sustainable profitability, but that has yet to happen during the car's two years on the market. While production problems initially hampered sales, some investors now worry about soft demand for the vehicle, as well as waning sales of its higher-end vehicles that are more profitable for Tesla.
Musk has pushed back his target of turning a profit a number of times, most recently targeting the fourth quarter of 2019, with the September quarter to be break-even. 
Many on Wall Street have grown skeptical of Musk's pronouncements, such as his prediction last April that self-driving Tesla taxis would be available in some U.S. markets next year.
Underscoring investors' doubts about Tesla's progress with autonomous-driving technology, a U.S. regulator said on Wednesday it was looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla cars driving themselves to their owners using a recently launched Smart Summon feature.
After slumping in early 2019, Tesla's stock has stabilized since June, but it remains down 31% year to date.
To turn profitable, Musk has put a lid on costs while investing in initiatives such as building a $2 billion factory in Shanghai, as well as planned future models, such as the Model Y SUV and a commercial truck.
Tesla aims to start production at its China factory this month, but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

""The company has yet to prove it can produce its vehicles at scale profitability, and we question management's projections of what the steady state of demand is for the current product lineup and roadmap,"" Cowen analysts wrote in a note to clients.

823,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 05:31PM ET</span>","Chasing Chinese consumers, Tiffany CEO sends top bling abroad","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) is sending more of its priciest jewelry to mainland China to reach consumers kept at home by a weak currency, Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo said on Thursday.
""We follow our customers where they shop,"" Bogliolo said in an interview. 
A lower domestic sales tax has also contributed to double-digit decreases in sales to Chinese tourists in the United States and in other destinations, he said, reflecting an effort by China's government to ""repatriate consumption"" by its citizens.
Bogliolo spoke after a luncheon put on by Boston College's Carroll School of Management. Among the inventory moved abroad, he said, has been high-end jewelry like diamond necklaces valued at $1 million and up. In the past, more of these types of pieces were purchased by wealthy Chinese travelers in New York or Paris, he said. 
Tiffany shares were trading around $89 each on Thursday, well below the closing high of $139.50 they reached in July 2018. New York-based Tiffany is among a group of luxury brands grappling with the U.S.-China trade war, along with lost business due to the protests that have rocked Hong Kong since summer, forcing malls to shut.
The protests have led to a rising number of store closings in the Chinese-controlled territory, Bogliolo said, without giving a precise figure. ""We hope for a positive resolution of the protests, but it's not improving at all,"" he said.
Hong Kong accounts for up to 10% of the estimated $285 billion annual global market for luxury goods. Other brands under pressure include Swatch Group (SIX:UHR), Cartier-owner Richemont and France's Hermes.
In their ongoing trade war, Washington and Beijing have levied punitive duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods, roiling financial markets and threatening global growth.
Bogliolo said he could not forecast how long tensions might continue but said he aimed to ""act on what is in our control.""

The company last month opened an exhibit of its jewelry at Shanghai's Fosun Foundation, for instance, and Bogliolo said he wants to avoid charging Chinese consumers extra to cover the costs of tariffs on jewelry it imports into the country.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 05:29PM ET</span>",Fighting GM puts a financial squeeze on striking union workers,"By Bryan Woolston
BOWLING GREEN, Ky. - (Reuters) - While striking workers at General Motors Co's U.S. auto plants continue walking picket lines for a third week to demand better pay and benefits, the financial pressure has mounted for union members like Frank Lee.
Analysts estimate that GM could lose $1 billion from the labor dispute that began on Sept. 16 and is now the longest nationwide strike at the automaker since 1970. For GM, which had $24 billion in cash and marketable securities as of June 30, that cost is likely manageable. 
But it's a different story for some strikers.
Frank Lee, a United Auto Workers union member at GM's Corvette assembly plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is fending off bill collectors.
“Until yesterday, I was negative in my bank account,"" said Lee. ""I called the bank to try and stop an insurance payment from coming out. I failed to do that; it was too late.” 
Adding to the difficulty of his situation, union regulations prohibit Lee from seeking outside employment while on strike. If he finds another job, or supplements the weekly $250 strike pay, he will lose the benefits with the union. 
Negotiators for the United Auto Workers and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) continued talking on Wednesday, with no word on when a deal would be agreed that would get the automaker's U.S. assembly lines rolling again. 
GM and the UAW said they traded what were described as comprehensive proposals on Tuesday. The union rejected GM's plan, saying it fell short on wages, healthcare, job security and the treatment of temporary workers, which has become a central issue for the UAW.
Lee is a temporary worker who was hired at the Bowling Green plant three years ago. The 47-year-old has trained to work at more than 30 positions within the assembly plant. 
But even after three years on the job, Lee does not qualify for the same pay and benefits as full-time UAW workers, who earn $7 to $14 an hour more than temporary workers in the same factories. 
Lee lives with his son, Isiah, in a trailer home thirty miles south of the Bowling Green plant. 
“Before the strike even happened, the money I make as a temporary [employee] is week to week; paycheck comes in, paychecks go out, and we barely survive,” said Lee, making his comments in between phone calls with bill collectors.
On Friday, union members at GM will mark their second payday without a check. 
“I’ve got bills that are behind already. I’ve got bill collectors; they’re already calling me,” Lee said.  “There’s a stack of bills that seemed to have doubled. Rent is due. I don’t know where that money is coming from.” 
Lee has called his credit card providers, explaining that paying rent and buying groceries would need to take priority. 
The UAW is working with charities in communities affected by the strike to get additional help for strikers, a union spokesman said. 
Lee said financial pressure had increased for him not because of the strike but due to the way General Motors treats temporary employees. He had believed his temporary position would lead to a job with full pay and benefits.
Despite the stress and financial hardship, Lee finds inspiration in his son, Isiah. 
“I’m in this for my son, and we are survivors,” he said. “We will get through this.”
At the bargaining tables in Detroit, the issue of how temporary employees are treated is based on the union's principle that workers at the same plant should get similar wages for similar work. 
High absenteeism poses a problem for GM management as the company tends to rely on temporary workers to fill in for missing full time workers.
The union has urged GM to give temporary workers a pay rise and an easier path to jobs at full UAW pay and benefits. GM pays temporary workers between $15.78 and $22 an hour depending on when they were hired, according to a summary of the now expired contract. Full time assembly workers can earn a base pay of nearly $30 an hour or more.
GM management has talked up the $63 hourly average labor costs at its U.S. operations, which is higher than the average $50 an hour paid by Asian and European automakers at their non-union auto factories in the United States. 

Non-union plants tend to employ a much higher number of temporary workers, who can be laid off or hired back more quickly as demand ebbs and flows.

The S&P 500 advanced 0.8%. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.47%, and the Nasdaq Composite won a relatively strong 1.12% gain. The gains were welcome after the Dow lost 838 points in the prior two days, with the S&P 500 giving up 89 points and the Nasdaq 214.
The S&P 500 and Dow finished just below their highs of the day. The Nasdaq closed at its high. 
 
The upside of the rally was heavy buying in the last half hour of the day. The Dow moved up more than 100 points to finish with a 122-point gain.
The rally was powered by big technology stocks, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
The five combined to contribute nearly 40% of the Nasdaq 100 index's gain of nearly 88 points.
In addition, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), due to report earnings after the close, was up 1.4%. But the shares were 1.1% lower after hours after the company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share, and sales growth on a comparable-store basis was lower than expected.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Apple, Visa (NYSE:V) and Microsoft were responsible for 101 points of the Dow's 122-point gain.
The market seemed to weather weakness in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), whose September deliveries missed expectations.
As welcome as Thursday's rally was, Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department could scuttle things quickly if the numbers are weak. Solid job growth will probably set off a big day.
 
Uncertainty in the market came early in the day from the Institute for Supply Management, whose September report for the non-manufacturing economy showed the slowest growth in three years.
The ISM report set off a selloff, with the Dow down as many as 335 points before recovering in a big way. The report also expanded speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut its key rate at its meeting at the end of October.

(Reuters) - Wall Street stocks climbed on Thursday after data showing U.S. services-sector activity at a three-year low fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to stem a wider economic downturn.
Microsoft (O:MSFT) rose 1.2% and Facebook (O:FB) added 2.7%, with the two contributing more than any other companies to the S&P 500's gain.
The market dropped after the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 52.6 in September, the lowest since August 2016.
That added to fears sparked on Tuesday when a report showed U.S. factory activity contracted to its lowest level in more than a decade, as well as data on Wednesday showing private payrolls growth in August was not as strong as previously estimated. 
Stock prices bounced back from the dour economic data as bets on a third U.S. rate cut this year at Fed's October policy meeting surged to 90% from 40%, according to CME Group's Fed Watch tool. 
""The degradation of the data, especially the non-manufacturing data, kind of pushes the Fed to another cut,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. 
Traders are again expecting at least two more rate reductions by the end of 2019, which they had abandoned after the central bank described each of its last two rate cuts as a ""mid-cycle adjustment."" [MMT/]
""We are at a critical point. Global growth is slowing and U.S. growth is decelerating because of trade disputes and uncertainty caused by trade policy,"" said Ben Phillips, chief investment officer at EventShares. ""But the market loves easy money, and when it gets a whiff of it, it gets high.""

The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 1.12% to end the session at 7,872.27.
Over the past 12 months, the S&P 500 is down about 0.5%.
PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) on Thursday rose 3% after beating quarterly expectations as higher advertising and new low-calorie versions of Gatorade boosted demand for its beverages in North America.
Its shares pushed the S&P consumer staples index (SPLRCS) 0.7% higher. All of the 11 major sectors rose, led by a 1.3% rise in the energy index (SPNY). 
Corona maker Constellation Brands Inc (N:STZ) fell 6.1% after it took an $839 million markdown in the value of its investment in pot firm Canopy Growth (TO:WEED) during the quarter.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.56-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 9 new 52-week highs and 20 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 6 new highs and 109 new lows.

829,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 04:13PM ET</span>",There's a Disconnect in the Latest Auto Sales Figures,"(Bloomberg) -- A key figure used for decades to sum up the state of the auto market looked wildly out of step with carmakers’ own sales reports this week, and the dissonance could continue for months to come.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate, or SAAR, attempts to translate the level of demand for new cars and trucks each month into a figure that gives investors and economists a sense of how the whole year may shake out. On Tuesday, Japan’s three largest automakers posted double-digit percentage drops, but the industry ended up registering a relatively strong SAAR of 17.2 million.
The reasons for the disconnect are complicated. The statistical adjustments used to smooth out month-to-month swings based on factors such as the time of year and number of selling days provided a big boost to the September SAAR. Another issue is that General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV no longer publicly report monthly U.S. sales, potentially leading to more months where the industry sales rate looks much different than figures released by those companies still publicly posting results.
For Haig Stoddard, an analyst at Ward’s Automotive Group, which publishes a SAAR on a monthly basis, the confusion over September’s figure captured why the measure was never perfect to begin with. Carmakers have long managed to distort the number by boosting incentives or deliveries to car-rental fleets, as they have this year.
“There’s just too much noise in the numbers to come up with the perfect seasonally adjusted rate,” said Stoddard, whose firm continues to privately collect sales data from the Detroit Three. “You should never put too much emphasis on a one-month result.”
GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler combined sell almost half of the vehicles in the U.S. They’re not the only ones sitting out public reporting of monthly sales -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. has avoided the practice for years.
Even before the Detroit Three switched to only putting out figures publicly every quarter, the SAAR was already flawed, said Maryann Keller, a longtime industry watcher and consultant.
“It’s easy for car companies to play games and manipulate the market with incentives,” she said. “The SAAR isn’t as good a measure as an economic indicator as it was years ago because of the manipulation of the market.”"
830,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 04:03PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. It's Jobs Friday!
Labor market numbers over the past few days have done little to instill confidence. The private sector jobs growth for September fell short of estimates. Initial jobless claims climbed to a one-year high. But it could all turn around on Friday, with the release of nonfarm payrolls at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 PM GMT.)
Economists forecast that the U.S. economy created about 140,000 jobs in last month, up from 130,000 in August, while the unemployment rate  is expected to remain steady at 3.7%.
Some on Wall Street, however, are expecting a lower nonfarm payroll print and have pointed fingers at slowing employment growth in the services sector.
“We forecast a below-trend 125,000 increase in nonfarm payroll employment during September, likely driven by another weak month of service employment growth,” Nomura said in a recent email.
Wage growth, meanwhile, is expected to slow to a pace of 0.3% from 0.4% a month earlier, though remain steady at 3.2% year on year.
Trade data will also be focus, with the U.S. trade deficit expected to have widened to $54.50 billion in August from 54 billion in July.
2. Oil Rig Count Rolls In 
The latest rig count data due Friday will offer clues on the pace of domestic crude production, which has remained at near-record highs at 12.4 million barrels a day.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 6 to 713.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude oil prices fell 19 cents to settle at $52.45 on Thursday amid ongoing fears that slowing global economic growth will weigh on oil demand.
3. Fed's Powell Takes to the Stage
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver opening remarks at the Fed Listens event in Washington, where the topic will be “Perspectives on Maximum Employment and Price Stability.”
The speech comes as the odds of an October Fed rate cut have topped 90%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, following a spate of underwhelming U.S. economic data, including a lower-than-expected non-manufacturing ISM report on Thursday.
""The risk raised by the downside in today's ISM non-manufacturing report is that the service sector may be decelerating, pointing to a potential inflection in what has been to-date one of the key pillars of US economic growth,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note."

832,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 02:56PM ET</span>",Brexit raises stakes for Britain in aircraft trade war,"By Tim Hepher
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. tariffs on European goods have plunged Britain into a trade war between the European Union and United States just as it plans to leave the 28-nation bloc, infuriating Scotch whisky makers and handing it a dilemma over thousands of Airbus (PA:AIR) jobs.
The United States has pledged tariffs on goods worth $7.5 billion a year in a dispute over Airbus subsidies from Oct. 18, days before Britain's planned end-October exit. And the EU is due to hit back in a parallel case concluding next spring.
Britain - which builds wings for Airbus jets and has been found to subsidize the jetmaker alongside France, Germany and Spain - said it was seeking confirmation from the WTO that it had obeyed its rulings and should not be subject to tariffs.
Barring a settlement or an end to seven years of argument over whether Europe has complied with earlier WTO findings - neither of which looks imminent, according to trade sources - tariffs could start to bite as Britain plans to leave the EU.
The timing rankles with some executives at firms in other industries hit by the new U.S. tariffs, compounding their frustration at having to pay for the misdeeds of plane giants.
""It throws up enormous uncertainty. With that realignment of allegiances going on, it is surprising that something as uniquely geographical as Scotch whisky is targeted by the Americans,"" said Edward Odim, managing director of Aceo Ltd, an independent Scotch whisky supplier.
""It is quite clear that Britain's position in the world is highly ambiguous at the moment. If we are going to be out of Europe, what is the purpose of it?"" he said, adding the 25% tariffs would ""really hurt.""
Technically, the U.S. case against the EU over Airbus aid cites Britain and others as separate parties. But the spat is widely viewed as a confrontation between trade superpowers, Washington and Brussels, that could decide the WTO's future.
RETALIATE OR NEGOTIATE?
Britain faces an even starker dilemma next year when it must decide whether to join the EU in imposing counter-tariffs on U.S. goods over subsidies paid to  Boeing Co  (N:BA), trade experts said. The WTO says both sides have been at fault.
The WTO is expected to allow the EU to impose tariffs in around April at a time when Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government expects to negotiate a trade deal with Washington.
Trade sources say Britain could continue to support the EU over Airbus and punish U.S. imports at the risk of upsetting the post-Brexit trade talks with Washington. Or it could reject the offer to back Airbus with tariffs and upset a big employer.
The decision echoes a broader discomfort facing Britain as it chooses between European neighbors or the United States on a range of existing disagreements from access to contracts for Chinese telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] to the fate of a nuclear deal with Iran.
The Scottish government said U.S. tariffs on goods like whisky indicated the United Kingdom could not offset damage from Brexit by doing a trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump.
But Brexit supporters insist the aircraft row is what Britain needs to find a voice on trade and boost its membership of the WTO, where EU states are mainly represented by Brussels.
""It's another great reason for us to leave the EU and take a seat back at the WTO so we can shape events,"" said Richard Tice, a businessman and European parliamentarian for the Brexit Party.
The UK government had no comment on how Britain would handle the aircraft dispute after Brexit, but said a tariff war would be in nobody's interest.
Drawing back from imposing tariffs on the United States after 15 years of trench warfare with Boeing at the WTO would upset Airbus which has threatened to review long-term UK investments after Brexit, several industry sources said.
Germany, Spain and non-EU Korea, Japan and even the United States are potential rivals for future wing work in the 2030s -the basic technology for which is already under development.
Airbus, which has 14,000 jobs in Britain, declined comment.
""Britain won't refuse to support its European partners in Airbus and will stay firmly together,"" predicted aerospace analyst Howard Wheeldon. ""The UK government has too much to lose as Airbus is a key investor."""

""This is relatively in line or above other battle royale games, or mobile games that have stemmed from established IP on console,"" Parker said. ""We continue to believe that the game has significant potential as a premium mobile game experience, and view initial datapoints as positive relative to our expectations of $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2019.""
But Activision is not the only player raking in the plaudits for the explosive start of the mobile version of game. Tencent, which owns a stake in Activision, developed the mobile version of the game and oversees distribution for South Korea. Activision publishes ""Call of Duty: Mobile"" in regions including the U.S., Europe and Latin America.
But not everyone on Wall Street is convinced the game will be the panacea for Activision, which has been facing stiff competition from free-to-play battle royal games like ""Fornite.""
Bernstein on Wednesday downgraded Activision to underperfom from market perform, warning that the market was ""paying too much for the hype"" surrounding ""Call of Duty: Mobile"" and ""World of Warcraft Classic.""
""We cannot reconcile the current stock price with the company’s risk-adjusted fundamentals,"" said Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger.
Activision is up 16% so far this year and has an average price target of $57, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com."

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the two giants can't agree on whether Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) can sell ""a substantial amount"" of advertising on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) content streamed to HD TVs through Fire TV devices.

If there's no agreement, Disney content may not be available from Fire TV. That could include ESPN, ABC network programming, Disney Channel program plus access to Disney's ad-free Disney+ streaming service, set to launch on Nov. 12.


Fire TV is the second-largest distributor of streaming content now with a 29% share, behind Roku's 41%. Fire TV offers set-top boxes or the Fire TV stick, which is a HDMI plug-in stick. Users can stream content to their TVs from a variety of apps, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Sling TV and a number of TV networks.


  Roku   (NASDAQ:ROKU), Fire TV and others have become increasingly important hubs for reaching viewers who stream media. Increasingly, the services are playing the role cable companies have played in traditional TV.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 01:36PM ET</span>",Vivendi sues Mediaset in Italy over pan-European plan,"MILAN (Reuters) - French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) has filed a lawsuit against Italian broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), seeking to invalidate the decisions of a shareholder meeting that last month approved a corporate overhaul, Mediaset said on Thursday.
Vivendi, led by tycoon Vincent Bollore, has been a hostile Mediaset shareholder since the two sides fell out in 2016 over an aborted pay-TV deal.
After the failed pay-TV sale, the French group built a 29% stake in Mediaset - a holding that the Italian group considers illegitimate. The two sides have been in a legal war ever since.
Milan-based Mediaset, which is controlled by the family of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, has since set up a plan to merge with its Spanish subsidiary Mediaset Espana (MC:TL5) under a Dutch holding company to help create a pan-European player.
Vivendi, which has plans of its own to become a European media powerhouse, opposes the ongoing overhaul saying the new entity's governance strengthens the grip the Berlusconis have on the group.
It has already brought legal proceedings against Mediaset's plan in Spain and in the Netherlands.
In a statement on Thursday, Mediaset said it had been notified that a lawsuit had now been filed in Italy too, adding that a court hearing had been scheduled for Jan. 10, 2020.
It said Vivendi was also seeking unspecified damages from Mediaset and the Berlusconi family holding company, Fininvest, saying their actions had hurt the value of its Mediaset stake.
Mediaset's merger plan was approved by a Sept. 4 shareholder meeting where Vivendi was allowed to vote only with the 9.99% Mediaset stake it owns directly - not enough to block the deal on its own.
Two-thirds of Vivendi's stake in Mediaset is held through an arms-length trust which Mediaset prevented from participating in the Sept. 4 meeting."

(Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc (N:STZ) racked up millions of dollars in losses from its investment in Canadian pot company Canopy Growth, pushing the maker of Corona and Modelo beers into a quarterly loss and sending its shares down as much as 8%.
The brewer has invested over $4 billion in Canopy (TO:WEED), making it one of the first major alcohol producers looking to cash in on the proposed legalization of recreational weed in several countries.
However, the pot producer has been reporting losses as it invests in equipment, research and marketing, warning in August that it would need another three to five years to turn profitable.
""Clearly, the Canopy investment has not turned out how they would have liked it to so far,"" said William O' Neil analyst Andrew Kessner.
""They knew the investment was going to be a drag for a while... but I think what has changed since then is that it is kind of clear now that Canopy's runway to profitability... is much longer than Constellation anticipated.""
Net loss attributable to Constellation was $525.2 million in the second quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with a profit of $1.15 billion a year earlier, due to $484.4 million in losses from the Canopy investment.
Constellation said it also marked down $839 million in value of its investment in Canopy during the quarter.
The brewer also cut its fiscal 2020 earnings per share on a reported basis to 55 cents to 75 cents from $4.95 to $5.25, but raised its adjusted profit forecast that excludes the costs related to Canopy investments to $9 to $9.20 from the previous range of $8.65 to $8.95.
Constellation's loss from Canopy overshadowed a better-than-expected quarterly adjusted profit that was driven by summer demand for its Modelo Especial and Corona beers.
The company's legacy business has been growing steadily as Constellation adds Mexican and craft beers to its portfolio, helping cushion the impact from waning beer demand across the globe.
Sales of beers, its biggest business, rose about 7.4% to $1.64 billion, lifting overall sales about 2%. 

Excluding items, Constellation earned $2.72 per share, above analysts' estimate of $2.60, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 01:16PM ET</span>","Some LSE investors call on Hong Kong exchange to up bid by 20%, add cash","By Sinead Cruise and Clara Denina
LONDON (Reuters) - Some  London Stock Exchange  investors have told Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) that any bid must contain more cash and be up to 20% higher to persuade them to engage, three shareholders and a banking source close to the deal said.
The three investors, who own a combined 3% of LSE, said HKEX has been lobbying them to back a potential $39 billion cash and share offer for the London exchange after it made a surprise approach last month.
LSE (L:LSE) quickly rejected HKEX's initial approach, saying it faced regulatory hurdles and did not make strategic sense.
The London exchange has already agreed a separate $27billion deal to buy data provider Refinitiv, in which professional information company and Reuters News parent ThomsonReuters holds a 45% stake.
HKEX now has until Oct. 9 to make a formal bid or walkaway, and its executives have been meeting LSE's top shareholders to garner their support.
Guy de Blonay, manager of the Jupiter FinancialOpportunities Fund, who met with HKEX co-president Romnesh Lamba, said HKEX would have to increase the per share price to between 90 and 100 pounds, up from the initial approach of around 83.61 pounds for shareholders to take it seriously.
De Blonay said it would also need to increase the cash component. The initial proposal was around 25% cash, with the rest in HKEX stock.
A banking source close to the deal said that 90 to 100pounds was 'what most investors asked for'. The Asian exchange has been looking for financing to see if it can meet a higher bid price, the source close to the deal said.
A bid in this range could prompt the LSE board to ask for an extension to the October deadline, De Blonay said, and move HKEX towards creating a powerhouse spanning Asia, Europe and the United States and better able to compete with U.S. rivals.
""(HKEX Chief Executive) Charles Li knows this is a one-off opportunity, and I would expect him to carry on fighting,"" deBlonay said, pointing to considerable political hurdles and a possible backlash among HKEX's own shareholders that could still scupper a higher recommended bid.
Two other LSE shareholders told Reuters they too expected HKEX to lift the headline price of its offer. The investors, who declined to be named, were however skeptical that a deal would pass regulatory muster, saying a bigger price-tag may still not be enough to land Li his prize.
HKEX declined to comment on its plans on Thursday. LSE also declined to comment.
Reuters was not able to ascertain the views of some of LSE's largest shareholders, including those who also hold a stake in the Asian bourse.
Li has been vocal in highlighting the long-term benefits of his deal versus the ""short-term"" earnings boost of the LSE-Refinitiv tie-up.
Li, a former offshore oil worker, lawyer, journalist and investment banker, has overseen HKEX's transformation into the world's largest capital-raising venue in five of the past 10years.
Last week Li said that his team had been working on a takeover approach for a long time, but uncertainty aroundBritain's exit from the European Union had any delayed action until the LSE announced its plan to buy Refinitiv in August.
The LSE board has so far stood by its deal with Refinitiv, which the HKEX proposal requires its London rival to abandon.
REGULATION
HKEX's proposed deal is widely expected to draw regulatory scrutiny in Britain, Italy and the United States, which is locked in a trade war with China, if it proceeds.
Several ""big bang"" exchange mergers have failed in recent years, opposed by politicians and regulators and the LSE bid has raised concerns that China would have undue influence because some HKEX board members are appointed by Hong Kong's government.
Li has said he is open to review governance.
As it gears up to push ahead with an offer, HKEX's Lamba has met investors and hedge funds in the United States over the past two weeks, two sources said.
It has also added HSBC and UBS to its financing advisory line-up over the past two weeks, regulatory filings show.
The HKEX deal has been orchestrated with the help of U.S. advisory firm Moelis, whose lead banker Caroline Silver is one of the most prominent exchange bankers."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Thursday it has made ""significant progress"" in contract talks with  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), even as a strike at General Motors Co (N:GM) is in its third week.
The UAW agreed to extend contracts with Ford and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) as it focused first on GM. About 48,000 UAW members at GM went on strike on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker’s profit and protection of healthcare benefits. [nL2N2680Z7]
JP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated in a research note this week the strike has cost GM over $1 billion but it may be able to recover some lost profit in the fourth quarter. He said GM is losing $82 million a day.
GM shares are down nearly 12% since the strike began.
LMC automotive estimated on Thursday GM has lost production of 118,000 vehicles through Oct. 2. But GM has 81 days' supply of vehicles in stock for the United States, and 90 days' worth of Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks.
GM said earlier this week the strike by U.S. workers forced it to halt production at its pickup and transmission plants in Silao, Mexico, resulting in temporary layoffs of 6,000 workers. [nL2N26M1C7]
The UAW on Tuesday rejected a new comprehensive offer from GM and the sides have been exchanging counterproposals over the last few days.
The statements on ""comprehensive proposals"" indicate the talks have shifted into a higher gear as the dispute is taking a toll on both the automaker and striking UAW workers, whose individual compensation of $250 a week from the union strike fund is a fraction of their normal pay.
Both sides face broader risks should the U.S. economy slow down. Data released on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in September to its weakest level in more than a decade. Stocks fell broadly on the report. [nL3N26M3M6]
The strike had previously forced GM to lay off at least 2,000 Canadian workers and temporarily close an engine plant in Mexico. Many suppliers have halted or scaled back some operations.
The UAW said 18 out of 20 Ford subcommittees have reached tentative agreements or made significant progress. Ford said it is focused on ""reaching a fair agreement with the UAW that allows the company to be more competitive so we can continue to preserve and protect good-paying manufacturing jobs."""

843,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 12:29PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Italy in talks with EU over Monte dei Paschi bad loan spin-off - source,"By Stefano Bernabei and Valentina Za
ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - Italy is in talks with the European Commission over a plan to rid state-owned Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) of around two thirds of its soured loans to pave the way for a sale of the bank, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said.
Hurt by a pile of problem debts and a derivatives scandal, Monte dei Paschi was for years at the forefront of Italy's banking crisis until a bailout in 2017, which handed the state a 68% stake in the world's oldest lender.
Even after shedding around 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in problem loans in recent years, Monte dei Paschi had 16 billion euros of soured debts, or 16% of total loans, at the end of June. 
The source said that to become a merger candidate, the bank would need to lower that ratio to about 5%, a level that has become a benchmark for lenders seeking to clean up their balance sheets.
To reach that goal, the plan under discussion would see Monte dei Paschi spin off some 10 billion euros in impaired loans into a separate company that would then be merged with state-owned bad loan manager AMCO, the source said.
Monte dei Paschi and AMCO declined to comment. The EU Commission was not immediately available for comment.
FRAGILE 
Heavily exposed to Italy's public debt mountain, the country's banks are also contending with a stagnant economy and a fractious political system, which have increased their funding costs and dented their already weak profitability.
To win a green light for Monte dei Paschi's 2017 bailout from European Union competition authorities, Italy had to agree to a tough restructuring plan for the bank and committed to exit its capital in 2021 at the latest.
The Treasury must inform Brussels of its proposed exit strategy by the end of this year.
Several people familiar with the matter have told Reuters Monte dei Paschi's soured loan burden stands in the way of finding a buyer for the bank.
The bad loan spin-off plan currently under discussion would allow the bank to offload risky assets without incurring the losses it may face if it were to sell them on the market.
To overcome concerns the plan may breach EU rules on state aid, the Rome government is arguing that tougher rules on loan loss provisions introduced by the European Central Bank after the approval of Monte dei Paschi's restructuring plan make it hard for the bank to stick to its commitments and for the Treasury to liquidate its stake, the source said. 
AMCO, led by former UniCredit (MI:CRDI) executive Marina Natale, has started raising funding on international markets to face its growing commitments. 

Fitch Ratings estimates that AMCO could be managing 30-35 billion euros in problem loans by mid-2020, from 20.6 billion at present, as it continues to take on soured debt from struggling lenders.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 12:23PM ET</span>",Atlantia's request for overhaul of Alitalia plan draws government anger,"ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - Benetton-led  Atlantia  SpA (MI:ATL) raised government hackles on Thursday after saying it would not be able to press ahead with plans to rescue flagship carrier Alitalia as long as the risk of losing its motorway concessions hung over it.
Atlantia, which runs Italian motorway group Autostrade per l'Italia, is part of a group of investors led by the Italian railways backing a possible rescue of the loss-making airline.
But on Thursday a source close to the matter said Atlantia had sent a letter to Italy's Industry ministry asking it to radically revise its Alitalia plan if talks were to go ahead.
""On Alitalia we won't give in to blackmail from anyone,"" Industry Deputy Minister Stefano Buffagni said on the sidelines of a conference, when asked about the letter.
In the letter Atlantia managers said the continuing risk of losing the motorway concessions meant the company would not be able to invest in Alitalia due to concerns about resources and the safeguard of its shareholders.
Atlantia has previously said it is ready to invest in the airline with Italian railways and U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) providing the plan guaranteed stable returns in the long term.
The letter - parts of which were published on the website of Italian daily La Repubblica on Thursday and confirmed by the source close to the matter - said Atlantia's advisers had given a negative opinion on the Alitalia rescue deal.
""I think we all need to work together to make things work well,"" Buffagni, a leading figure in the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, said.
The ruling coalition 5-Star has been campaigning for almost a year to scrap the Benetton group's concession, blaming Atlantia for a bridge collapse that killed 43 people on its toll network in Genoa last August.

Atlantia, which makes around one-third of its core earnings from its Italian motorway business, denies accusations it neglected maintenance on the bridge.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) has hired Stephanie Sze as a global co-head of its sellside mergers and acquisitions (M&A) group, based in New York, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
In her new role, Sze will specialize in advising clients looking to sell companies and assets, such as private equity firms cashing out on their holdings. These assignments are coveted by investment banks, because the chances of getting paid for a successful deal are higher when advising the acquisition target than when advising a perspective acquirer that may lose out to another bidder.
Sze previously worked at  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC), where she was a managing director within the exclusive sales group of its M&A practice for more than 11 years. She will report to Credit Suisse’s global co-heads of M&A, Robin Rankin and Greg Weinberger, and will be based in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - When the little known Ken Murphy takes over next year as CEO of  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Britain's biggest retailer, he will inherit something current boss Dave Lewis did not have the luxury of when he joined in 2014 - a strategy and a stable business.
But the 52-year-old veteran of healthcare retailing will still have to work hard for his $1.7 million a year salary, with Britain facing a potentially disruptive exit from the European Union and German discounters Aldi and Lidl grabbing market share from the country's top supermarket chains.
When former  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) executive Lewis became CEO of Tesco on Sept. 1, 2014, the supermarket group was already reeling from a dramatic downturn in trading. Three weeks later, an accounting scandal plunged it into the biggest crisis in its history.
Fast forward five years and Lewis, 54, has declared Tesco's turnaround complete. He will hand over to Murphy, a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA), next summer.
""I don't think we had a strategy in September 2014,"" Lewis told reporters when reflecting on his arrival at Tesco.
Jason Tarry, now Tesco's UK and Ireland CEO, said the strategy then was ""survival"".
Lewis said Murphy, an Irish national, would be in a much better place because he would inherit a ""super clear strategy"" that he could evolve.
Lewis' strategy has focused on differentiating the Tesco brand from competitors, reducing costs and generating cash, improving profit margins, maximizing value from property and driving innovation.
He has also pursued growth by buying wholesaler Booker, forming a global purchasing alliance with  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and launching discount format Jack's.
""The good thing is - all the heavy lifting of the turnaround and getting us back financially secure and stable again has been done and so now it's much more in terms of investment choices that he'll have to make,"" said Lewis.
CHOICES
Analysts say those choices revolve around taking the fight on prices to Aldi and Lidl who have been gobbling up market share, as well as investment in technology, online grocery capacity, convenience stores, Booker and overseas ventures.
Murphy, a qualified accountant who has studied at Harvard, will also have to decide if excess cash should be returned to shareholders.
Alasdair McKinnon, lead fund manager of Tesco shareholder, the Scottish Investment Trust, said Murphy was ""potentially well placed to deliver the next stage of Tesco’s transformation.""
HSBC analyst Andrew Porteous said Murphy was ""a strong choice"" whose key challenge was to drive sales growth.
But Murphy's appointment has left others puzzled.
""Walgreens-Boots has material strategic challenges in the U.S. and the UK. What is it about Ken's track record there that impressed the board?"" asked Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.
Murphy led the turnaround of drugs wholesale and retail group Alliance UniChem in Italy, then shared the top operations job at health and beauty business Boots UK & Ireland before becoming executive vice president, chief commercial officer and president of global brands at Walgreens Boots Alliance.
His appointment came in a big week for UK grocery sector moves. On Tuesday, John Rogers, the boss of Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) Argos business who was seen as the favorite to succeed Mike Coupe as Sainsbury's CEO, quit to become finance chief of advertising group WPP (LON:WPP), while Waitrose [JLPLC.UL] boss Rob Collins said he would step down next year.
Lewis has no doubt Murphy, who began his retail career helping in his father's shop at the age of 15, will succeed, dismissing his lack of major UK grocery retailing experience as an irrelevance.
""What Ken needs to have and I do know him and I do believe he has it is - have you got a strategic perspective? Do you understand brand, do you understand the customer? Have you got the interpersonal skills to engage with 450,000 people,""
His advice to Murphy - ""use his ears more than his mouth""."

The total settlement amount might rise to $800 million, depending on how many claimants choose to participate, according to the law firm Eglet Adams.
""Our goal has always been to resolve these matters so our community and the victims and their families can move forward in the healing process.

TORONTO (Reuters) -  RBC  Capital Markets has been fined $5 million (C$6.7 million) by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission for failures that resulted in unlawful trades and other violations between at least late 2011 and May 2017.
Between December 2011 and October 2015, RBC Capital Markets (RBCCM), a unit of Canada's biggest lender, Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY), engaged in at least 385 non-competitive, fictitious or unlawful trades, the CFTC said in a statement on its website https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8034-19 on Tuesday. 
The CFTC said 217 of the trades took place after the entry of a consent order in December 2014 of a CFTC enforcement action against RBC for fictitious transactions. 
""The order finds that RBCCM had actual notice of the December 2014 injunction against RBC prohibiting wash trading, yet the Wash EFPs (exchange for physical) continued at RBCCM,"" according to the statement. 
In a wash trade, an investor simultaneously buys and sells the same financial instruments, creating misleading activity. An exchange for physical is an agreement to trade a futures contract for the underlying asset. 
""This matter has been resolved and we continue to remain committed to complying with regulatory requirements,"" a spokeswoman for RBC said by email on Thursday. ""We have enacted a number of measures to prevent this issue from recurring, including improved surveillance and additional training.""
Those involved believed such moves were allowed, and a compliance officer did not respond to inquiries on whether the trades were appropriate until at least May 2015, according to CFTC.
And while RBCCM reported the trades to the CFTC shortly before disclosing them in its 2015 compliance report, it failed to respond fully and on time to document requests and subpoenas from CFTC staff, the regulator said. RBCCM also tried to dissuade the regulator's staff from examining RBC's role in the trades. 

The CFTC also found RBCCM, which was responsible for handling RBC's futures transactions in the United States, failed to ""adequately implement a reasonable supervisory system overseeing its futures transactions.""

850,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 10:36AM ET</span>",India realty company boss arrested in PMC co-operative bank scam case,"By Rajendra Jadhav
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India arrested the head of a bankrupt realty company on Thursday after lender Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) accused executives of partaking in a ""criminal conspiracy"" involving forged audit reports that cost the bank some 43.55 billion rupees ($616.5 million).
In the latest case to roil India's banking sector, PMC made a police complaint accusing its own executives and officials at Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) of misleading the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from 2008 to August 2019 by forging the audits to hide the fact that big accounts had become non-performing assets.
The RBI last week took charge of the bank and suspended Managing Director Joy Thomas and the bank's board after uncovering lending irregularities. PMC has been barred from renewing, or granting any loans, or making investments without the RBI's prior approval.
Depositors have been informed they can only withdraw a maximum of 10,000 rupees ($140) from their PMC accounts over the next six months. On Tuesday, dozens of account holders gathered outside an RBI office in Mumbai to protest against the curbs and demand that the central bank and government intervene to release their funds.
On Thursday evening, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police arrested HDIL's chairman Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan as well as his son Sarang Wadhawan, the bank's vice chairman, Mumbai Police spokesperson Pranaya Ashok told Reuters. He declined to provide information about the charges against them.
Reuters was not immediately able to contact the two Wadhawans. HDIL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the past two years, India's troubled banking sector has been rocked by a multibillion-dollar fraud at a state-run lender, the collapse of a major infrastructure lender, bad loan issues at state-run banks and a liquidity squeeze that has hit shadow lenders.
Indian media outlets on Sunday reported that PMC's exposure to HDIL stood at 65 billion rupees, which accounts for 73% of its overall 88.8 billion loan book. That is well above the RBI's permissible exposure levels to a single entity.
PMC could not immediately be reached for comment on the estimate.
More than two dozen co-operative banks are now under RBI administration. PMC, among the top five co-operative banks in the country with deposits of 116.2 billion rupees as of March 31, is by far the largest.
India has more than 1,500 small urban co-operative banks that typically service small local communities in certain districts or states. Depositors at co-operative banks are in a relatively higher risk zone, but tens of thousands still bank with these lenders as they typically offer better interest rates on deposits."

The Dow dipped 0.1%, by 09:40 AM ET (13:40 GMT), while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were little changed.
Wall Street's main indexes slid 3% in the previous two sessions after weak employment and manufacturing data suggested that the U.S.-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the U.S. economy.
The ISM's non-manufacturing activity index is forecast to slow to 55 in September, down from 56.4 in August. The report is coming ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for September, which will be closely watched for signs of strength in the economy.
""We are really counting on the consumer to kind of carry us through here amid the slow patch in manufacturing,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Brown said a rebound in the services sector in August from its weakest level in nearly three years was indicative of the health of the overall economy, but ""markets are going to be pretty sensitive to any surprise on the downside.""
Data earlier Thursday showed that initial jobless claims rose marginally last week, suggesting the labor market remains strong even as employers are becoming more cautious about hiring workers.
Meanwhile, shares in Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) were higher after it beat quarterly revenue and profit estimates, as ramped up advertising and new low calorie versions of Gatorade boosted demand for its beverages in North America.
Brewer Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) fell despite raiseing its full-year adjusted profit forecast. It beat Wall Street estimates for second quarter profit on the back of strong summer demand for Corona and Modelo beers, but shares fell after it said it took a $839 million write down in the value of its investment in pot firm Canopy Growth (TO:WEED) during the quarter.
Discount wholesaler Costco (NASDAQ:COST) was set to report after the close.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3) has delayed its expected timeline for the closing of a major deal with Boeing (N:BA) to early 2020, according to a securities filing on Thursday.
Previously, Embraer had said repeatedly that the deal, which will see Boeing buy 80% of its commercial jet division for $4.75 billion, would close by the end of 2019.
The new timeline comes after the European Commission said it would do an extensive investigation of the deal on antitrust grounds. Embraer also said on Thursday it had received approval from U.S regulators.
The deal with Boeing will challenge Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which recently bought a controlling stake in the Bombardier unit that competes directly with Embraer's mid-sized commercial planes of up to 150 passengers.
The Airbus-Bombardier deal was approved by all regulators.
Until all approvals are received and other conditions are satisfied, Embraer cannot guarantee that the Boeing deal will keep to its new timetable or be completed at all, it said.
Embraer shares have fallen five days in a row, their longest losing streak in four months, and are down 10% in the last two weeks, underperforming the broader Brazilian stock market."

Build rates at the Mobile plant currently stand at five A320-series narrow-body aircraft a month, up from four last year, and Airbus is committed to a further increase in production, according to the Toulouse, France-based company.
While the U.S. factory has a theoretical capacity of eight A320s a month, Airbus hasn’t indicated when that rate might be reached, a spokesman said Thursday.
Airbus was spared the full impact of the tariffs in a move by the U.S. that may be aimed at protecting local jobs. The list of goods slated for duties includes “new airplanes” from the four European countries deemed by the World Trade Organization to have provided it with illegal launch aid.
That means components and large structures like wings can be shipped from Europe for assembly in Mobile without incurring levies, though the degree to which the exemption will provide a workaround depends on how much of Airbus’s U.S. backlog can be satisfied from the Alabama plant.
Expansion there won’t help Airbus avoid duties on wide-body aircraft, which it only makes in Europe. Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and United Airlines Holdings Inc. have about 90 such A330 and A350 planes on order between them, according to Airbus’s order and delivery figures for August.
Airbus currently produces about 60 A320-series narrow-body jets a month worldwide, and aims to lift that rate to 63 by 2021.
The company has seven other final assembly lines for A320s in addition to Mobile, four in Hamburg, Germany, two at its headquarters in Toulouse, France, and one in Tianjin in China. A further unit may be added, most likely replacing the A380 superjumbo line in Toulouse that’s earmarked for closure. Mobile has also begun assembling A220 jets, with the first deliveries due next year.
While terms of the U.S. tariffs would appear to open the door for Airbus to supply U.S. customers from its China site without incurring the new penalty, doing so could risk worsening existing confrontations over trade."

Editor Lionel Barber, in an email to staff, said the two-month probe by law firm RPC had found that ""the evidence does not support claims of collusion between FT investigative reporters and investors trading in Wirecard"".
No comment was immediately available from Wirecard, a Munich-based fintech that was last year admitted to Germany's DAX blue-chip share index.
Barber called in RPC after German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on July 21 that Wirecard had given evidence to German prosecutors of suspected collusion between short sellers seeking to profit from share-price falls and FT staff.
""I am satisfied that there is no foundation to support the allegations of collusion leveled against our reporters by Wirecard,"" Barber wrote in the email to staff seen by Reuters. ""We stand by our journalism.""
FT reporter Dan McCrum has this year published a series of investigative reports into Wirecard that, citing evidence from whistleblowers, allege financial and accounting irregularities at entities the company controls in Asia and the Middle East.
His first piece at the end of January, alleging fraud and creative accounting at Wirecard's Singapore office, wiped up to $10 billion off the fintech's stock market value and triggered a police investigation in the Asian city-state.
Wirecard denies the allegations and has filed a suit at the Munich regional court against both the FT and McCrum, seeking a ruling on the merits of its case. If it wins that case, Wirecard says it would seek financial redress.

The Munich public prosecutor, acting on a complaint by financial regulator Bafin, is meanwhile investigating suspected manipulation in Wirecard stock. According to sources close to the investigation, McCrum is named as a suspect.

Shares rose 2.2% to $136.83 in premarket trading, as the company said it expects to meet or exceed its fiscal 2019 organic revenue growth target of 4%.
Since taking the helm last October, Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta has carved out a multi-billion dollar strategy that includes partnering with celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen and ramping up manufacturing capacity for smaller cans to boost demand for out-of-favor sugary sodas.
The company has splurged on new ads for its trademark Pepsi colas, as well as Mountain Dew and Gatorade beverages, rounding off with a campaign centering around the National Football League's 100th anniversary.
Advertising and marketing expenditure has increased 12% so far this year, the company said.
Gatorade sales have benefited from new low sugar and organic options, and the company said a sugar-less version of the sports drink surpassed half a billion dollars in retail sales since its launch in May last year.
Overall beverage sales in North America rose 3.4% in the third quarter to $5.64 billion, also supported by new flavors of its bubly sparkling water brand.
PepsiCo Chief Financial Hugh Johnston told Reuters that he expects bubly to become its next billion-dollar brand, with sales rising ""dramatically"" after a Super Bowl ad earlier this year.
The company's major snack brands, Doritos and Cheetos, also got a boost from the marketing push, even as calorie-counting Americans increasingly shift toward healthier options.
On-the-go lifestyles are helping snack sales, Johnston said.
""With busier lifestyles (there) comes a desire to eat more conveniently, which is a strong tailwind for our business"".
Net revenue rose 4.3% to $17.19 billion in the three months ended Sept. 7, beating analysts' estimates of $16.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
However, the higher investments have been a drag on profit.
The company left its full-year core earnings per share forecast unchanged, which  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said was a sign that the cost of achieving top line growth was rising.
PepsiCo's attributable net income fell to $2.10 billion, or $1.49 per share in the quarter, from $2.50 billion, or $1.75 per share, a year earlier.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya's first green bond has raised 4.3 billion shillings ($41.45 million) to build environmentally-friendly student accommodation, the issue's lead arranger said on Thursday.
So-called green bonds are fixed income securities that raise capital for projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, green transport and waste-water treatment.
The bond was issued by Nairobi-based property developer Acorn Holdings after new rules were unveiled in February to guide the issuance of green bonds.
Stanbic Bank, which arranged the deal, said the bond was priced at an interest rate of 12.25% and rated B1 Global, a notch above the Kenyan government's rating of B2.
""The subscription book was well diversified with significant interest from Kenyan domestic pension funds, commercial banks, insurance and reinsurance companies and non-resident funds,"" the bank said.
The issue was looking to raise a minimum of 2 billion shillings and a maximum of 5 billion shillings, Stanbic said.
It was structured as a ""restricted public offer"", targeting sophisticated investors who received a 50% guarantee from credit guarantees provider Guarantco on both their investments and the interest. Over-the-counter trading will be allowed.
The advent of the green bonds will help protect Kenya from the impact of extreme weather on the agriculture sector, which contributes about a third of annual GDP, said Nuru Mugambi, a director at the Kenya Bankers Association.
""With the landmark legislation that zero-rates taxes on green bonds, we expect to see more issuance coming to market,"" she said.
In January, HSBC said global green bond issuance is seen at $140-$180 billion this year, from $149.2 billion in 2018."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokio Marine Holdings Inc (T:8766) will buy insurer Pure Group for about $3.1 billion, it said on Thursday, marking its fourth sizable acquisition in the United States in a little over a decade.
Japanese financial firms have been forced to look abroad for growth amid an ageing, shrinking population at home. Tokio Marine, the world's fourth-largest property-and-casualty insurer by revenue, has pushed into both emerging markets and the United States.
""The U.S. market is huge and it is expected to grow steadily,"" Tokio Marine Chief Executive Satoru Komiya told a news conference. ""Also, the market is transparent.""
But he acknowledged that the $3.1 billion price, at 33-times Pure Group's forecast profit for 2020, was ""not cheap"".
""We are paying for Pure's big potential growth,"" he said.
The deal, to be financed through cash on hand and external funding, is expected to close during the first quarter of 2020 and Tokio Marine will keep Pure Group's current management in place, Tokio Marine said in a statement.
Pure Group provides property-and-casualty insurance to high net-worth individuals across the United States and has become one of the top three players in that market since its founding in 2006, Tokio Marine said.
REVENUE AND RISK
Overseas acquisitions allow insurers to diversify their revenue and risk, so that a natural disaster hitting one region could be offset by profits from elsewhere.
Tokio Marine bought U.S. speciality insurer HCC Insurance Holdings for $7.5 billion in 2015. It paid $2.7 billion in 2011 for Delphi Financial and bought Philadelphia Consolidated for $4.7 billion in 2008.
The high net-worth insurance market is one of the few insurance businesses seeing strong growth in the United States, Tokio Marine said, as growth in the number of wealthy individuals outpaces that of the overall population.
Pure has achieved a compound annual growth rate of around 30% in the last five years and reached around $1 billion in managed premiums in 2018.
Tokio Marine is valued at $38 billion and brings in $45 billion a year in revenue, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of the insurer ended 1.8% lower after the Nikkei newspaper earlier reported the news."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks hovered near four-week lows on Thursday and yields on major benchmark bonds slipped after Washington moved to impose new tariffs on European goods, fuelling fears about global growth and dousing risk appetite. 
MSCI's index of world stocks (MIWD00000PUS) slipped 0.1%, with Asian shares plunging. Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) closing down 2%, its biggest one-day decline since Aug. 26.
However, European stocks eked out small gains after suffering their worst day since last December on Wednesday, when the U.S. got the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods.
Washington will enact 10% tariffs on Airbus (PA:AIR) planes and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal EU subsidies to Airbus. 
But a reduction in the initial list propped up some sectors with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index (STOXX) up 0.2%, torn between falls in financials and gains in luxury goods stocks. France's CAC index (FCHI) rose 0.7% while Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) fell 0.5%. German bourses - a weather vane for exports - were closed for a national holiday. 
The latest U.S.-European trade tensions added to fears over the standoff between Washington and Beijing, which has cast a shadow over global growth prospects. Earlier in the week, disappointing data on U.S. manufacturing and the jobs market suggested the trade war with China had damaged the world's largest economy. 
""The big question for a lot of folks is whether this is the third slowdown since the financial crisis or are we now heading for a global recession,"" said Anujeet Sareen, a fixed income portfolio manager and global macro strategist for Brandywine Global. ""The wild card in the pack is always Donald Trump and whatever he tweets next.""
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) (NQc1) indicated 0.4% higher, after shares fell the most in nearly six weeks on Wednesday. All three major New York share indexes lost more than 1.5%.
""Risk aversion is broadly on the rise and that has been triggered by the weakness in U.S. manufacturing ISM data earlier this week,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
""The outperformance of the U.S. economy compared to other major economies has held the dollar and other risky assets up but that has changed this week.""
The flight to safety saw yields on two-year U.S. Treasury yields (US2YT=RR) slip to 1.4680%, nearing a two-year low of 1.4280%. Adding to pressure on yields was a weak U.S. jobs report, boosting expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month.
Traders see a 72.8% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points to 1.75%-2.00% in October, up from 39.6% on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
Bets on a rate cut could rise further if a U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday shows weakness in the labor market.
Government bond yields in safe-haven Germany (DE10YT=RR) fell for the first time in over a week.
In currency markets, the dollar dipped to one-week lows against the euro and yen. The greenback crossed 107 Japanese yen  and touched a week low of 106.95 yen before recovering some ground. It fell to $1.0973 per euro (EUR=). The dollar index (DXY) slipped 0.1%. 
Meanwhile, sterling  was flat at $1.2306 as investors waited for a European Union response to Britain's latest Brexit offer, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson offered on Wednesday. 
So far, the last-ditch Brexit proposal has received a cool reception. One senior EU official said it ""can't fly"" because it was an unworkable move backwards that left Britain and the EU far apart.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was flat at $57.84 per barrel. Energy traders are worried about a slowing global economy, an over-supplied market and geopolitical friction in the Middle East.

The bull run in stocks that began a decade ago isn’t over, Robert Buckland, Citigroup’s chief global equity strategist, wrote in an Oct. 2 note. Citi forecasts a 9% gain in global equities by the end of 2020, albeit with “dips along the way.”
Stocks worldwide tumbled in the first two days of the month as unexpectedly poor data on U.S. manufacturing and payrolls stoked worries about economic growth. Citi sees a global recession as the biggest threat to its positive view.
“It is too early to call the end of this 10 year global bull market, although the risks remain considerable,” Citi wrote in a note. “Our market targets suggest that U.S. equities will continue to lead the way.”
Global equities have had a stellar run in the past decade, with the MSCI All Country World Index nearly tripling from a low in March 2009. While the recent string of bad data is threatening stocks’ best annual gains since 2017, Citi expects central banks to continue supporting risk assets in 2020 by easing policy in response to slowing economies and low inflation.
Citi endorses U.S. equities, while it’s underweight on emerging-market shares as earnings growth is weakening. U.K. stocks, among the worst performers in Europe this year, are its preferred value trade. Within sectors, information technology and health-care stocks are favored, while financials are an underweight despite “tempting valuations.”"

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M (ST:HMb) posted its first rise in quarterly pretax profit in more than two years on Thursday as the world's second-biggest fashion retailer said its drive to meet rapid changes in the market were on track. 
H&M has been spending heavily on reviving its business after years of falling profits and growing inventories due to slowing sales at its core H&M branded stores.
Shares in H&M, which is controlled by the founding Persson family, with the founder's son the chairman and his grandson the CEO, were up 6.5% at 0840 GMT. 
""H&M delivered its first strong quarterly earnings in over four years, which could raise confidence in the turnaround,"" investment bank Carnegie said in research note. 
The shares are up 56% this year after hitting a 13-year low in 2018 though they remain at about half their peak levels hit in 2015.
Pretax profit for the June to August quarter beat expectations, rising to 5.0 billion crowns ($507 million) from 4.01 billion a year earlier. 
Analysts had on average forecast a rise to 4.93 billion crowns, Refinitiv data showed.
The increase was the Swedish retailer's first since the second quarter of 2017. 
""The continued development of more full-price sales and reduced markdowns contributed to a 26% increase in operating profit in the third quarter, all while maintaining a high level of activity in our transformation work,"" CEO Karl-Johan Persson said in a statement.
Profit growth was also helped by accelerating sales growth.
H&M had said on Sept. 16 that sales growth in the quarter was the steepest in three years buoyed by well-received summer ranges and increased market share. 
But analysts cautioned that investment might again squeeze profit margins, and shares fell on that day.
H&M's gross margin actually widened to 50.8% from 50.3%, and its operating profit margin rose to 8.0% from 7.1%. 
Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), H&M's biggest rival, has been weathering challenges in the sector better than most yet its first-half results on Sept. 11 revealed disappointing margin growth that overshadowed a strong rise in sales.
Smaller brick-and mortar rival Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 30.
H&M's inventories increased 9% to 42.0 billion crowns at the end of its third quarter, equivalent to 18.5% of sales. 
However, H&M said that, measured in local currencies, they shrank by 1% while the composition of the stock had kept improving.
The group in 2018 announced a target to cut inventories to 12-14% of sales by the end of 2020. CEO Persson on Thursday told analysts and media on a call that range was still reachable, but did not say when. 
Markdowns decreased for a fourth straight quarter, by 2 percentage points in relation to sales. 
H&M in June had predicted a 1.5 percentage point decrease. The company unusually did not provide an outlook for markdowns in the current quarter.
""We believe we have reached an inflection point for margins and foresee the potential for further markdown recovery over the next 2-3 years,"" said RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain, who recently raised his rating on H&M to ""outperform"".
H&M said sales in September, the first month of its fourth quarter, grew 8% in local currencies. 
Persson said on the call with analysts and media that favorable weather had helped boost sales. 

Executives also said on the call that activity to transform the company would remain high in coming quarters in an indication investment would stay elevated.

873,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 05:06AM ET</span>","StockBeat: H&M Shines as Europe Tries to Shake off Tariff, PMI Blues","Investing.com -- The turnaround at retailer H&M (ST:HMb) gathered pace in the third quarter, sending the company’s shares up 6.6% to their highest in nearly two years.
The Swedish fast-fashion giant has convincingly put behind it the trauma of an over-ambitious expansion plan that left it with a mountain of unsold clothes and a network of stores that couldn’t pay their way. The shares are now up 56% in 2019, well ahead of the 23% gain posted by Zara owner   Inditex   (MC:ITX).
The results owed much to a 25% currency-adjusted rise in online sales, reflecting the work that it’s put into improving its website in recent quarters. As a result, overall sales rose 6% on a currency-adjusted basis, even as the company cut its network of physical stores by 7. That, along with a further decline in markdown costs, also expanded the gross profit margin to 50.8% from 50.3%.
H&M also again trimmed its plans for net store openings this year to 120, down from 130 three months ago and 175 at the start of the year.
It was a completely different story on Thursday morning for U.K.-based   Ted Baker   (LON:TED), whose shares fell 36% after it swung to a net loss in the third quarter and offered no clear path out of its current problems. The lack of answers suggests the company is still struggling with the loss of its CEO earlier this year amid allegations of improper behavior toward female staff. Elsewhere in London, tobacco giant Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) edged down 0.1% after it parted ways with CEO Alison Cooper, a week after it warned on this year’s profits due to growing legal problems with new tobacco products such as e-cigarettes.
H&M stood out Thursday in a European market still reeling from Wall Street’s worst sell-off in two months, compounded by the announcement of U.S. tariffs on a range of European goods in retaliation for illegal subsidies to Airbus.
Airbus (PA:AIR) itself was, however, the biggest gainer in Paris, up 3.6% after the tariffs levied on European aircraft and components came out at the benign end of a range of expectations. The U.S. exempted from tariffs components shipped to an assembly plant in Alabama, a move aimed at keeping the cost of aircraft low for U.S. airlines. LVMH M (PA:LVMH) likewise rose 1.7% after leather goods were left off the tariff list, while   Pernod Ricard   (PA:PERP) gained 3.3%, also on relief that the tariffs weren’t any heavier.
Markets in general were also depressed by the negative reaction to U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposals for a revised withdrawal agreement with the EU. The EU parliament’s Brexit committee dismissed the proposals on Thursday as “not a basis for an agreement.”
The U.K. FTSE 100 fell 0.7% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT). The German Dax and Euro Stoxx indexes were both closed for the German Unity Day holiday.
Also making things worse was the confirmation that growth in the euro zone nearly stalled last month, as the sharp slowdown in manufacturing spread ever-more broadly into the bigger services sector. The composite purchasing managers index compiled by IHS Markit fell to 50.1 from 51.9 the previous month, just above the 50 line that separates growth from expansion. In the U.K., the composite PMI fell clearly below that line to 49.3."

The change in management comes at a sensitive time for the unit. Bloomberg News reported last month the private bank is in the process of reviewing all of its roughly 8,000 clients after finding it sometimes couldn’t explain the source of their wealth. Siripurapu didn’t return an e-mail seeking comment.
“Following what has been an incredibly intense period building out our private banking business in the region over the last few years,” Srinivas has decided to spend more time with his family, according to an internal memo circulated Thursday. He is being replaced by Lizin, who joins from UBS Group AG, where he was head of wealth management and senior executive officer for Dubai.
One of the largest Western banks operating in emerging markets, Standard Chartered operates a sprawling network of offices across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, serving thousands of corporate clients and millions of retail customers.
A 2017 review by Dubai’s financial regulator found that Standard Chartered’s private bank couldn’t explain how many clients acquired their money and in some cases lacked even basic information such as current addresses and phone numbers, Bloomberg reported in September, citing people familiar with the situation. The bank subsequently discovered similar client documentation failures in major hubs including Hong Kong, Singapore and London, the people said.
Standard Chartered has paid billions of dollars in fines to regulators for sanctions violations and other wrongdoing, casting a pall over Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters’s attempts to turn around the lender since joining in 2015. This year, the bank paid $1.1 billion to the authorities in the U.S. and the U.K. to settle an investigation over violations of sanctions against Iran and anti-money-laundering failures.
Low Morale
Faced with a collapse in staff morale after repeated run-ins with local regulators and aggressive financial targets, senior managers in the region recently delivered hand-written ‘Thank You’ cards to staff and hosted team bonding sessions where employees were asked to write letters praising each other, the people said. The charm offensive intensified after Bloomberg made queries about shortcomings at the private bank, they said.
A survey of Standard Chartered’s global workforce found that the private bank reported the highest levels of dissatisfaction, according to an internal report seen by Bloomberg News. The survey discovered a negative score for the private bank when staff were asked whether they would recommend to others to work there, a metric known as a net promoter score. The overall result for the group was positive.
After Bloomberg News reported last month on the widespread anti-money laundering failures at the bank, senior managers told staff they should not talk to journalists, according to a person familiar with the matter."

(Reuters) - Ride-hailing firm  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) said it launched an app called Uber Works to connect temporary workers looking to work shifts with businesses trying to plug gaps in their rosters. 
The app, made available only in Chicago for now, will show workers the available shifts in a certain area and help businesses that struggle to staff up during peak demand, and with missed shifts and high turnover, Uber said in a blog https://ubr.to/2n5ka15. 
""Uber Works has a business dashboard and we connect directly with businesses, including restaurants and others, to assist them with filling empty shifts,"" a company spokesman told Reuters. 
The move to diversify its core business comes at a time when Uber's main ride hailing operations face competition in Asia, while the U.S. company is also facing regulatory scrutiny for classifying its drivers as independent contractors. 
Last month, a driver with Uber sued the company after California legislators voted to help thousands of those workers become employees and enjoy associated benefits. 
A new California law designed to limit the use of ""gig"" workers goes into effect on Jan. 1. 
Uber reported a record $5.2 billion loss in the second quarter, with its results showing slowing revenue growth that raised questions about its ability to expand and fend off competition. 
Uber said on Wednesday Uber Works will partner with staffing agencies such as  TrueBlue Inc  (N:TBI) - which employ, pay and handle worker benefits - and also connect directly with businesses. 

Users of the app can get detailed information about shifts that they are interested in, including information about gross pay, work location and skills, or required attire, Uber said, adding that the app will enable time-tracking by allowing users to clock in and out and log breaks.

LONDON (Reuters) - Profits from supplying gas and electricity at Britain’s big six energy firms sank by a combined 35 percent last year as they continued to lose customers to smaller rivals, a report by energy market regulator Ofgem said on Thursday.
Britain’s so-called 'Big Six' energy suppliers - Centrica's British Gas, E.ON, SSE (LON:SSE), EDF's EDF (PA:EDF) Energy, Innogy's npower and Iberdrola's Scottish Power - have faced competition from more than 60 smaller firms, often offering cheaper prices.
In its annual state of the market report, Ofgem said the six companies had lost around 1.3 million customers and they served just above 70% of domestic customers as of June this year, down from around 75% in June last year.
Total domestic supply profits across the six largest firms, measured as earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), fell by 35% last year to 599 million pounds from 924 million pounds a year earlier. Profits fell 10% last year.
Their overall average profit margin, measured by EBIT as a percentage of revenue, fell to a nine-year low of 2.7%.
However, profit margins varied across the six companies.
British Gas had the highest at 7%. Scottish Power's was at more than 4% last year, up from just above 0% in 2017.
EDF Energy's profit margin also rose to nearly 2% from 0.9% a year earlier. E.ON's profit margin fell to below 0% from above 5% a year earlier, and npower had the lowest profit margin at nearly -4%.
The difference in margins is usually due to varying operating costs and the extent to which costs were passed onto customers.
Relative newcomer Ovo Energy is set to become one of the Big Six after striking a 500 million pound deal to buy SSE's retail arm last month.
E.ON is buying npower from peer Innogy but both have said they would look at all options for the business, leaving room for a sale, restructuring or winding it down.
Ofgem said energy bills are one of the largest single items of regular expenditure in Britain. Households and businesses together spend around 55 billion pounds a year on energy.
The average dual fuel energy bill for a typical customer with the large suppliers in 2018 was 1,184 pounds, up from 1,117 the year earlier.
Following government legislation, the regulator introduced a cap on energy prices for around 11 million customers on expensive default energy deals in January and estimates it has saved them around 1 billion pounds this year.
Ofgem added that it is still investigating an outage which disconnected 1.1 million electricity customers in August and will report on the causes in next year's report."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand has given the agro-industrial conglomerate  Charoen  Pokphand Group (CP) until Oct. 15 to sign an investment agreement for the 225 billion baht ($7.36 billion) high-speed train project, a senior official said.
Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announced the deadline on Thursday, adding that CP's bid for the project was 60 billion baht (nearly $2 billion) lower than competitors.
CP Group and 12 other companies won the bid for the project in May, beating out a consortium led by mass transit operator, BTS Group Holdings Pcl (BK:BTS).
Since then, the company has been negotiating with the State Railway of Thailand on terms of the agreement including land ownership.
""On Oct. 15, CP Group should sign the contract because if they don't, they will be blacklisted by the government,"" Anutin said.
He said failure to sign would mean other companies in the CP bidding group - including Bangkok Metro Expressway and Metro Pcl (BK:BEM), Italian Thai Development Pcl (BK:ITD), CH Karnchang Pcl (BK:CK) and China Railway Construction (SS:601186) - could also be affected in future government projects.
The high-speed train project, a private-public partnership, will connect Thailand's main international airport Suvarnabhumi to low-cost carrier airport Don Muang and U-Tapao airport in eastern Thailand.
""I think there will not be a problem in signing,"" acting governor of State Rail of Thailand, Worawut Mala, told Reuters.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 04:03AM ET</span>","As protests rack Hong Kong, China watchdog has Cathay staff 'walking on eggshells'","By Jamie Freed
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Staff at Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293), Hong Kong's flagship airline, are on edge.
Their city has been gripped by months of anti-government protests, and their company is feeling the wrath of China's aviation regulator after some staff members took part or expressed support.
Since an Aug.9 directive by the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) that called for the suspension of staff who supported or participated in the demonstrations, the regulator has rejected some entire crew lists without explanation, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The rejections have forced Cathay to scramble, pulling pilots and flight attendants off standby while it investigates social media accounts in an effort to determine which crew member has been deemed a security threat, one of the sources said.
Other disruptions have come in the form of a huge jump in the number of plane inspections upon landing, four pilots said.
The flexing of regulatory muscle has contributed to a climate of fear within the airline, with employees telling Reuters they felt Cathay's longer-term future as an independent company was highly uncertain and subject to Beijing's whims.
The CAAC's labeling of employees who support the protest as a security risk and its demand that they be suspended from flying over mainland airspace has been a de facto career killer.
Around three quarters of Cathay flights use mainland airspace and due to the directive, 30 rank-and-file staff, including eight pilots and 18 flight attendants, have been fired or resigned under pressure, according to the Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation. 
Cathay CEO Rupert Hogg and his top deputy also resigned in August amid the mounting regulatory scrutiny on the 73-year-old airline, one of the region's most high-profile brands that draws on Hong Kong's British heritage. 
""Things changed very quickly,"" said Jeremy Tam, a pro-democracy lawmaker and pilot who resigned from the airline after the CAAC directive, likening the atmosphere to a political trial. ""The threat is huge and it's almost like zero to 100 in two seconds.""
Reuters talked to 14 current and former employees for this article. Nearly all declined to be identified for fear of being fired or due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The CAAC did not respond Reuters requests for comment on the rejections of crew lists or the increase in plane checks.Cathay said in a statement it must comply with all regulatory requirements. ""Quite simply, this is our license to operate; there is no ground for compromise,"" it said.
The airline declined to comment on the number of employee departures, but said any terminations took into account factors such as a person's ability to perform their role.
DEMERIT SYSTEM
Aviation regulators around the world conduct occasional plane inspections at airports to ensure an airline is in compliance with safety regulations. 
But after the CAAC's Aug. 9 directive, the once-infrequent inspections occurred almost daily and included the new and unusual step of checking phones owned by crew for anti-China photos and messages, the pilots said, adding that this had led to flight delays.
The step-up in checks has increased the likelihood of regulators finding minor issues to write up, which pilots said had included dirt on the plane's exterior and scratches on a fire extinguisher.
Infractions can have outsized consequences under the CAAC's strict demerit points system, they said, noting the regulator could force Cathay to reduce its number of flights, cut destinations or in a worst-case scenario, revoke the airline's right to fly to mainland China.
Management has urged staff to do their utmost to avoid infractions. 
""It is nothing less than the survival of the airline at stake,"" said a senior employee. ""Management have made that abundantly clear at meetings.""
Executives are particularly sensitive after seven incidents outside mainland China in the past two months in which pre-flight checks found emergency oxygen bottles for crew were depleted.
The CAAC is more public than many regulatory peers about disclosing safety violations, warnings and punishments.
In 2017, Emirates was banned from expanding its operations for six months following two safety incidents, while flag carrier Air China Ltd (SS:601111) was ordered last year to cut  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 flights by 10% after a emergency descent linked to a pilot smoking an e-cigarette in the cockpit.
Cathay declined to provide information on its points under the CAAC system but said it wanted to emphasize that there had been no impact on its flight services into mainland China. 
The pilots said the high frequency of airplane checks, which one described as ""very intimidatory"", was starting to recede.
A THOUSAND CUTS
Employees are also feeling pressure from other regulatory bodies.
Last week, ahead of China's National Day on Oct.1, immigration officers at some mainland airports requested photos of crew with the Chinese flag, said a pilot at regional arm Cathay Dragon who flies to the mainland regularly.
He said to his knowledge, most pilots - many of whom are expats from Western countries - had refused but Hong Kong cabin crew were ""too nervous to say no"" given the scrutiny on their actions by the company and the Chinese government.
""Everyone is walking on eggshells in China,"" the pilot said.
Cathay did not respond to a request for comment, while China's Ministry of Public Security, which oversees immigration, did not respond to a request for comment during a week of public holidays.
There has been no let-up in the widespread, sometimes violent, unrest that has beset Hong Kong. Triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, it has morphed into an outpouring of opposition to the former British colony's Beijing-backed government.
The crisis has also meant a sharp drop in travel demand to Hong Kong, putting more pressure on Cathay. 
Cathay's overall passenger numbers were down 11.3% in August. Flights at Cathay Dragon, which does most of Cathay's mainland flying, were on average 60-65% full in September, down from the usual 80%, according to estimates from two pilots. 
The pilots said while the sharp drop in demand was in some ways similar in scale to that weathered by Cathay during the SARS epidemic and the global financial crisis, there were key differences that felt more threatening to the company's future.
Some state-controlled firms such as China CITIC Bank International and Huarong International have told employees to avoid flying with Cathay, and it has been attacked by Chinese state news organizations as well as by many mainland consumers on social media.
CAAC's Aug.9 statement which called staff who supported the protests a security risk has also put Cathay's reputation as one of the world's safest airlines under a cloud it does not deserve, employees said.
Many acknowledged the new management team, which oversees around 33,000 employees, has few palatable options in dealing with the situation given the sway Beijing holds over the airline's operations.
But they lamented the loss of freedom of speech and sense of job security, saying employees are afraid to speak about anything even vaguely political or voice support for protests on social media for fear of being reported by colleagues under a whistleblower policy.

""It has become a Hong Kong company with mainland employment terms,"" a pilot at Cathay Dragon said. ""The risk is death by a thousand cuts.""

884,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 03:30AM ET</span>",Stocks on tenterhooks as U.S. recession signs build,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A wake-up call from the U.S. heartland has spooked Wall Street by raising fears of a recession that will push equities into a correction. 
After Tuesday's dire picture on manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which rattled the market, investors await Thursday's ISM services report and Friday's employment report to confirm or quash recession worries.
They will also be looking for evidence on the strength of the consumer, which has been a cornerstone of the current economic expansion. 
""I am more concerned at this point than I have been at any point in the entire year ... The key ingredient is when the business recession impacts the consumer and we get a total recession,"" said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.
The ISM came in at 47.8 on Tuesday, its lowest level in over 10-years as trade tensions weighed on exports.
That tipped the Dow (DJI) and S&P 500 (SPX) into their biggest one-day percentage declines since Aug. 23. The S&P 500 is now down 4.6% from its record July 26 closing high. A correction is traditionally defined as a 10% decline.
""This one is significant. We're seeing a real contraction in the manufacturing sector,"" Blancato said.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. Manufacturing hits 10-year low - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6861/6792/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Worries the drop in manufacturing was a harbinger of a sharper slowdown in the economy continued on Wednesday, as each of the major indexes closed down more than 1.5%. A report on private payrolls showed further slowing and did little to turn sentiment.
Expectations for the ISM services report are for a reading of 55.0, down from the 56.4 registered in August. Friday's payrolls number is forecast to show job gains of 145,000, up from the 130,000 in August, while the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7%. 
Manufacturing represents a much smaller piece of the economic pie than the services sector. The concern though is that other data points, such as hours worked for the services sector, have indicated the slowdown may be escalating. 
""We are of course now watching non-manufacturing ISM and ultimately, most importantly, the nonfarm payrolls on Friday for the composition of how much of the deterioration we are seeing is only in manufacturing and are there any signs this is spreading to services,"" said Torsten Sløk, chief economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities in New York. 
""The worry we have is the uncertainties associated with all this will continue to argue for having a much more cautious approach as an investor at the moment.""
Aside from the recessionary worries, October is a historically volatile month for stocks, said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.
According to Detrick, no month has had more single days moves of 1% in either direction since 1950 than October. Since 1928, six of the 10 biggest single-day drops have come during the month, while three of the 10 best one-day performances have also occurred in October. 
""It is almost a function of the fact that last month was so dull, then you get the disappointing ISM number and everyone kind of freaks out real fast and that is what has led to this two-day, very quick gyration lower as we were kind of lulled almost to sleep by the lack of volatility in September,"" said Detrick.
Detrick also pointed to other periods during the current bull market where the manufacturing number fell below 50, the threshold between expansion and contraction, and managed to bounce back as reason for optimism.
However, an ISM contraction does not necessarily signal long-term market losses.
Chris Ciovacco, CEO at Ciovacco Capital Management in Atlanta, Georgia, said there were at least five instances where the manufacturing number registered above 60 and subsequently fell to Tuesday's 47.8 reading going back to 1982. In four of those cases, the S&P 500 was higher after the first two years. The index was also higher in each case after four and five years. 

""Obviously weak manufacturing does have a correlation with recessions and that is something you have to respect, it shouldn’t just be written off or ignored,"" Ciovacco said.

885,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 03:19AM ET</span>",Aramco Needs More Than Bourse’s Invisible Hand to Buoy Its Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco’s shares, when they’re finally issued, may just prove to be havens in a volatile region. At least in the beginning.
Given the wide-spread speculation that government-related funds prop up the market when times are bad, some investors assume shares of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. wouldn’t be allowed to perform badly, especially given the hype around the initial public offering.
But even if they do, the support probably won’t be enough to keep global fund managers invested in Aramco’s stock for long, despite the company’s intrinsic ties to the kingdom and its finances.
“Short-term investors will find the downside protection, if there, comforting,” said Thea Jamison, a portfolio manager at Change Global Investment in Camas, Washington. In the long-run, investors would ask “bigger questions” about the company’s “fundamentals, its long-term growth outlook, the country’s macroeconomic environment and political risks.”
The Invisible Hand
Aramco’s offering shines a light on what some investors call “the invisible hand” that shields Saudi Arabia’s stock market during times of crisis. A year ago, there was speculation that funds with links to the government swooped in during the fallout of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, and in 2017, when local billionaires were imprisoned at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh.
There was also sign of support after last month’s attacks on the kingdom’s oil facilities, with the main stock index recovering about half its losses within the first hour of trading.
Aramco “will be a showcase for the Tadawul,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior market analyst at London Capital Group. “Therefore, the Saudis won’t refrain from giving the necessary support to Aramco shares. And they have the means to do so.”
The share sale, which has been in the making for at least three years, is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to modernize the economy and diversify the nation’s revenue from oil. That drive includes turning Riyadh’s bourse into a gateway for foreign investment.
The offering is going ahead even though the strikes risk reducing Aramco’s valuation, which Prince Mohammed has put at over $2 trillion.
Based on his target, a 1% float would be valued at about $20 billion, or about 4% of the Saudi stock market. The state-run company plans to announce its intention to float around Oct. 20, and its listing could take place as early as November, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
No Guarantee
Judging by the performance of equities held by the Public Investment Fund, the biggest investor in the equities market, Saudi Arabia’s reliance on Aramco doesn’t necessarily mean that the so-called invisible hand will buoy the shares indefinitely.
Shares of Saudi Telecom Co., National Commercial Bank, Riyad Bank and Samba Financial Group have outpaced the benchmark index over the past two years, while those of Saudi Basic Industries Corp, Saudi Arabian Mining Co. and Almarai Co. have lagged. PIF’s holdings in these stocks vary from about 15% to 70%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Over the multi-month and multi-quarter time-frames relevant for institutional investors, government support for a share price cannot fight the prevailing wind,” said Hasnain Malik, the Dubai-based head of equity strategy at Tellimer."

Elders General Manager Tony Beaven said Elders has conducted a review and was in consultation with its adviser network after it had ""identified a potential way forward"", without providing specifics.
The Australian Financial Review newspaper reported that IOOF intends to close the business.
""Recent changes to the financial planning industry mean that it has become increasingly difficult for EFP, as a small-scale dealer group, to generate the income required to cover higher regulatory compliance and insurance costs,"" Beaven said in an emailed statement.
""EFP is seeking feedback from advisers on this proposal.""
The AFR reported that IOOF plans to wind up the business, terminating adviser agreements and transitioning the advisers to IOOF's unit Millennium3, according to documents sent to financial advisers that the newspaper had viewed.
IOOF, which owns a majority 51% stake in Elders Financial via Millenium3, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Elders Ltd (AX:ELD), which owns 49% of the unit.
The potential closure comes after a government-mandated inquiry into the financial sector uncovered widespread misconduct, prompting regulators to abolish commissions and increase compliance, making it tougher for small-scale advisers.
The country's largest wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) recently started cancelling licenses of some of its more than 1,500 aligned financial advisors, citing the new regulations.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), the country's largest, recently completed the sale of Count Financial - its financial adviser network.

The engineer said in the complaint filed this year that during the development of the 737 MAX, Boeing had rejected a safety system to minimize costs, the New York Times had reported https://nyti.ms/2nOUo1J earlier.
The engineer, who worked on cockpit instruments and controls, felt the safety system could have reduced risks that contributed to two fatal crashes that killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia, according to the report.
""All of this information is critical to have as we prepare for our Committee's October 30th hearing with Boeing's CEO, as well as Boeing's chief engineer of its commercial airplanes division, and the chief pilot for the 737,"" said Peter DeFazio, chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
Boeing said it would continue to cooperate with Congress and regulatory authorities as it focuses on safely returning the MAX to service.
The committee has been poring over hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and emails from Boeing and the FAA, but it was not aware of the engineer's complaint, he said. 
Boeing persuaded the Federal Aviation Administration in 2014 to relax safety standards for the new 737 MAX related to cockpit alerts that would warn pilots of problems during flight, the Seattle Times reported on Wednesday, citing documents. 
The regulator struck out four clauses that would be requirements for any new jet being designed today, the report said. That meant the planemaker avoided a complete upgrade of the 737's aging flight-crew-alerting system, the report added.
Boeing declined to comment on the Seattle Times report. 
Boeing's submission cited an estimate that full compliance would cost more than $10 billion, the Seattle Times said. 
That amount included the direct cost to Boeing of redesigning the airplane and the expense of additional pilot training, all of which would have been borne by Boeing's airline customers, making the MAX a much less attractive airplane, the report said. 
""These reports certainly add to my concern that production pressures may have impacted safety on the 737 MAX, which is exactly why it's so critical we get to the bottom of this,"" DeFazio said.

The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Walmart will pilot a program that will connect patients with local doctors in an effort to cut down on its workers relying on word of mouth or social media to find a doctor. The pilot programs will be held in parts of Arkansas, Florida and Texas.
The company is the largest U.S. private-sector employer with a 1.4 million workforce.

In Colorado, Wisconsin and Minnesota, Walmart will expand a program that allows patients to video chat with a doctor from home for $4 per chat.
The retailer will also offer workers access to fitness clubs for $9 per bi-weekly pay period and add a predictable co-pay of $35 for every visit to a primary care physician under its most popular medical plan. These services will be available nationwide.
In addition to healthcare services for employees, the company is also beefing up its presence in the fast-growing health and wellness market in the country.
Recently, Walmart said it is expanding an education program it began last year by offering healthcare degrees, aimed at filling critical roles at its more than 5,000 retail pharmacies.
Last year, the retailer signed a deal with Anthem Inc (N:ANTM), one of the country's largest insurers, to attract more Medicare enrollees to buy over-the-counter medicines and supplies at its stores.
This month, it opened a facility in Georgia to offer low-priced health services that include dental, x-rays, and mental health counseling.
Walmart also runs one of the largest pharmacy chains in the country and has been aggressive in offering low priced generic drugs and prescriptions."

Hong Kong stocks traded lower after data showed the city’s retail sales declined by the most on record as months of protests took an increasing toll on the city’s economy.
The value of retail sales slumped 23% year-on-year in August, while visits from Mainland China fell 42% during the month.
Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary Paul Chan said back in September that the city’s economy likely entered a technical recession in the third quarter. Chan added that more stimulus could be added by the government if needed.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a report cited by Bloomberg that there has been an outflow of Hong Kong dollar deposits totalling up to $4 billion to Singapore as of August.
“We found modest net outflow from HKD deposits in Hong Kong and modest net inflow of FX deposits in Singapore,” analysts Gurpreet Singh Sahi and Yingqiang Guo wrote in a note to investors late Monday. “We believe the debate on Hong Kong outflow/liquidity will remain active and the data points for September (and beyond) critical in shaping the same.”
The Hang Seng Index traded 0.4% lower by 10:52 PM ET (02:52 GMT) following the release of the weak data.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 2.0%, while Australia’s ASX 200 lost 1.9%.
Markets in South Korea and China are closed for holidays.
Also putting pressure on Asian stocks today was the announcement from the U.S. that it is imposing more tariffs on European goods.
Washington said overnight that it would slap a 10% tariff on European-made Airbus planes and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies and cheese from across the continent."
896,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 10:20PM ET</span>",Airbus plant in Alabama spared fallout from U.S. tariffs,"By Andrea Shalal and Tim Hepher
WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Alabama aerospace workers won an unexpected reprieve from escalating trade tensions on Wednesday when the United States spared an Airbus (Pa:AIR) plant in the state from the impact of tariffs against the European planemaker - at least for now.
While Airbus aircraft built in Europe will be hit with a tariff of 10% after the World Trade Organization allowed Washington to impose sanctions on EU goods, semi-finished fuselages and wings are exempted, an official list showed. 
That means large parts shipped to the deep-sea Alabama port of Mobile from plants in Europe will not be hit by the duties, allowing Airbus to continue to supply U.S.-based airlines with a limited number of locally assembled aircraft.
""Earlier today, we received confirmation from Airbus of very positive news that parts and components used at the final assembly plant in Mobile will not be subject to tariffs,"" said George Talbot, spokesman for the city of Mobile.
""There is a great sense of relief and gratitude about the outcome.""
France-based Airbus opened the Mobile plant in 2015, widening its international footprint from existing assembly lines in Europe and China.
The Alabama plant produces four A320-family jets a month, a relatively small part of the Airbus total, but is seen as important to the company's plans to raise output globally. U.S. rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has large manufacturing operations in the north of the state.
Mobile city leaders and Alabama lawmakers had lobbied hard for exemptions from the tariffs, arguing they could jeopardize some 1,000 jobs.
Alabama's largely conservative voters supported U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and he continues to poll very strongly in the state.
The surprise decision to omit imported aircraft sections came in a list of tariffs that was smaller in percentage terms and in scope than initially signaled by Washington.
The United States said on Wednesday it expected the European Union to enter negotiations but stressed it also had authority to increase the tariffs or alter the products affected.
NORTHERN IRELAND REPRIEVE
Also spared by the decision to exempt imported aircraft parts were wings made in Northern Ireland for smaller Airbus A220 aircraft, which had been drawn into a separate row in 2017.
The planes are mainly built in Canada where they were originally designed by industrial group Bombardier (TO:BBDb) before Airbus bought the loss-making program last year.
But in August, Airbus also began building the planes in Mobile, adding plans for 400 jobs to 850 already in place.
A dispute over low prices for the jets sucked Boeing into a three-way trade row with Canada and Britain in 2017 and caused a political storm about politically sensitive jobs in Belfast.
For now, both those jobs and the new A220 jobs in Alabama appear to be sheltered from the latest dispute.
Airbus said it was evaluating the tariff list in close collaboration with the European Commission.
Despite relief over Airbus, Alabama is bracing for tariffs that could hit Germany's Daimler, which operates a large Mercedes auto plant in Tuscaloosa, beginning next month. 

Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose 25% tariffs on imported cars from Germany and elsewhere in Europe.

WASHINGTON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) cars driving themselves to their owners using the company's Smart Summon feature, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday.
Several users have posted videos on social media of Tesla vehicles that appear to have been in near accidents. One posted a video of a Tesla striking a garage wall and another of a Tesla being struck by a vehicle backing up. 
A Tesla software update last week added its Smart Summon feature for some customers. When the car is within 200 feet and in their line of sight, they use a phone app to summon the vehicle in a parking lot.(https:// On its website, Tesla's description of Summon reads: ""Your parked car will come find you anywhere in a parking lot. Really.""  Asked about reports of crashes, NHTSA said it ""is aware of reports related to Tesla’s Summon feature. We are in ongoing contact with the company and we continue to gather information. Safety is NHTSA’s top priority and the agency will not hesitate to act if it finds evidence of a safety-related defect.""  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, but Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday tweeted that there were more than 550,000 Smart Summon uses in the first few days. Tesla says users of Smart Summon should have a clear line of sight and check the surroundings. It said the vehicle ""will maneuver around or stop for objects and notify you when detected."" Users can stop the car from driving by releasing the app's button, it says, adding, ""You are still responsible for your car and  must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful around quick moving people, bicycles and cars."" While Tesla said Summon is to be used only in private parking lots and driveways, the feature breaks new ground by allowing operation of a vehicle without a driver behind the wheel. Federal vehicle safety regulations were written decades ago, before such technology existed.  Tesla reported Wednesday that it delivered 97,000 vehicles in the third quarter, fewer than some analysts had expected. In addition to the crashes depicted on social media, there are also videos of several near misses. In one Twitter video, a Tesla exits a parking space and starts to cross a driveway when an SUV nearly collides with the driverless car. A voice is heard gasping and exclaiming, ""Oh my God!"" The poster, Dallas-based solutions architect Roddie Hasan, commented that his ""first test of Smart Summon didn't go so well."" (https:// ""..A car pulled in from the road and around the corner into the lot, and I expected the Tesla to 'see' it and stop, however I had to take my finger off the (app) button when I saw that my Tesla wasn't slowing down,"" Hasan told Reuters. Another Twitter user, Mark Solomon, also posted a video that showed his car was not able to park itself properly using the feature. ""Not sure what the problem was but I think an older map of the parking lot was being used,"" he said.  'PROFOUND MOMENT' Tesla's website warns that drivers ""are still responsible for your car and  must monitor it and its surroundings at all times  and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful around quick moving people, bicycles and cars."" Other users had positive reviews. One posted a video of a white Tesla that slowly maneuvered around a parking lot for over a minute, ultimately arriving safely next to where the operator was standing. ""It was a very profound moment to see this technology live! People don’t understand the depths and multitude of challenges to make this happen,"" the Twitter user, @problematique79, told Reuters.  The summon feature is one of a suite of automated driving features that Musk has promised customers who have paid $6,000 for optional ""Full Self Driving"" packages of hardware and software.  
Automated driving features are one way Tesla hopes to stay ahead of traditional automakers, which have been more conservative about enabling vehicles to operate without drivers.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 07:23PM ET</span>",Tesla deliveries miss Wall Street estimates; shares fall 6%,"By Neha Malara and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Electric car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Wednesday its deliveries rose less than 2% in the third quarter, missing Wall Street estimates and sending its shares down nearly 6% in trading after the bell.
Total deliveries came in at a record 97,000 units for the quarter, but was below analysts' estimates of 97,477 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is under pressure to ramp up production, while proving that there is sustainable demand for its vehicles and that it can turn a profit, even as traditional luxury car makers begin to roll out their own electric models.
The company has set a target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, which means that it needs to deliver at least 104,800 vehicles in its final quarter to meet the low end of its full-year forecast.
""Looks like the 360k bottom end of 2019 forecast is starting to look a bit iffy,"" Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said.
The company's Model S and X vehicles are also facing challenges from the recently launched all-electric SUVs from Audi and Jaguar Land Rover.
Deliveries of the two high-priced models fell 1.4% to 17,400 from the second quarter and came in below analysts' estimates of 18,829 vehicles.
The company also delivered 79,600 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter, beating estimates of 79,470, but the pace of growth was just 2.6% from the previous quarter.
The Model 3 is the linchpin of Tesla's growth strategy and Musk is under pressure to deliver the vehicle to new international markets efficiently, while guarding working capital.
Tesla said its orders in the third quarter exceeded deliveries and that it was therefore entering the fourth quarter with a backlog.
CHINA FACTOR
China is emerging as a major market for Tesla and the company plans to start production this month at its new Shanghai plant.
The California-based company is aiming to produce at least 1,000 Model 3s a week from the factory by the end of this year, the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S. cars.
The plant's mass production schedule is crucial for Tesla's hopes of reaching its total production rate at an annualized 500,000 vehicles by the end of this year.
It was, however, unclear when it would meet its year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers, according to a Reuters report.
As the company strives to improve margins and post profit for the second half of 2019, Musk has been trying to cut spending.
Musk had previously said that Tesla aims to be profitable in the fourth quarter, with the third quarter to be break-even. The company said it was focusing less on profit and more on volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation.
Under pressure to meet his repeated promises to make Tesla sustainably profitable, Musk is trying to contain costs while still spending on major initiatives from a Shanghai factory and assembly-line to upcoming models such as the Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.
Tesla also announced that it had entered into a debt facility agreement of up to 5 billion yuan ($700 million) to finance vehicles-in-transit to China.
Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday that U.S. regulators are looking into parking lot crashes involving Tesla cars driving themselves to their owners using the company's Smart Summon feature.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 07:06PM ET</span>",Investors keep their faith in Hong Kong markets despite protests,"By Julie Zhu, Noah Sin and Marius Zaharia
HONG KONG (Reuters) - As anti-government protesters fought pitched battles with police in Hong Kong streets last week, a group of bankers in another part of the city were busy taking in billions for the public float of the Asia unit of the world's largest brewer.
After a freeze during months of sometimes violent protests, Asia's top financial hub looks to be back in business. The stock market is off its lows, Hong Kong's love affair with property is undimmed and companies are forging ahead with listing plans.
Budweiser Brewing Company APAC (HK:1876) raised about $5 billion in its initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, making it the second largest IPO in the world this year.
Bankers say at least three more major companies are set to list in Hong Kong this month, selling more than $3 billion worth of new shares.
Hong Kong's status as a gateway for global capital flowing into and out of China, the world's second-largest economy, has seen many global banks and fund managers make its towering skyscrapers their regional homes.
""How does this (unrest) affect you buying exposure to a good asset that has presence in China, and is growing? None of those things have any correlation with the Hong Kong protests,"" said a senior banker with a global investment bank.
""I don't think I have received even one phone call saying 'we shouldn't be doing this IPO because of what's happening in Hong Kong’,"" said the banker, declining to be named due to sensitivity of the issue.
Companies raised $15 billion in new listings in Hong Kong in the first nine months of 2019, second only to New York, according to Refinitiv data.
While the protests have hurt tourism and retail sectors, threatening to send Hong Kong into its first recession in a decade, its proximity to the massive Chinese market and locally listed firms' presence there are more important, bankers and analysts say.
Already, the Hong Kong stock market has shown signs of steadying after initial falls as equity investors look for bargain hunting opportunities, they said.
The benchmark Hang Seng stock index (HSI) rallied about 1.4% last month, but is still down 6.1% since mid-June when the unrest began.
""I think people are getting used to the weekly events,"" Steven Leung, executive director for institutional sales at brokerage UOB Kay Hian, said of the protests.
""The impact was seen in the initial one to two months in share prices, and mostly in retail, property and tourism,"" he said. ""(But) the index mostly reflects onshore Chinese market and economy. Hong Kong companies' share is not that big.""
FUNDRAISING NEEDS
What started as protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial have evolved into broader calls for greater democracy, among other demands in Hong Kong.
Demonstrators are frustrated at what they see as Beijing's tightening grip over the former British colony, which returned to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula intended to guarantee freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
After the initial nervousness about the unrest, things are looking up again in the financial markets, partly aided by hopes that Beijing would not take any step that would imperil the prospects of its only offshore financial center, analysts said.
""The question is whether people think there is a replacement. Hong Kong still has quite a big investor pool,"" said Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis.
As many as 40 companies have filed IPO applications with the Hong Kong stock exchange in September, according to information available on its website, the highest pace of filing since March this year.
In addition to the Budweiser APAC IPO, Topsports International Holdings, the sportswear business of Chinese footwear retailer Belle International, last week launched a Hong Kong IPO of up to $1.2 billion. Companies expected to launch Hong Kong IPOs within a month include ESR Cayman Ltd, a developer and manager of logistics facilities, planning to raise about $1 billion, and a $1 billion-plus float of Prague-based consumer lender Home Credit.
ESR and Home Credit declined to comment.
""A deal can always get done if the price is right, no matter what the market conditions are,"" said James Wang, co-head of equity capital markets in Asia ex-Japan, at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), referring to the broader IPO market.
""An IPO's timetable is driven more by the company's need to raise capital so in most cases, market conditions have to be severe to override that need and delay a deal.""
SOLID DEMAND
Investors including sovereign wealth funds and large global funds that invested in recent offerings are enthused by the lower valuations as well as long term business prospects, bankers said.
Budweiser, which relaunched its IPO last month after cancelling plans for a bigger float in July, priced the offering at the low end of the indicative range.
E-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) in August also delayed plans for a $15 billion listing in Hong Kong because of the political turmoil.
But such caution has not badly dented the demand for new and listed stocks.
In another sign of solid demand, net purchases on southbound stock connect that allows mainland-based investors to buy Hong Kong stocks - reached $8 billion in August, the most since January 2018.
Other markets in Hong Kong are also holding up.
Demand from homebuyers in the world's most expensive property market has shown little signs of weakening due to the protests.
Property firm  Wheelock  (HK:0020) sold 80% of its 816 flats in the development since late August, lower than sales at other launches this year, but ""still good"" given the current environment, property agents said.
Still, other factors including the U.S.-Sino trade war and slowing global growth have been affecting financial markets and asset prices in Hong Kong, as they have elsewhere.
Sean Taylor, APAC chief investment officer at fund manager DWS said Hong Kong could benefit more than most if China and the United States reach an agreement on trade. In the meantime, investors needed to be patient.
""You've got to accept the situation that tourism levels are down, retail sales are down, property prices may come down a bit – you're going to be in a slow environment for a while,"" Taylor said."

The company, which launched two new cameras including a ramped up version of its ""HERO"" line on Tuesday, said it would ship the cameras in the fourth quarter instead of the third quarter as planned earlier. 
The action camera maker said there was a ""late stage production delay"" that would lead to a fall in revenue, but did not provide any details. 
The company forecast annual growth of 6% to 9%, well below its previous estimated rise of 9% to 12%. 
GoPro is trying to differentiate its premium priced products from smartphones with advanced cameras, through its flagship HERO line and spherical camera Fusion, as it looks to lure back action junkies.
On Tuesday, the company launched Hero8 Black, priced at $399 and a new dual lens GoPro MAX camera at $499. It also slashed the price of its top-selling product Hero7 Black, launched last year. 
It now expects to post an adjusted profit of between 33 cents and 39 cents per share for the second half of the year, compared with its prior forecast of 37 cents to 49 cents.
The company trimmed its 2019 revenue forecast to between $1.22 billion and $1.25 billion, from a prior forecast of $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion. 

Shares of the California-based company were on track for its worst intraday performance this year, if losses hold on Thursday.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 06:28PM ET</span>","U.S. widens trade war with tariffs on Airbus planes, French cheese, Scotch whisky","By Tim Hepher, Philip Blenkinsop and David Lawder
LONDON/BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday said it would enact 10% tariffs on European-made Airbus (PA:AIR) planes and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal EU aircraft subsidies.
The announcement came after the World Trade Organization gave Washington a green light to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods annually in the long-running case, a move that could ignite a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war.
The U.S. Trade Representative's target list for EU tariffs, set to take effect on Oct. 18, includes large Airbus planes made in France, Britain, Germany and Spain for 10% tariffs.
But no tariffs will be imposed on EU-made aircraft parts used in Airbus' Alabama assembly operations nor those used by rival U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA), safeguarding U.S. manufacturing jobs.
Instead, the list heavily targets the four Airbus consortium countries with tariffs, including French wine, Spanish olives, British whisky, sweaters and woolens and German tools and coffee. 
Cheese from nearly every EU country will be hit with the 25% tariffs, but Italian wine and olive oil was spared, along with European chocolate.
""Finally, after 15 years of litigation, the WTO has confirmed that the United States is entitled to impose countermeasures in response to the EU’s illegal subsidies,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.
""We expect to enter into negotiations with the European Union aimed at resolving this issue in a way that will benefit American workers,"" Lighthizer added.
WTO arbitrators said Boeing had lost the equivalent to $7.5 billion a year in sales and disruption to deliveries of some of its largest aircraft because of cheap European government loans to Airbus.
The decision, confirming a figure reported by Reuters last week, allows Washington to target the same value of EU goods, but bars any retaliation against European financial services. 
It is part of a two-way dispute that diplomats and trade experts expect to lead to tit-for-tat European import tariffs against U.S. goods next year over state subsidies for Boeing.
The Trump administration asked the WTO for an emergency meeting to give the formal ratification needed for tariffs in mid-October.
Earlier this year, U.S. trade officials floated a $25 billion list of European targets from planes to helicopters, wine, cheese, spirits and luxury goods. Goods from EU countries that are not part of the Airbus consortium, such as Italy would still be targeted, a USTR official said, because European Union nations all bear responsibility for the situation. 
Broad selling amid worries over slowing global growth that had punished European stocks earlier on Wednesday accelerated as the ruling revived worries about damage to the already-ailing regional economy. The pan European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) finished down 2.7%, its worst day since December 2018. 
Airbus shares closed down 2%.
Wall Street's main indexes suffered their sharpest one-day declines in nearly six weeks on Wednesday after employment and manufacturing data suggested that the U.S.-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the U.S. economy.
WAR OF ATTRITION
The world's two largest planemakers have waged a war of attrition over subsidies at the WTO since 2004 in a dispute that has tested the trade policeman's influence and is expected to set the tone for competition from would-be rivals from China.
The WTO had already found that both Europe's Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in the world's largest corporate trade dispute.
The global trade body is due to decide early next year on the level of annual tariffs the EU can impose on U.S. imports.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the decision would weigh on the European planemaker, which is one of Germany's largest industrial employers and is headquartered in France. 
Before any tariffs can be imposed, the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body must formally adopt the arbiters' report in a process expected to take between 10 days and four weeks. 
Its next scheduled meeting is on Oct. 28, but Washington's request could bring that forward to Oct. 14.
'LOSE-LOSE' TRADE WAR
While the level of tariffs amounts to less than three days' worth of trade between Europe and the United States, importers led by U.S. airlines that buy Airbus jets have urged Washington to be selective when choosing industries to hit in order to avoid causing collateral damage to the U.S. economy.
EU manufacturers are already facing U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to penalize EU cars and car parts. The EU has in turn retaliated.
The Trump administration believes tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade, and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to U.S. products. 
Airbus has said this would lead to a ""lose-lose"" trade war and has published a video stressing its contribution to the U.S. industry through local assembly plants and 4,000 direct jobs.
Not all analysts see the WTO's aircraft subsidy row - with its thousands of pages of legal and aeronautical jargon - inflaming broader international trade tensions.
""In some ways it is a distinct issue from the rest of the Trump trade wars,"" said Constantine Fraser of UK research firm TS Lombard. 
""I think the White House is going to be aggressive in pursuing this, but I don't think there is necessarily any kind of read-through from this to the prospect of tariffs on cars.""

904,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Sees Worst Loss Since August on Global Economic Fears,"Investing.com – U.S. stocks suffered their worst losses since late August on Wednesday as worries built up about slowing global growth.
The selloff in the United States followed a nasty slump in Europe, with indexes in Germany, the U.K. and France falling around 3%. The violence of the slump boosted expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
The S&P 500 was down 1.79%. The Dow fell 1.86% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.56%. The Nasdaq 100 Index, weighted toward big technology companies, fell 1.74%.
The Dow was off as many as 598 points before bargain hunters stepped in and trimmed the losses nearly down to about 400 points before late selling set in again. It closed off nearly 500 points. The S&P and Dow have fallen about 3% in two days, with the Nasdaq dropping 2.7%.
U.S. stocks have been buffeted by the ongoing U.S.-China trade fight and slowing economies elsewhere, especially Europe. Both the trade fight and slowdown issues are starting to affect domestic manufacturing and financial stocks. The issues have been visible since the market peaked in mid-July. 
The S&P 500 is now down 4.64% from its July all-time high. The Dow's decline is 4.8% and the Nasdaq's is 6.65%. But it should be noted stocks for the year are still up nicely. The problem is that most of the gains came in the first quarter as equities recovered from last year's ugly fourth-quarter slump.
Only one of the 30 Dow stocks was higher. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) moved up 1.55% after settling an opiod suit in Ohio for $20 million. Only 10 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index showed gains, led by payroll processor Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) and   Charter Communications   (NASDAQ:CHTR). 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dropped 2.5% with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) down 1.29% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) off 1.77%. 
Energy, consumer staples and financials were the weakest sectors, all falling more than 2%. Industrial stocks were off 1.9%. No S&P 500 sector was positive on the day.
An exception was homebuilder   Lennar   (NYSE:LEN), up 3.77% after easily beating expectations for third-quarter earnings. Shares of the second-largest builder (by units sold) briefly hit a 52-week high of $57.92.
Lennar was top performing S&P 500 stock, followed by Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Charter Communications  (NASDAQ:CHTR). 
Among the biggest S&P 500 losers were retailers, including Macy’s (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), L Brands (NYSE:LB) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN). 
The selloff helped push oil prices and oil stocks lower. West Texas Intermediate crude  fell 98 cents to $52.64 a barrel and is off 5.85% this week. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell $1.20 to $57.69.
Gold futures jumped $18.90 to $1507.90 an ounce, along with other precious metal prices, as investors sought safety. They also sought safety in bonds. The 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 1.601% from Tuesday's 1.644%."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday that aircraft operators must inspect 165 Boeing 737 NG airliners for structural cracks within seven days after the issue was found on a small number of planes.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) notified the FAA of the issue after it discovered structural cracks on an aircraft undergoing modifications in China. The FAA said subsequent inspections found similar cracks in a small number of additional planes. The FAA said planes with fewer flights will eventually get inspected. 
The order covers a total of 1,911 U.S. registered planes. 
The inspections can be done visually and should require about an hour per airplane, the FAA said.
The cracks are on what is known as the ""pickle fork"" -- a part that attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure and manages forces.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines Inc (O:AAL) are among carriers that fly the 737 NG. The NG includes the 737-600, -700,-700C,-800, -900, and -900ER.
Southwest said it began the inspections on Tuesday and will fully comply within the required time. The company said it has not found any ""unusual findings.""
The airline added it has ""developed a schedule to perform overnight inspections"" and does not expect operational disruptions.
American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said none of the company's 737-800 fleet ""fall into the seven day requirement."" The company anticipates around 80 737-800 aircraft will require this inspection in the next eight months and the inspections will not impact its operation.
The FAA said the inspections would look for ""cracking of the left and right hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps."" The FAA said the issue ""could adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane and result in loss of control of the airplane.""
The 737 NG is the third-generation 737 and version before the now grounded 737 MAX, which is not impacted by the issue. Boeing said on Friday it has been in contact with 737 NG operators about the discovery of cracks, but added that ""no in-service issues have been reported.""
Reuters and other outlets late on Friday reported the planned inspections, but the FAA had not discovered overall details. The order will take effect on Thursday.
Aircraft with more than 30,000 cycles must be inspected within seven days, while planes between 22,600 and 29,999 cycles must be inspected within 1,000 cycles, which typically correspond to the number of flights. The FAA wants operators to ""report their findings to the agency immediately.""

United said it also does not fall under the 7-day time frame and 80 of its airplanes are ""between the 22,600 and 29,999 cycles"" and will be inspected as required.

906,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 04:54PM ET</span>",Wall Street tumbles as trade war threatens U.S. economy,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes suffered their sharpest one-day declines in nearly six weeks on Wednesday after employment and manufacturing data suggested that the U.S.-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the U.S. economy.
Adding to trade concerns, the United States won approval on Wednesday to levy import tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods over illegal EU subsidies handed to Airbus (PA:AIR), threatening to trigger a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war. 
All 11 major S&P sector indexes fell, with energy (SPNY) and financials (SPSY) each down more than 2%.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private payrolls growth in August was not as strong as previously estimated, and said ""businesses have turned more cautious in their hiring,"" with small enterprises becoming ""especially hesitant.""
That added to fears sparked on Tuesday when a report showed U.S. factory activity contracted to its lowest level in more than a decade. 
""The fact the manufacturing side of the economy in the U.S. and globally is doing badly shouldn't come as a newsflash to anybody. But the extent of the miss yesterday is something that's driven this two-day move,"" said Greg Boutle, head of U.S. equity and derivative strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
The recent weak data has shaken investor faith in the strength of the domestic economy, which had shown relative resilience in the face of slowing global growth. Confidence in the U.S. economy has helped support Wall Street this year.
""If China buys less from us, we have less to manufacture, fewer orders to fill. This data is indicating we are not immune to this trade dispute, that it's hurting us as well as China,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
The focus is now on the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive jobs report on Friday for further clues on the health of the U.S. economy.
The S&P 500 (SPX) and the Dow (DJI) slipped below their 100-day moving averages for the first time in about a month. Many investors believe that falling below such moving averages means the indexes are likely to fall further.
The S&P 500 is now about 5% below its all-time high hit in July after coming within striking distance of the mark two weeks ago. Over the past 12 months, the S&P 500 is down about 1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dropped 1.86% to end at 26,078.62 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.79% to 2,887.61.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) fell 1.56% to 7,785.25.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.0 billion shares, compared with the 7.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX (VIX), an options-based gauge of investor anxiety, rose 1.9 points to 20.47, its highest in about a month.
Activision Blizzard Inc (O:ATVI) dropped 1.2% after Bernstein downgraded the videogame maker's shares to ""market perform.""
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) shares fell 3.3% after the carmaker reported a fall of about 5% in U.S. auto sales for the third quarter. General Motors Co (N:GM) slumped 4.0% after its quarterly sales came in slightly short of U.S. car shopping website Edmunds' forecast. 
Among bright spots, homebuilder  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) rose 3.8% after the company reported a better-than-expected profit as cheaper mortgage rates led to higher demand for its homes.
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) gained 1.5% after the drugmaker said it will pay $20 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, allowing it to avoid an upcoming federal trial seeking to hold the industry responsible for the nation's opioid epidemic.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.75-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded four new highs and 182 new lows.

908,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 04:36PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Jobless Claims and Services Data Due
Thursday’s slate of economic data, including initial jobless claims and the ISM non-manufacturing index, will likely come under added scrutiny in the run-up to the crucial nonfarm payrolls due Friday. The economic calendar has a sprung a few negative surprises so far this week.
The Labor Department at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims rose to 215,000 from 213,000 the previous week.
An ISM survey on services sector activity is due at 10:00 AM ET.
Economists expect that the ISM non-manufacturing PMI for September will show a decline to a reading of 55 from August’s reading of 56.4. A reading above 50 signals non-manufacturing economy is expanding.
At the same time, the Commerce Department is expected to release an update on factory orders for August.
Factory orders are expected to have fallen 0.2% in August.
2. Sterling in Spotlight
GBP/USD swung wildly Wednesday as traders digested U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s a new Brexit plan -- a five-point offer that includes an alternative to the contentious Irish backstop.
And cable will likely be in action Thursday as officials in Brussels have already begun to poke holes in the new Brexit plan, with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker citing “problematic points” in the proposal and insisting it needed work.
Johnson on Wednesday warned the EU to match his compromise on Brexit or risk Britain leaving the economic bloc without a deal.  
3. PepsiCo, Costco) Earnings on Watch
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is slated to report earnings before the opening bell tomorrow, with many expecting its snack business to continue to underpin performance.
The company recently has spruced up the snack business by adding healthier options.
In its second-quarter report, the beverage and snack maker said it expects its fiscal 2019 organic revenue to grow by 4% and adjusted earnings per share, assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates, to decline by 1%.
Pepsi is expected to report earnings of $1.50 per share on revenue of about $16.9 billion.
Despite a 2.5% loss on Wednesday, shares are up 21% this year, reflecting an investor preference for stability.
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), meanwhile, is expected to report earnings after the closing bell.
Ahead of its earnings, the retailer early last month reported that comparable-store sales rose 5% through most of the fiscal fourth quarter.
Costco will also update investors on subscriber trends with renewal rates – often used as a barometer of Costco’s future growth and a key driver of its earnings growth – likely to garner added investor attention after Bernstein recently warned that the company is facing peak membership numbers.
Costco is expected to report earnings of $2.54 a share on revenue of about $47.5 billion.
Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has been one of the year's strongest big-cap stocks. It was up 0.4% Wednesday, in spite of the day's market drubbing, and is up nearly 40% on the year."
909,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 04:26PM ET</span>",Short sellers circle cannabis stocks as profits dwindle,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's love of cannabis appears to be going up in smoke as vaping-related ailments and missed revenue projections are prompting short sellers to raise their bets against the industry, fund managers and analysts said on Wednesday.
Short interest in cannabis stocks, which reflects bets that prices will fall, has risen 55% for the year to date, handing short-focused investors more than $2 billion in profits over the period, according to data released by research firm S3 Partners on Monday.
More than 800 cases of a vaping-related lung disease and 12 deaths across 10 U.S. states have so far been reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leading states such as Massachusetts to impose temporary bans on all vaping products. Those numbers are expected to climb.
A pushback on vaping could put further pressure on companies such as  Curaleaf  Holdings Inc (CD:CURA) and  Aurora Cannabis  Inc (TO:ACB), whose stocks suffered drops of 10% or more after missing revenue projections in their most recent quarters.
Fund managers say increased short selling is a sign that the industry is transitioning from a can't-lose proposition to a shakeout that will leave only the highest-quality companies standing.
""We've been through the golden ages in the sector where you had high growth models and unsustainable price speculation because it was a hot new idea,"" said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, who has focused on cannabis stocks. ""Now the gold rush talk is gone and you're going to see a rationalization of the business.""
As a result, Underhill is focusing more on companies like  iAnthus  Capital Holdings Inc (CD:IAN), which recently hired senior executives from  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO),  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and Hewlett-Packard, and is focused more on managing its balance sheet for long-term growth than expanding at any cost, he said. Shares of the company are down 65% for the year to date.
""This is going to start being a story of haves and have-nots very soon,"" he said.
Short-selling will likely continue to weigh on share prices until legislation allows more giant fund companies such as Fidelity Investments Inc and T. Rowe Price (O:TROW) to take larger positions in cannabis companies, said Brett Hundley, an analyst at Seaport Global.
""It's going to be a while before big institutional investors can access the cannabis space and that takes away the incremental buyer that could push stock values up,"" he said.
That lack of support from capital markets will also weigh on companies trying to expand in newly opened markets such as Illinois and Massachusetts, making it harder for those with weak balance sheets to survive, he said.
Yet some fund managers maintain that the short-selling is already overdone, with the possible health benefits of cannabis boosting its long-term appeal.
""There's a little bit of a feeding frenzy happening right now and everything good is getting thrown out along with the bad,"" said Dan Ahrens, portfolio manager of the actively managed AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (P:YOLO)."

(Reuters) - The Big Three U.S. automakers on Wednesday reported a rise in sales of pick-up trucks for the third quarter as lower interest rates boosted demand in an otherwise sluggish auto market.
Shares of General Motors (N:GM), Ford Motor (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) were, however, trading lower, tracking a broad selloff in the market over fears of a U.S. slowdown.
While higher vehicle prices and rising interest rates earlier in the year kept car shoppers on the sidelines, recent interest rate cuts helped sales in the third quarter.
Automakers in the United States are also focusing on selling larger SUVs and trucks that are more profitable, as sedans fall out of favor.
""Gas prices and interest rates remain at historically low levels ... (and) support our industry to 17 million plus level for what is now the fifth straight year,"" Mark LaNeve, Ford's vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service, said on a call with analysts.
There were concerns that GM's sales could take a hit after 48,000 hourly employees at the top U.S. automaker walked out for the first time in 12 years on Sept. 16 and remain on strike.
GM did not face a severe inventory crunch in the third quarter, as most dealers showed healthy supply levels heading into October, according to an analysis by automotive shopping website CarGurus.
However, the company risks facing parts shortage that could possibly affect sales in the current quarter, likely benefiting rivals including Ford. 
Sales of Silverado pick-up trucks jumped 16.6% to 155,482 vehicles, boosting GM's total U.S. sales by 6.3% to 738,638 vehicles.
Sales of Ford's pick-up trucks rose 5% to 240,387, their best third-quarter performance in 14 years, even as overall sales fell 4.9% to 580,251 units, hurt by lower demand for the company's passenger cars including the Taurus sedan.
Fiat Chrysler's sales of its Ram pick-up trucks surged 14% to 161,635, marginally lifting overall sales by 0.1% to 565,034 units.
GM's sales fell slightly short of U.S. car shopping website Edmunds' forecast of 748,746 vehicles, while Ford and Fiat Chrysler beat expectations. Edmunds had expected third-quarter sales for the industry to rise by 0.8% to 4.3 million vehicles, led by volume gains at GM.
Edmunds had forecast Ford's sales at 570,179 vehicles and Fiat Chrysler's at 558,302.
The results showed September U.S. light vehicle seasonally adjusted annualized pace was tracking 17.2 million vehicles, above consensus of 17 million, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said.

Shares of GM fell 4.7% to their near four-month low of $34.41, while those of Ford slumped 5.2% to more than six-month low of $8.44. Fiat Chrysler's U.S.-listed shares slipped 2.1% to $12.46.

The document, seen by Reuters on Wednesday, showed the number of people involved in the probe had risen to 87 from 68 originally under investigation, along with five banks and two diamond brokerages.
In a long-running scandal in a sector already tarnished by controversy, Italy's biggest banks are suspected of colluding with diamond brokers to scam their own customers.
They are alleged to have sold diamonds at vastly inflated prices while marketing them as sound financial investments.
The wrapping up of a preliminary investigation is usually the final step before prosecutors request a trial. There was no indication from the prosecutors whether a trial would be requested in this case, nor is there any certainty a judge would grant one.
According to the document, notifying the closure of the probe, those under investigation included former UniCredit country chairman for Italy Gabriele Piccini -- today a top manager at Intesa Sanpaolo.
UniCredit manager Remo Taricani, head of Sales & Marketing Retail until 2016 and today co-head of the bank's Commercial Banking Italy division, and Renato Miraglia, Unicredit's head of Investment Products in Italy until 2016, were also being probed, the document showed.
Lawyers for the three managers, contacted by email, did not comment.
In February prosecutors ordered the seizure of more than 700 million euros ($766 million) in assets from two diamond brokers, Italy's top lender UniCredit, Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) unit Aletti, Intesa Sanpaolo and Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS).
Prosecutors suspect the banks of fraud and, in some cases, of money-laundering for using the proceeds of diamond sales to boost profits.
Officials from Banco BPM are also suspected of corruption because broker Intermarket Diamond Business (IDB) invested some of its profits from the diamond sales in the banks' shares, according to evidence gathered by prosecutors.
All the banks involved, with the exception of Banco BPM, started reimbursing clients by re-purchasing the diamonds at the original price.
Banco BPM recognized the difference between the price paid for the diamonds and the fair value of the stones.
Intesa Sanpaolo, Monte dei Paschi and Banco BPM did not comment.
A spokesman for UniCredit said the lender never commented on ongoing proceedings. ""We are confident that the competent authorities will recognize the impunity of the Bank and of our colleagues,"" he said.
Lawyers representing the two diamond brokers did not reply to a Reuters email requesting comment."

Eni, the biggest foreign oil and gas producer in Africa, is currently on trial in Milan on graft allegations surrounding the 2011 acquisition of a giant Nigerian oilfield.
It has also been involved in a long-running corruption case involving its previously 43%-owned unit Saipem over alleged bribes paid to win contracts in Algeria. A Milan court acquitted it last year but the decision is subject to appeal.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) had been conducting its own investigation into the Nigerian and Algerian allegations independently of the Italian court cases.
On Tuesday, Eni issued a statement saying the DoJ had informed it that the investigation had been closed with no action taken.
Following Eni's statement, Italian prosecutors wrote to the DoJ seeking clarification and asking if the decision to close the inquiry was due to lack of evidence, as they said Eni's statement seemed to imply.
According to a reply filed with the court in Milan and seen by Reuters on Wednesday, a trial attorney for the DOJ said that in light of the ""misleading implication"" of a lack of evidence highlighted by the prosecutors, he was sending them a copy of the DOJ's original communication with Eni's counsel in the United States.
In that letter, the acting chief of the DOJ's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act unit said the inquiries had been closed because Italian authorities were prosecuting the case.
""If the circumstances noted above change, the Department may reopen its inquiries,"" he said.
Shortly after issuing its first English language statement on Tuesday, Eni issued a second version with a slightly different wording that removed a passage saying the DoJ decision confirmed investigations by independent advisers and Eni's own controlling bodies that found no illegal activity.
An Eni spokesman said the original statement had contained a translation error and had been replaced as soon as possible. He said the DoJ's statement that it could re-open the investigation if circumstances changed was in line with normal procedure.
""If the DoJ would decide to reopen its investigation based on events new and unknown, then Eni will cooperate again with the Department to further demonstrate that Eni and its management are not involved in any illegal conduct,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement.
On Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), which is also on trial over allegations surrounding the acquisition of the OPL 245 field in Nigeria, said it had been informed that the DoJ had closed its inquiry into Shell over the deal."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. and New York regulators on Wednesday fined two units of  BGC Partners  Inc (O:BGCP) $25 million to settle charges their brokers concocted fake trades to fraudulently induce clients to transact in foreign exchange options at unfair prices.
BGC Financial LP will pay a $15 million civil fine and GFI Securities LLC will pay $10 million, both divided equally between the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James.
The New York settlements also resolve criminal probes of BGC and GFI, which agreed to enter non-prosecution agreements, retain an independent monitor for one year, upgrade oversight and training, and cooperate with James' ongoing investigation.
BGC Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its chief executive, Howard Lutnick, who also runs the financial services company Cantor Fitzgerald, was not accused of wrongdoing.
Regulators said that in 2014 and 2015, BGC and GFI brokers reported hundreds of thousands of fake bids and offers for emerging markets foreign exchange options, a practice known as ""flying.""
The brokers allegedly did this to create an illusion of greater market liquidity and, sometimes, narrower spreads, to encourage clients to trade on their electronic platforms when they otherwise would not have.
James said BGC and GFI brokers also frequently reported fake trades, including thousands based on ""flown"" bids and offers, to encourage clients to enter genuine follow-up trades that would generate commissions.
BGC and GFI did not admit or deny wrongdoing in settling with the CFTC. They admitted to using fraudulent practices to solicit and accept orders to buy and sell options as part of their settlements with New York.
The New York settlements resolve claims under that state's powerful Martin Act securities law."

The second-largest U.S. homebuilder (by 2018 sales volume),  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) reported earnings of $1.59 a share on revenue of $5.86 billion, ahead of the consensus estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $1.32 per share on revenue of $5.48 billion. Earnings were up 20% from a year ago while revenue grew 3.4%.
Lennar rose 2.6%, shrugging off a 2.1% decline in the S&P 500. It hit a 52-week high of $57.74 in the early afternoon.
The earnings beat was driven by a surge in homesales as lower mortgage rates boosted demand. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped below 4% in the past week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's Weekly Mortgage Application Survey.
In its homebuilding segment, sales rose to $5.44 billion from $5.29 billion a year earlier, as the company sold 13,522 homes, an increase of 7%, while orders for new homes gained 7% to 14,469 in the quarter from a year earlier.  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) has operations in 15 states.
The company also said it was making progress in becoming a land-lighter company - decreasing captial tied up in land to boost cash flow -- with its controlled homesite percentage rising to 30%.
""We've clearly focused our attention on becoming a land lighter company. Regarding our forward-looking 40% goal of controlled homesites versus owned, during the quarter, we made great progress by increasing our controlled homesites from 25% to 30%,"" CEO Rick Beckwitt said.

919,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 01:06PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ships with one million tonnes of grain stuck outside Iran's ports in payment crisis,"By Jonathan Saul and Parisa Hafezi
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - More than 20 ships carrying around one million tonnes of grain are stuck outside Iranian ports as U.S. sanctions create payment problems and hamper the country's efforts to import vital commodities, sources directly involved in the trade said.
Trading companies such as  Bunge  (N:BG) and China’s COFCO International have been hit by payment delays and additional costs of up to $15,000 a day as the renewed U.S. restrictions stifle the processing of transactions, trade sources said.
Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from sanctions Washington re-imposed after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was walking away from a 2015 international deal over Iran's nuclear program.
But the U.S. measures targeting everything from oil sales to shipping and financial activities have deterred several foreign banks from doing any Iranian business, including humanitarian deals such as food shipments.
The few remaining lenders still processing Iranian business face multiple hurdles to facilitate payments as financing channels freeze up.
Six Western and Iranian sources said the situation was contributing to the cargoes being held up for more than a month outside Iran's biggest ports for goods, Bandar Imam Khomeini and Bandar Abbas.
The ships are carrying cargoes including soybeans and corn mostly from South America, the sources said. The grain vessels are also visible through ship tracking data.
""There are no restrictions on humanitarian business, but you can't get paid for it,"" one European source said. ""You can be waiting for months to get a payment.""
Another source said: ""There is nervousness among traders about making more sales to Iran before the backlog (of ships) is cleared.""
A senior Iranian port official, who declined to be named, told Reuters there had been problems since U.S. sanctions were imposed on its financial system in November 2018.
""What has changed is that now the number of banks, traders that are staying away from doing business with Iran is increasing,"" the official said.
Separate U.S. sanctions imposed in September on Iran's central bank - following attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia that U.S. officials blamed on Tehran - have added to difficulties with transactions.
The Iranian port official said these latest sanctions would scare away banks.
""Some small banks that we used to work with have informed us that they will no longer do business with us,"" he added, declining to name the banks.
An official with Iran's agriculture ministry said separately that Tehran had since the 1980s aimed to ensure the country had sufficient stocks of grain.
""We have increased the amount of stockpiles because of Trump's policy towards Iran and tensions in the past months,"" the official said. ""It is becoming more and more difficult because of the sanctions.""
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated last month that Iran’s total cereal stocks in 2019 would total 5.1 million tonnes, falling to 4.8 million tonnes in 2020, versus 9.9 million tonnes in 2016.

PRESSURE ON PORTS
Trade sources said Iranian ports were also struggling to process ships due to a lack of available berths.
Of the vessels still anchored, at least 20 dry bulk ships were waiting outside Bandar Imam Khomeini, Refinitiv data showed. A further two vessels had managed to discharge their cargoes after waiting for weeks, the data showed.
Separate data from shipping intelligence platform MarineTraffic showed a similar number of ships stationary for more than a month.
A separate Iranian government official confirmed that ships were waiting but declined to give details.
Trade sources said Turkey’s Halkbank (IS:HALKB) - one of the main banks that Iran has relied on for such humanitarian trade - had not been able to process payments fast enough because of the complexity of the process and in some cases did not complete transactions with suppliers. Halkbank declined to comment.
Suppliers have been left with additional costs, known as demurrage, of up to $15,000 a day as they wait to unload.
Trade sources said U.S. agribusiness group Bunge and China's COFCO International were among the companies affected, together with smaller Turkish and Iranian suppliers.
COFCO International declined comment.
Bunge spokesman Frank Mantero said: ""While we don't comment on or confirm commercial contracts, Bunge exports agricultural commodities in accordance with all applicable legislative frameworks.""
Two sources said the increasing difficulties had prompted U.S. agribusiness company ADM (N:ADM) to halt trading with Iran since August. An ADM spokeswoman declined to comment.
Trade sources told Reuters in December that Bunge and rival U.S. group Cargill [CARGIL.UL] as well as other suppliers had halted new food supply deals to Iran due to payment issues.
Cargill [CARGIL.UL] said in a statement: ""In certain countries where international sanctions exist, we provide that food using the humanitarian exception for medicine and food.""
A U.S. Treasury spokesperson said Washington designated Iran's central bank under its counter terrorism authorities, adding that the broad exceptions to the sanctions such as for humanitarian trade that once applied to transactions involving the central bank no longer applied.
The spokesperson also said the department continued to encourage the private sector and foreign counterparts to provide humanitarian assistance, if the transactions were conducted with Iranian financial institutions or entities that have not been blacklisted by Washington."

LONDON (Reuters) - A London-based former  Citigroup  (N:C) trader is suing the U.S. bank for more than $112 million, alleging it made materially false and malicious statements to U.S. prosecutors that led to his trial in New York on foreign exchange-rigging charges.
Rohan Ramchandani, the former European head of Citigroup's forex spot market trading desk, alleges in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday that Citigroup made false and ""gravely derogatory"" assertions against him to government investigators and the media after firing him in 2014 without cause.
""Ultimately, Citi quite literally fabricated an antitrust case for the United States Department of Justice against Ramchandani based upon knowingly false allegations that he engaged in market 'manipulation' and 'collusion',"" read the complaint filed in the federal court in Manhattan.
A spokeswoman for Citigroup in London said the bank rejected the allegations and would fight the case.
""Mr. Ramchandani's claims of malicious prosecution are without merit and we will contest them vigorously,"" she said.
A New York jury last year cleared Ramchandani, alongside two other London-based currency traders, of scheming to rig benchmark exchange rates in the $5.3 trillion-per-day foreign exchange markets after just hours of deliberation.
The verdict was a blow for U.S. authorities, which alongside Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had fined some of the world's most powerful banks -- including Citigroup -- a total of around $10 billion over the foreign exchange scandal.
The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) abandoned its own criminal investigation into currency rigging allegations in 2016, saying it lacked sufficient evidence for a successful prosecution.
Ramchandani alleges that a Citigroup lawyer, who is not named in the filings but who he said had ""full knowledge"" of the facts, had recognized that he had not engaged in intentional wrongful conduct or violated any law or regulation.
He also alleges his manager at Citigroup, an experienced forex spot market trader tasked with reviewing and evaluating Ramchandani's communications, had volunteered that Ramchandani had not engaged in ""collusion or price fixing"" and there was ""nothing criminal"" in his intent or actions.
Citigroup only pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currencies in order to pin the blame on Ramchandani and to limit the regulatory consequences for their senior managers and officers, the former trader alleged.
Ramchandani alleged that although he had been acquitted, Citigroup's conduct had cost him tens of millions of dollars, damaged his reputation and ended his successful and well-paid professional career.
He is demanding a trial by jury."
925,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>",EU leaders risk trade tension with carbon border tax to protect industry,"By Susanna Twidale and Barbara Lewis
LONDON (Reuters) - The new European Union executive risks stoking international tensions over trade and the environment even before it takes office in November by promising a carbon border tax to shelter its industry from the cost of cutting emissions.
Previous European Commissions have resisted calls, led by steelmakers and traditionally protectionist France, for a carbon levy on imports to protect Europe's relatively clean and expensive manufacturers from competition from cheaper production elsewhere.
But fresh momentum has come from increased prices in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the European Union's flagship instrument for making polluters pay, as well as a rising tide of protectionism led by the United States.
(GRAPHIC - Benchmark European carbon price: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6730/6712/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Until now, the Commission has handed out free ETS permits to tackle industry's complaints it is subject to ""carbon leakage,"" the term used to refer to the possibility high EU compliance costs will drive manufacturers to move their plants to lower-cost parts of the world.
But from 2021, companies will receive fewer free permits, boosting their costs just as they face investing in expensive new technology to enable the EU to reach a goal of climate neutrality by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement on curbing global warming.
Some lawyers say the Commission must be prepared to be pulled into trade conflicts or European industry will be destroyed.
""Either the EU prepares itself for and accepts the risk of retaliation or it simply allows other countries to continue with a major artificial advantage which will increasingly destroy EU manufacturing,"" Laurent Ruessmann, Brussels-based partner at Fieldfisher law firm, said.
History suggests the United States and China will respond if the Commission's proposal ever becomes law.
The United States, China and other foreign governments, accused the EU of acting beyond its jurisdiction when it tried to include international aviation in the EU ETS.
The attempt to charge all aircraft for their pollution led to threats from China to withhold multi-billion-dollar orders for Airbus aircraft, forcing the EU to suspend the law in 2012.
The United States mission in Brussels, which follows EU policy on behalf of the U.S. government, said it had no comment. No-one from the Chinese government could be reached for comment.
IMPORTANCE OF DESIGN
Much could depend on the design of any border tax, which so far is entirely unclear and in any case would require years of EU policy-drafting and debate to become law.
In policy guidelines, Ursula von der Leyen, the German president-elect of the new Commission, said she would introduce a carbon border tax, starting with selected sectors.
Acknowledging possible challenges, she said it ""should be fully compliant with World Trade Organization rules"".
Italy's Paolo Gentiloni, who is expected to oversee economic affairs in the new Commission, would have a leading role in the policy debate.
He said last week the design of a border levy would have to be ""carefully crafted to exert political pressure on climate laggards to take action, to ensure that EU companies can compete on a level playing field"".
Harro van Asselt, professor of climate law and policy at the University of Eastern Finland, said trade disputes could be avoided.
""Limiting the measure to trade-exposed, energy-intensive industries is sensible from an economic, environmental and legal point of view,"" he said, adding it was also important for the European Union to consult other countries about the measure's potential impact.
The steel industry, represented by industry body Eurofer, said it welcomes the proposed border tax without commenting further. ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), the world's biggest steelmaker, has said it wants a carbon border tax, but did not respond to questions for this article.
The sector has not yet said whether it would accept losing other support, in the form of free ETS permits, as demanded by environmental organisations.
The upstream mining sector, which provides coking coal and iron ore to make steel, has acknowledged it needs to address emissions from the use of its products. It has previously called for a global carbon price but so far has been ambivalent about a carbon border tax.
The world's leading miner BHP (AX:BHP) (L:BHPB), when asked about the idea, referred back to comments from CEO Andrew Mackenzie in July in London.
""I am a free trader. Naturally, when you start talking about border taxes, I get a little bit anxious,"" Mackenzie said.
The green lobby, meanwhile, worries that riling China -- which, unlike the United States, remains engaged in the ongoing U.N. effort to reduce global emissions -- could be counter-productive.
""You risk setting up a massive climate protectionism mechanism and it would not move decarbonization on,"" Sam Van den plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch said."

HONG KONG/PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Global luxury brands from Prada to Cartier are counting the cost to their businesses of four months of unrest in Hong Kong that has kept tourists away and forced shops to shut, with upcoming results set to reveal the damage.
Hong Kong, which ranks among the world's top five luxury destinations, has long been a magnet for brands attracted by the flow of visitors from mainland China. The city accounts for between 5% and 10% of the estimated $285 billion annual global sales of luxury goods, according to Bernstein analysts.
But data on Wednesday showed retail sales had fallen 23% in August from a year earlier - the biggest decline on record - while the value of sales of jewellery, watches and other valuable items decreased by 47.4%.
Visitor arrivals dropped 39%, with the number of mainland tourists to Hong Kong falling 42.3%.
""We don't see any light at the end of the tunnel,"" said the chair of Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Annie Yau Tse.
After the pro-democracy demonstrations started in June, the impact on second quarter results was muted, but that is expected to change in third quarter results as brands from Hermes to Tiffany grapple with store closures.
RBC analyst Rogerio Fujimori, who has just visited Hong Kong, estimates most brands will suffer sales declines of between 30% to 60% in the third quarter. Bain & Co now sees the global luxury sector growing this year at the low end of the 4% to 6% range, said analyst Claudia D'Arpizio.
Watchmakers in particular are likely to be hurt – Hong Kong is a major center for high-end timepieces – and Switzerland's Swatch Group (S:UHR) and Cartier-owner Richemont rely on Hong Kong for 11 to 12% of their global sales.
Around 30 major shopping malls had to shut down during anti-government protests which turned violent on October 1, marring celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The closures come during the annual Golden Week holiday – usually one of the busiest periods for retailers in the city.
""Business has obviously been very affected. We were losing lots of sales and now the closures make it harder. It's much harder for us to get customers,"" a Gucci salesperson at the brand's store in the Pacific Place shopping mall told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
SHOPS CLOSED
U.S. jeweller Tiffany, which counts Hong Kong as its fourth biggest market, has said the impact on its business has been material although it has invested in new shops - both in Hong Kong and mainland China - which it hopes will help counter some of the disruption to its sales.
""The traffic in shopping malls is nowhere where it used to be, and we are also struggling sometimes to keep our stores open,"" CEO Alessandro Bogliolo told Reuters in late August.
France's Hermes (PA:HRMS), which makes $10,000-plus leather Birkin handbags, said in September it had been forced to temporarily shut some of its five stores as well as an airport shop in Hong Kong.
Chanel put a fashion show planned for Nov. 6 to present its ""Cruise"" collection on hold, saying it would happen at a ""later and more appropriate moment.""
But most companies are not rethinking their business plans more drastically yet and Tiffany went ahead with the opening of its One Peking Road flagship store in September as planned.
Some luxury brands, like LVMH (PA:LVMH), are likely to be able to absorb the hit thanks to rising demand in mainland China and other Asian countries - Hermes has already said as much.
LVMH, which makes around 6% of its revenue in Hong Kong, kicks off the industry's reporting season on Oct. 9. It declined to comment on the impact from the protests so far. Its big sales drivers like handbag maker Louis Vuitton or fashion label Christian Dior have been enjoying strong demand in recent months from mainland China, echoing trends at Kering's (PA:PRTP) powerhouse Gucci.
CHINESE TOURISTS SHOP ELSEWHERE
Lots of rich Chinese tourists are going on shopping trips to Japan instead of Hong Kong, an industry source said. South Korea, Australia and Singapore are also benefiting from Hong Kong's decline, analysts say.
Chinese customers have also been encouraged to shop at home by the government's import tariff and VAT cuts. But some brands in turnaround mode, including Italy's Tod's (MI:TOD) or even recovering fashion label Prada (HK:1913), have not seen as big a bounce on the mainland as LVMH or Hermes.
""For those groups that have a well developed retail network across Asia, the Hong Kong protests do not necessarily mean losing money,"" said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein.
As an example, Solca said that winter jacket maker Moncler (MI:MONC), whose CEO Remo Ruffini sounded a cautious note on the group's outlook for 2019 because of the turmoil, had about 30% fewer stores in mainland China than Gucci or Vuitton.
Luxury goods in Hong Kong are also cheaper than in mainland China - in the case of fashion, the price can halve.
""Some Chinese could decide to buy fewer items - or just wait for the protest to end, whenever that might be,"" Solca said.
In the meantime luxury firms are asking Hong Kong landlords to cut their sky-high rents.
Local press reports say Prada plans to quit its 1,400 square meter store right in the retail heart of Hong Kong next year because of dwindling sales. Jefferies analysts said the landlord of that building is negotiating a 44% cut in rental costs. Prada declined to comment.
All major brands are trying to renegotiate rental terms, according to a second industry source, as they look to cushion themselves from the impact of the protests.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 11:01AM ET</span>",French Suez shares slide as new strategy seen lacking clarity on dividend,"By Geert De Clercq
PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in French waste and water group Suez (PA:SEVI) dropped more than 6% on Wednesday after its new chief executive unveiled a four-year plan to boost earnings but lacked clarity on dividends and planned asset sales.
The plan unveiled on Wednesday by Bertrand Camus, who was appointed in May, follows an appeal in July by activist investor Amber Capital for a review of the utility's strategy to create more value for its shareholders.
Camus' 2020-2023 strategy focused on boosting earnings per share, cutting costs and selling assets, but he declined to say which assets the firm may sell and gave no date for a long-awaited dividend increase. 
Unlike bigger sector peer Veolia (PA:VIE), which has increased dividends over the past four years, Suez has kept its dividend unchanged at 0.65 euro for a decade.
""We will maintain the dividend at 0.65 euro in the next two years and then we want to be able to make it grow in line with earnings ...as soon as the dividend is well-covered by earnings per share and cash flow,"" Camus said on an earnings call. 
Despite repeated questions about the dividend during a nearly three-hour analyst conference, he refused to be pinned down on when Suez may boost payout. 
Chief Financial Officer Julian Waldron said Suez hopes that towards the end of the 2021-2023 plan, solid earnings will allow it to increase its dividend. 
""That is not necessarily after the end of the plan, it could also be before,"" he said. 
Dividend payments are a key element driving share prices, especially for utilities, which tend to have higher payout ratios and more steady dividends than other industries. 
Suez shares fell over 6%, its biggest one-day drop in nearly 1-1/2 years.
COST CUTS
Brokerage Oddo said in a note the new Suez strategy plan lacked detail and downgraded the stock to neutral from buy. 
Camus said that by 2021, Suez wants to have recurring earnings per share (EPS) of 0.8 euros, from 0.47 in 2018.
The group plans to cut costs by 1 billion euros ($1.09 billion) by 2023 compared to 2018, cutting costs by an additional 250 million every year, with nearly half of these savings already in place by 2021. 
Camus said these cuts would focus on procurement and operations, not on staff costs. 
Suez also wants to grow the share of revenue from outside the European Union from 38% in 2018 to 60%, and it wants to push the revenue share from industrial customers from 41% to 50% as it reduces its reliance on cash-strapped municipal customers. He set no target dates.
It plans to sell businesses representing 15-20% of its 20.6 billion euro capital employed, or about 3 to 4 billion euros worth of assets to refocus its portfolio, but Camus declined to say which assets might be sold.

Suez also said it planned to book one-off charges worth 150-200 million euros this year and another 500-700 million mainly in 2020.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 10:31AM ET</span>",Renault chairman auditions narrowed field of Nissan CEO candidates,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) - The Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) CEO race has narrowed to a contest between three Renault-Nissan veterans, with Renault's chairman conducting interviews ahead of a Renault-Nissan alliance meeting scheduled for Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) chairman Jean-Dominique Senard spoke on Tuesday with the candidates in person in Paris or via TV conference ahead of Wednesday's meeting, the people said. 
Senard sits on the Nissan board's nominating committee, a post he received in June after a battle with Nissan executives.
Two of the candidates are Japanese company veterans - Nissan’s acting CEO Yasuhiro Yamauchi and former Nissan China chief Jun Seki. They are seen as the frontrunners, the sources said. But Nissan’s board and Renault have kept up dialogue with Indian-born Ashwani Gupta, and a possible external candidate.
Gupta, 49, joined Renault in 2006 in India as a purchasing manager, and was sent this year to Nissan’s alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) as chief operating officer.
Gupta was interviewed by Senard on Tuesday via TV conference, the sources said. 
The support of Renault, which has a 43.4% stake in Nissan, will be critical in winning the race, as will support from Japan’s trade ministry, which has intervened in Nissan’s affairs, sensitive to Renault's upper hand in the alliance.
A Renault spokesman declined to comment.
One issue Senard raised, according to the sources, was Nissan’s ability and willingness to defend its dividend payout, which was cut for the fiscal year ended March 31 following a 45% decline in Nissan’s operating profit. That dividend cut wiped 130 million euros ($146 million) off Renault’s 2019 earnings.
Nissan is forecasting earnings to continue to slip this fiscal year.
Yamauchi came out of his meeting in Paris with Senard smiling, according to one of the sources. Seki, meanwhile, also met Senard in Paris and told his colleagues he ""had a blast"" with the Frenchman, according to a message viewed by Reuters. 
TOUGH CHOICES
Relations between Renault and Nissan have been strained since the 2018 arrest in Japan of the alliance's architect, Carlos Ghosn, on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies. Nissan executives have pushed for a restructuring of the alliance and more independence from Renault.
The tensions contributed earlier this year to the collapse of a proposed merger between Renault and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA).
“We want (Nissan’s) board to pick a leader that can restore Nissan’s business and free us from all the politics we’ve been forced to cope with,” one of the sources told Reuters. 
The selection process highlights an internal debate over Nissan's strategy. Ghosn sought to combine tight cost control with ambitious expansion goals. But Nissan's profits have plunged to a ten-year low, undercut by low-margin sales to rental fleets aimed at propping up market share.
Nissan's next CEO faces a restructuring task, and tough choices about where to focus investment as China and Europe demand more electric vehicles.
Nissan’s board of directors has narrowed a list of candidates in part by using a business school style-CEO aptitude test to measure candidates’ leadership quality, sources said.
Yamauchi, the acting CEO, was groomed as a cost manager and climbed the ranks under Ghosn. He is favored by older top managers, people familiar with internal discussions said.
Seki is backed by younger leaders and is especially popular among rank and file employees who see him as more likely to chart a new course for Nissan. 
Seki has been leading the company’s recovery team which is looking at a deeper restructuring of the business that would shutter plants in some markets and exit certain global markets and vehicle segments."

937,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 09:46AM ET</span>","Merrill Lynch Hid Tax Fraud Profits, Ex-Trader Tells Court","(Bloomberg) -- Bank of America Corp.'s (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch unit was among lenders getting a share of the profit of clients’ so-called Cum-Ex trades, and tried to hide payments linked to the controversial tax-driven practice by masking them as unrelated futures, a former trader said in a German court.
Like other investment banks acting as prime brokers for Cum-Ex investors, Merrill Lynch charged the “industry standard” of 4% of the money generated through the double tax refunds, the ex-trader said Wednesday. The man, referred to as Darren T. because he can’t be identified under local law, appeared as a witness at a Bonn court in the case against two former bankers charged over the trades.
While always collecting “precisely 4%,” the banks didn’t bill the amount as a share of the profit but hid the money as service fees, such as charges for custody, clearing and leverage, he said. Merrill Lynch didn’t even want to charge regular fees, instead having customers pay it via an unrelated futures contract, Darren T. said.
“I think this way Merrill Lynch was not only hiding and veiling this to the outside world but probably internal groups were hiding it from each other,” the former trader said.
The testimony is part of the first criminal trial over Cum-Ex in Germany, where the scandal -- orchestrated mainly by London investment bankers -- is the biggest tax heist in the country’s history. The 45-year-old is the initial witness in the trial against former bankers Martin Shields and Nicholas Diable. They are charged with helping to orchestrate deals causing more than 400 million euros ($437 million) in lost taxes.
Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to comment. Macquarie spokesman Stephen Moir didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Darren T. worked on Cum-Ex deals at Macquarie Bank from 2005 until 2009, when he joined Zeta Financial Partners. Among other roles in the Cum-Ex deals, Macquarie acted as a prime broker for which it also charged the 4%, he said. ZFP was a company set up by former Macquarie bankers and traded heavily in Cum-Ex. Merrill Lynch was its prime broker, according to Darren T."

The Wall Street bank has unleashed its computer model to map the fallout from Britain’s tortuous bid to leave the European Union, one of the most intractable issues in world finance.
The good news: The hit to assets in a no-deal exit isn’t as bad as some fear. The bad: It’s still pretty ugly, and Morgan Stanley sees a 35% chance it will happen.
Here’s what the model said about the worst-case scenario in a report published Monday:
In equities, a no-deal Brexit will likely have a negative impact on European and U.K. stocks in the short term, but declines will be moderate (single-digit) rather than severe (double-digit). European earnings per share could drop as much as 5-6%; the FTSE 100 has downside potential of 3-5%.In currencies, investors selling risk assets following a no-deal could spur a bid for the euro, a hot funding currency, cushioning its fall. The Swiss franc should rally.In government bonds, Morgan Stanley anticipates a widening of about 25-35 basis points in the Irish 10-year spread relative to Belgium, Austria and Finland, while the spread to Bunds could potentially rise to 100 basis points.German government bonds will likely take their direction from gilts, with yields for the latter possibly rising. In corporate bonds, the ECB’s stimulus program should cushion non-financial debt somewhat. The team sees room for greater volatility in the assets that are not directly supported by the ECB’s purchases like high yield and corporate hybrids.To reach its conclusions, Morgan Stanley used an “input-output” framework to simulate how a change in demand in one country can be traced back through the sectors and countries that provide inputs into the final product. That allowed the firm to sketch out in fine detail a Brexit trading book.
In the process, it also helped them nab the award for understated headline of the year:
“Executive summary: Brexit is an important downside risk.”"

The claimants said Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., had illegally accessed details of Apple (O:AAPL) iPhone users' internet browsing data by bypassing privacy settings on the Safari browser between June 2011 and February 2012.
London's High Court ruled in October 2018 that Google's alleged role in the collection, collation and use of data from the browser was wrongful and a breach of duty, but claimants had not suffered ""damage"" as specified by Britain's Data Protection Act.
James Oldnall, lead lawyer on the case, said the Court of Appeal decision had ""confirmed our view that representative actions are essential for holding corporate giants to account"".
Richard Lloyd, the representative claimant in the mass action, said Wednesday's judgment ""sends a very clear message to Google and other large tech companies: you are not above the law.""
""Google can be held to account in this country for misusing people's personal data, and groups of consumers can together ask the courts for redress when firms profit unlawfully from 'repeated and widespread' violations of our data protection rights,"" he added.
Lloyd also said he expected a lengthy legal process.
Google said protecting the privacy and security of its users had always been its number one priority.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The president of Japan's Kansai Electric Power Co (T:9503) has no intention of resigning, he said on Wednesday, after admitting that he and 19 company employees had received payments and gifts worth 320 million yen ($3 million).
The scandal, at a time when the Japanese public's trust in nuclear power companies is already at rock-bottom, suggests that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push for better corporate governance still has a long way to go in the world's third-largest economy.
Shigeki Iwane, who admitted last week to receiving payments, told a news conference he wanted to stay in his position and regain the public's confidence.
""I want to fulfil my responsibilities by taking leadership in finding the cause of what happened and taking preventive measures,"" Iwane told a news conference broadcast live on NHK.
Kansai Electric earlier announced that its internal investigation found that 20 executives, including Iwane, had received cash, gift certificates and business suits from Eiji Moriyama, the now deceased deputy mayor of Takahama, where the company has a nuclear power station.
The report did not give an overall total of how much had been paid, but Iwane has previously said he and the others received 320 million yen in cash and gifts over a seven-year period.
Moriyama exerted influence over local government officials, the internal report said, and sought to influence them to support the local economy and use local businesses as suppliers.
The payments raise governance concerns because they were disclosed only after the matter was raised by the local tax bureau, said Moody's analyst Yukiko Asanuma.
""The cash payments ... add to existing negative public sentiment around nuclear power generation,"" Asanuma said.
BOX OF SWEETS
Iwane said on Wednesday that he was once given a gift by Moriyama that he thought contained sweets.
""When I opened it, I found gold coins in it. I tried to return the box but was told by our staffers it is difficult to return gifts to him. So I kept it in a safety box at our office,"" he said.
Iwane said that none of the executives had any intention of keeping the gifts and many had returned them to Moriyama.
Kansai Electric has long been reliant on nuclear power. Before the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power (T:9501), Kansai relied on nuclear reactors for nearly half of its electricity generation.
The Fukushima disaster, in which three reactors suffered a meltdown after a massive earthquake and tsunami, shattered public trust in nuclear power. Kansai Electric operates three reactors, the most among Japanese utilities.
The mayor of Osaka, the largest shareholder in Kansai Electric, is considering seeking a management reshuffle at the utility, the Mainichi newspaper reported on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - A major global share index hit its lowest level in a month on Wednesday on fears the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war is spreading to the U.S. economy and could further hurt global growth.
The dollar (DXY) steadied, having earlier been knocked off its highest levels in more than two years following data on Tuesday that showed a measure of U.S. manufacturing activity falling to its lowest in more than 10 years.
The index that measures the greenback against a basket of peers was up 0.14%.
A slowdown in U.S. economic growth would remove one of the few remaining bright spots in the global economy and come just as Europe is seen as close to falling into recession.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS), covering 49 markets, dipped 0.4% to its lowest since Sept. 4, after shedding 0.83% in the previous session.
European shares fell to their lowest in a month, with London stocks lagging the most. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 1.6%. (EU)
The FTSE 100 index (FTSE) slipped 2%, the largest drop across European regions, with the British pound also shedding 0.4% to the dollar.  [GBP/]
Adding to investor anxieties, European companies looked set for their worst quarterly earnings in three years as revenue drops for the first time since early 2018, according to the latest Refinitiv data.
On Wall Street on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.23% to hit four-week lows. Selling was triggered after the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) index of factory activity, one of the most closely watched data on U.S. manufacturing, dropped to the lowest level since June 2009.
Markets had been expecting the index to rise back above the 50.0 mark denoting growth.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 08:34AM ET</span>","Metro Bank shares up more than 30% on new bond deal, chairman's exit","By Lawrence White and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in troubled British lender  Metro Bank  (L:MTRO) rose by more than 30% on Wednesday after it announced the successful relaunch of a 300 million pound bond deal and the exit of its chairman and founder Vernon Hill.
The news follows a turbulent year for the bank whose shares have fallen as much as 90% since it disclosed a major accounting error in January. Its troubles intensified last month when it had to ditch a 250 million pound ($307.15 million) bond issue after failing to attract investors despite offering a hefty yield.
Metro successfully relaunched the bond sale on Wednesday at a higher yield of 9.5%, fulfilling an obligation to raise more regulatory capital by the end of the year.
The lender's shares, which rose 6% on the news of Hill's exit, rose as much as 31% by 1210 GMT after the bank said it had received orders worth 475 million pounds for the 300 million pound bond.
The bank had said in July that Hill, a U.S. entrepreneur who was the public face of the bank, would step down as chairman once a successor was appointed.
Metro Bank said on Wednesday that if the search for a new chairman was not completed by the end of the year an independent non-executive director would take on the role on an interim basis. Hill will also step down from the board.
A Metro spokeswoman said Hill would not be making any comment. 
Hill built a reputation in the United States and in Britain for taking on the banking industry by rolling out customer-friendly branches with brightly colored decor that stayed open longer than competitors.
He referred to customers as fans and regularly posed with his dog Duffy in publicity shots for the bank. 
But Metro's strategy of opening branches seemed at odds with a broader industry shift toward digital banking and Hill upset Metro Bank shareholders in Britain last year over payments made to an architecture company owned by his wife Shirley.
Hill had already attracted scrutiny in the United States over the use of the design company run by his wife at U.S. lender Commerce Bancorp. Commerce Bancorp was ultimately acquired by Toronto Dominion Bank (TO:TD). 
“We hope this change in leadership will help the Board draw a line under the governance issues at Metro Bank and focus on restoring shareholder trust and improving financial performance,"" said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of responsible investment Royal London Asset Management, a Metro Bank shareholder.

""The negative profitability impact for Metro Bank will only accelerate the need for a wider strategy recalibration and, potentially, further asset sales post-Brexit,"" said John Cronin, analyst at Dublin-based broker Goodbody.

Donovan, chief economist at the global wealth management unit, was put on leave in mid-June after his remarks in a saga known as “swinegate” sparked outrage in China and were condemned by local rivals. Donovan stayed clear of controversial remarks in his opening note on Wednesday, which covered topics from trade taxes to Brexit and global bond yields.
A frequent commentator in financial media, Donovan set off a furor during a discussion of Chinese consumer prices, which had risen because a pig virus drove up pork costs. The situation mattered, he said, “if you are a Chinese pig. It matters if you like eating pork in China.” Social media commentators quickly condemned the first remark, interpreting it as a derogatory reference to local people rather than to ill swine.
Even as many English speakers viewed the phrasing as innocuous, it set off a firestorm on Chinese social media. The comment was condemned by two Communist Party publications and by trade groups representing Chinese brokerages."

Kazuyuki Sasaki moves from managing director to CEO of WeWork Japan, an office-sharing venture jointly owned by WeWork and its biggest backer SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), the company said in a statement. 
Sasaki replaces Chris Hill, who had served as CEO since WeWork entered Japan in 2017.
WeWork's parent, the We Company, abandoned an initial public offering (IPO) in September following criticism of its valuation and corporate governance.
The loss-making start-up is looking to trim its workforce and slow expansion to preserve cash as it seeks alternative sources of funding, sources have told Reuters.
WeWork Japan has grown to 21 locations in 5 cities in just 20 months, in part by filling seats with SoftBank employees, with WeWork also designing the tech conglomerate's new Tokyo headquarters.
WeWork is a cornerstone bet for SoftBank's Vision Fund, which after burning through most of its first $100 billion fund is currently fundraising for a second. 

SoftBank, which owns nearly a third of the We Company, invested in the start-up at a $47 billion valuation in January, but the expected IPO valuation dropped as low as $10 billion before listing plans were dropped, Reuters reported.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) China factory aims to start production this month but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The U.S. electric vehicle maker aims to produce at least 1,000 Model 3s a week from the new factory by the end of this year, the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S. cars. 
The plant's mass production schedule is crucial for Tesla's hopes of reaching its total production rate at an annualized 500,000 vehicles by the end of this year.
The $2 billion factory - Tesla's first car manufacturing site overseas - gained key government approvals last month and is on schedule to start production in October, the sources said.
""We aim to start some production in October, but the actual production volume depends on many factors including car orders we received, performance of newly hired workers, supply chain and so on,"" a Tesla source told Reuters.
""It's unclear when we can reach the 1,000-2,000 units per week target,"" the person said, declining to be named as he was not allowed to speak to media.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. 
The factory is kicking into gear amid the U.S.-China trade war and weakness in China's auto market. Sales of new energy vehicles contracted for a second month in a row in August, and are likely to grow at a slower pace this year to 1.5 million vehicles, down from a previous forecast of 1.6 million, according to an industry association.
Tesla has fared better, with China sales rising 98% in the first seven months of this year thanks to strong demand for Model 3, according to research firm LMC Automotive.
NEW PHASE 
Tesla has embarked on a new phase of construction work at the factory in a sign of confidence in its China strategy. The new facilities will include battery pack production units, according to a company source and documents.
The so-called 1.5-phase works, which have not previously been reported, include a production workshop and an energy center, construction documents showed. Construction is scheduled for completion by around the end of this year. 
Tesla also is looking to hire battery-related production engineers in Shanghai, according to its job advertisements.
The plant, which Tesla says will be simplified and more cost-effective than its existing Model 3 line, will have 500,000 units of annual capacity when the second phase is completed, doubling from initial phase capacity of 250,000 vehicles. 
The factory, China's first fully foreign-owned car plant, is a reflection of Beijing's broader shift to open up its car market. 
Shanghai authorities have offered assistance to speed up construction, and China excluded Tesla models from a 10% car purchase tax on Aug. 30.
State partners of the Tesla project include Shanghai Construction Group (SS:600170), China Construction Industrial & Energy Engineering Group, State Grid [STGRD.UL], Power Construction Corporation of China (SS:601669), and MinMetals' [CHMIN.UL] Shanghai unit Baoye, according to multiple sources involved in the construction project.

950,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 06:58AM ET</span>",Generali CEO May Invest at Least $3.3 Billion for Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Assicurazioni Generali (MI:GASI), Italy’s biggest insurer, may invest at least 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to grow through mid-size acquisitions in insurance and asset management, according to Chief Executive Officer Philippe Donnet.
“I don’t believe in big consolidation, because of risk management, regulation,” Donnet said in an interview. “I believe there will be some aggregation in asset management and insurance in Europe -- some of the smaller companies won’t be able to deal with low interest rates for so long -- definitely we’ll be proactive in these aggregations.”
The Italian insurer aims to expand in growing markets to boost profit. As part of the effort, the company agreed to acquire Portugal’s second-largest non-life insurer, Seguradoras Unidas, and the service company AdvanceCare for 600 million euros in July. “After this acquisition, we still have at least three billion euros to invest for growth,” he said.
In insurance, the CEO is looking at mid-size companies focusing on non-life, health, benefits and assistance. While not discussing specific targets, he said continental Europe would be the focus of any insurance acquisitions. “We want to grow in countries where we are already present to become one of the top three players,” Donnet said. Malaysia, Thailand and Brazil, are also possible regions to search for targets, according to the executive.
In asset management, Generali is looking at possible deals in the U.S., Asia and Europe, including the U.K. Despite issues related to Brexit, the CEO is attracted to the U.K. because of the skills and expertise of London asset managers.
Generali is in talks to buy the Central European assets of MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET). and some of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA’s insurance businesses, people with knowledge of the matter have said.
Growth Plans
Generali’s strategic plan released last year predicts annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% annually by improving profitability in both insurance and money management and cutting debt. The CEO announced in November the firm will invest as much as 4 billion euros in acquisitions and internal growth over the life of the plan.
Life insurance providers are under pressure as a prolonged period of low interest rates hurts firms that buy bonds and other securities to meet payout obligations. As a large holder of Italian sovereign debt, Generali is vulnerable to swings in the value of government bonds driven by political turmoil.
“M&A is a good accelerator, but only if you’re successful” in terms of organic growth, Donnet said. “I’m convinced that we will find the right opportunities.”

The Turkey unit will have 943.5 million lira ($164.21 million) capital and the parent company had paid a quarter of that amount, the gazette said. The remainder will be paid in the next two years.
The unit will focus on designing, producing and assembling automobiles, trucks and other vehicles, the gazette said.
VW had been looking into a possible new plant in eastern Europe, with Bulgaria known to be among countries considered along with Turkey.
A board member of the German carmaker told reporters last week in Berlin that the company is nearing a decision on building the new plant in Turkey.
A spokesman for VW told Reuters on Wednesday that the company was still in the final stages of negotiation and that it had not made a final decision on the factory.

A deal in Turkey could be politically controversial given European Union concerns regarding what it sees as constraints on freedom of expression and demonstration rights under President Tayyip Erdogan. VW's argument is that Turkey is a candidate for EU membership.

Investing.com -- The man who saved   Tesco   (LON:TSCO) is leaving.
Dave Lewis said Wednesday he’ll step down in summer next year, nearly six years after taking over as chief executive when the U.K.’s largest food retailer was reeling from a false accounting scandal.
He called the decision ""a personal one,” in a statement accompanying the supermarket chain’s latest earnings which – true to form - revealed a 3.7% increase in currency-adjusted profits in the first half of its fiscal year, along with a sharp dividend hike, a doubling of cash flow from retail activities and a further reduction in net debt.
Lewis took over with Tesco’s share price languishing at the lowest in decades, its foreign operations a hot mess and its U.K. market share under pressure from pushy German discounters and online startups such as Ocado (LON:OCDO).
He never quite stopped the bleeding – Tesco’s market share of 26.9% in the 12 weeks through Sept. 8 is still down a couple of points from when he took over, and there is no sign of Aldi and Lidl going ex-growth yet. But there is no exaggeration in his statement Wednesday that: ““Our turnaround is complete, we have delivered all the metrics we set for ourselves. The leadership team is very strong, our strategy is clear and it is delivering. The  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) brand is stronger and customer satisfaction is the highest it has been for many years.”
While the 31% increase in the share price during his reign may not seem extreme, the wonder is that it happened it all, given the competitive environment and the relentless squeeze on U.K. consumer finances from Brexit, which has caused the U.K. to go from the top of the G7 growth league in 2015 to the bottom in 2018. No wonder that chairman John Allen said in the same statement that he accepted the resignation “with regret”.
Another aspect of the departure is the relatively smooth succession planning. Lewis is staying around until summer 2020, giving his designated successor Ken Murphy, a veteran of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), plenty of time to acclimatize.
That (along with the results and the dividend hike) helps to explain the stock’s 1.8% rise on a day when the FTSE 100 is down 1.5% and the rest of Europe is also in the red. The Stoxx 600 was down 1.2% and the German DAX down 1.1% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT).
It also means that Lewis will still be at the helm over what is set to be a tumultuous few months for  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), given the risk of a disorderly “No-Deal Brexit” at the end of the month or, perhaps, a couple of months later after a General Election. The erection of new border checks at U.K. ports is set to cause acute disruption to supplies of fresh food in particular, according to the British Retail Consortium, which said last month that government claims to the contrary are “categorically untrue”.
“Retailers will be preparing for Christmas, stretching already limited warehousing capacity, and the U.K. will be importing the majority of its fresh food from the EU, magnifying the impact of border delays,” the BRC said at the time. The Food and Drink Federation also predicts “significant and adverse changes to product availability, and random shortages” after a No-Deal Brexit.
“I will give the job everything I have until my very last day,” Lewis said, and  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) shareholders can be thankful for that. For Lewis, there’s the consolation that, whatever chaos Brexit brings, it will all be someone else’s problem before too long."

(Reuters) - European shares hit a one month-low on Wednesday, with London stocks lagging the most on fresh worries over Brexit, while global growth fears intensified after several dismal factory reports were released across the bloc and the United States.
The FTSE 100 index (FTSE) slipped 1.2%, the largest drop across European regions and ahead of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's talks with Brussels as he prepares to unveil his final Brexit offer later in the day.
Investors were also still reeling from the shock of dismal U.S. and euro zone factory data on Tuesday, which saw the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) and the euro zone index (STOXXE) log their biggest one-day drop in two months.
A drawn out U.S.-China trade war, along with slowing economic growth and Britain's dramatic exit from the European Union, have rattled European equity markets this year. The STOXX 600 gained around 2% in the third-quarter compared with 12% in the first three months of the year.
But more heartache may be around the corner as European companies could be set for their worst quarterly earnings in three years as revenue drops for the first time since early 2018, according to the latest Refinitiv data.
""It's going to be a tough season and the most important thing will be how the companies view going into Q4 and the early outlook for 2020, which is shaping up to be a tough year for markets and corporates,"" said Neil Campling, analyst at Mirabaud Securities.
Data on Tuesday from Europe's powerhouse - Germany - showed manufacturing recession deepening in the bloc's biggest economy. Frankfurt shares (GDAXI) fell 0.9% to their lowest level since early September, extending a drop from Tuesday.
Euro zone bond yields inched up on Wednesday, in a sign that investors were bracing for further deterioration in economic growth. All eyes are now on the release of service sector data from the euro zone on Thursday.
The STOXX 600 index (STOXX) dropped 0.9%, with the commodity-linked basic resources sector (SXPP) falling the most, tracking a drop in metal prices.
Finnish engineering firm  Metso  (H:METSO) fell 5%, the most on the STOXX 600 after J.P.Morgan and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) downgraded the company's stock.
In a bright spot, the travel & leisure sector (SXTP) gained 0.4% and was the sole gainer among the major European sub-sectors as gambling stocks outperformed.

Dollar bonds of   Yes Bank   Ltd. (NS:YESB), which has sizable exposure to the cash-strapped shadow lenders, slumped a record 5.5 cents to 80.9 cents on the dollar on Wednesday, the lowest since the bonds were sold in 2018.
The bank is at the epicenter of rising stress in India’s credit markets, where shock defaults last year by a major infrastructure lender have led to broader strains at other shadow banks. Yes Bank’s shares collapsed about 23% on Tuesday to the lowest since 2009, amid concerns that a cleanup in corporate debt could drag on. Debt woes among India’s non-bank lenders including Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. have also prompted jitters for the sector.
“The stock and bonds both are reflecting investor concerns on asset quality, where slower resolutions and rising stress could continue to pose pressure,” said Diksha Gera, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.
The drop in Yes Bank’s share price on Tuesday was “primarily on account of the forced sale” of 100 million shares, “triggered by an invocation of pledge on the equity shares of a large stakeholder,” the bank said in a statement on Wednesday. Its financial and operating metrics remain “intrinsically sound” and stable, with its liquidity position “well in excess of regulatory requirements,” it added.
A report had previously said that Yes Bank shares pledged by its co-founder Rana Kapoor, have been sold. The India stock market is closed today for a holiday.
Kapoor stepped down as chief executive officer earlier this year after the Reserve Bank of India refused to grant him another three-year term amid a controversy over bad-debt accounting.

957,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 04:22AM ET</span>",Here’s How to Track Trade Sentiment While China’s Closed for Golden Week,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors haven’t stopped playing the vagaries of the U.S.-China trade war just because the world’s No. 2 economy shut down to celebrate its 70th birthday. For a glimpse of sentiment on the mainland, they can turn to other other emerging markets instead.
It’s all about correlation. China tends to drive assets in the developing world, especially now that the trade battle has magnified swings in sentiment. Beijing’s decision earlier this year to let the yuan slip to the lowest in at least a decade triggered a slump in MSCI’s benchmark currency and equity gauges. The 50-day correlation between MSCI’s currencies index and the offshore yuan is above 60%, historically considered high.
“Although China is away, the crucial issue of the trade war hasn’t vanished and remains on the minds of investors,” said Piotr Matys, a London-based emerging-markets strategist at Rabobank. “If we have some remarks from U.S. officials that would suggest progress is unlikely, then investors are going to use the most liquid EM currencies.”
Nearby currencies with the highest contagion -- such as the Taiwanese dollar and Malaysian ringgit -- are the most correlated with China’s currency, based on weekly moves during the past 10 years. Yet the South African rand, which is often used as a proxy for broader sentiment, may be another gauge to monitor, according to Matys. Should the yuan weaken, “then other EM currencies will follow,” he said.

Even with China shut, there’s nothing stopping officials there or in the U.S. from offering up new trade rhetoric. Developing-nation currencies fell this week even after President Donald Trump’s administration played down a Bloomberg report on Friday that the White House was weighing limits on U.S. portfolio flows into China.
China reopens on Tuesday, and trade developments will almost certainly dominate the headlines, given than China’s chief negotiator Liu He is set to visit the U.S. that same week for further talks.
Exchange-traded funds traded in the U.S. can also show investor sentiment while Chinese markets are closed. The iShares MSCI China ETF -- known by its ticker MCHI -- fell as much as 1% Tuesday, the 10th decline in 12 days. Chinese equities seem to drive emerging-market ETFs more broadly, too; the performance of MSCI’s developing-nation gauge is almost identical to one that excludes China.
Money managers could look to Hong Kong or position with Chinese American depositary receipts, said Michael Hirson, New York-based practice head for China and northeast Asia at Eurasia Group. Hong Kong’s H-share index, which tracks mostly state companies listed in the former British colony, could provide some insights. Markets in nations closest to China’s economic cycle, such as Australia and Brazil could also be good proxies, Hirson said.
Emerging-market hard currency debt may be worth watching with China away, according to Damian Sassower, chief emerging-markets credit strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. He expects the Asian nation to maintain its outsized impact on emerging markets, with trade especially important.
Sovereign and corporate issuer revenues are often linked to global growth, which is essentially global trade with China, he said. The spreads of a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index tracking developing-nation hard currency bonds tends to follow China’s five-year CDS, a proxy for the sovereign credit risk, he said.
“It’s much more correlated when you’re talking about the impact of China on EM hard currency debt simply because of the way it trades,” he said. “It’s much more liquid.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Veteran investor Martin Gilbert will leave  Standard Life  Aberdeen (L:SLA) next year, ending a career spanning more than three decades at the helm of one of Britain's most successful asset managers.
The 500 billion pound ($613 billion) fund firm said former co-chief executive Gilbert, currently vice-chairman, would not seek re-election to the board at its annual meeting in May and would leave in September.
Gilbert oversaw the meteoric rise of Aberdeen Asset Management, the small company he co-founded in 1983 with just 50 million pounds in assets, to what became the country's biggest listed fund firm at the time of its 11 billion pound merger with Standard Life in 2017.
Touted as a strong tie-up of two of Scotland's biggest financial services companies, Gilbert and Standard Life peer Keith Skeoch initially shared the role of chief executive, despite some discontent from shareholders.
The unusual arrangement became a deeper problem, though, as persistent share price underperformance on the back of heavy outflows of client cash and broader corporate upheaval linked to the merger drew calls for change.
Former HSBC Chairman Douglas Flint was drafted in to lead the board and in March this year Gilbert stepped down from his role as co-CEO to become vice chairman.
""It has been an incredible journey, almost unimaginable from the earliest days when we were just three people in one office in Aberdeen,"" Gilbert said. ""I will leave the company in extremely good hands, and well positioned for further growth and prosperity.""
At 0724 GMT, shares in SLA were down 1.4%, slightly underperforming a 1% fall in the FTSE 100 (FTSE).
Until his departure, SLA said Gilbert would continue to focus on strengthening relationships with clients, winning new business and realizing the potential of its global network.
His key client, industry and regulatory relationships would be transferred to Flint and other executives.
The 64-year-old golf fan said he still harbored ""a great enthusiasm for growing and guiding businesses"" and was looking forward to ""fresh challenges"" in the next stage of his career.
The Financial Times reported in July that Gilbert was in line to take up a role as chairman of digital bank Revolut.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2019 02:58AM ET</span>",Tesco CEO Dave Lewis to step down in 2020,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -  Tesco  (L:TSCO) boss Dave Lewis will step down next summer after completing the turnaround of Britain's biggest retailer and hand the baton to Ken Murphy, a former executive at Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA).
Celebrating its 100th anniversary, Tesco, which has a 27.4% share of Britain's grocery market, is in the final stages of a recovery plan that Lewis instigated after a 2014 accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in its fortunes.
""With the turnaround complete and as we begin to implement the next steps of our sustainable growth strategy, now is the right time to plan a smooth and orderly succession,"" Lewis, who joined Tesco from  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) in 2014, said on Wednesday.
""As such, I will step down as group CEO next summer and pass the baton to Ken Murphy.""
The group has met the majority of its turnaround goals, including a key margin target of earning between 3.5 pence and 4 pence of operating profit for every pound customers spend.
Lewis has overhauled Tesco's relationship with suppliers, lowered prices versus competitors, simplified product ranges and improved store standards since taking charge. Jobs have also been cut, including 4,500 announced in August.
The 54-year-old has also pursued growth by buying wholesaler Booker, forming a global purchasing alliance with  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and launching a new discount format called Jack’s.
The announcement of Lewis's departure came as Tesco reported a better-than-expected first-half operating profit before one of items of 1.41 billion pounds, a rise of 25.4%.
The retailer said it had a ""strong start"" to the year and was well positioned to be highly competitive in a challenging market.
Lewis's successor Murphy was joint chief operating officer at Boots UK & Ireland before rising to executive vice president, chief commercial officer and president global brands at Walgreens Boots Alliance.
He left his executive position at the U.S. retailer at the end of 2018 but retained a consultancy role, Tesco said."

While the Zurich-based bank has decided to continue financial reporting in Swiss francs, Credit Suisse said it would calculate its Group Operational Risk risk-weighted assets in dollars to better align its capital usage to the main currency in which its risks originate.

""The increase in net interest income will be hedged over at least a two-year period,"" the bank said.

Westpac and ANZ's decision on Wednesday comes despite pressure from the country's Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to do so after the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its benchmark cash rate to an all time low of 0.75% on Tuesday in an attempt to kick-start the economy.
However, analysts have warned that the three rate cuts this year and any further central bank easing may inflict even more pain on Australian banks' net interest margins.
Westpac said it would lower variable home loan interest rates by 15 basis points, while ANZ said it would lower it by 14 basis points.
The move follows similar reductions by Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) hours after the RBA's cut.
The banks have argued that they face a difficult balancing act with rates approaching zero, which has raised questions about the effectiveness of super easy monetary policy.
The top four lenders have resisted public pressure in the past to fully pass on the earlier two central bank rate cuts to customers.

A SK Hynix official said it had selected an unnamed Korean company to supply high-purity hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is used in etching silicon materials and cleaning chips.
South Korean chipmakers have been looking for ways to cut their reliance on Japanese materials since Japan imposed curbs on exports of key input products into South Korea in July.
The SK Hynix official, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the company started using the Korean brand material this week after running a months-long quality test. The official said the company had not replaced the entirety of the Japanese HF materials with Korean products.
Local media reported earlier on Wednesday that SK Hynix was testing high-quality liquid hydrogen fluoride supplied by South Korea's Ram Technology Co Ltd. Ram Technology declined to comment.
Japan tightened restrictions in July on exports of three materials to South Korea, home to memory chip titans Samsung (KS:005930) and SK Hynix, threatening to disrupt the global tech supply chain.
Japan provides about 70% of the world's demand for the products: fluorinated polyimide, which is used in smartphone displays, and photoresists and high-purity hydrogen fluoride, which are both used for chipmaking.
With no sign of tensions between Tokyo and Seoul abating, Samsung has also stepped up testing of non-Japanese photoresists and hydrogen fluoride.
The restrictions were prompted by a decades-old row between the Asian nations over compensations for forced South Korean laborers at Japanese firms during World War Two."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tech specialists Raghav Maliah and Jung Min have been appointed co-heads of Goldman Sachs' (N:GS) mergers and acquisitions in Asia Pacific excluding Japan as former head John Kim moves to global private equity giant  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG).
Kim, a 19-year veteran of the bank's Asia business, joins Carlyle as a managing director of its Asian buyout team, and will lead its activities in Korea, according to a press release from the private equity group.
Goldman told staff that Kim was retiring from the bank and praised his role as a ""trusted advisor to many of our clients"" and his involvement in several industry-leading transactions, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Kim spent 19 years with the bank in Asia, moving between his native Korea and Hong Kong. He headed Goldman Sachs Korea before taking over the M&A division in 2014.
The bank also told staff on Wednesday that Maliah and Min, who currently co-lead the bank's technology, media and telecoms (TMT) business in Asia ex-Japan (AEJ), would assume leadership of Mergers & Acquisition (M&A) for the region too.
Maliah, who joined the bank in 2000 and made partner in 2010, is also global vice-chairman of Goldman's investment banking business.
Min, who became a partner in 2016, was also recently named co-chief operating officer of the bank's global TMT business.
""This commitment of senior bankers to our M&A franchise, with their deep experience across industries and geographies, will strategically align our team to capture the anticipated growth in merger activity in AEJ,"" the bank said in a memo to staff. 
The news comes as Goldman chief executive David Solomon marks one year at the helm of the Wall Street giant. In an internal podcast interview to mark the anniversary, Solomon said he had focused on making sure the bank's clients were the center of its thinking. 
""We're a divisional firm, we've always been a divisional firm, but I think there's a great opportunity to make sure for our clients that we're delivering the whole firm,"" he added.
Goldman ranked second behind  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) in a league table of M&A for Asia Pacific including Japan at the end of the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data, having advised on deals worth $108.4 billion. 
The region has been hit harder than elsewhere by a drop in global deal volumes as uncertainties over the economic outlook and rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China weigh on M&A appetite. 

Dealmaking volumes in Asia-Pacific fell 30% year-on-year to $751 billion as at end-September according to Refinitiv data, while globally volumes fell 11% to $2.8 trillion.

970,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 11:48PM ET</span>",Norway Wealth Fund Gets Nod to Sell $6 Billion in Oil Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Norway’s massive wealth fund got the go-ahead to sell oil and gas stocks worth $5.9 billion, ending a two-year process that has reduced an initial proposal to dump all its petroleum investments to a more moderate divestment.
The $1 trillion fund shocked markets in 2017 when it asked the government for permission to sell about $40 billion in such stocks, arguing a cut in exposure would reduce the overall risk for Norway, western Europe’s biggest petroleum producer. That plan was then heavily diluted in a political compromise that shielded the world’s biggest oil companies.
The final plan from the Finance Ministry released late Tuesday evening in Oslo outlines a divestment that will be even smaller than the government had foreseen in March, when it estimated disposals would total about 70 billion kroner ($7.6 billion).
As expected, the divestment will now include companies classified as “Oil: Crude Producers” by index provider FTSE Russell. The number of companies held by the fund in that category was 95 in mid-September, making up 0.8% of the fund’s benchmark for equities. The divestment will “be made gradually over time,” the government said.
According to a list provided by FTSE Russell in July, the fund’s biggest holdings in that category at the end of 2018 were ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG)., Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). and CNOOC Ltd. The Finance Ministry didn’t provide an updated list of companies in Tuesday’s statement.
By using the index classification, the fund’s investments will continuously be blocked from “upstream oil and gas companies, including corporate events, new listings and new information on or changes in companies’ activities over time,” the government said.
The plan marks a compromise for the Conservative-led government, which is heavily dependent on oil income and faces an increasingly powerful environmental movement. The government decided to shield the biggest oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, arguing they will likely be big investors in renewable energy in the years ahead.
Regardless of its scope, the divestment has been widely debated in Norway and left a mark globally. While the fund and the government have insisted the move has nothing to do with the climate crisis and is purely about an oil-producing nation’s risk exposure, it has been widely celebrated by activists and politicians as a powerful signal that fossil fuels are losing favor among investors.
In a show of how divided even Norway’s government is on how to interpret the divestment, Environment Minister Ola Elvestuen called it “the most important climate decision” the coalition has agreed on, in direct contradiction of the official line."

(Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) (AX:NAB) on Wednesday said it has almost doubled to A$2.09 billion ($1.40 billion) the amount of money set aside to repay customers for overcharged fees and unneeded insurance, sending its shares down as much as 3%.
The charge follows a government-mandated inquiry into the financial sector which found misconduct at major institutions, with NAB singled out over accusations that top management had failed to accept responsibility for wrongdoing at the bank.
Australia's third-largest lender subsequently lost its top two executives and has turned to former Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (L:RBS) chief Ross McEwan to rebuild trust.
NAB's unexpectedly large charge gets the bad news out of the way before the new chief executive starts in December but weakens the bank's capital position ahead of a regulatory deadline in January, analysts said.
""We had expected remediation costs to come at about A$500 million, so this is worse and means NAB's capital position its also slightly worse than expected,"" said banking analyst Azib Khan at stockbroker Morgans Financial.
NAB said it was setting aside the extra A$1.18 billion mainly because it expected to have to return about 55% of ongoing advice fees received by its network of self-employed advisers from 2009 through 2018.
""We understand that shareholders will be rightly disappointed,"" acting CEO Philip Chronican said in a statement. ""However, we also recognize the need to prioritize dealing with these past issues and fixing them for customers.""
NAB said the charge would reduce its cash earnings in the second half of fiscal 2019 by around A$1.12 billion after tax.
It also said the charge covered costs of its remediation program, higher refund rates for mis-selling consumer credit insurance, and about A$348 million incurred after its software capitalization policies changed.
CAPITAL UNDER PRESSURE
To ensure compliance with a regulatory requirement to have a core capital ratio of 10.5% by January 2020, NAB this year cut its dividend for the first time in a decade, by 16%. The ratio refers to funds set aside to weather an acute economic downturn.
Its core capital ratio was 10.4% at June-end, meaning the new charge again puts pressure on the bank to ensure compliance.
""NAB's CET1 ratio will now be running a finer line than we previously thought relative to APRA's 'unquestionably strong' benchmark of 10.5%,"" Khan wrote in a note to clients, referring to the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority.
The bank said it would disclose the impact to its core capital ratio when it announces full-year earnings on Nov. 7.
NAB's share price was down 3.1% after the announcement, while the broader market (AXJO) was 1.4% lower. Its stock recovered slightly to A$28.9, or down 2.46%, in early afternoon trading."

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said on Tuesday it will pay $20.4 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, allowing the U.S. healthcare giant to avoid an upcoming federal trial seeking to hold the industry responsible for the nation's opioid epidemic.
J&J became the fourth drugmaker to settle claims ahead of the Federal Court trial against multiple manufacturers and distributors in Cleveland scheduled for later this month. The case is considered a bellwether for more than 2,600 lawsuits by state and local governments that are pending nationally.
""The settlement allows the company to avoid the resource demands and uncertainty of a trial as it continues to seek meaningful progress in addressing the nation's opioid crisis,"" J&J said in a statement. 
""The company recognizes the opioid crisis is a complex public health challenge and is working collaboratively to help communities and people in need,"" it added.
Opioids were involved in 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
J&J which formerly marketed the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, said the settlement includes no admission of liability.
The company will pay $10 million to Cuyahoga and Summit counties, reimburse $5 million of their legal and other expenses and provide $5.4 million to non-profit organizations that run opioid-related programs in the counties.
 Mallinckrodt  Plc (N:MNK) finalized a $24 million settlement with the same two counties on Monday. Endo International Plc (O:ENDP) and Allergan Plc (N:AGN) also settled with the two counties in August to avoid going to trial.
The remaining defendants in the Oct. 21 federal trial include McKesson Corp (N:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  (N:CAH), Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) and  Henry Schein  Inc (O:HSIC). 
OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP succumbed to pressure from the lawsuits and filed for bankruptcy protection in September.
Some plaintiffs' lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.
Earlier in the year, an Oklahoma judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers.

Purdue Pharma and Teva had settled claims by Oklahoma’s attorney general for $270 million and $85 million, respectively.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 10:01PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC proposes exchanges seek public consultation on data fee changes,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Tuesday proposed a change to the way exchange operators alter their fees, in a move aimed at improving transparency but which could make it harder for operators to compete on price to propel revenue growth.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed that operators submit requests to change fees for such services as market data and connectivity with other exchanges, and then seek industry feedback before any changes can be implemented.
At present, operators - such as New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and Cboe Global Markets Inc (Z:CBOE) - notify the regulator of fee changes, which then take immediate effect. The system effectively allows operators to compete on price in real time.
In May, the SEC said securities exchange operators must do a better job of describing and justifying their fees when they make a filing, or else the filing will be suspended for review.
Tuesday's proposal, which is subject to public consultation before adoption, comes after a years-long dispute over what many brokers and investors see as soaring costs for services essential for trading, but which are also major revenue drivers for most exchange operators.
Exchanges lodge hundreds of fee-related filings with the SEC each year. Under current rules - known as the National Market System plan, or Regulation NMS - fee changes become effective immediately to ensure retail investors get the best price possible. NMS also prevents trades being executed at prices inferior to bid and offer prices displayed at other trading venues.
Under Tuesday's proposal, the delay before implementing changes could make it tougher for exchange operators to compete quickly on price, potentially limiting future revenue growth.
""The fees charged by NMS plans affect a wide variety of investors and market participants,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement. ""This rulemaking will help ensure that NMS plan fee changes benefit from review and comment by investors and market participants before those fees can be charged."""

Joe Murillo is the first big hire by Juul's new chief executive officer, K.C. Crosthwaite, who himself moved over from Altria last week. 
Altria owns a 35.5% stake in Juul, which last week said it would suspend all advertising in the United States where the Trump administration has announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves to rising popularity among teenagers.
In his new role, Murillo will help guide the applications that Juul must submit by May to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any products it wants to keep on the market beyond that point, Crosthwaite said in an emailed statement.
""The company is fully committed to supporting and complying with FDA's final effective flavor policy and to working through the PMTA (premarket tobacco product application) process – a process Joe understands well and one he will help lead JUUL Labs through,"" Crosthwaite said. 
""We invite an open dialogue, will listen to others and will be responsive to their concerns,"" he added. 
The FDA last month warned the company about marketing its products as safer than traditional cigarettes and requested more documents and information within 30 days. 
Flavored e-cigarettes represent 80% of Juul's sales. The company's had dropped to about $25 billion, from $38 billion when Altria invested in it, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

Federal prosecutors in California are conducting a criminal probe into Juul, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, though it said the focus of the probe was unclear.

Exxon this year began disclosing quarterly comparisons just after the period ended to deliver more timely information on its businesses to investors. Official results are due Oct. 31.
The biggest hit to profits came from weaker oil prices. Earnings in the company's oil and gas production unit are expected to fall about 45% from last year's $4.23 billion in operating profit, Exxon's data showed.
Its refining business had improved margins that were offset by higher logistics costs, the filing showed. That business is expected to report profits fell about 18% from last year's $1.64 billion.
Its chemicals unit earnings were projected to fall about 72% from the year ago's $713 million.
Exxon shares fell 2.4% on Tuesday to $68.95.
The company had warned analysts it was spending heavily to replace production and will not reach its profit goals until next year.

Last quarter the company posted a 21% drop in profit as sharply higher oil production was offset by weakness in its refining and chemicals businesses.

978,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 08:39PM ET</span>","UAW rejects new GM offer as strike forces 6,000 Mexico layoffs","By David Shepardson and Joseph White
(Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Tuesday it rejected a new comprehensive offer from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to end a two-week-old strike, saying the automaker came up short on several fronts including wages, healthcare and temporary workers.
The union said it made a counterproposal and warned ""there are still many important issues that remain unresolved."" Also on Tuesday, GM said the strike by U.S. workers forced it to halt production at its pickup and transmission plants in Silao, Mexico, resulting in temporary layoffs of 6,000 workers.
About 48,000 UAW members went on strike on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker’s profit and protection of healthcare benefits.
UAW Vice President Terry Dittes told members in a letter the GM offer ""came up short"" on issues like healthcare, wages, temporary workers and job security, ""to name a few."" The union said it is committed ""to exploring all options in order to reach an agreement.""
GM said in a statement it continues ""to negotiate and exchange proposals, and remain committed to reaching an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our company.""
The statements on ""comprehensive proposals"" indicate the talks have shifted into a higher gear as the dispute is taking a toll on both the automaker and striking UAW workers, whose $250 a week from the union strike fund is a fraction of their normal pay. Analysts estimate the strike could cost GM over $1 billion. 
Both sides face broader risks should the U.S. economy slow down. Data released on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in September to its weakest level in more than a decade. Stocks fell broadly on the report, and GM's share price was down more than 3%.
The strike had previously forced GM to lay off at least 2,000 Canadian workers and temporarily close an engine plant in Mexico. Many suppliers have halted or scaled back some operations.
JP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated in a research note that the strike has cost GM over $1 billion but it may be able to recover some lost profit in the fourth quarter. He said GM has $82 million a day in lost profit. 
GM in Mexico said that “for the moment” its three other Mexican plants – Ramos Arizpe, San Luis Potosi and Toluca – are working normally. A spokesman in Mexico said the plants still had parts available but the company could not say how many more days the plants would remain open. The spokesman declined to estimate the daily cost of suspending operations at the Silao complex. 

The 6,000 affected workers are being paid a percentage of their salary, the spokesman said, with some workers using vacation time to continue receiving their full salaries.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co (N:DE) on Tuesday announced indefinite layoffs for 163 U.S. manufacturing workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa that make agricultural, forestry and construction equipment, citing decreased customer demand.
The layoffs come weeks after the company said it would reduce production by 20% at its facilities in Illinois and Iowa in the second of half of the year to keep inventory in line with retail demand.
The world's largest farm equipment maker is reeling from the fallout of the U.S.-China trade war that has slowed purchases from farmers. 
Meanwhile, lingering trade tensions have inhibited manufacturing activity and investment in nonresidential construction.
Weaker demand in the latest quarter dented its earnings, forcing Deere to trim its full-year earnings forecast and initiate a review of costs.
In August, the Moline, Illinois-based company said it was assessing its manufacturing footprint as part of the cost structure review.
In an emailed response, Deere said 50 production employees at Harvester Works, which makes large agriculture equipment, in East Moline, Illinois, would be put on indefinite layoff. Separately, 113 workers would be laid off for an indefinite period at its construction and forestry plant in Davenport, Iowa.
Deere's shares closed on Tuesday down 1.9% at $165.50.
The year-long tariff war between the United States and China has slashed the export earnings of American farmers. China imported $9.1 billion of U.S. farm produce in 2018, down from $19.5 billion in 2017, according to the American Farm Bureau.
U.S. shipments to China of soybeans, the country's most valuable farm export, sank to a 16-year low last year as Beijing shifted purchases mostly to Brazil, leaving American farmers with a surplus.
Deere has said it expects industry sales of agricultural equipment to be about the same as last year in the United States and Canada, which account for 60% of its overall business. Sales in the region were earlier projected to be flat to up 5% earlier.

982,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 05:25PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch," Investing.com – Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. U.S. Private Jobs in Focus
Ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls due Friday, traders will look to ADP’s measure of private-sector employment for a readthrough on the labor market.
The report comes at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect that private nonfarm payrolls rose by 140,000 last month, down from a gain of 195,000 in August.
Fed speak is also on the calendar with Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker set to deliver a speech at 9 AM ET.
2. Crude Inventories to Build for Third-Straight Week?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases its petroleum report on Wednesday, with economists expecting a third-consecutive build in domestic crude supplies.
The EIA is expected to report a build in crude stockpiles of about 1.57 million barrels.
Crude oil futures gave up gains to settle at $53.62 a barrel, down 0.8% despite reports that production in the U.S. and Russia declined during the third quarter.
Many analysts have downplayed expectations for a ramp-up in oil prices, as Saudi Arabia has restored capacity following the Sept. 14 attack, which reportedly forced the kingdom to shut down half of its crude production, or roughly 5.7 million barrels a day.
3. Bed Bath & Beyond;  Lennar  Earnings in Focus
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is set to report earnings after markets close on Wednesday. The company has rung the changes at both board and management level amid pressure from activist investors. There's speculation a new CEO could be announced tomorrow as well.
But the changes have done little to boost investor optimism, with analysts expecting the company to reap the benefits over the next two years rather than in the immediate short term.
Wedbush said it expects earnings to stabilize, or even grow, over the next two years as the company implements a host of changes, including store remodels, private-label brand launches and the sale of non-core assets and real estate.
“Second quarter results are likely to fall short of consensus expectations that are not aligned with company guidance, and 2019 guidance could be withdrawn as the company clears inventory, digests list 4 tariffs (the fourth list of good from China subject to tariffs) and gives the new CEO time to evaluate the business,” Wedbush said.
The company is expected to report earnings of 29 cents on revenue of $2.76 billion, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com.
In the housing sector,  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) will report earnings before the market opens, with analysts expecting earnings of $1.32 on revenue of $5.48 billion.

983,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>",Stocks: S&P Slumps as Weak Manufacturing Data Stuns Traders,"Investing.com - Stocks stumbled badly to start the fourth quarter as a weak report on U.S. manufacturing prompted broad selling Tuesday.
The S&P 500 was off 1.23%, with the Dow Jones industrials  down 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.13%. The Dow's 344-point decline was its largest one-day point loss since a 623-point drop on August 23.
The weakness was heaviest in classic industrial stocks like 3M (NYSE:MMM), Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT).
Large-capitalization stocks seemed to weather the selling better than small caps. The SmallCap 2000 NR was off 2.35%. 
Plus shares of companies that have done recent initial public offerings were hit. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) were down 4.3% and 3.1% respectively. Uber is off 38% from its high right after shares started trading. Lyft is off 55%.
Railroad stocks fell more than 2.5% as the Dow Jones Transportation Average fell more than 2.3%.
The selloff was set off by a weaker-than-expected report on manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management. The report showed the ISM's manufacturing PMI falling to its lowest level in 10 years.
The report underscored how stress in manufacturing can be amplified throughout the economy. Manufacturing has been hit by weak export markets, especially China, which has been engaged in a bitter trade battle with the Trump Administration. Negotiators are supposed to meet in Washington later this month. 
The selloff hit industrial, materials, energy and financial stocks hardest. Financials were weighed down by Charles Schwab's (NYSE:SCHW) announcement it would no longer charge commissions on stock and ETF trades. Schwab shares fell 9.7%. Other discount brokers that rely on commission revenue were also slammed. ETrade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) fell 16.4%. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) managed to stay in the black Tuesday, up 0.28%. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was off 1.4%. Both maintained market capitalizations greater than $1 trillion. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was flat. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was down 1.1%. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) fell more than 3.4%
Crude oil futures moved lower and interest rates also fell as many investors decided the safety of their money was more important than making a killing, at least for now.
While the major indexes finished the third quarter with their best nine-month performances since 1997, they have struggled since hitting new highs in July. The S&P 500 is off nearly 2.8% from its July peak, with the Dow 2.8% below its peak and the Nasdaq down 5% from its peak.
The S&P 500 suffered its sixth loss in eight trading sessions and has finished under 3,000 for eight-straight sessions. The index is trading just under its 50-day moving average, a key technical indicator for market confidence.
Spice-maker McCormick (NYSE:MKC), Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) and credit-card processor Visa (NYSE:V) were among the top performers in the S&P 500. 
ETrade (NASDAQ:ETFC), Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), oil-and-gas producer   Cimarex Energy   (NYSE:XEC) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the S&P 500's biggest laggards."

He said in a note to clients dated Sept. 29 that it is reminiscent of other corporate events that marked the top of secular trends in the past 20 years.
Morgan cited three: United Airlines' failed leveraged buyout in October 1989, which effectively ended the LBO craze of the 1980s; the AOL-Time Warner merger in 2000, which indicated the dot com bubble was coming to a close; and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase's takeunder of the failed Bear Stearns investment bank in 2008, which signaled the end of the financial excesses of the previous few years.
""It was one heck of a run, but paying extraordinary valuations for anything is a bad idea, particularly for businesses that may never generate a positive stream of cash flows,"" he wrote.
Getting back to a more disciplined mindset was a good thing, Wilson said, adding that some publicly traded stocks ""still need to fall back to earth."" This downward adjustment was already happening and may not have much further to go, he said, but noted that these stocks also will come roaring back.
WeWork’s parent, The We Company, on Monday filed to withdraw its IPO a week after the SoftBank-backed office-sharing startup ousted founder Adam Neumann as its CEO. The scrapping of the IPO marks the conclusion of a tumultuous few weeks for the firm, which failed to excite investors who raised concerns about its burgeoning losses and a business model that involves taking long-term leases and renting out short-term space."

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow suffered their worst tumbles in over a month on Tuesday after data showed U.S. factory activity shrank in September to its weakest in over a decade, ratcheting up fears that the U.S.-China trade war is hobbling the world's largest economy.
Investors moved to the safety of U.S. Treasuries after the ISM report showed its manufacturing activity index at 47.8, falling further from August's sharp contraction and below economists' expectations of 50.1. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.
With lingering trade tensions weighing on exports, the U.S. data mirrored similar patterns in the euro zone, Japan, the United Kingdom and China.
The S&P industrials index (SPLRCI) dropped 2.4%, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors. The materials <.SPLRC> and energy (SPNY) indexes both fell 2.3%. All 11 sectors lost ground.
A jobs report on Friday is expected to shed further light on U.S. economic strength.
""This is a bad number, fitting in with the world’s manufacturing recession,"" Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research in Chicago, said of the ISM report. ""I think the market is right to be concerned, but we will have to see whether other manufacturing numbers in the U.S. bear that out, not the least of which being the manufacturing payroll numbers on Friday."" 
Despite a prolonged U.S.-China trade war that has hammered global growth, confidence in the domestic economy has helped the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) climb about 17% this year.
Thomas Simons, a Jefferies economist, said the manufacturing contraction does not underpin a wider softening in the U.S. economy, as it was the result of several factors, including Boeing Co's (N:BA) production issues relating to its best-selling jets.
""Manufacturing itself is in a recession, but it does not mean that the overall economy is in a recession.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 1.28% to end at 26,573.04, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.23% to 2,940.25. Both indexes had their biggest one-day dip since Aug. 23, when U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that American companies seek alternatives to doing business with China.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 1.13% to end at 7,908.69.
The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX (VIX), an options-based gauge of investor anxiety, rose 2.3 points to 18.56, its highest close in about a month.
Shares of online brokerage E*Trade Financial (O:ETFC) tumbled 16.4%, the most on the S&P 500, after rival  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) said it would remove commissions for online trading of stocks, ETFs and options listed on U.S. or Canadian exchanges. Charles Schwab's shares slumped 9.7%. 
McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) dropped 2.7% after JP Morgan said the fast food chain's third-quarter same-store sales would be softer than analysts' estimates.
Shares of chipmaker  Xilinx Inc  (O:XLNX) declined 4.1% after KeyBanc lowered its rating to ""sector weight.""
In one of the few bright spots, Ulta Beauty Inc (O:ULTA) advanced 6.1% after an independent director bought shares.
 Stitch Fix  (O:SFIX) rose 1% in extended trade after the apparel seller's quarterly earnings per share beat analysts' estimates. 
As the final quarter of 2019 kicks off, investors will be focusing on a range of factors, beginning with the high-stakes Sino-U.S. trade talks in early October, corporate earnings and the Fed's next policy meeting.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.29-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 131 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.3 billion shares, compared with the 7.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

986,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 04:09PM ET</span>",Best Returns of the Year Lure ‘Believers’ to Clean-Energy ETFs,"(Bloomberg) -- Exchange-traded fund investors are finally paying attention to clean-energy stocks thanks to a market-beating year.
The $439 million Invesco Solar ETF, known by its ticker TAN, has returned 58% this year, outperforming all other unleveraged ETFs in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s spurred the most demand for the fund in five years, with more than $60 million flowing in last quarter.
Despite a recent bout of weakness, clean-energy stocks have been on a tear as tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on imported solar equipment gradually decline. Meanwhile, the outlook for greater use of renewables has also improved, further burnishing the appeal of companies like  First Solar Inc  (NASDAQ:FSLR)., one of TAN’s largest holdings.
“It’s finally gaining some believers,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said of the ETF.
Two other clean-energy funds are also among the year’s top 10 performers through Sept. 30: The Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (NYSE:XLE) and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT).’s SPDR S&P Kensho Clean Power ETF both returned 38%.
But price gains aren’t solely responsible for investor interest. Renewables have become a mainstream energy source, supplying more power to America’s grid than coal for the first time ever in April. Solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of power in two-thirds of the world. Meanwhile, the Solar Energy Industries Association recently said the U.S. pipeline for utility-scale projects had reached 37.9 gigawatts, a record.
In fact, newcomers to clean energy missed much of the sector’s advance this year, with TAN’s performance in the first half of 2019 significantly outpacing its return in the third quarter.
However, it’s easy to understand buyers’ caution when you look at the fund’s history: Despite this year’s advance, TAN has lost 85% since it began trading in April 2008.
“Because there’s some maturation of the industry, that could reduce some of the volatility going forward,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA Research. “While we think prospects for many of these companies are favorable, these products are not for the faint of heart.”"
987,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 04:08PM ET</span>",Direct Lending Poised to Pick Up as Private Equity Deals Mount,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. direct lending activity is expected to pick up amid a swelling private equity M&A pipeline and as borrowers seek to wrap up financing before the end of the year.
Lending is lagging last year’s breakneck pace, but there are “encouraging signs” that a long-anticipated increase in deal flow will materialize, according to Michael Ewald, global head of Bain Capital Credit’s private credit group. That view is based on the level of sell-side advisory activity currently in the market, he said.
Borrowers that aren’t private-equity owned will also seek to wrap up financings in the last quarter, so they can begin the new year with capital for their growth ambitions or acquisitions, said Darius Mozaffarian, partner at White Oak Global Advisors.
Volumes are falling short of last year’s tally as the market slowly rebounds after volatility late in 2018. September’s transactions were largely driven by health care, business services and software deals. Deals included a $220 million facility for the acquisition of health-care software company Ontario Systems and a $75 million unitranche for Avista Capital Partners’ buyout of GCM, a provider of machining to the medical technology industries.
September Deals

Borrowers in the direct lending market are also anticipating a time when debt may not be as readily accessible, by negotiating more delayed draw and accordion features on their deals, according to Mozaffarian.
“This way they’re preparing for a financing market that may not react well to a great macroeconomic event,” he said.
For their part, investors are exercising a touch more caution amid uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and other geopolitical factors. They’ve been tentatively pushing back on terms in credit documents, seeking stronger limits on Ebitda addbacks and smaller carve-out baskets, Mozaffarian said.
In terms of deals, more second-lien facilities are being privately placed before broadly syndicated first-lien deals are offered, according to Bill Sacher, partner and head of private credit at Adams Street Partners. Ascensus Specialties, Autodata and DigiCert were among the issuers to come to the broadly syndicated loan market with privately-placed second-lien tranches in September.
“Locking in the second-lien portion of the capital structure helps build momentum for the first-lien syndication, establishes a benchmark for pricing on the first lien, and eliminates a significant amount of the market risk,” Sacher said. “Private equity sponsors also appreciate the comfort of knowing they have relationship-oriented lenders in the second lien that are likely to hold the paper for the life of the deal.”"
988,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>",Dalio Outlines Possible Trump Path to Limit Capital to China,"(Bloomberg) -- Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund, said preliminary discussions on limiting U.S. investments in China make him wonder if the Trump administration is “inching toward bigger moves.”
In a new essay posted on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) Tuesday, the Bridgewater Associates co-chairman points to the U.S. freezing Japanese assets and embargoing oil to Japan in the late 1930s to early 1940s as a potential example of how special emergency powers could be used by the president.
“Regarding the capital and currency wars, the ability of the U.S. president to unilaterally cut off capital flows to China and also freeze payments on the debts owed to China, and also use sanctions to inhibit non-American financial transactions with China must be considered as possibilities,” Dalio wrote. “That’s why the proposed step of limiting American portfolio investments in China makes me both think about the implications of this step and wonder if it is an inching toward bigger moves.”
Bloomberg News on Friday reported that Larry Kudlow, the head of President Donald Trump’s National Economic Council, was leading deliberations inside the White House over what some hawks have labeled a potential “financial decoupling” of the world’s two largest economies.
The options discussed have included forcing a delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges, imposing limits on investments in Chinese markets by U.S. government pension funds and putting caps on the value of Chinese companies included in indexes managed by U.S. firms, according to people familiar with and involved in the discussions.
In a statement emailed to Bloomberg over the weekend, a spokeswoman for U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there were no current plans to stop Chinese companies from listing on U.S. exchanges.
Bloomberg’s report was later matched by other news organizations including the Financial Times and New York Times. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, in an interview Monday with CNBC, acknowledged that the White House is looking at issues related to Chinese stocks, while broadly denying Bloomberg’s story as “fake news.” He refused to answer multiple questions from the network’s anchors about what was inaccurate.
In his essay, Dalio cites the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, as the powers most accessible to President Trump for such a move.
“It empowers the president to unilaterally impose capital and FX controls, freeze assets and/or payments on assets (coupons), and force asset divestures to ‘deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat’ from outside the U.S.,"" Dalio wrote.
Trump is aware of the powers and has referred to them as a tool in his trade policies. He mentioned them when he threatened in May to place levies on Mexican goods as a way to force curbs on the flow of undocumented immigrants across the U.S.-Mexican border. His administration also said in August that the legislation would give the president the authority to force American companies to leave China if Trump declared an emergency.
Dalio said the news last week ""seemed like the most recent logical steps in this classic dangerous journey that is analogous with that which occurred in the 1935-45 period.""
During those years, as is the case today, America experienced a widening gap between the rich and poor, and intensifying conflicts between populist politicians on the left and right, Dalio wrote. It was also a time, like now, when the world’s central banks were limited in their ability to stimulate economies in a downturn and there was a rising world power challenging the existing one.
“From not having to worry about such things in the past, now all market participants need to worry about them,"" he wrote."

Results were disastrous for leading Asian automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., which each suffered double-digit declines that were worse than analysts expected. While a fuller picture will emerge Wednesday when General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. are due to report, the poor performance suggests that overall deliveries of cars and light trucks could come in worse than the 12% drop anticipated by analysts, based on six estimates.
The severity of the slide stokes fears that a long-anticipated car sales collapse may be arriving. The slowdown puts auto dealers already struggling with shrinking profit margins in an even more precarious position. With outgoing model-year vehicles clogging their lots, automakers had to pony up record incentives of more than $4,100 a vehicle in the third quarter, according to researchers at J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.
Nissan led declines among the major companies reporting Tuesday, as the Japanese carmaker continues to struggle in the post-Carlos Ghosn era.
Here are highlights from the carmakers that have reported results for last month:
Toyota’s Lineup-Wide Tumble
Toyota saw it sales plunge 16% in September, with both its namesake and Lexus luxury brands declining by double-digit percentages. Deliveries fell for almost every model, including its best-selling RAV4 crossover and Camry sedan.
While all carmakers are going to struggle with September having been a shorter sales month -- the Labor Day holiday weekend applied to August figures this year -- Toyota can’t entirely blame the calendar. Even on a daily selling rate basis, total sales were down 9.2%.
Honda’s Turbulent Two Months
Honda had a rough September after logging its best U.S. sales month ever in August. Deliveries declined 14% last month, a much worse showing than analysts expected.
Major models that stumbled in September include the Pilot SUV (-40%), Accord sedan (-20%) and CR-V crossover (-15%).
Nissan Not as Bad as Feared
Nissan’s deliveries decreased 18%, though analysts were expecting an even steeper decline of 21%.
The models that drove the decrease give reason to be downbeat. Sales of Nissan brand pickups and sport utility vehicles -- which tend to be more lucrative than passenger cars -- dropped 21%, while deliveries for the Infiniti luxury division fell 44%.
Subaru’s Incredible Run Ends
It nearly lasted the length of a two-term U.S. presidency, but Subaru Corp.’s streak of monthly sales increases is over.
The Japanese carmaker’s run ended in September after 93 months -- almost 8 years. Deliveries dropped 9.4%, with Tom Doll, chief executive officer of Subaru’s U.S. sales division, citing a rapid sell-down of older-generation Legacy sedans and Outback crossovers.
Palisade Powers Hyundai
Hyundai Motor Co.’s namesake brand may have weathered the month better than others in the industry, with sales slipping 8.8%.
The South Korean company started U.S. deliveries of the Palisade, a three-row flagship SUV, in June. While it’s quickly become one of the carmaker’s better-selling models, Hyundai was unable to measure up against the numbers it posted a year ago. It still expects to have gained market share for the quarter, Randy Parker, Hyundai’s U.S. vice president of sales, said in a statement.

PLANO, Texas (Reuters) - American Airlines Group's (O:AAL) pilots want compensation for lost pay stemming from flights canceled as a result of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding, the head of the airline's pilot union said on Tuesday.
Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in mid-March after two deadly crashes that together killed 346 people in a span of five months and forced MAX carriers like American to cancel more than a hundred daily flights.
""The effect has been real and calculable,"" Allied Pilots Association President Captain Eric Ferguson said at a conference for independent pilot unions in Plano, Texas.
Ferguson said APA pilots are seeking a commitment from American similar to one made by Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) last month when Chief Executive Gary Kelly promised employees to share any reimbursement from Boeing over the MAX grounding.
""We're looking for the same thing,"" said Ferguson, noting that while some 737 MAX pilots have been scheduled on other routes, their overall flying hours have decreased as a result of the cancellations.
Negotiations between Boeing and its customers over the financial impact of the grounding, which has also halted deliveries of more than 250 jets that continue to roll off its Seattle production line, are ongoing.
Southwest is the world's largest MAX carrier. It has 34 jets parked in the California desert awaiting approval to fly again, and 41 more that were scheduled for delivery this year. American has 24 MAX jets and 16 more due this year.
Ferguson, who became president of APA in July, is working closely with American to ensure that its MAX jets are safely returned to service once the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approves them.
Boeing is developing a software fix and new pilot training that must be reviewed by the FAA. The manufacturer has repeatedly said it is targeting the fourth quarter for the plane to return to service.
Once the FAA gives 737 MAX approval, American will need around 30 days to prepare the jets and its pilots for commercial flight, APA representatives said.
For Southwest, with over 10,000 737 pilots, it may take between 45 to 60 days following approval before the plane resumes commercial flights, representatives from the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association said at the conference."

993,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 02:42PM ET</span>","StockBeat: Spotify Slides, but Wall Street Bear Says Shorting Opportunity Limited","Investing.com – Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) fell Tuesday, joining in on the broader market selloff, but sentiment on the streaming music company has been lifted after a Wall Street bear upgraded his rating on the company. 
Evercore analyst Kevin Rippey upgraded his rating on Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) to in line from underperform and maintained its $110 price target on the company, citing the nearly 30% decline since the August peak. Spotify fell more than 1% pressured by selling in the broader market after U.S. manufacturing stooped to a 10-year low. The S&P 500 and Dow were both down more than 1%.
Rippey said that while the path to substantial gross margin expansion for Spotify is unclear, the opportunity to short the company has diminished after the pullback.
The upgrade comes just a few weeks before the company is set to release its earnings report on Oct. 24 in which subscriber and monthly active user trends will be the key metrics, Evercore said.
During the second quarter, the company grew premium subscribers by 31% year over year to 108 million. Monthly active users were 232 million, up 29% year on year. Users streamed 17 billion hours of content during the quarter, which was up 35%, according to CEO Daniel Ek.
The uptick in user growth helped the company slash net losses to 76 million euros last quarter ($83 million), compared to a loss of 394 million euros a year earlier.
Spotify is down about 0.6% so far this year. It has an average price target of $149, according to consensus estimates from Investing.com."
994,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 02:39PM ET</span>",Stocks Deepen Losses as Weak Data Fuel Growth Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks slid and Treasuries rose after a gauge of U.S. manufacturing posted the weakest reading since the end of the last recession, fueling fears of an impending global slowdown and boosting haven assets.
The S&P 500 fell the most in five weeks, pushing through a key support level, after the Institute for Supply Management’s factory index slipped to the lowest since June 2009. Banks led the fall as rates moved lower, followed by industrial companies. The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled toward 1.6%, and the dollar weakened against major peers. Gold and the Japanese yen advanced.
“We are clearly seeing a very weak backdrop for manufacturing. The concern is the contagion effect into the services economy, which is the driving force of the U.S. economy,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management. “We cannot take this lightly and we think the Fed shouldn’t take it lightly either.”
The weak factory gauge, which came on the heels of similarly disappointing numbers out of Europe on Tuesday, renewed concerns about a global economic slump amid the U.S.-China trade war and sparked another round of speculation about how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. Investors may get some signals from the slew of Fed speakers this week, which include Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, when the latest jobs report will also be released.
Elsewhere, European shares fell the most in almost seven weeks following data that showed the region’s manufacturing sector slumped last month and inflation slowed. The euro advanced after the European Union was said to be ready to consider a time limit on the Irish Brexit backstop. Oil fell to the lowest in almost a month amid a grim outlook for global energy demand.
Asian markets were subdued as Hong Kong and China were closed for holidays, while Australia’s dollar slid after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 02:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Italian prosecutors widen probe over safety of Atlantia-operated bridges - sources,"By Emilio Parodi and Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors have widened an inquiry into suspected safety breaches at subsidiaries of Atlantia ATL.MI to include more employees and viaducts than they identified last month, two sources close to the investigation told Reuters.
The safety inquiry follows a 2018 Genoa bridge collapse which killed 43 people and has led Italy's co-ruling 5-Star Movement to call for the motorway concession of Atlantia, the biggest Italian toll-road operator, to be revoked.
Prosecutors said on Sept. 13 they had arrested three employees at Atlantia's motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia and its maintenance unit SPEA for allegedly falsifying safety reports on two other bridges after the Genoa disaster. (Full Story)
Police also said last month that five other people working for the companies and one consultant from a company outside the Atlantia group were temporarily banned from holding office.
Genoa prosecutors have since placed a total of around 20 people, including the nine already made public, under formal investigation and are examining the records of nine bridges on the Atlantia network, two sources told Reuters.
Under Italian law the investigation is preliminary and may not lead to any charges.
A Sept. 13 arrest warrant for the nine people initially placed under investigation, issued by Genoa prosecutors and viewed by Reuters, names both Autostrade and SPEA as responsible for misleading ministry inspectors about the safety of some parts of the motorway network.
The warrant said the choices of the employees under investigation were guided by ""strictly commercial logic, which took precedence over the aim of guaranteeing the security of motorway infrastructure"".
The two subsidiaries of Atlantia, which is controlled by the Benetton family famous for its fashion clothing label, are also formal suspects in the Genoa bridge inquiry but have denied wrongdoing, saying regular, state-supervised inspections had indicated the it was safe. (Full Story) (Full Story)
Atlantia, which is not a formal suspect in the road safety report investigation, declined to comment on Tuesday and referred to previous statements issued on Sept. 16 by Autostrade which said there were no safety problems at its viaducts, which had also been inspected by an external maintenance company.
Atlantia's long-serving CEO Giovanni Castellucci resigned on Sept. 17 after the Benetton family said it was shocked by what was emerging from the safety controls investigation.
Atlantia's shares remain 14% below the level seen on the eve of the Genoa bridge collapse, due to concerns over the future of the concession for Autostrade to operate 3,000 km of motorways in Italy, which generates a third of its core profit.
WIDER INQUIRY
The safety investigation grew out of a separate criminal inquiry into the Genoa disaster. This included prosecutors bugging Atlantia employees' phones and uncovered evidence of allegedly false safety reports on the network, the arrest warrant shows.
Prosecutors have also widened the scope of their safety investigation to include Atlantia's overall risk management practices, including how it oversees safety at its units, one of the sources told Reuters.
Last week they seized documents at Atlantia's Rome headquarters to better understand its internal controls and its oversight of Autostrade and SPEA, the source said.
Atlantia on Tuesday confirmed prosecutors had taken documents, without giving details.
Among the allegations in the warrant is that SPEA employees approved the transit of an exceptionally heavy truck over a damaged bridge on the basis of a false safety report issued by several SPEA employees.
SPEA and Autostrade are both listed as formal suspects in the investigation, the arrest warrant shows.
SPEA, which in a statement on Sept. 18 said it had suspended the employees targeted by recent arrests, did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters."

998,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 01:37PM ET</span>",NewsBreak: Dow Plunges More Than 300 on Market Selloff,"Investing.com - The Dow started the fourth quarter badly, falling more than 300 points in early afternoon trading, potentially its biggest one-day loss since late August.

At 1:15 p.m. ET, the blue-chip index was off 1.1%. The S&P 500 was down 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.9%. The decline comes as the stock market has been stalled just below its all-time highs in July. Twenty-seven of the 30 Dow stocks were lower, with 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) the biggest decliners, off 3.3% and 3.2%, respectively. Visa (NYSE:V) is the leader, up 1.1%.


The selloff was set off by a weaker-than-expected report on U.S. manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management. It's a signal that the U.S.-China trade fight plus economic slowdowns elsewhere, especially in Europe, are taking a toll on U.S. manufacturing.


The selloff sent interest rates lower, with the 10-Year Treasury yield falling to 1.637% from 1.673% on Monday.

The Labor Day weekend is one of the busiest car-buying periods in the United States that has automakers and dealers roll out promotions days in advance to boost sales.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said it U.S. sales fell 16.5% to 169,656 vehicles in September, hurt by lower sales of its Highlander and Tacoma sport utility vehicles, as well as declining demand for sedans such as Camry and Prius.
Hyundai Motor's (KS:005380) U.S. sales tumbled 9% to 51,951 automobiles last month, due to lower volumes of its Elantra and Sonata sedans, while Nissan's U.S. sales plunged 17.6% to 101,244 vehicles on lower sales of its Sentra sedan and Rogue SUV.
U.S. automakers are focusing on selling larger SUVs and trucks that are more profitable.
While higher vehicle prices and rising interest rates earlier in the year kept car shoppers on the sidelines, analysts expect recent cuts in interest rates to boost car sales in the third quarter.
The average interest rate on a finance deal fell to 5.5% in the latest quarter, more than 60 basis points lower than the first quarter, according to auto consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.
In the third quarter, sales in the United States slipped 1.2% to 627,194 vehicles for Toyota, rose 5% to 173,028 vehicles for Hyundai and fell 5% to 327,354 vehicles for Nissan.
U.S. car shopping website Edmunds has forecast third-quarter sales for the industry to rise by 0.8% to 4.3 million vehicles, led by volume gains at General Motors Co (N:GM). 

GM, Ford (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) report quarterly numbers on Wednesday.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 12:35PM ET</span>",Italy's Illycaffe sets five year target for U.S. expansion,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Illycaffe could reach its goal of opening 200 cafes in the United States within five years as part of a broader drive to expand its business outside its home market, Andrea Illy, the chairman of the premium coffee maker said.
The project - which would mark a significant expansion overseas for the Italian roaster - is conditional on finding an ally with deep knowledge of the U.S. market, sound experience in the high-end retail sector and no previous engagement in the coffee business, the entrepreneur said. 
The group announced last week that it had picked Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) as an adviser to find a partner for its retail expansion in a strategic market where it faces giants including Starbucks (O:SBUX). The group, which made its name as a coffee roaster, currently operates 23 cafes in North America, part of a network of nearly 220 illy-branded outlets outside Italy.
""Our target is reaching 200 illy-branded cafes in the United States,"" Andrea Illy, the grand-son of founder Francesco Illy, told Reuters. ""With an operating partner we can get there in five years at the latest,"" he said.
The Illy family is considering the sale of a minority stake in the group for the first time in its 86-year history as a way to cement the planned partnership, he said.
""To align our goals with the ones of the prospective partner, we are ready to offer it a minority stake in illycaffe or, if it prefers, in our U.S. subsidiary,"" Illy said. 
The roaster, which is well-know around the world for its top-quality coffee blend made by nine varieties of Arabica beans, has always considered its independence a top priority.
Illy said that although the group was considering taking on board an investor from outside the founding family, it did not want to team up with a direct competitor. 
""We don't want to sign a partnership with one of our rivals in the coffee sector,"" Illy said.
That would exclude as potential partners JAB holding, with which Illycaffe signed a licensing deal to produce and sell Nestle-compatible (N:NESN) coffee pods. 
For Illycaffe, the U.S. market accounts for sales of nearly 100 million euros out of a total 483 million euros last year. 
Massimo Della Ragione, co-head of Investment Banking for Goldman Sachs in Italy, told Reuters he was confident the bank would present a shortlist of potential partners for illycaffe by year-end.

Compared to an IPO, a direct listing would allow the home-sharing startup to cut the costs of going public, as they wouldn't need to fork out hefty underwriting fees to investment banks to issue any new shares and raise any new capital.

In the last quarter, Airbnb generated more than $1 billion in revenue and the company has said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were positive in both 2017 and 2018.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian meatpacker BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) has admitted to bribing food inspectors with bank deposits and health benefits and is cooperating with investigators in the latest phase of a corruption probe, federal police said on Tuesday.
Police said the fourth phase of the so-called Weak Flesh investigation involved evidence from the company of some 19 million reais ($4.56 million) in bribes paid up until 2017, when BRF overhauled its management. 
BRF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
People involved in the scheme are no longer working at the meatpacker, which is not itself under investigation in the two-year-old probe, police said.
Investigators are still negotiating a formal leniency agreement with BRF in return for its continued cooperation, according to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity.
BRF shares fell nearly 2% in opening trade before trimming losses to 1% after a news conference by police.
When the scandal first broke in 2017 it led to the temporary closure of export markets and 12 BRF plants are still banned from selling meat products to the European Union.
Thirty-nine of the 60 inspectors targeted in the investigation remained on active duty, police said.
The inspectors answer to the Agriculture Ministry, which said it overhauled its food inspections.
The ministry reiterated ""trust"" in the 2,500 food inspectors who remain in service, saying bribery accusations against some of the inspectors working for the ministry ""were an exception to the rule.""

BRF began cooperating with investigators in the second half of last year, prosecutors said in a court document.

UniCredit (MI:CRDI) has sped up clean-up efforts ahead of the presentation of a new business plan on Dec. 3.
It said in August it had lowered an end-2019 target for gross problem loans at its non-core division to around 10 billion euros, from 14.9 billion previously.
The bank's head of non-core management last week confirmed UniCredit was on track to hit its year-end goal.
The bank held 15.7 billion euros in impaired debt at its non-core division at the end of June, but it has since agreed a number of disposals, including three sales of bad corporate loans worth 2.3 billion euros in total.
The latest transaction concerns home mortgages, a type of asset Italian banks so far have been reluctant to part with for fear of attracting bad publicity as loan collectors foreclose on properties to seek to recoup the money.
However, unrelenting regulatory and market pressure to clean up balance sheets has left lenders little alternative.
Italy's biggest loan recovery specialist doValue (MI:DOVA), born out of UniCredit's spun-off debt collection unit, is set to manage the portfolio the bank is offloading, one of the sources said.
Following massive disposals since 2017 under Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier, UniCredit has cut its soured loan burden to just below 7% of total lending, one of the lowest in Italy but well above a European average of 3%.
UniCredit's disposal plan was first reported by Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore at the weekend.
UniCredit has also invited bids for a 1 billion euro portfolio of ""unlikely-to-pay"" corporate loans, which are not in default yet but are unlikely to be recovered in full."

(Reuters) - Discount brokerage  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) said on Tuesday it is eliminating commissions for online trading of stocks, ETFs and options listed on U.S. or Canadian exchanges.
Schwab's latest move is likely to have a knock-on effect across the sector, forcing rivals to follow suit and eliminate commissions, experts warned. 
Shares in rivals TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD) and E*Trade (O:ETFC) slid 22% and 18%, respectively, while Schwab's stock was down 9.7%.
""Certainly sends a salvo to other self-directed firms to follow suit,"" said Stephen Biggar, director of financial institutions research at Argus Research.
The decision marks an inflection point for online brokers, as newer, nimbler rivals such as Menlo Park, California-based startup brokerage Robinhood have been capturing market share in recent years by offering commission-free stock trades. 
The firms are able to offer the free trading by selling their customers' orders to so-called wholesale market makers, such as Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial (O:VIRT), which aim to make a profit on the spread between the bid and the offer on the shares. 
This has forced traditional brokerages to follow suit. 
Rival Interactive Brokers Group on Monday started offering commission-free, unlimited trades on U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs. And last summer, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) also began offering free stock trades for self-managed accounts through its mobile banking app.
""Stocks commissions long ago stopped being a primary revenue item for Schwab, dropping to 8% of revenues last year and currently under 5%. Net interest income from customer deposits and asset management fees are far more important,"" added Biggar in an email to Reuters.
Schwab made $139 million from selling its customers' orders in 2018, up 22% from the previous year, according to a regulatory filing. 
TD Ameritrade was paid $458 million for customer orders in its last fiscal year, up from $320 million the year before, according to a filing. 
Schwab will reduce the commission to zero from $4.95 per trade, starting Oct. 7, the company said.
The company reported an 8% year-on-year jump in second-quarter net income at $937 million. 

Schwab managed total client assets of $3.75 trillion, as of July end.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>",Ford ties up with Mahindra in India to cut risks and costs,"By Promit Mukherjee and Aditi Shah
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  and Mahindra & Mahindra said on Tuesday they would form a joint venture in India, in a move aimed at reducing risks for the U.S. automaker's local business and cutting the cost of developing and producing vehicles for emerging markets. 
The venture, valued at $275 million, will see Ford (N:F) enlist Mahindra (NS:MAHM) as a partner for developing and selling vehicles in India and emerging markets using the U.S. automaker's production facilities in the country.
By shifting to a joint venture, Ford is also changing its strategy for India, where it has long run an independent operation. The South Asian nation, where auto sales are slumping, once promised growth for global carmakers, many of which are now frustrated after working hard to gain a foothold.
Ford's decision comes at a time when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration is trying to boost local manufacturing by cutting corporate tax rates and offering cheap loans to push car sales. 
Under pressure from shareholders to make profits, Ford has been globally restructuring its businesses with an aim to save $11 billion over the next few years. 
Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett said the partnership was ""not only a fitness objective"" but also gave the automaker a platform to expand in a market like India, where it wished it had done things differently. 
""We have other emerging markets where we need to apply the same kind of understanding,"" Hackett told reporters in Mumbai over a video conference from Dearborn, Michigan. 
Ford, which has invested more than $2 billion in India over two decades, will take an $800 million to $900 million non-cash charge to reflect the writedown of its Indian assets, it said in a separate exchange filing. 
By shelving efforts to go it alone in emerging markets, including India, Ford will save capital for more urgent and potentially profitable endeavours - such as defending its U.S. truck franchise or fixing its operations in China. 
Ford has also executed a significant alliance with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to share the costs of electric cars, commercial vehicles and developing autonomous vehicles.
""I think it's a disappointment when I see Ford sitting at the passenger seat, while Mahindra drives, if that will be the arrangement,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst, automotive forecasting at consultancy IHS Markit. 
""But looking at a global scenario of rapid transformation in powertrains and a shift to electric, this is a better way to mitigate investment risks,"" he added.
INDIA OPERATIONS
The two companies have for months been negotiating the deal which will see Ford take a 49% stake in the new entity, ending most of its independent India operations, Reuters reported in April.
Under the terms of the deal, which is likely to be finalised by mid-2020, Ford will transfer its local automotive assets, including both car manufacturing plants, and employees to the new entity, the companies said. Ford will retain its engine plant at Sanand in western India and global business center in Chennai in the south.
The new entity, which will be operationally managed by Mahindra, will develop and sell Ford brand vehicles in India and export Ford and Mahindra brand vehicles to emerging markets.
Mahindra will bring its sourcing, supply chain and Indian market knowledge to the table and will in return get access to Ford's global reach and technology. 
""These synergies lead to sizable business opportunities to create new products, leverage brand and distribution assets, enter new markets and seize leadership,"" said Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group.
In India, Ford currently manufactures and sells its cars via its wholly owned subsidiary. In 2017 it formed a strategic alliance with Mahindra under which, among other things, they would develop new cars together.
The companies expect to launch three new utility vehicles under the joint venture, starting with a midsize SUV. They are also jointly developing electric vehicles for emerging markets.

Michigan-based Ford has a share of just about 3% in a market dominated by Asian car makers including Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) that together control two-thirds.

The vast site holds a symbolic position in the UK after former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher lured Nissan there in 1986, beginning a recovery in British car-making after its near collapse in the 1970s. 
Britain's big carmakers, all foreign owned, had urged Britons to vote to stay in the European Union in the 2016 referendum and have warned ever since that they will struggle to operate if the normal European trade arteries are disrupted.
All carmakers rely on supply chains that run across Europe, bringing components to factories on a just-in-time basis. 
In the months after the 2016 vote the then prime minister, Theresa May, struck a deal with Nissan to keep it in Britain, promising extra support in written assurances that Brexit would not hit the Sunderland plant's competitiveness.
Former Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, who was involved in those negotiations, has since been fired by Nissan. 
The FT quoted three people with knowledge of the matter as saying that the decision to build the Qashqai in Britain had been contingent on a so-called ""soft"" Brexit that included a smooth transition. 
""While we don't comment on speculative scenarios, our plans for Qashqai production in Sunderland have not changed,"" a company spokesman said.
Nissan has already canceled plans to make the next model of its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, saying in February that uncertainty over Brexit was making it harder to plan for the future. It decided to produce the vehicle solely in Japan.
Britain has already delayed two deadlines to leave the bloc and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to deliver Brexit at by the end of October, with or without a deal, alarming companies that rely on trade routes to operate.
Japanese companies including automakers Honda (T:7267) and Toyota (T:7203) have long seen Britain as the gateway to Europe. 
The Nissan spokesman said that frictionless trade had enabled the Sunderland plant to become the biggest factory in the history of the British car industry, exporting more than half of its production to the EU.

""Today we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and EU will look like,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering all possible responses to tariffs the United States may impose this month in a two-way dispute over aircraft subsidies, the EU trade chief said on Tuesday.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has found that both European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) and its U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years.
The Geneva-based body is expected in the coming days to announce the level of trade sanctions the United States can impose over Airbus. A similar ruling for the EU in the Boeing case is expected early in 2020, giving Washington a head start.
""We are exploring all kinds of areas where we could react, but until and if the American tariffs kick in we are prioritizing a negotiated solution,"" EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a news conference. ""The EU will not do something that is not compliant with the WTO.""
The EU cannot retaliate immediately to any U.S. tariffs in the case, as it did following what it considered unlawful U.S. tariffs on metal imports in 2018.
The clearest response is to wait until a pronouncement in the parallel Boeing case. However, the EU might seek to revive an existing right to hit $4 billion of U.S. imports in a WTO dispute over U.S. tax breaks for exports, even though the two sides settled in 2006.
Malmstrom declined to comment specifically on that possibility.
""We're looking to all options and there are some cases where the (WTO) appellate body has judged, as late as this spring, that the U.S. is still not complying with old cases,"" she said, in an apparent reference to a WTO finding on Boeing subsidies.
""We're looking at everything. It doesn't mean that we will use these possibilities, but everything is on the table,"" she told reporters after a meeting of EU trade ministers in Brussels.
People familiar with the case say the WTO's three-person tribunal is expected to award the United States the right to target $7.5 billion of EU imports, a record for the 24-year-old watchdog.

Washington has drawn up a list of $25 billion from which it will pick targets from aircraft and aerospace parts to wine, cheese and luxury goods. The EU has its own list of $20 billion of U.S. products it could target in the Boeing case.

(Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and its Kia affiliate have sued the four largest U.S. railroads, accusing them of violating U.S. antitrust law by conspiring to drive up shipping costs though coordinated fuel surcharges.
The South Korean automakers filed three lawsuits on Monday accusing BNSF, CSX Corp (O:CSX),  Norfolk Southern  Corp (N:NSC) and  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) of imposing the surcharges between July 2003 and December 2008.
BNSF is a unit of billionaire Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), but was a standalone company at the time of the alleged conspiracy.
The lawsuits seek triple damages and were filed in the federal court in Santa Ana, California, near the automakers' respective U.S. headquarters.
Lawyers for BNSF referred a request for comment to that company, which did not immediately respond. The other railroads' lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Citing meetings, phone calls and emails, Hyundai and Kia accused the railroads of conspiring to impose fuel surcharges, under the guise of a fuel cost recovery program, that ultimately generated billions of dollars in profit at customers' expense.
Their lawsuits cited a 2007 independent study that said the railroads' fuel surcharge revenue exceeded their fuel costs by more than $6 billion from 2003 to March 2007.
Hyundai and Kia sued 6-1/2 weeks after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. said nationwide litigation over the surcharges could not proceed as a class action because more than 2,000 members of the proposed class were not harmed. The automakers' law firm also worked on that case.
The cases in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, are Hyundai Motor America Inc v BNSF Railway Co et al, No. 19-01878; Hyundai Motor America Inc v BNSF Railway Co et al, No. 19-01880; an Kia Motors America Inc v BNSF Railway Co et al, No. 19-01881."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) used more than 21,000 fictitious accounts to hide loans it made, according to a police complaint lodged by Indian officials, in the latest banking fraud case to spook the country's depositors and investors. 
The complaint, filed with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police on Monday and later seen by Reuters, accuses the bank's management of concealing non-performing assets and disbursing loans leading to a loss of at least 43.55 billion rupees ($616.5 million). 
A single realty firm and its group companies were the beneficiaries of 44 loans, according to the complaint.
""The actual financial position of the bank was camouflaged, & the bank deceptively reflected a rosy picture of its financial parameters,"" said the complaint, noting that the fictitious loan accounts were not entered into the bank's core banking system - a factor key in the perpetration of a $2 billion fraud at  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) that was uncovered in 2018.
The complaint names the bank's Chairman Waryam Singh and its Managing Director Joy Thomas, along with other bank officials, and accuses them of criminal breach of trust, forgery and falsification of records.
It also names bankrupt realty company Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (NS:HDIL), along with its former senior executives Sarang Wadhwan and Rakesh Wadhwan, who were beneficiaries of the loans. 
A senior government official late on Tuesday said that the serious fraud investigation office will look into the alleged wrong doing by HDIL in the PMC case, expecting to complete the investigation in the next two months.
PMC and HDIL did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it had no comment. 
The PMC case has sparked renewed concerns about the health of India's troubled banking sector, which has been rocked by a multi-billion dollar fraud at a state-run lender, the collapse of a major infrastructure lender, bad loan issues at state-run banks and a liquidity squeeze that has hit shadow lenders.
More than two dozen co-operative banks are now under RBI administration, but PMC Bank - with deposits of 116.2 billion rupees as of March 31 - is by far the largest. 
DEPOSITORS PROTEST
The RBI last week moved to take charge of PMC, one of India's top five co-operative lenders with more than 900,000 depositors, and suspended Thomas and the bank's board after uncovering lending irregularities
The RBI has barred the bank from renewing or granting any loans or making investments without prior approval of the central bank, while depositors have been informed they can only withdraw a maximum of 10,000 rupees ($140) from their PMC accounts over the next six months. [L3N26G2L2]
Dozens of account holders gathered outside an RBI office in Mumbai on Tuesday to protest against the curbs and demand that the central bank and government intervene to release their funds.
In a letter written by Thomas to the RBI that allegedly blew the lid off the scam, he says that he oversaw the fraud and hid details from the regulator for fear of reputational risks to the bank. Reuters reviewed a copy of the letter.
The police complaint against PMC and HDIL officials was filed at the behest of an administrator, whom the RBI appointed last week to oversee the bank's operations. 
The complaint alleges that the PMC officials misled the RBI for over a decade from 2008 to August 2019 by failing to disclose big accounts that had become non-performing assets by producing forged audit reports.

Indian media outlets on Sunday reported that PMC's exposure to bankrupt HDIL stood at 65 billion rupees, which accounts for 73% of its overall 88.8 billion loan book - well above the RBI's permissible exposure levels to a single entity.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be holding talks with Indian leaders this week and three sources in government and industry in New Delhi said there were renewed expectations of a trade deal on farm goods and pharmaceuticals.
The two countries have been locked in trade disputes for months and were expected to announce a limited deal during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's trip to the United States last month.
But no deal was sealed and an Indian government source said negotiators were trying to tie loose ends related to some farm products and generic drugs.
""The aim is to reach an abridged version of a deal that is reciprocal in value terms even though volumes may be small,"" the source said.
India's trade ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi referred questions on trade to the United States Trade Representative.
The USTR did not immediately reply to a Reuters email seeking comments.
The deal under discussion includes lowering some tariffs on U.S. farm produce while giving Indian pharmaceuticals faster approvals to enter the U.S. market.
India dominates the world’s generic drugs market and the United States is among its top importers.
Ross is expected to meet his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal on Thursday.
Despite close strategic ties, U.S.-India trade relations have been fraught. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly complained about India's high tariff rates, including a 50% tariff on Harley-Davidson (N:HOG) motorcycles.
The United States has also taken issue with India's new investment rules on e-commerce that limit how companies like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart-backed Flipkart can do business in a rapidly growing online market set to touch $200 billion by 2027.
On Monday, India blocked a request from the United States at the World Trade Organization for setting up a panel to rule on India's decision to impose additional duties on certain U.S. products, a WTO official said in Geneva.
In June, the United States ended duty-free access for about $5.7 billion worth of Indian exports under its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, of which India was the largest beneficiary. New Delhi responded with higher retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products, including almonds, apples and walnuts.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 08:51AM ET</span>",UK's John Lewis to run department stores and Waitrose as one business,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's John Lewis Partnership [JLPLC.UL] will cut a third of its senior management roles as part of a plan to run its eponymous department stores and its Waitrose upmarket supermarket chain as a single business.
The UK's largest employee-owned business said on Tuesday the creation of cross-partnership roles and the greater integration of the two brands would see 75 of 225 senior management head office positions removed.
The changes mean there will no longer be separate bosses for the two divisions.
The plan will lead to an overall cost saving of about 100 million pounds ($122.5 million) over time, said the group, which in March reported a 45% fall in 2018-19 profit.
Many British retail chains are going out of business or closing stores in the face of subdued consumer spending and a shift to online shopping.
""The lesson of the last two years is that we need more innovation, faster decision making and bolder steps to align our operating model with our strategy,"" Chairman Charlie Mayfield said.
""We are confident, as a board, that when the program is complete, the partnership will be better positioned to break out from the cycle of declining returns that are affecting most established retailers.""
Mayfield is being succeeded by Sharon White, the current head of UK telecoms and media regulator Ofcom, at the start of next year. [nL8N23D3VX]
With effect from Feb. 3 2020 the partnership will be managed by a single executive team responsible for business strategy and performance. Led by White, this team will comprise seven new director roles.
Paula Nickolds, the current boss of the department stores chain, will become the partnership's executive director, brand.
Rob Collins, head of Waitrose for the last four years, will step down from the business in January after 26 years with the partnership.
Current finance chief, Patrick Lewis, will become executive director, finance, and new executive directors for trading and for strategy will be appointed."

The deal effectively ends Ford’s independent operations in a country it wanted to become one of its top three markets by 2020. The U.S. carmaker will take an $800 million to $900 million impairment charge related to the value of its India assets in the third quarter, it said Tuesday, after struggling to compete with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles built by the local units of Suzuki Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co.
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (NS:MAHM), an Indian maker of sport utility vehicles, will own 51% of the joint venture and Ford the rest, the two companies said. The JV, which includes Ford’s two car factories in India, will be operationally managed by Mahindra. Governance of the venture is valued at 19.25 billion rupees ($275 million) will be equally shared.
Ford has been “struggling for a long while,” and Mahindra’s products as well as its sourcing and distribution network will support the American company, said Priya Ranjan, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking in Mumbai. “It is not about giving up on India, it’s about doing better in India.”
The agreement, which includes cooperating on electric cars for emerging markets, comes at a time when sales of cars and SUVs in India are going through the worst-ever slump. A slowing economy, dwindling rural income, and rising popularity of ride-hailing and car-sharing services are weighing on vehicle demand.
Ford and Mahindra plan to introduce three new vehicles under the Ford brand, beginning with a midsize SUV that will share underpinnings with the Indian partner.
The deal keeps Ford in the country of 1.3 billion people while letting it share the financial burden with Mahindra, as Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett leads an $11 billion restructuring effort and pares money-losing overseas operations. U.S. rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). pulled out of India two years ago, scrapping a $1 billion investment and stopping sales of Chevrolet models.
Ford was one of the first global car companies to enter India when the economy opened up in the early 1990s. The company first set up shop in India in 1926 but shut down that operation in the 1950s.
India’s car sales contracted 41% in August, the 10th straight monthly decline. Job losses in the industry, which employs more than 32 million people directly and indirectly, have climbed to more than 580,000 in the past 18 months, according to estimates from labor unions and auto dealers."

""And if you are sensitive to global trade and sensitive to manufacturing, you are having a very tough time at the moment, there is no doubt about it.""
The dollar's advance did slow before U.S. trading and manufacturing data, but economic surprise indices published by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) <.CESIUSD> <.CESIEUR> underscored just why it was looking so good.

British government bonds also sold off as Prime Minister Boris Johnson pitched new proposals for an amended Brexit agreement that would remove the contested insurance policy for the Irish border.

1027,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 08:49AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Brexit Crunch Time Is Bad News for Greggs,"Investing.com -- You know it’s crunch time for Brexit when   Greggs   (LON:GRG) starts stockpiling the butter.
The bakery and sandwich chain that has acquired cult status in the U.K. said Tuesday that It’s “preparing for the potential impact of the U.K.'s departure from the European Union by building stocks of key ingredients and equipment that could be affected by disruption to the flow of goods into the U.K.”
Greggs is a microcosm of the Irish border problem that is at the heart of the failure to break the Brexit deadlock. Greggs needs imports of milk and butter from Ireland for its pastry and drinks. Faced with sterling’s depreciation against the euro since 2016, and with new administrative costs from the Brexit-induced border changes, it has little scope to pass on price rises to a clientele with limited purchasing power.
The chain’s trading update also revealed that the buzz from its vegan sausage rolls, a British coda on the much-hyped Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) IPO earlier in the year, is fading somewhat. Sales growth slowed to 12.4% in the third quarter, down from over 15% at the start of the year, while like-for-like sales growth slowed to 9.4% from over 11%. Those figures are set to lose even more luster in the final quarter, thanks to a strong set of comparatives from a year earlier.
The management has turned conservative as the economy has slowed this year under the pressure of repeated Brexit deadlines. Greggs now expects only 90 net store openings this year, down from 100 at its latest update three months ago. It repeated long-standing concerns about pressures on both food input and labor costs.
The company’s shares fell 6.6% after Tuesday’s update, although they’re due a correction after a 60% increase since the start of the year – and they’re still one of the best-performing stocks in the sector in Europe this year, ahead of brewers AB Inbev (BR:ABI) and Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), and defensive stalwarts such as Nestle (SIX:NESN) and   Unilever   (LON:ULVR).
Elsewhere, European indexes lost some early gains Tuesday as a raft of depressing-looking purchasing manager surveys underlined the bleak near-term outlook for the European economy, overshadowing the benefits of an even cheaper euro and pound. Ironically, the return of Brexit-related stockpiling led the U.K. manufacturing PMI to beat expectations, although at 48.3 it remained clearly in contraction territory.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are among 10 financial companies that had been accused in the lawsuit of benefiting from manipulating the market for Mexican government bonds. 
U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan said in his opinion he was dismissing the lawsuit because the plaintiffs - eight pension funds - failed to allege a direct link between each defendant and a conspiracy. 
Oetken said he never determined if there was a plausible existence of an antitrust conspiracy, but said the plaintiffs could try to amend their complaint. 
Todd Seaver, a lawyer for the pension funds, said his team was evaluating the ruling and had no further comment. 
The lawsuit followed an investigation announced by Mexico's Federal Commission for Economic Competition, or Cofece, in April 2017, into possible breaches of competition laws in the public debt market. 
Cofece described the probe as its largest investigation into public debt sales and reflected the Mexican government’s efforts to increase market oversight. 
In November, Mexico's securities regulator in a separate probe fined top banks, traders and brokers for simulating bond trades to pump up volumes, according to a government document and source. 
Banks have in recent years faced a variety of lawsuits in Manhattan federal court by investors seeking billions of dollars over market-rigging allegations.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 07:26AM ET</span>",Brexit vote reprise? Money flows out of UK property funds,"By Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top property investment funds have shed almost 10% of their combined assets this year as investors fret about the impact of Britain's exit from the European Union.
The net outflows of client cash - some 2 billion pounds ($2.46 billion) - carry echoes of the mass demand to exit after Britain's vote to leave the EU in 2016. The outflow then led some funds to prevent clients leaving, to buy time to sell assets and raise cash.
That kicked off a regulatory review that concluded on Monday, when the Financial Conduct Authority issued tougher rules for funds investing in hard-to-trade assets like property. It said funds must now be frozen if valuers are uncertain how to assess more than 20% of the portfolio.
Despite that, the FCA maintained the right for retail investors to leave such funds any day they like.
Daily redemptions meant a ""fundamental liquidity mismatch remains in these funds"", said Alastair Sewell, senior director, fund and asset management at Fitch Ratings.
This was also a problem for money manager Neil Woodford, whose equity income fund invested in a large number of unlisted companies and has been frozen since June 3.
Britain is slated to leave the EU on Oct. 31, although opposition politicians have pushed for the deadline to be extended.
Fund industry tracker Morningstar showed each of the 10 biggest open-ended property funds shed assets between January and August this year as investors pulled cash from the sector.
The M&G Property Portfolio fund was the worst hit, with net outflows of more than 750 million pounds. Others who saw significant outflows included Aberdeen UK Property, with net outflows of 459 million pounds, and Janus Henderson UK Property, with outflows of 204.2 million pounds.
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2l1o0Y6.
Total assets under management for the funds was 11.3 billion pounds at the end of August.
Several other UK asset classes have seen fund outflows this year, including the much bigger equity sector, where investors pulled out 10.5 billion pounds. Others, most notably fixed income, saw inflows, though.
The UK property market outflows compare with inflows of more than 11 billion euros into European property funds over the same period, as more investors continued to look for higher returns.
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2neLIAZ.
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2nfqiDP.
Disposals by the UK property funds this year include a retail property sold by Kames in Wimbledon, in south London, for 9 million pounds and an office block sold by the same fund in Bristol, in southwestern England, for 8.2 million pounds.
As a result of the property fund outflows, several of the funds have changed the way they price their assets to encourage investors to stay put.
One way to do so is by moving to so-called ""bid pricing"" when there is more money leaving the fund than entering it, which leads to investors taking a hit for selling out.
Others have increased the level of assets held in cash, so they can pay off investors quickly, although that can prove a drag on performance for the fund and those investors not seeking to leave.
Average liquidity in the funds has risen to 17% at the end of July 2019, compared with 14% in June 2016, Fitch's Sewell said.
""There’s been a few liquidity scares in the last couple of years and funds have tried to adjust for this by having high cash levels, as well as a general move to a full spread pricing structure,"" said Jonathan Miller, director, manager research ratings, UK at Morningstar.
""Still, we've always said that in an illiquid asset class such as physical property, a daily dealing structure isn't appropriate,"" he added."

Standard Chartered did not confirm the job cuts, but said in an email: ""We are continuously reviewing our businesses and accelerating our shift toward digital and consumer preference.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The bosses of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and  BP  (LON:BP) are set to take part in an energy conference presided by Russian President Vladimir Putin in a rare trip to Moscow despite a wider political standoff between Russia and the West.
ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods might meet Putin in Moscow on Wednesday on the sidelines of the conference, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Woods and BP boss Robert Dudley are listed among the panelists of this week's conference, which is also expected to be attended by officials from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
Peskov said that Putin and Woods, if their meeting happens, would discuss 'potential cooperation areas' in a 'short meeting'.
BP declined to comment on Dudley's plans.
Western oil executives frequently visited Russia before relations with Moscow soured in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea by Russia and subsequent insurgency in eastern Ukraine.
This was followed by allegations of Moscow meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections, which the Kremlin has denied, and wider sanctions against Russian individuals and corporates.
As the result of the sanctions, ExxonMobil had to withdraw from joint energy projects with Kremlin-controlled Rosneft in the Arctic.
Woods attended a Russian conference in St. Petersburg in 2017, while Dudley, former head of Anglo-Russian oil producer TNK-BP, which was sold to Rosneft in 2013, met Putin in March in the Kremlin at a gathering with UK businesses.

He will take over early next year from outgoing CFO Paul Richardson at WPP, the world's largest advertising group, which is still trying to recover after a string of profit warnings. Last month it appointed Keith Weed, the marketing head of  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), to its board.
Rogers had been seen by analysts as the favorite internal candidate to succeed Mike Coupe as chief executive of Sainsbury's in due course.
He has held several senior posts at the supermarket group over the years, including chief financial officer from 2010 until 2016. He has also worked in China, India, Japan, South Africa, the United States and throughout Europe.
Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said Rogers' move to WPP could be a sign that Coupe is staying put.
""To our minds, Rogers was the prime internal candidate to replace Mike Coupe... should the incumbent boss wish to hang up his boots. With this announcement, it's maybe the clearest smoke signal yet that Coupe is going nowhere,"" Black said. 
Coupe, CEO since 2014, has been under pressure since Britain's competition regulator in April blocked Sainsbury's 7.3 billion pound ($8.97 billion) agreed bid for Walmart-owned rival Asda. That pressure has been compounded by a 30% drop in Sainsbury's share price over the last year.
Last week Coupe reaffirmed his commitment to leading Sainsbury's, saying a major investor event he hosted was not a beauty contest for his potential replacement.
Shares in WPP were up 0.8% by 0916 GMT after news of Rogers' appointment. Sainsbury's shares were up 1%.
GROWTH STRATEGY
""His priority will be to lead a finance function that best fosters investment in creativity, technology and talent in support of WPP's new strategy for growth,"" WPP CEO Mark Read said of Rogers' appointment. 
Rogers will be paid an annual salary of 740,000 pounds and will be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 225% of salary, a long-term incentive award of 300% of salary plus other benefits. He will also receive compensation for share-based and cash incentives he will forfeit on his exit from Sainsbury's.
""Joining WPP was an opportunity impossible to resist,"" he said.
Sainsbury's said Rogers will leave the business on Oct. 31. It does not plan to replace him as its strategy is to bring the Argos and Sainsbury's businesses closer together.
It said Argos's retail and logistics teams will report into Simon Roberts, the group's retail and operations director, and Argos's commercial team will report into Paul Mills-Hicks, its commercial director.

Roberts and Mills-Hicks are also seen as contenders for Coupe's job, along with finance chief Kevin O'Byrne.

A spokesman for the company confirmed the death of the 40 year-old in an accident that occurred as he was moving a mould in the cold press area of the plant as part of standard operating procedure.
The three main Italian metal engineering unions, FIOM, FIM and UILM, called for an eight-hour strike on Tuesday in Cassino, where the group produces Alfa Romeo Giulia sedans and Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV models.
Rocco Palombella, head of the UILM union, said accidents of such gravity had not happened for several years at Fiat Chrysler plants.
""We're waiting to know from prosecutors how a fatal accident could occur, despite all the safety measures that are normally taken in the plant,"" he said.
FIOM heads Francesca Re David and Michele Palma urged the government to strengthen procedures for preventing and supervising job safety, claiming that both were increasingly being affected by understaffing."

ZURICH (Reuters) - A private investigator who organized the surveillance of a senior former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) manager committed suicide last week,
a lawyer for the security firm at the center of the spying case said on Tuesday.
Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner expressed regret on Tuesday over the man's death, as the bank cleared Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam of the botched surveillance of its former wealth management head Iqbal Khan.
Khan, who helped Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam reshape Credit Suisse into a wealth management heavyweight, filed a criminal complaint alleging threats and coercion after a confrontation with people tailing his car in Zurich on Sept. 17.
""It is with great sadness and concern that we have learned of the tragic death of an external security expert, who worked for Credit Suisse. We express our deepest condolences to his kin,"" Rohner said.
Zurich prosecutors, who have not named the deceased, have opened a criminal investigation into the Sept. 17 incident and were not currently treating the death as suspicious.
""As is customary in the case of deaths, prosecutors and the police investigate the circumstances of the death and whether there is any criminally relevant misconduct by third parties. According to current information, there are no signs of a third party leading to the death of the deceased,"" prosecutors said in a statement.
The investigator worked as a middleman between Switzerland's second-biggest bank and Investigo, a security firm he hired to tail Khan.
Attorney Thomas Fingerhuth, who represents Investigo, told Reuters the investigator committed suicide last Tuesday.
Rohner, speaking at a news conference at which he announced the results of an internal probe into the surveillance, said the bank would not comment further on the death out of respect for those close to the man.
The surveillance as well as reports of a falling out between Khan and Thiam made headlines in Switzerland last week, shaking up the normally staid world of Swiss banking.
Credit Suisse's internal probe, carried out by the Homburger law firm, found that Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee, Thiam's right-hand man, alone initiated observation of Khan. He resigned following the investigation."

The three Dogger Bank wind projects in the North Sea will use GE's Haliade-X turbine, which with a capacity of 12 megawatts (MW) is the world's most powerful turbine.
""Dogger Bank will now be home to the largest offshore wind turbines in the world and this pioneering low carbon technology, which will play a central role in helping the UK become carbon neutral by 2050,"" Paul Cooley, director of capital projects at SSE Renewables, said in a statement.
GE Renewable Energy is a Paris-based division of  General Electric  (N:GE).
Orsted (CO:ORSTED) is also set to use the Haliade-X for two U.S. projects, with the first off the Maryland coast expected to begin operation in 2022.
The spokesman said the turbines for Dogger Bank are likely to be built in GE's factories in Saint Nazaire and Cherbourg in France.
SSE and Equnor won contracts for the three Dogger Bank projects under Britain's latest renewable subsidy auction, which cleared at a record low for offshore wind last month.
The cost of developing offshore wind projects has plummeted over the last few years, largely due to the increase in the size of turbines.
The most powerful turbine currently in commercial operation is Vestas' (CO:VWS) 9.5 MW turbine.
Britain is already the world's largest offshore wind market, and plans to generate a third of its electricity from the technology by 2030 in a bid to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two of Australia's four largest banks defied calls on Tuesday to pass on a central bank interest rate cut in full, as concerns rise over the impact of record low rates on their margins.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had earlier lowered its benchmark cash rate by another quarter-point from 1% in an attempt to kick-start the economy amid sluggish mortgage demand, putting further pressure on banks' profits.
National Treasurer Josh Frydenberg called on lenders to pass on the whole cut to mortgage customers but Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) both said they would not do so. 
""It is the government's expectation that the banks will pass on this 25 basis point rate cut in full,"" Frydenberg told reporters in Sydney.
With two rate cuts before Tuesday's RBA announcement already eating into Australian banks' net interest margins, analysts have again warned that further central bank action could inflict even more pain. 
""This sustained very low interest rates environment will weigh down on net interest margins and hence bank earnings power,"" said Matthew Wilson, a senior banking analyst at Evans & Partners.
Net interest income for the four largest banks, which dominate about 80% of the deposit and house lending market, could fall by about A$8.4 billion ($5.66 billion) if the central bank moved rates to zero percent, Wilson estimated.
The final impact would depend on a number of other factors including how much of the benchmark rate cut is passed on to customers and banks' interest rate hedging techniques, with the official cash rate widely expected at 0.5% by early next year.
CBA, Australia's top lender, said it faces a ""difficult balancing act"" with rates approaching zero, raising questions about the potential effectiveness of super easy monetary policy.
It cut its standard variable owner-occupier interest rates, a key gauge, by 13 basis points. NAB, the country's number three lender by market value, lowered home loan rates for owner-occupied customers by 15 basis points.
NAB's Chief Customer Officer for consumer banking, Mike Baird, said costs of deposits are coming under pressure with interest rates at record lows. 
""The RBA now has only three, or possibly even fewer, more conventional cuts available to them before they will have to venture into unconventional monetary easing territory -- negative rates, QE (quantitative easing), or bond yield targeting,"" ING's chief Asia-Pacific economist Rob Carnell said.
UBS analyst Jonathan Mott said that despite the expected pick-up in lending from lower rates, the banks' ""fundamentals are increasingly challenged with ultra-low interest rates"".
""The benefit to bank revenues would likely be offset by NIM pressure given the rate cuts required to re-stimulate the housing market,"" he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.
Commonwealth Australia Bank (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Group (AX:WBC), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) (AX:ANZ) have resisted public pressure to fully pass on the past two central bank rate cuts to customers.
Westpac and ANZ had yet to update the market on whether it would pass on Tuesday's rate cut in full.
Although they remain some of the most profitable banks worldwide, Australia's Big Four reported a combined profit of A$14.5 billion for the first half of their financial years, down 4% from a year prior, as they were hit with sluggish credit growth and billions in remediation costs from wrongdoing.
The fall was also partly driven by a 11 basis point reduction in net interest margins, the difference between the rates paid and charged for money lent by banks, to 1.95%. 
As the cash rate falls towards zero, it gets harder to reduce deposit rates to offset the cheaper mortgages they must now offer borrowers, while also losing on lower investment rates.

If rates moved to zero percent, NIM margins could shrink by as much as 26 basis points, Evans & Partners' Wilson said. The calculation excluded all other factors, he added.

The S&P 500 finished the day up 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.75% and the Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.88%. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.36%.
The quarter showed the smallest gains for stocks in the first three quarters of the year, with the gains fading toward Monday's close.
The S&P 500 and Dow were up 1.2% for the quarter, with the Nasdaq up down 0.09%.
The market was buffeted repeatedly by fears of an all-out trade war between the United States and China, malaise in Europe and the threat of impeachment of President Donald Trump. The uncertainty cut down what began as a strong start to the quarter.
On July 26, the S&P 500 was up nearly 2.9% and reached an all-time high of 3,028. Then it faded. Monday's close was its seventh-straight close below 3,000. 
But the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq all moved higher for the month.
The S&P 500 is up 18.7% for the year, with the Dow up 15.4% and the Nasdaq up 20.6%. The S&P 500's nine-month gain is its best since 1997. 
While the market is up strongly for the year, most of the gains came in the first quarter and a clear stall starting in late July. Moreover, indexes have been boosted by gains in an increasingly narrow band of stocks. 
 
Monday's rally was set off by assurances from the Trump Administration that it was not planning to disrupt capital flows between the U.S. and China. On Friday, a report the U.S. might try to delist Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges blew up a rally.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 2.44%, and saw its market capitalization top $1 trillion for the first time since Sept. 18, behind only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which also moved higher on Monday.
Apple) was the biggest driver for gains in all the indexes. The gain resulted when JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee boosted his price target on the stock to $265 from $243, citing better-than-expected sales of the new iPhone 11.
The consensus target price among analysts tracked by Investing.com is $226.48.
Also boosting the Dow overall was Merck (NYSE:MRK), up 1.6% on promising data from its Lynparza cancer drug. The company is developing the drug with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN). AstraZeneca, however, was off 1.6% in New York.
The market gains came as U.S. crude oil fell 70 cents to $55.21, along with gold futures. The December gold contract closed down $33.50 to $1,472.90 an ounce.
U.S. crude finished the quarter down about 5.6%. Brent, the global benchmark was off more than 7% in the quarter, after falling to $60.78 a barrel on Monday.
Interest rates were mostly flat, with the 10-Year Treasury yield at 1.675%, up from Friday's 1.674%. The dollar hit a 52-week high against EUR/USD on reports economists expect to cut growth forecasts for Germany. Germany's DAX index was up 0.38% on the day.

Here is a summary of European airlines that have gone bankrupt since 2017 (in chronological order):
AIR BERLIN
Germany's second-largest airline filed for bankruptcy on Aug. 15, 2017 after shareholder Etihad Airways withdrew funding following years of losses.
The German government granted a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($163.3 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany.
In October, Lufthansa agreed to buy parts of the insolvent company. [https://reut.rs/2llUI6P] [https://reut.rs/2lNYlCQ]
MONARCH
Britain's Monarch Airlines collapsed on Oct. 2, 2017, affecting around 900,000 passengers.
Hurt partly by a weakened pound, its finances deteriorated in 2016 after security concerns deterred travel to Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt and brought increased capacity on routes to Iberia.
The company, based at Luton Airport north of London and in business since 1968, became the largest British airline to go bust at the time, adding to turbulence in the European airline industry. [https://reut.rs/2nq1rgD]
PRIMERA AIR
The Danish airline ceased operations on Oct. 1, 2018. Forced to cancel flights earlier that year, citing delays in receiving aircraft from Airbus, it later faced complaints about poor service and late refunds. [https://reut.rs/2lmsRDx]
GERMANIA
Germany's Germania declared bankruptcy on Feb. 4, 2019, after it failed to secure financing to navigate a short-term cash squeeze. [https://reut.rs/2nvZUpp]
Founded in Berlin in 1986, it mainly flew German tourists to more than 60 destinations in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
FLYBMI
The UK regional airline ceased operation on Feb. 16, 2019, blaming Brexit uncertainty as one of the reason for its collapse.
It said its prospects had ""been seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process, which has led to our inability to secure valuable flying contracts in Europe and a lack of confidence around bmi's ability to continue flying between destinations in Europe.""

WOW AIR
Iceland's WOW air became another budget airline casualty on March 28, 2019 after failed efforts to raise funds, which included merger talks with rival Icelandair.
WOW controlled a quarter of the fast-growing low-cost, long-haul transatlantic market in 2018. The airline's collapse negatively affected Iceland's economy, which was largely dependent on tourism. [https://reut.rs/2CH1KZl] [https://reut.rs/2lT1b9v]
THOMAS COOK
The world’s oldest travel company, Thomas Cook, collapsed on Sept. 23, 2019, sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history, with about 600,000 people including 150,000 Britons abroad at the time of the collapse.
The company, which failed to secure a deal with creditors or a government bailout, was running hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year. [https://reut.rs/2mUg5w8]

1046,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 03:49AM ET</span>",BOJ Tapers So Much That Bond Buying Could Be Less Than Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is certainly putting his money where his mouth was, after repeated expressions of concern about excessively low bond yields.
To be precise, he’s putting up less money -- in the regular BOJ bond-purchase operations that have served as a component of the central bank’s stimulus programs since Kuroda took office in 2013. The current buying pace would see the BOJ take just 5 trillion yen ($46 billion) of Japanese governments bonds (JGBs) in 2020, according to calculations by Yuki Masujima at Bloomberg Economics.
That’s less than the 6 trillion yen annual target for the BOJ’s purchases of equity exchange-traded funds, which have served as a supplemental component of Japan’s stimulus. And it’s just a fraction of the official target of 80 trillion yen that’s been disregarded for some time now.
The downshift in bond purchases follows the powerful rally in sovereign bonds over the past year, which sent Japan’s 10-year yields below the BOJ’s loose target range of 0.2% to negative 0.2%. In early September, even 20-year yields approached 0%. Ten-year yields were at -0.153% at 2:35 p.m. in Tokyo.
Super-low long-term yields threatened to be counterproductive to the BOJ’s policies. Kuroda said after last month’s policy meeting that excessively low yields would damage consumer sentiment as returns on pensions and other long-term investments would drop.
The market is listening: on Tuesday, demand at a government auction for 10-year notes dropped to the lowest level since August 2016. That last time was days after the BOJ had launched a comprehensive review of its policy framework.
And that auction in turn sparked the biggest sell-off in Japanese government bond futures in more than three years.
Meantime, ETF purchases offer a steady source of support for Japan’s stocks, which just capped their best month since October 2017 -- the time of global synchronous growth."

Wesfarmers said during the testing of its new payroll system, it found that employees at Blackwoods, Workwear Group, Coregas and Greencap units were not paid the owed sum, about half of which ""relates to superannuation on loadings and allowances"".
The company said it was working to compensate the 2,000 current and 4,000 former employees impacted, with interest, adding that the errors were ""inadvertent"".

It also reported the underpayment to the Fair Work Ombudsman.
Last week, Wesfarmers' hardware unit, Bunnings, said it faced a payroll system issue from 2011 that relates to superannuation payments.
The error affected part-time staff who worked more than their contracted hours in the 2011/2012 financial year. Bunnings said it will pay back the amounts and compensate those affected in accordance with Australian Tax Office requirements.

Leroy said she did nothing wrong, but KPN said it could not press ahead with her appointment with the investigation pending.
""Joost knows the company inside and out,"" said Chairman Duco Sickinghe in a statement, adding that he was confident he could help the company meet 2019-2021 growth targets.
Separately on Tuesday, KPN announced a wider board shake-up. It said Chief Financial Officer Jan Kees de Jager would leave the company in March 2020 after five years in the job to pursue ""international entrepreneurial opportunities"".
De Jager, a former politician, will be replaced by an executive from Dutch insurer ASR, Chris Figee.
The company said it would add four additional executives to its management board, including a consumer market chief, a business market chief, and a chief technology officer."

K2's platform allows investors to build a portfolio of investments across multiple funds at discounted rates. The new funds allow clients to get their money back on a daily basis rather than quarterly.
The fund range will have strategies from five managers - Barden Hill Investment Partners, Chilton Investment Company, Electron Capital Partners, Ellington Management Group and Wellington Management - Franklin said in a statement.
Bill Santos, Senior Managing Director at K2 Advisors, said it would look to expand the range of managers and funds on offer and had seen strong demand from clients in Italy, Germany, Spain and elsewhere in the region to invest.
K2 currently manages $10.6 billion in assets on behalf of institutional and retail clients, with around 60% of its assets managed for institutional investors using its platform.
In return for reduced management fees of between 1% and 1.5% and performance fees of between 12.5% to 15%, Santos said K2 aimed to ensure each manager attracted at least $1 billion in fresh assets under management.
Many hedge funds have struggled to outperform during a decade of easy money from central banks, prompting some investors to pull their cash and a number of funds to close, but more aspiring managers continue to try their luck.
Data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research said 289 funds were launched in the first half of the year, although that was outnumbered by the 399 funds that shut down.
The estimated average management fee for newly launched funds in the second quarter was 1.25%, HFR said, while the average performance fee was 15.65%."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Major U.S. fund managers have tens of billion of dollars at stake in some of the most popular Chinese stocks on Wall Street, exposing them to potential losses should the White House move to delist Chinese firms from U.S. exchanges.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday dismissed reports that the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges as ""fake news,"" helping Chinese stocks including JD.com (O:JD) and  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA) recover some of their declines from Friday after the reports emerged.

""The proposed measures would completely undermine the international ADR/GDR etc. market and would harm the US's role as a conduit for international capital,"" Jefferies equity strategist Sean Darby wrote in a client note.

U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan, who had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit in July 2017, said Comerica was still unable to show that the planes had been returned to the lessor, which its contracts with Bombardier required before payment could be made.
The bank had sought $10.1 million (C$13.4 million) in its original January 2016 lawsuit. The amount sought was blacked out in the amended complaint. Lawyers for Comerica did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Comerica had said its Comerica Leasing Corp unit had been the beneficiary under trusts that bought the four CL-600 business jets from Bombardier, and then leased them to a predecessor of SkyWest Inc's ExpressJet unit.
The Dallas-based bank said Bombardier had guaranteed minimum residual values after the leases ran out in 2015, and promised to make up shortfalls if it found no buyers.
Gardephe, however, agreed with Bombardier that ""pleading that ExpressJet made the aircraft available to Comerica Leasing at an airport in Georgia is not the same as pleading that ExpressJet returned the aircraft to Comerica.""
Monday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning Comerica cannot file an amended complaint.

The case is Comerica Leasing Corp v Bombardier Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 16-00614.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Lawyers for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou detailed a list of emails, notes and other records they are seeking to prove that her rights were violated before her December arrest at Vancouver's airport, according to a court document released on Monday.
Meng, 47, was arrested at the airport on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading the bank HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business in Iran. She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.
In the British Columbia Supreme Court, Meng's lawyers are seeking further documentation from Canada's Department of Justice (DOJ), the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). They claim they meet the legal standard that there’s ""an air of reality that there are other documents... that have not been disclosed,"" according to the document.
If they ultimately help prove the Canadian officials abused their authority, her lawyers say, the extradition proceedings should be halted.
The documents demanded pertain to the Nov. 30 coordination in the lead up to the arrest between the DOJ, the CBSA and the RCMP, and Meng's arrest on Dec. 1, 2018.
Lawyers for Canada's attorney general started their oral arguments on behalf of the United States in a Vancouver courtroom Monday.
In their filing last week, they said the Crown already provided extensive documents to Meng, and that contacts between U.S. and Canadian authorities under such circumstances are encouraged. 
That filing also said there was no evidence of any misconduct by border or police officers, or that Meng's rights were violated, and there was no need for additional disclosure.
""They haven't established an air of reality to anything,"" Robert Frater, counsel for the attorney general, told the judge last week, speaking of the legal standard.
Meng's lawyers wrapped up their arguments last week. Oral arguments by counsel for the Canadian attorney general are scheduled to run through Friday this week but could end earlier.

The extradition proceeding itself is scheduled to begin in January and experts say legal wrangling could go on for years.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 07:13PM ET</span>",New York congressman resigns ahead of insider trading plea,"By Brendan Pierson and Richard Cowan
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chris Collins, a Republican U.S. congressman from New York state, resigned on Monday ahead of his expected guilty plea in a criminal insider trading case. 
A senior Democratic aide speaking on condition of anonymity said Monday that the office of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi had received Collins' letter of resignation, and that it would become effective Tuesday.
Collins, 69, is scheduled to appear in Manhattan federal that day to enter his guilty plea, court records show. Collins' son, Cameron Collins, and another man, Stephen Zarsky, are also scheduled to plead guilty in the case on Thursday. 
A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office is prosecuting the case, declined to comment, as did Mauro Wolfe, a lawyer for Zarsky.
Lawyers for Chris and Cameron Collins could not immediately be reached.
Chris Collins, an early supporter of President Donald Trump, represents New York's 27th Congressional District, which includes areas surrounding Buffalo and Rochester. He won reelection last November, three months after he was criminally charged.
The criminal case relates to Australian biotechnology company Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd, a company for which Chris Collins sat on the board and held a 16.8% stake.
Prosecutors allege that in June 2017, while attending the congressional picnic at the White House, Collins learned in an email from Innate's chief executive that a clinical trial for its proposed multiple sclerosis drug MIS416 had failed.
Collins immediately told the trial failure news to his son, who in turn told his fiancée, Lauren Zarsky, and her parents, Dorothy and Stephen Zarsky, prosecutors allege.
Chris Collins did not trade his own Innate stock, which lost millions of dollars in value. Prosecutors said the congressman was ""virtually precluded"" from trading in part because he already faced a congressional ethics probe over Innate.
However, prosecutors said others used the insider information to avoid more than $768,000 in losses when Innate's share price plunged 92% after news of the drug's failure became public.

Lauren and Dorothy Zarsky were not criminally charged, but reached civil settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

LONDON (Reuters) - The threat of a no-deal Brexit has sent profits and sentiment in Britain's financial services falling at their fastest pace since the global financial crash a decade ago, a CBI/PwC survey showed on Tuesday.
The latest quarterly survey by the CBI, a business trade body and consultants PwC, said that in the three months to Sept. 30, the level of business activity at banks fell at its fastest pace in 28 years.
Banking, insurance and investment funds bring in billions of pounds in tax revenues for the British economy, but direct access from London to its most important market, the European Union, could be blocked if there is a no-deal Brexit on October 31.
The quarterly survey of 83 firms found that optimism about overall business in financial services fell at the quickest pace since September 2008 when the Lehman Brothers crash deepened the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The level of optimism has now been flat or falling for 15 consecutive quarters.
""The sector is the jewel in the crown of the UK’s world-leading services industry,"" said CBI Chief Economist, Rain Newton-Smith.
""While it’s encouraging that investment plans have improved, the threat of a ‘no deal’ Brexit is hitting confidence.""
Britain has yet to secure a divorce settlement with Brussels, with only a month to go before it leaves the EU.
Financial firms in Britain have spent millions of pounds opening hubs in the EU to cope with whatever form Brexit takes.
Profits fell at their quickest pace since June 2009, but headcount in banking grew at the fastest pace in since December 2006, probably due to increased regulatory requirements, the survey showed.
Andrew Kail, PwC's head of financial services, said there has been a drop-off in plans to launch new products and services as firms batten down the hatches in expectation of a turbulent few months.
Looking ahead to the December quarter, business volumes are expected to fall further, the survey showed. For the coming year, new regulation, Brexit, IT spending and customers switching to rivals would hit business most."
1062,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 06:33PM ET</span>",WeWork throws in the towel on its ill-fated IPO,"By Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - WeWork's parent The We Company on Monday filed to withdraw its initial public offering, a week after the SoftBank-backed office-sharing startup ousted founder Adam Neumann as its chief executive officer.
The withdrawal of its IPO prospectus formalizes the end of the New York-based company's pursuit of a near-term listing and allows Neumann's successors to proceed with the company's financial turnaround without disclosing as much information publicly. 
The company's high-yield bond price slid to a record low after the move was announced earlier in the day. 
The scrapping of the IPO marks the conclusion of a tumultuous few weeks for the office-sharing firm, which failed to excite investors who raised concerns about its burgeoning losses and a business model that involves taking long-term leases and renting out spaces for a short term. 
Furthermore, experts pointed out that removing Neumann from the CEO role and addressing governance issues were not enough, and that such a business model was unlikely to thrive during an economic downturn. 
According to the IPO prospectus it filed earlier in September, We Company had cash and cash equivalents of roughly $2.5 billion as of June 30. However, while revenue doubled to nearly $1.8 billion in 2018, its losses also more than doubled to $1.9 billion. 
The decision to scrap the public share sale will also put pressure on WeWork to secure alternative funding, given that a $6 billion loan deal with banks, agreed last month, hinged on a successful share sale of at least $3 billion. Analysts have projected that WeWork will burn through several billion dollars over the next few years and thus needs to keep on raising fresh funds at favorable valuations. 
According to two sources familiar with the matter, the company is currently looking to trim its workforce and slow down its expansion in order to burn through less cash and be less dependent on fresh funding. 
The company is in talks to raise fresh funding from investors, including SoftBank Corp, the sources added.
SoftBank, which had been pushing WeWork to postpone its IPO and is currently attempting to raise its second $100 billion-plus Vision Fund, is under pressure to assuage key backers of the fund who have raised concerns over the long-term viability of the investment fund. 
The decision to withdraw the IPO was no surprise, though. It was widely expected after the company postponed the share sale earlier in September, following push-back from prospective stock market investors over its widening losses and Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.
""We have decided to postpone our IPO to focus on our core business, the fundamentals of which remain strong,"" WeWork's newly appointed co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham said on Monday. 
""We have every intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future,"" Minson and Gunningham added.
The company does have publicly traded debt, however, and on Monday the $669 million junk bond it sold in April 2018 plunged to a record-low price. It was last bid at 84.5 cents on the dollar, down 2.5 cents on the day.
The price drop drove its yield to nearly 11.75%, and its benchmark spread - a measure of the added compensation demanded by investors to hold the risky paper relative to safer government securities - mushroomed to more than 10 percentage points, the widest ever.
SoftBank, which owns nearly a third of We Company, invested in the startup at a $47 billion valuation in January. But investor skepticism forced it to consider a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion earlier this month, Reuters reported. 
We Company had vowed to pursue the IPO and complete the share sale by the end of the year after Neumann stepped down as CEO. However, sources had told Reuters last week that the IPO was unlikely to be completed this year.
WeWork's doomed IPO marks a rough period for startups that have been going public in recent weeks. Last week, U.S. entertainment and talent agency company Endeavor Group Holdings pulled its IPO, while shares of Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) Interactive Inc, the fitness startup known for on-demand workout programs on its exercise bikes, slid as much as 7% in their market debut.
Earlier in September, teeth straightening firm SmileDirectClub Inc made an underwhelming market debut.

Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) also went public earlier this year with high expectations, but their shares have tumbled since then as investor fret over steep losses racked up by the two ride-hailing companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The maker of Energizer batteries sued the maker of Duracell batteries on Monday, accusing Duracell of duping consumers by implying that its new ""Optimum"" AA and AAA batteries are more powerful and last longer than all rival batteries.
Energizer Holdings Inc (N:ENR) said Duracell, a unit of Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), engaged in false advertising for Optimum with packaging that said its batteries offer ""extra life"" and ""extra power,"" and TV commercials that said: ""Both is better than not both.""
It is only in the ""mice-type"" fine print, according to Energizer, that battery buyers learn that Optimum may outperform Duracell's own Coppertop batteries, not rival batteries, and only in some devices.
""These paltry and sporadic benefits are not the stuff great ads are made of and, indeed, barely seem worth touting at all,"" Energizer said in its complaint in Manhattan federal court.
The St. Louis-based company is seeking damages for false advertising under New York law and the federal Lanham Act, and a halt to any improper advertising.
Duracell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Berkshire bought Duracell, which has offices in Chicago and Bethel, Connecticut, from Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) in February 2016. It was not named specifically as a defendant.
The lawsuit is not the first Duracell has faced over Optimum, which were launched in July.
In August, New Jersey vaping company What A Smoke LLC accused Duracell of infringing its trademark rights in ""Optimum"" with respect to batteries, battery chargers, liquids and other products associated with electronic cigarettes. That lawsuit was filed in the federal court in Newark, New Jersey.

The Civil Aviation Authority said it was launching a new, online payment system next week for bookings made by payments methods other than direct debit and would enable customers to get refunds within 60 days of receiving refund forms.
A total of 100,000 bookings made by direct debit would be refunded within the next 14 days.
53 flights are scheduled to operate on Sept. 30, returning 8,000 people following the collapse of collapsed British travel firm Thomas Cook, the regulator said.

1070,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 03:42PM ET</span>",Apple Is Denied Tariff Relief on Five Mac Pro Parts After Staying in Texas,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). was denied relief for tariffs on five Chinese-made components for the upcoming Mac Pro computer, even after the company announced it was keeping some assembly operations in the U.S.
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office on Monday said it didn’t grant reprieve from 25% tariffs on the much-discussed optional wheels for Apple’s Mac Pro, a main circuit board, power adapter, charging cable and a cooling system for the computer’s processor.
The decision comes about a week after Apple announced it would make new Mac Pro computers in Austin, Texas after originally considering shifting production to China like its other products. The move followed an announcement earlier this month that the U.S. trade office had agreed to Apple’s request for tariff waivers on 10 out of 15 Chinese parts.
Apple said it didn’t have any comment beyond last week’s announcement. USTR wasn’t immediately available for comment.
Exclusion decisions are based on whether a product is available only from China, is strategically important or related to Chinese industrial programs, and whether duties will “cause severe economic harm” to the company or U.S. interests. In announcing that the Mac Pro would continue to be made in Texas, Apple applauded the Trump administration for its tariff relief on the other components, including the computer’s casing and accessories like the mouse and trackpad.
No Other Source
In its 15 requests for exclusions posted July 18, Apple said the devices or components are not related to Chinese industrial programs -- and that “there are no other sources for this proprietary, Apple-designed component.”
Trump had signaled that relief from tariffs would be rejected, saying in a July 26 tweet that “Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!” But the president later told reporters “we’ll work it out” and that “I think they’re going to announce they’re going to build a plant in Texas.”
Apple’s requests involved goods that are part of $200 billion in Chinese products hit with tariffs last September. Trump increased the duty on that batch to 25% from 10% in May. The rate is due to rise to 30% on Oct. 15, including on another $50 billion of goods also hit last year.
Products such as the Apple Watch, AirPods and iMac computers were hit by 15% tariffs earlier this month, while the iPhone, iPad and other major Apple products are set to be impacted later in December. Apple has maintained that its products are primarily designed in the U.S. and has grown its local investment since the trade war began brewing."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian officials registered a police complaint against the senior management of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) on Monday for hiding non-performing assets and disbursing loans that led to a loss of 43.55 billion rupees ($616.5 million) for the lender, a police official said.
The complaint, which names the bank's Chairman Waryam Singh and its Managing Director Joy Thomas, was filed with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police, according to the police official and a statement seen by Reuters. It also names bankrupt realty company Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) and its Chairman Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, who were beneficiaries of the loans.
A special team has been formed to investigate the case, police added.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week took charge of the bank and suspended Thomas and the bank's board after uncovering lending irregularities at the bank, which has been barred from renewing, or granting any loans, or making investments without prior approval of the RBI.
The police complaint against PMC and HDIL officials was filed at the behest of an administrator, whom the RBI appointed last week to oversee the bank's operations while it probes the lender. The RBI has placed curbs on withdrawals from PMC, prompting protests among thousands of PMC's depositors, whose funds have been largely frozen.
The complaint alleges that the PMC and HDIL officials purposely misled the RBI for over a decade from 2008 to August 2019 by failing to disclose big accounts that had become non-performing assets by producing forged audit reports.
Indian media outlets on Sunday reported that PMC's exposure to bankrupt HDIL stood at 65 billion rupees, which accounts for 73% of its overall 88.8 billion loan book - well above the RBI's permissible exposure levels to a single entity.
PMC and HDIL did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The RBI said it had no comment.
The PMC case has sparked renewed concerns about the health of India’s troubled banking sector, which has been rocked by a multi-billion dollar fraud at a state-run lender, the collapse of a major infrastructure lender, bad loan issues at state-run banks and a liquidity squeeze that has hit shadow lenders.
More than two dozen co-operative banks are now under RBI administration, but PMC Bank - with deposits of 116.2 billion rupees as of March 31 - and among the top five co-operative banks in the country, is by far the largest to be hit by such RBI measures.
India has more than 1,500 small urban co-operative banks that typically service small local communities in certain districts or states. Depositors at co-operative banks are in a relatively higher risk zone, but tens of thousands still bank with these lenders as they typically offer better interest rates on deposits."

The USDA reported Sept. 1 soybean stocks at 913 million bushels, also below the range of analyst expectations. The government revised its estimate of the 2018 U.S. soybean harvest to 4.428 billion bushels, down from 4.544 billion previously.
In a separate report on small grains, the USDA trimmed its estimate of U.S. 2019 all-wheat production to 1.962 billion bushels, from 1.980 billion previously. The latest figure was slightly below an average of trade expectations.
Chicago Board of Trade corn futures jumped to a seven-week high after the release of the reports while soybean futures extended gains and wheat futures also firmed.

COMMENTS:
* Jim Gerlach, president of A/C Trading:
""These were the biggest (quarterly stocks) misses in history and not by a little, by a lot. Last year's crops were over-stated ... The cash market has been telling you for a long time that we didn't have a 2.4 billion-bushel corn carry-out.""
* Bill Lapp, president of Advanced Economic Solutions:
""It was certainly a sharper reduction than the trade thought in the 2018 (soybean) crop. We saw the USDA reduce the final crop by 116 million bushels. That was the largest revision to the crop we've seen on Sept. 1. The fact that they missed it last year does not imply that this year's is going to be a big shock as well.""
* Jack Scoville, vice president with Price Futures Group:
""The USDA is telling you that they overestimated the crop last year as much as anything. But at the end of the day, 2.1 billion bushels of corn and 910 million bushels of soybeans is still a lot of corn and soybeans out there.""
* Joe Vaclavik, president of Standard Grain:
""The soybeans, that was a big deal on the balance sheet. Corn stocks number, too, was well below estimates. It's an aggressive cut, when most people thought we could actually see the USDA come in above the market expectations. This really caught the trade off-guard.""
* Ted Seifried, chief market strategist, Zaner Ag Hedge:
""As far as corn is concerned, it was a bullish (stocks) number. This is a bit of a game-changer for the new crop. We'll be sitting at a friendlier level for ending stocks than what we were looking at on the September WASDE, when we get the October report.""
* Bob Utterback, president of Utterback Marketing:
""The USDA comes out with a report saying we have 900-plus million bushels of soybeans, and that's bullish to this market. It's a sign of where we're at: We've gotten so used to these massive numbers (that) they've lost their shock value.""
* Terry Reilly, senior analyst, Futures International:
""We were surprised that USDA didn't make an adjustment in U.S. corn production for 2018 because stocks came in much below expectations. It indicates demand for corn for feed was much better than expected.""
* Craig Turner, commodities broker, Daniels Trading:
""Corn was the big surprise today. It's not wildly bullish, but it's not as bearish as everyone was worried about ... USDA today is taking away the 2 million bushels or so of corn that they said they found in the March report ... That has the market really focused now on yield: Will the (2019) harvested acres come down, as we're all expecting, and will the corn yield come down, even just a bit?"""

LONDON (Reuters) - The Lloyd's of London Ltd [SOLYD.UL] insurance market is planning to launch two electronic exchanges next year as part of a three-year overhaul, it said on Monday, as it seeks to fend off competition from low-cost rivals.
Lloyd's, which is made up of 99 syndicate members and focuses on large commercial insurance, has suffered two years of steep losses due to natural catastrophes and is facing uncertainty due to Britain's departure from the European Union.
It has been moving slowly to process some of its trades online, but much business is still done face-to-face in Lloyd's City of London tower.
Simplifying and automating its processes could cut the cost of doing business at Lloyd's to 25-30% of premium revenue, compared with a current 40%, it said.
""We are trying to take a step in the right direction,"" Lloyd's chief executive John Neal told Reuters, adding that initial estimates for the costs of the changes were in the ""low hundreds of millions"" of pounds.
One of the new electronic exchanges will focus on simpler risks and the other on more complex risks, with ""early builds"" of both in place by December 2020, Lloyd's said. Improved technology will be rolled out in 2021 and 202.
Lloyd's said that to pay for the changes it could use surplus funds, raise senior debt or securitize business against future income flows, but would not increase the levy it charges members.
In an attempt to compete with centers such as Bermuda, Lloyd's is also looking to attract participants offering insurance-linked securities such as catastrophe bonds.
It is also offering syndicates the ability to set up without a physical presence at Lloyd's.
Lloyd's said on Monday that reinsurance group Munich Re, which already has a presence at Lloyd's, was setting up the first remote ""syndicate-in-a-box"" which will focus on newer areas such as renewable energy.
Lloyd's is also pushing its members to improve their underwriting performance, and Neal told an event to launch the detailed strategy that the market expects a combined ratio below 100% for 2019, which indicates an underwriting profit.
Some brokers and smaller insurers, which have already undergone years of tough competition, fear there will be no place for them in the new-look Lloyd's. 
""Efficiency must not replace advocacy,"" said Simon Matson, CEO of broker Gallagher UK. 
""Our role as brokers has been, and always will be, as the advocate for the customer.""
Christopher Croft, CEO of the London & International Insurance Brokers' Association, said that ""technology has a role to play...but not at the expense of the value that an intermediary brings"". 
Neal said Lloyd's was not aiming to exclude brokers in its attempts to streamline the market but wanted their input.

""We are trying to take the brokers on the journey with us.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Burford Capital (L:BURF) began legal action on Monday against the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) seeking trading data it said it needs to investigate alleged manipulation of its share price.
Burford, a company which specializes in financing litigation, raised concerns about trading activity on Aug. 12 after a sharp fall in its shares, alleging 'spoofing' and 'layering', where traders make and cancel orders to influence share prices, and said it was investigating.
London-listed Burford last month commissioned a report from Columbia University academic and data analyst Joshua Mitts to assess publicly available market data on its shares.
Burford's lawyer Richard East of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said in court documents that the report by Mitts showed there were ""strong grounds to consider that a large proportion of the decline in Burford's share price was the consequence of unlawful trading activity known as 'spoofing' and 'layering'"".
""This share price decline coincided with a short selling attack on Burford's shares carried out by Muddy Waters Capital LLC,"" East said in the documents seen by Reuters.
Carson Block, founder of Muddy Waters, denied any involvement in a statement on Monday.
""Spoofing and layering are issues that have arisen in the high frequency and computer-driven trading world, and Muddy Waters has zero capability to engage in these practices,"" he said.
Burford said it wants the court to help it discover which individuals and entities placed the orders, and on behalf of whom, to help determine what was legitimate trading and what may have constituted market abuse. 
That level of data is commercially sensitive and not currently in the public domain, hence the need for Burford to apply for court approval to access the data. 
A spokesperson for the LSE said: ""The Financial Conduct Authority is the competent public authority responsible for investigating allegations of market abuse, where there are reasonable grounds for doing so and taking action, including potential criminal proceedings, where the evidence supports it.
""London Stock Exchange provides any information the FCA requires from it for the purposes of their investigations.""
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Aug. 12 it was making ""wide-ranging enquiries"" into the circumstances surrounding the Muddy Waters report.
The FCA declined to comment on the case on Monday.

After falling 42% from Aug. 6 to the close on Friday, Burford stock jumped to a session high of 843.5 pence after its statement on Monday. Its shares closed up 3.7% on Monday.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",Third quarter could mark turning point in U.S. profit cycle,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As investors prepare for U.S. corporations to report financial results next month, they could look past recent sluggish growth and find comfort as earnings look set to rebound after the third quarter.
Profits were strong throughout 2018 because of the tax windfall, so comparisons to those earnings periods mean growth has been relatively more muted this year. 
Those comparisons will get ""easier"" in Wall Street parlance in coming months, with the third quarter set to mark a low point in the recent earnings cycle. 
Moreover, easing monetary policies both here and abroad are likely to provide a cushion for companies despite slower economic growth, especially in the face of a lingering trade war between the United States and China. 
To be sure, some of those profit gains will depend on whether the economy does hold up, and experts say that is far from certain. Recent economic data has been mixed, with reports on U.S. labor and housing upbeat, but others disappointing.
Data Friday was in the latter camp. It showed U.S. consumer spending barely rose in August and the business investment remained weak, and some strategists consider the Trump administration's nearly 15-month trade war with China to be among the biggest risks to the economy and earnings.
Still, some strategists argue that just a small amount of economic growth should be enough to support better profit growth, which could help justify high market valuations.
""People are overestimating the negative from trade and underestimating the lagged response from a lot of policy easing,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.
""It could affect what corporations say when they look ahead,"" he said. 
The Federal Reserve has just begun to lower interest rates in the United States but other countries are further along in their easing cycles.
For the quarter that ends Sept. 30, analysts are forecasting S&P 500 earnings to fall 2.2% from a year ago, based on IBES data from Refinitiv, putting the period on track to be the lowest quarterly profit performance since 2016.
(GRAPHIC - S&P 500 profit performance since 2015: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6749/6680/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
Analysts were projecting earnings declines in both the first and second quarters, too, but those quarters ended with some profit growth, according to Refinitiv's data, and that could be the case for the third quarter as well.
While fourth-quarter earnings estimates have fallen sharply in recent months and strategists expect 2020's forecasts will come down as well, the last quarter of 2019 is still estimated to show profit growth of 4.1%. And earnings are forecast to grow 11.2% in 2020.
Many investors are hopeful that earnings, which begin in mid-October with reports from JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and other banks, will take some of the focus away from recent political turmoil, including Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.
The Cboe volatility index (VIX) ended Friday at a three-week high.
""It's good that earnings are coming ... At least then we'll have some concrete data to go on,"" said Susan Schmidt, head of securities and portfolio manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors Americas in Chicago. ""we don't expect good things to come out of this earnings season. I think we're going to hear toned-down guidance.""
Results could offer some positive surprises. 
According to most forecasts on Wall Street, the trajectory for earnings is still upward after the third quarter, said Jill Carey Hall, a U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.

""If we see any positive news on trade, and if corporates have been successful in mitigating some of the pressures, that could help reaffirm expectations of a pickup in profit growth,"" she said.

 Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and JD.Com Inc (O:JD) rose 2% each in early trading. They had tumbled more than 5% after the reports said the potential moves were aimed at limiting the flow of U.S. capital to Chinese companies.
On Monday, China warned of instability in international markets from any ""decoupling"" of China and the United States, and noted a U.S. Treasury response that said there were no immediate plans to block Chinese listings ""at this time"".
Helping sentiment further was White House trade adviser Peter Navarro dismissing the reports as ""fake news.""
""That story, which appeared in Bloomberg; I've read it far more carefully than it was written. Over half of it was highly inaccurate or simply flat-out false,"" Navarro told CNBC.
Bloomberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Index providers  MSCI Inc  (N:MSCI) and S&P Global Inc (N:SPGI) were up 1% and 0.2%, respectively. The companies, which have increased their exposure to Chinese shares in recent years, had fallen over 3% each on Friday.
""Implementing (a delisting) would be a very massive undertaking and extremely challenging, so the reaction we saw on Friday was quite exaggerated,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas. 
Shares of  China Automotive  (O:CAAS) and NetEase Inc (O:NTES) were the biggest gainers among U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. 

Video game-streaming company Huya (HUYA), online financial companies  Qudian Inc  (N:QD) and  PPDAI  Group Inc (N:PPDF) and chat app maker  Momo Inc  (O:MOMO) also rose marginally.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 11:48AM ET</span>",Forever 21 closing stores in bankruptcy filing shows limits to fast fashion,"By Rama Venkat and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Fast-fashion retailer Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy late on Sunday, joining a growing list of brick-and-mortar companies that have seen sales hit by the rise of competition from online sellers like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and the changing fashion trends dictated by millennial shoppers. 
Forever 21 Inc, the privately held company that helped popularize trendy and cheap clothing, has fallen out of favor with shoppers, in part due to other retailers like Sweden' H&M and Spain's Zara that churn out affordable styles similar to those recently seen on designer runways. 
Younger and more environmentally conscious shoppers are also choosing brands that ethically source garments instead of retailers that use cheap fabrics to make T-shirts that are snapped up for $5. Resale sites like thredUp.com, which calls itself the largest online thrift store, are also growing in popularity. 
Forever 21, which has 815 stores in 57 countries, said the restructuring will allow it to focus on the profitable core part of its operations and shut stores in some international locations.
It has requested court approval to close up to 178 U.S. stores outside of its major markets.
On its website on Monday, Forever 21 sales included tops that started at $3 and dresses, handbags and jewelry and pants for $20 and under.
Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail research firm A-Line Partners, said the bankruptcy would likely create pressure on other clothing retailers as Forever 21 slashes prices to clear inventory.
She said the chain did little to differentiate itself from others and also has very large store leases to support.
""They used to have a bit of an older customer, but customers have become more conscious of where they spend their dollars. They want sustainability, they want to feel represented and I don't think Forever 21 particularly stood for any of this,"" she said.
Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Los Angeles, the apparel retailer said it will close most of its stores in Asia and Europe but would continue operations in Mexico and Latin America. 
Since the start of 2017, more than 20 U.S. retailers including Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) and Toys 'R' Us have filed for bankruptcy as more customers shop online and eschew large malls.
Forever 21 also said on Sunday its Canadian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy and it plans to wind down the business, closing 44 stores in the country.
""Slimming down the operation and reducing costs is only one part of the battle. The long-term survival of Forever 21 relies on the chain creating a sustainable and differentiated brand,"" Saunders said.
Forever 21 lists both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion, according to the court filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

The retailer, which filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, said it received $275 million in financing from its existing lenders, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Bank NA as agent, and $75 million in new capital from TPG Sixth Street Partners and certain of its affiliated funds.

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Martina Merz, chair of Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) supervisory board, will take over as chief executive on Oct. 1, the group said on Monday, hoping to end years of underperformance at the company and restore investor confidence.
Merz's appointment, agreed on unanimously by the group's supervisory board, will be for a maximum of 12 months, the group said, adding the contract with current CEO Guido Kerkhoff was terminated by mutual agreement.
The replacement confirms last week's announcement of a wider management reshuffle at the group, which has had a string of profit warnings and two botched restructurings.
""We are now looking to the future and continuing our strategic realignment. In the new executive board team we will take the structural decisions now on the agenda with the necessary consistency,"" Merz said.
Her biggest task will be to deliver on plans to sell or list Thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology (ET), the company's most profitable and healthiest asset, to bring in funds needed to restructure other divisions and pay down debt.
Tentative bids for ET, which analysts have valued at up to 17 billion euros ($18.5 billion), are expected in a month's time, sources told Reuters last week. Thyssenkrupp is also considering a partial listing of the division.
NO SPECIAL DIVIDEND
Knut Giesler, vice chairman of ET's supervisory board and head of the IG Metall union in North Rhine-Westphalia state, where Thyssenkrupp is based, said Thyssenkrupp needs to keep a majority holding in the business.
He said any proceeds from a sale would have to stay within the group and opposed the idea of a special dividend for shareholders: ""The company needs to be stabilised. Whoever wants a special dividend must expect resistance.""
Thyssenkrupp has paid a stable dividend of 0.15 euros per share for the past four financial years, but with shares down 38.8% over the past year and four profit warnings since July 2018, it is unclear whether this will be repeated.
Thyssenkrupp's biggest shareholder, the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation, welcomed Merz's appointment, saying the ""urgently needed realignment decided in spring can now be swiftly pursued and implemented"".
Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board also approved the appointment of Klaus Keysberg to the management board from Oct. 1. He will also remain head of the Materials Services business until a successor has been found.

""The new executive board team will strengthen the confidence of the capital markets, shareholders, customers and employees in our company. I am absolutely convinced of this,"" said Siegfried Russwurm, who will take over as chairman while Merz is CEO.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on two units of Chinese shipper COSCO hit the liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker industry on Monday as U.S.-listed Teekay LNG (N:TGP) said its shipping joint venture in Russia had been ""blocked"" because of its ties to COSCO.
The United States imposed sanctions on COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co and subsidiary COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman & Ship Management Co for allegedly carrying Iranian crude oil.
Teekay LNG said on Monday that its 50-50 Yamal LNG Joint Venture had been deemed a ""blocked person"" under the sanctions because its partner China LNG Shipping (Holding) (CLNG) is 50% owned by COSCO Dalian.
""As a result of CLNG's 50% interest, the Yamal LNG Joint Venture also currently qualifies as a 'Blocked Person' under OFAC rules,"" Teekay said in a statement, referring to the Executive Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Order.
""For clarity, the Teekay Group has not traded and will not trade with Iran and will not act in contravention of any trading sanctions,"" Teekay said in the statement after postponing its Oct. 2 investor day because of the developments.
The venture owns Arc7-class LNG tankers capable of navigating through Arctic ice, making them key to transporting LNG from Novatek's (MM:NVTK) Yamal LNG plant in northern Russia.
The LNG plant, surrounded by thick ice during the winter, is unique in operating in such harsh conditions. The Arc7 tankers take LNG westward to Europe in winter and eastward to Asia in summer when ice along the Northern Sea Route dissipates sufficiently to allow passage.
A Novatek spokeswoman declined to comment immediately.
Teekay said it would hold a conference call at 2000 GMT to discuss the developments.
SIZEABLE FLEET
The venture owns the Eduard Toll, Rudolf Samoylovich, Nikolay Yevgenov and Vladimir Voronin tankers, all newly built for Yamal, which began operations in December 2017.
Georgiy Ushakov, another Teekay Arc7 tanker, is now heading to Yamal after its sea trials around South Korea's  Daewoo Shipbuilding  and Marine Engineering (DSME) (KS:042660) shipyard. A sixth, Yakov Gakkel, is undergoing tests.
A further nine Arc7 tankers serving the Yamal plant are managed by Dynagas (N:DLNG), Mitsui OSK Lines (T:9104) and Sovcomflot.
Yamal has been producing and shipping LNG above its expected capacity of 16.5 million tonnes a year (mtpa), shipping 12.8 mtpa so far this year.
""Everything is going without hindrance,"" a source close to Novatek told Reuters when asked about the tankers' movements.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. sanctions on COSCO hit LNG tankers in Russia's Arctic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6697/6679/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
The sanctions imposed last Friday on the two COSCO units caused oil freight rates to spike as Asian oil buyers rushed to secure alternative vessels to load crude oil from the Middle East.

Shipping analysts said LNG freight rates have jumped by between 7% and 11% in the past week to about $70,000 a day, though rates have been rising gradually in recent weeks as winter demand picks up.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 10:22AM ET</span>",Fitch cuts Saudi credit rating citing 'risk of further attacks',"By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Rating agency Fitch downgraded Saudi Arabia's credit rating to A from A+ on Monday, citing rising geopolitical and military tensions in the Gulf following an attack on its oil facilities and a deterioration of the kingdom’s fiscal position.
The Saudi finance ministry said it was disappointed by the ""swift"" downgrade and urged Fitch to reconsider it, arguing the move did not reflect the kingdom's response to the Sept. 14 attack or its capacity to handle adversity.
The move – which places Saudi Arabia one notch above the assessment of peer rating agency S&P Global – is a blow to the largest Arab economy as it seeks investment to diversify away from oil and prepares a potential international sale of U.S. dollar denominated Islamic bonds.
It follows an unprecedented attack on Saudi oil plants which initially halved the crude output of the world's largest oil exporter. Riyadh blamed adversary Iran, a charge Tehran denies.
""In our view, Saudi Arabia is vulnerable to escalating geopolitical tensions given its prominent foreign policy stance, including its close alignment with U.S. policy on Iran and its continued involvement in the Yemen war,"" Fitch said on Monday.
It saw a risk that the United States and Saudi Arabia could be drawn into a deeper conflict with Iran or its allies.
""Although oil production was restored fully by end-September, we believe that there is a risk of further attacks on Saudi Arabia, which could result in economic damage.""
The finance ministry said the kingdom had shown ""restraint and careful consideration"" in its response and had acted immediately and effectively to maintain global oil supplies.
Saudi officials have said the Sept. 14 strike would not affect state finances or growth, but investors and analysts said it could have a long-term impact on ambitious plans to diversify the Saudi economy and attract foreign capital.
""We have revised our assessment of the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia's economic infrastructure to regional military threats as a result of the most recent attack,"" Fitch said.
Fitch is the first agency to change Riyadh's credit rating -- used by investors to assess the risk associated with a debt issuer -- since the attacks, the most dramatic of several incidents this year raising Iranian-Saudi tensions.
S&P Global Ratings last week affirmed its A-(minus) rating, saying however that its rating could come under downward pressure should Saudi oil infrastructure be attacked repeatedly.
IPO PLANS
Fitch said it was forecasting a widening of the Saudi fiscal deficit to 6.7% of GDP from last year's 5.9%, due to a loosening of fiscal policy and lower average oil prices and production.
The finance ministry said the deficit was ""well within the parameters"" it had set for the 2019 budget and that financial assets ""substantially exceed"" liabilities.
Ratings agency Moody's cut its 2019 forecast for Saudi economic growth to 0.3% from 1.5% after the attacks, though said it was largely due to an overall decline in oil production.
Fitch's downgrade comes ahead of a planned issue of international Islamic bonds by the kingdom, and the rating move could potentially affect the cost of Saudi Arabia's debt issue.
""The dollar sukuk would be a good test to see if pricing has been impacted, albeit slightly given that S&P last week kept its rating untouched,"" sad John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Gulf Research Center.
The downgrade also comes as state oil giant Aramco presses on with its initial public offering (IPO) plans, a pillar of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's diversification drive.
Dollar-denominated bonds issued by the Saudi government didn't move much in the wake of the downgrade. The 2047 issue was down 0.5 cent at 113.50 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb data, little changed from earlier in the trading session. The 2046 issue was 0.3 cent lower at 111.55 cents in the dollar.
""People are focusing on the returns and how low the debt is and the fact foreign assets are large,"" said Giyas Gokkent, of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities, when asked why there hadn't been a large bond market reaction.
""In an environment where the Fed is easing there's appetite among investors for strong names in the Gulf of which Saudi Arabia is one.”
Fitch rated Aramco A+ in April, when the company for the first time disclosed its finances before an inaugural bond issue. The rating agency said at the time it put Saudi Aramco's ""standalone credit profile (at) ‘AA+’"", adding that its rating was ""capped by that of Saudi Arabia in view of strong linkage between the state and the sovereign."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be permitted to retain a total of $45 billion in earnings going forward, as an initial step toward exiting government control.
In a joint statement released Monday, the Treasury Department and Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates the pair, said the new policy will allow the two to rebuild capital reserves.
""This letter agreement between Treasury and FHFA...is an important milestone on the path to reform,"" said FHFA Director Mark Calabria in a statement.
Ending the government's sweep of their quarterly profits was widely seen as a first step in any effort to end the 2008 bailout of Fannie and Freddie -- two private companies that guarantee over half of the nation's mortgages.
In a report released this month detailing a housing policy overhaul, the Treasury recommended ending the profit sweep as part of a comprehensive effort to shore up their finances and shrink their overall footprint in the market.
Undoing that sweep helps the pair rebuild their own reserves, which policymakers say is a critical first step towards eventually removing the two from government control altogether.
The Treasury holds warrants representing 80% of Fannie and Freddie’s common stock, as well as senior preferred stock agreements.
Those agreements were modified in 2012 to bar Fannie and Freddie from retaining a significant amount of profits. Now, the Treasury says Fannie and Freddie can retain $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively.
However, Calabria has also said he would like to explore other ways for the companies to raise capital, saying it could take years for the pair to build sufficient reserves simply by retaining earnings.
Since 2012, Fannie and Freddie have paid the Treasury a total of $292 billion profits, exceeding the $191.5 billion in government support they received, according to public data."

LONDON (Reuters) - A couple of hefty share listings in Europe and the return of AB InBev's (BR:ABI) Asian unit float in the third quarter of 2019 brought some hope to a global IPO market battered by political volatility and downbeat global growth expectations.
Investors' nervous mood was highlighted in the third quarter by the cancellation of WeWork's planned $20 billion initial public offering in the United States, while a poor debut for fitness start-up Peleton has added to the gloom.
Fund raising through stock markets globally is down by nearly 18% in the first three quarters of 2019 compared to the same period a year ago, its lowest since 2012, Refinitiv data showed.
This was partly due to the steep fall in Asian markets as protests rumbled on in Hong Kong and trade tensions between China and the United States simmered in the background .
Asia-Pacific equity capital markets (ECM) volumes were down 22% overall to $147.8 billion equivalent over the first three quarters versus the same period last year, particularly hurt by a 40% fall in IPOs to $40.88 billion. Chinese IPOs alone halved in volume to $26.7 billion.
But with Belgian brewing giant AB Inbev reviving the Hong Kong listing of its Asian Budweiser Brewing Company APAC to raise around $5 billion last week, the mood has turned a little more upbeat.
""The markets may be a little more volatile, but that doesn't change the appetite for companies operating on strong fundamentals in China that are considering IPOs,"" said Alex Abagian, Co-Head of Asia Pacific ECM at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""These are good assets, though maybe they will have to be a little more sensitive about price and valuation considering the extra market volatility,"" he said.
Similarly in Europe, bankers said they were feeling a little better about life after German tech firm  TeamViewer  (DE:TMV) and Swedish buyout group EQT Partners raised an overall 3.4 billion euros ($3.71 billion).
""I feel constructive about the rest of the year. We have already had some names re-open the market post-summer and there is a functioning market for growth stories of size,"" said James Fleming, co-head of ECM for Europe, Middle and Africa at Citi.
""That said, there's no denying it has been a tough year for EMEA ECM, with volumes at historically trough levels.""
European ECM proceeds are at their lowest level since 2012 in the first three quarters of the year, down 23% to $88.6 billion equivalent, while IPO volumes are down a whopping 40% to around $17 billion.
Hopes that Saudi Aramco could blow this figure out of the water in the fourth quarter with the biggest deal of the year -- and possibly the biggest IPO ever -- have faded with sources telling Reuters the listing may not happen this year.
MORE ROBUST U.S. MARKET
While ECM bankers in the Asia-Pacific and EMEA region have had a relatively lean time so far this year, their counterparts in the Americas have fared better, with overall volumes down only 6% at $203.77 billion.
In terms of IPOs, volumes in the United States were actually up 5% in the first three quarters of the year at $41.66 billion compared with the same period last year, helped by Uber's (N:UBER) $8.1 May listing, the year's biggest IPO.
But there have also been some problems.
Unicorns making their debut on the U.S. stock market are getting a rough ride, especially if they are losing money, casting a shadow over the IPO calendar for the rest of the year.
Loss-making teeth alignment company SmileDirectClub (O:SDC) was the first U.S. IPO in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first day, according to research firm Renaissance Capital. It was a similar story for fitness startup  Peloton Interactive Inc  (O:PTON), which closed down 11.2% percent in their market debut having priced at the top of its target range.

The decision to wind down South American businesses was announced in January following pressure from Elliott and Bluescape Resources at a time when California-based utilities were already under pressure from the devastating wildfires that hit the state.
Sempra intends to use the deal proceeds to bolster its balance sheet and fund capital needs for its core utilities in California and Texas, Chief Executive Jeffrey Martin said in a statement on Monday.
The company settled with the investors, who at that time held a combined 4.9%, by agreeing to add two new board members and review its liquefied gas portfolio.
Elliott no longer own any shares in Sempra, according to the fund's latest quarterly filing. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048445/000156761919016981/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml 
Sempra also said it was continuing with the sale process for its businesses in Chile, including its 100% stake in Chilquinta Energía SA [SRECHQ.UL] and Tecnored SA. The company said it expected to announce an agreement in the fourth quarter.
Italian utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) earlier this year made a non-binding bid for the assets Sempra was looking to sell in Chile and Peru..
The Peruvian sale will include the 83.6% stake in Luz del Sur, as well as interests in energy services firms Tecsur SA and Inland Energy SAC, the company said. 
Sempra said the deal with China Yangtze Power International (Hongkong) Co, which has to be approved by the Peruvian anti-trust agency and the Bermuda Monetary Authority, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020.
Sempra's subsidiary, Sempra LNG, has entered into an agreement with China Three Gorges Corp over potential supply of liquefied natural gas, the company said.

Since the announcement to sell the South America businesses, the company's shares have risen about 28% through Friday's close.

The payments are part of plan for a growing, progressive dividend to investors, according to a corporate presentation posted on the company’s website on Monday. The proposed payment, which could be boosted further with special dividends, compares with $58 billion in 2018.
Dividend payments of $75 billion would give investors a yield of 3.75% if the company achieves its ambitions of a $2 trillion valuation. Although it’s a decent payout in a low-interest rate world, it’s a lower dividend than other Big Oil firms: investors in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) receive a yield of 6.22%, while  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). pays out 4.9%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Equity investors will also receive only slightly higher returns than bond investors. The yield on the company’s 2029 bond is around 3%.
The state-run company plans to announce its intention to float around Oct. 20, people with knowledge of the matter said last week. The firm, which held analyst meetings last week, is targeting a valuation of at least $2 trillion -- more than double that of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The IPO is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans to revamp the Saudi economy and will release billions in capital for the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund.
The presentation also showed a changed schedule for royalty tax payments on oil production. Payments will be lower when oil is below $70 a barrel, but higher above that level. Under a new royalty structure effective from Jan. 1, 2020, Aramco will pay 15% for Brent prices up to $70 a barrel, 45% for Brent prices between $70 a barrel and $100 a barrel, and 80% on Brent prices above $100 a barrel. The current tax regime, introduced in January 2017, started at 20% and peaked at 50%.
Aramco will target net gearing, a measure of debt relative to the equity value of a company, of between 5% and 15% through the oil-price cycle, the presentation said. While that’s lower than other major oil companies, it offers room to borrow for a company that’s traditionally carried very little debt."

Many new entrants have been employing multi-class voting share structures -- including seven of the 10 largest IPOs so far this year, strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Sept. 27. That could prevent them from being added to indexes managed by the likes of S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell. That would mean missing out on flows from passive investment managers tracking those benchmarks.
“Using multi-class voting to insulate management from its own shareholders comes at a significant long-term cost,” the strategists wrote. “Firms restricted from joining major indices will not fully benefit as capital flows into passive funds that now represent more than 50% of total U.S. mutual fund and ETF assets.”
A potentially banner year for U.S. IPOs is showing signs of cooling. Firms like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) have struggled after their debuts, while SmileDirectClub (NASDAQ:SDC) had the worst opening trade for a big IPO in more than a decade.
The disappointing run in addition to an uncertain economic environment could put a freeze on offerings over the rest of this year and possibly into next year, as well. That’s even before layering on the “secular headwinds,” as Goldman calls the index-inclusion issue.
Goldman acknowledges the pro multi-class structure argument that the set up allows management to focus more on strategy and value creation without being distracted by activist investors seeking short-term gains.
“A sunset provision on dual-class stock is one potential solution to the corporate governance dilemma,” the strategists wrote. “Phasing out high-voting stock after 5-10 years would allow firms the opportunity to eventually be included in the major indices while providing some shareholders more control in the near term.”"

BRUNSWICK, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Monday rejected a German judge's call to settle a customer class action lawsuit over its rigging of diesel emissions tests, saying there was no case to answer.
VW admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests in 2015, a scandal which has cost it more than $30 billion in vehicle refits, fines and provisions.
""The vehicles are driven by hundreds of thousands of customers every day, which is why we believe there is no damage and therefore no cause for complaint,"" the German carmaker said.
It was responding to a call by the judge of the Higher Regional Court of Brunswick, which is near the carmaker's headquarters, on the first day of hearings in the case.
About 470,000 car owners have registered to participate in the lawsuit and the Brunswick court booked the local town hall to allow for large numbers of observers.
When the diesel scandal broke 2.4 million cars with defeat devices were on German roads. In the meanwhile, 99 percent have received a software update.
The scandal still casts a shadow over VW, with prosecutors last week accusing its Chief Executive Herbert Diess of holding back market-moving information on the rigged tests.
The VW board has backed Diess, who is leading the carmaker's efforts to reinvent itself as a champion of cleaner driving.
The German class action was made possible after the cabinet approved a draft law last year allowing consumer protection organizations to litigate on behalf of consumers, avoiding the high legal costs that might put people off legal action.
Negotiations were unlikely to be easy but the court would want to support and not impede them, judge Michael Neef said.
State-financed consumer protection organization vzbv has expressed confidence in being able to win or settle the case, pointing to the fact that a majority of local and higher regional courts have so far ruled in favor of motorists.
Vzbv has said it aimed to show that owners of VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat cars with so-called type EA 189 diesel engines have been intentionally harmed by VW's use of software that was used to cheat emissions tests.
VW has said that there was no legal basis for consumers in Germany to seek compensation due to differences in law.
Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States that addressed claims from them, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers and included buyback offers and additional compensation for about 500,000 owners.
VW had rejected criticism that the compensation for U.S. car owners was not extended to other jurisdictions. Consumers have also brought lawsuits in countries including Switzerland, Australia and Belgium."

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 08:46AM ET</span>",'Built on lie' funds face tougher rules starting in 2020,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets regulator published tougher rules on Monday for funds that invest in hard-to-sell assets like property, saying investors must get better warnings about the risks they face if they want their money back at short notice.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it will introduce a new category of funds investing in inherently illiquid assets, or FIIA, from September 2020, confirming proposals made last October.
""The new rules and guidance are designed to protect the interests of investors, particularly during stressed market conditions,"" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's executive director for strategy and competition.
""This includes those wishing to redeem their holdings, as well as those wishing to remain invested in the fund.""
The funds will be subject to additional requirements, including standard risk warnings in financial promotions, enhanced depositary oversight, and a requirement to produce liquidity risk contingency plans, it said.
""This means we’re likely to see funds suspend dealing more frequently and sooner than they would have done in the past,"" said Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell.
The FCA backed down on plans to stop property funds continually having a large cash buffer, Hughes added.
Funds investing in property had to be ""gated"" to suspend redemptions during market stress immediately after the result of Britain's referendum to leave the European Union in June 2016.
The funds were unable to meet promises of daily redemptions, prompting Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to describe such funds as being ""built on a lie"".
The FCA came under further pressure from lawmakers to intervene after high-profile fund manager Neil Woodford suspended his flagship equity income fund in June, which promised daily redemptions.
The Woodford fund was unable to meet a flood of redemptions and was found to have breached a rule limiting how much it can invest in illiquid assets.
The FCA assessed whether any lessons might be relevant to the issues covered in its new rules.
It said its new rules will not apply to EU-regulated funds known as UCITS, that include the Woodford fund, even though FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey has described the bloc's rules as ""flawed"".
The Woodford fund breached a rule that allows no more than 10% of a fund in illiquid assets, known in the industry as the ""trash"" ratio.
Britain's Investment Association, a trade body for asset management, said the FCA's ""pragmatic and measured"" approach recognised the need to enable investment in illiquid assets through open-ended funds. But all open-ended funds could face more rules once the Bank of England and FCA complete a separate review.
That review is assessing how funds’ actual redemption terms - rather than just how existing ones are applied - might be better aligned with the liquidity of their assets in order to minimize financial stability risks, and provide appropriate protection to investors."

LONDON (Reuters) - British-based digital banking app Revolut is set to hire around 3500 staff as it expands into 24 new markets thanks to a new global deal with payments giant  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), the two companies said on Monday.
Revolut, one of a breed of new digital-only account providers taking aim at traditional high street banks, has grown at breakneck pace since its launch in July 2015 and now boasts more than 8 million customers.
The deal with Visa expands an existing agreement between the two firms and will see Revolut expand from its current markets of Europe and Australia to open in the United States and Singapore by the end of this year, with Canada and Japan to follow, Revolut said. 
Revolut will then launch in other Latin American and Asian markets but does not have a fixed timeline, its chief executive and founder Nikolay Storonsky told Reuters.
""We are around 1500 people now and by summer next year we plan to be around 5000,"" he said.
The expansion into new markets will be subject to Revolut getting the necessary regulatory approvals.
The deal is not exclusive but will see at least 75% of all Revolut cards carry Visa branding rather than that of rivals such as Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA).
The global push could see Revolut double or triple its customers in the next year, Storonsky said. 
He told Reuters that Revolut's average customer holds around 1000 euros in their account, giving a total deposit balance of around 8 billion euros ($8.74 billion) currently, a minnow compared to global banking giants like HSBC and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) with trillion-dollar-plus deposit totals.
But, along with its peers, Revolut has shocked incumbent banks into upping their digital game, as customers flock to Fintechs with their slicker apps, money management tools and attractive offers on foreign exchange.
Revolut's rapid growth in recent years has not been without hiccups. It faced media reports about a cutthroat work culture and questions from Britain's financial watchdog earlier this year about its sanctions-checking systems.
Revolut said at the time it has never failed to meet its legal or regulatory sanctions requirements.
Reuters reported in September that customers who had been victims of fraud were frustrated by the digital bank's customer service, which was slow to respond and offered only in-App chat rather than a telephone helpline.
""We are a different company than we were two to three years ago, we've learned lessons,"" Storonsky said of those problems.

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>",Chinese companies rethink U.S. IPOs after Trump's delisting threat,"By Samuel Shen and Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Bestbond, a Chinese apartment rental company, had been planning on a Nasdaq flotation in one to two years but as U.S.-China trade tensions racheted higher, the Hong Kong stock exchange emerged as a possible candidate. Now, it's firmly on the table.
""We're having second thoughts,"" CFO Wang Jia told Reuters, adding that Hong Kong, despite being beset with political unrest, had become more attractive after news emerged on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was looking at delisting Chinese companies from U.S. bourses.
Bestbond, based in Nanjing, eastern China, still prefers Nasdaq as it is a higher profile, more liquid market that would likely offer better valuations, but the company cannot afford to have its eggs in just one basket, Wang said.
While a U.S. Treasury official has said Trump's administration was not considering blocking Chinese companies from U.S. listings ""at this time"", the possibility it may do so has resulted in much handwringing by mainland firms that had been looking at a U.S. IPO.
""Too many calls. Every client is worried,"" said Terence Lin, CEO of World Financial Holding Group, a boutique investment bank which helps Chinese companies with Nasdaq listings.
Two sources said the U.S. move was part of a broader idea to limit U.S. investment in Chinese firms, while one source has said that it is motivated by security concerns.
Lin believes, however, that Trump's threat would be extremely difficult to implement legally and is merely a negotiation tactic in the rapidly escalating trade war between the world's two biggest economies.
Even if difficult to execute, Trump's threats are bound to hurt Chinese firms already listed in the United States as well as providing bourses such as the Hong Kong and London stock exchanges with a fresh and lucrative opportunity to woo Chinese firms, industry participants said.
""The political uncertainty could exert pressure on the valuations and the liquidity of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks for a long long time,"" said Frederick Shen, partner at Chinese venture capital firm New Vision Capital.
Shen said he's increasingly taking his portfolio tech startups to list on China's newly launched STAR Market instead of the Nasdaq.
According to regulatory filings, corporate executives and bankers, Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) is cracking down on IPOs of small Chinese companies by tightening restrictions and slowing down their approval.
A Nasdaq spokeswoman said the bourse provides non-discriminatory and fair access to all eligible companies, but declined to comment on the impact of the listing rule changes for small Chinese companies.
CORNERSTONE WOES
For some firms, Trump's threats have even greater implications.
Cornerstone, a Chinese boutique private equity fund manager, had been hoping for an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in October but now sees an imminent U.S. listing as challenging, according to people familiar with management's thinking.
The Guangzhou, southern China-based asset manager focuses on investing in Chinese firms that have listed or are seeking to list in the United States, making its business model particularly vulnerable to slumps in those valuations.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index (HXC), a gauge that tracks Nasdaq-listed Chinese firms, slumped more than 4% on Friday.
The sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, a firm that advises Chinese companies on their capital markets strategies, said making equity capital raising a new flashpoint in the war between China and the United States benefits nobody.
""Having just returned from a week in China and given the work we do with pre-IPO Chinese companies, it's clear there is a mutual interest among the business community to continue to conduct business,"" said Drew Bernstein, co-managing partner.
He said China had produced more than 180 of the 300 unicorns worldwide and had generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for U.S. bankers and advisors.
""The U.S. offers the most diversified capital in the world and China offers innovative companies and a massive consumer and investor base, to name a few benefits."""

LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (L:BP) Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley is drawing up plans to step down next year, ending a tumultuous decade at the helm of the oil and gas company that swung from near collapse in 2010 to rapid growth today, sources close to the company said on Monday.
BP's first American CEO has indicated several times in closed discussions in recent years that he would like to retire at the age of 65, taking him into 2020.
His retirement plans were discussed at BP's board meeting in the United States last week, but no final date has been decided, according to the sources.
A BP spokesman declined to comment.
Sky News reported on Saturday that Dudley plans to step down within a year and that an announcement could be made by the end of 2019.
Preparations for his departure were accelerated after Helge Lund became BP chairman in January 2019 with a mandate to oversee succession plans.
There has still been no decision on a successor, the sources said.
Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary and Bernard Looney, head of oil and gas production, are seen as leading candidates, sources have previously told Reuters.
Dudley became CEO after his predecessor Tony Hayward stepped down in the wake of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that left 11 rig workers dead and led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history. 
He has since had to navigate near bankruptcy, a vast asset disposal to pay for over $60 billion in litigation and clean-up costs followed by a landmark settlement with U.S. authorities.
A collapse in oil prices in 2014 also forced the entire industry into deep cuts.
After steadying the ship following the 2017 spill settlement, Dudley oversaw a recovery in the company's operations and a rapid expansion of its production, including a $10.5 billion acquisition of U.S. shale assets, its largest such deal in 30 years.
He has also overseen BP's efforts to address growing investor pressure to meet targets under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to fight climate change by investing in renewable energy and reducing BP's carbon emissions.
Dudley has enjoyed overwhelming support from investors at BP's annual general meetings, however a majority of shareholders opposed his 2016 pay package, forcing the company to slash it by 40%."
1103,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 07:56AM ET</span>",Explainer: What delisting Chinese firms from U.S. stock markets could mean,"By John Ruwitch and Alun John
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering forcing Chinese firms to delist from U.S. stock exchanges, according to sources, a move that would escalate U.S.-China tensions and could throw some of China's biggest companies into chaos.
It was not clear how the delistings might be done, but the idea is part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two sources said. One source said it was motivated by the Trump administration's growing security concerns about the companies' activities.
HOW SIGNIFICANT WOULD DELISTING CHINESE COMPANIES BE?
Market participants say a forced delisting on this scale would be unprecedented. As of February, more than 150 Chinese firms are listed on the Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange and NYSE American exchange for small cap firms.
Some of those listed are giants.  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) and JD.com Inc (O:JD), for example, have a combined market capitalization of more than $500 billion.
Some prestigious older companies like oil giant PetroChina (N:PTR) (SS:601857) (HK:0857) and China Life Insurance (N:LFC) (SS:601628) (HK:2628) also have U.S. listings.
WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE?
The proposals are likely to affect firms' willingness to list in the United States as well as provide rival bourses with a fresh and lucrative opportunity to woo Chinese companies. Other stock exchanges that might benefit include Hong Kong, London and China's newly launched STAR market for startups, analysts have said.
""The proposed measures would completely undermine the international (American Depository Receipt) market and would harm the U.S.'s role as a conduit for international capital,"" analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note on Sunday.
IPO bankers expect there will now be a pause in new Chinese listings in the United States as companies, advisers and investors wait for more clarity. Some might also wait to see whether Trump wins re-election in 2020.
It is unclear how forced delistings could be implemented.
If the proposal goes ahead, Chinese companies which are already listed would have to find a way to buy out shareholders. One option would be a secondary listing elsewhere and giving investors new shares in exchange for the U.S. stocks, said an equity capital markets banker, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
This plan would come with a number of risks for both investors and the companies as well as significant technical challenges, the banker said.
HAS THE IDEA OF FORCED DELISTINGS COME UP BEFORE?
Individual delistings are not uncommon. Companies may take themselves private or move to other exchanges, while bourses regularly remove listings that fail to comply with requirements. However forced delistings for geopolitical reasons would be very unusual.
Several Russian companies are still traded on U.S. exchanges even after the United States imposed sanctions following the 2014 dispute in Ukraine.
Pressuring at least some Chinese firms to delist has been raised previously.
For years, corporate governance advocates and politicians in the United States have complained about the lack of access to working papers from the audits of Chinese companies. In June, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers in June proposed a bill that would force U.S.-listed Chinese firms to submit to more regulatory oversight or face delisting."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog has fined the country's largest insurer  Prudential  (L:PRU) 24 million pounds ($29.39 million) for failures related to non-advised sales of annuities, it said on Monday.
The fine comes after  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Assurance, part of insurer Phoenix Group (L:PHNX), was charged 31 million over the same issue in July. 
The FCA said Prudential, which is preparing to spin off its UK business next month, failed to make sure customers were consistently advised that by shopping around they could get a higher rate on their annuities, which pay pensioners a fixed income for life. 
Prudential did not always tell customers about enhanced annuities, which pay a higher rate to policyholders with a reduced life expectancy, it said. 
""Prudential failed to treat some of its customers, who could have secured a better deal on the open market, fairly,"" Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA said.
""These are very serious breaches that caused harm to those customers.""
The fine relates to the period between July 2008 and September 2017, the FCA said, adding that by Sept. 19, 2019, Prudential had offered around 110 million pounds in redress to 17,240 customers.
""We are deeply sorry for the historic failings in our non-advised annuity business and any detriment this has caused our customers,"" Prudential said in an emailed statement, adding that it expected to compensate the ""vast majority"" of affected customers by the end of October.
Prudential's fine was cut by 30% because it did not dispute the findings, the FCA said.

Prudential shares were little changed on the news and were trading up 1% at 14.89 pounds at 1006 GMT.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Japan Post Insurance Co Ltd  (T:7181) said on Monday it discovered 6,327 cases of improper sales in a previously flagged misconduct matter that is still under investigation and that 1,400 cases among them are suspected of violating the law.
This is the first time the unit of Japan Post Holdings (T:6178) has said some of the cases have broken the law.
Another group company,  Japan Post Bank Co Ltd  (T:7182), separately said earlier this month it had improperly sold investment trust products to elderly customers in about 19,500 cases.
The misconduct cases have rocked the Japan Post Group and some of their affiliates, pummelling their shares. Japan Post Insurance has suspended sales of insurance policies.
The admissions cast a shadow over the government's plan to sell $10 billion worth of its shares in parent Japan Post Holdings to pay for reconstruction in areas hit by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
Japan Post Insurance had said in August it possibly sold a total of about 183,000 insurance policies that could have been disadvantageous to policy holders, over the five years through fiscal 2018.
It said on Monday most of the cases that fell foul of the law involved false explanations provided to customers. The company has so far scrutinized about 68,020 cases, accounting for about 37% of total misconduct, it said, releasing an interim report on the investigation.
""I will lead from the front to restore our trust from customers,"" Mitsuhiko Uehira, president of Japan Post Insurance, said at a news conference. He, Masatsugu Nagato, chief executive at Japan Post Holdings, and other senior executives who attended the briefing, bowed in apology.
""We will continue to investigate with the view that even a single case of misconduct cannot be tolerated,"" Uehira said.
Once their internal investigation is concluded, Japan Post Insurance will consider imposing punishments such as disqualifying insurance agents who violated law or internal rules, the company said.
While it had aimed to restart selling insurance policies in October, the company postponed it to January 2020.
The Financial Services Agency's (FSA) division that monitors Japan Post Group declined to comment as the investigation is not over.
Japan Post Insurance shares have slumped about 20% since July, while Japan Post Holdings and Japan Post Bank shares have fallen 16% and 6%, respectively, over the same period.
The group's U.S. affiliate Aflac's (N:AFL) shares have also fallen since the news of the misconduct emerged on worries about its sales in Japan."
1107,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 06:46AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Says It’s Time to Switch From U.S. to Euro-Area Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s been a significant change of heart from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) equity strategists: U.S. stocks are no longer preferred to Euro-area equities.
“There is a tactical opportunity opening up for Euro zone to catch up,” strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note.
The 20% underperformance of the region’s stocks in dollar terms over the past 18 months, combined with investment outflows amounting to 20% of assets under management, are part of the reason the strategists upgraded the Euro-area region to overweight, while downgrading the U.S. to neutral.
The valuation discount has widened and the relative price-earnings ratio is now close to “outright cheap” territory, JPMorgan says. Value stocks have shown some signs of revival this month, and the continuation of a sector rotation from growth into value is also likely to support Euro area outperformance against the U.S., according to the strategists.
That’s not all. The poor macro backdrop in Europe is likely to change in the next few months, Matejka writes. Money supply, which tends to lead PMIs by two to three quarters, is accelerating, while the European Central Bank is starting a new round of quantitative easing. Additionally, the weak economy, trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty are helping build the case for a fiscal stimulus.
There are still some risks though, particularly Brexit, with a no-deal outcome likely to weigh on European stocks generally. Matejka prefers to see the glass half full: not only is the U.K. crashing out of the European Union not in his base-case scenario, he also wouldn’t ignore the possibility of a deal being signed by the Oct. 31 deadline, which would be very bullish for U.K. stocks, but would also support the case for Euro-area equities."

1110,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 06:24AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Thiam Set to Survive Spy Drama at Credit Suisse,"Investing.com --   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) was the second-best performing bank stock in Europe after early trading on Monday, as reports suggested that the group’s board was willing to back CEO Tidjane Thiam over an unseemly spying scandal that has led to much clutching of pearls and dropped monocles in the staid world of Swiss banking.
The Financial Times and Bloomberg both reported that the board would not look to remove Thiam, although the FT noted that the board had not yet fully processed an internal report into the episode.
Thiam has notched up some notable successes in his tenure at the bank so far but failed to overcome the headwinds of low interest rates and trade conflicts that have held back its lending business and complicated the business of managing the wealth of China’s richest men and women.
Thiam’s record is under scrutiny for his use of detectives to monitor Khan and stop him luring away other key members of his team after Khan agreed to join CS’s arch-rival UBS (NYSE:UBS) last month. Khan defected after appearing to lose an internal power struggle with Thiam. He’s expected to take up his duties on Tuesday, UBS chairman Axel Weber told Bloomberg last week.
CS wasn’t immediately able to comment on the FT and Bloomberg reports.
UBS could certainly do with a little bit of Khan’s magic. Its stock is down 7% so far this year, while Credit Suisse’s is up 14%. And Thiam’s house also looks better on a three-year comparison, up 3% while UBS has fallen 14%.
In part, that’s because UBS moved faster and more radically to cut its investment bank division after the regulatory backlash to the financial crisis, and focus on the more predictable wealth management business. It has lost momentum in recent months, losing $2 billion through net client withdrawals in the second quarter. Thiam's restructuring has been a more recent affair.
Elsewhere Monday, it was a quiet opening to the week for European stocks, despite a reported upgrade from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts. The Stoxx 600 was effectively unchanged at 391.82 by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), while the DAX was also unchanged. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.2%"

BEIJING (Reuters) - China warned on Monday of instability in international markets from any ""decoupling"" of China and the United States, after sources said the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering the move, three sources briefed on the matter said on Friday, in what would be a radical escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions.
It would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two of the sources said. One said it was motivated by the Trump administration's growing security concerns about the companies' activities.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had noted the reports on delisting and the response from the U.S. Treasury, which said there were no plans to block Chinese listings ""at this time"".
China-U.S. trade and financial cooperation is mutually beneficial, Geng told a daily news briefing.
""Exerting maximum pressure and even seeking the forced decoupling of China-U.S. relations will harm the interests of Chinese and American companies and people, create turmoil in financial markets, and endanger global trade and economic growth,"" he added.
""This does not accord with the interests of the international community.""
Geng said he hoped the United States would work with China to deepen economic and financial cooperation, and that the United States would take a ""constructive attitude"" toward resolving differences.
Stocks in mainland China fell to their lowest in almost a month on Monday on the news that the United States may curb Chinese companies' access to U.S. capital markets, stoking fears of a major escalation in the trade war.
The news comes just ahead of celebrations in Beijing on Tuesday marking 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, at which President Xi Jinping will oversee a massive military parade.
The United States and China have been locked in an escalating trade war for over a year. They have levied punitive duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods, roiling financial markets and threatening global growth.
In June, U.S. lawmakers from both parties introduced a bill to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits, or face delisting.
Chinese authorities have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms - including member firms of the Big Four international accounting networks - citing national security concerns.
China and the United States are due to resume high-level talks next week in Washington on their increasingly bitter trade war.
China hopes Beijing and Washington will resolve their trade dispute ""with a calm and rational attitude"", Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, who has been part of China's negotiating team, said on Sunday."
1112,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 04:34AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Dubai Aerospace drops plans for big aircraft order, targets M&A deal","By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai Aerospace Enterprise favors expanding its fleet via a takeover of a rival after the group was unable to agree on a major order from Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA), its chief executive said. 
DAE, which joined the top tier of aircraft lessors with the 2017 acquisition of Dublin-based AWAS, was interested in a near-record purchase of 400 jets from Airbus and Boeing.
""It is hard to see how DAE is able to find a way to accept the price and terms and conditions the OEMs (original equipment manufacturer) are offering,"" CEO Firoz Tarapore told Reuters.
A pricing disagreement had been an issue when Tarapore told Reuters in May 2018 DAE was interested in the order. This has led to DAE pursuing other options to increase its portfolio.
Boeing declined to comment on customer discussions. Airbus could not be immediately reached for comment.
The order for 400 single-aisle aircraft would have been worth more than $40 billion at list prices, though discounts of at least 50 percent are common on large orders.
This would have given DAE a pipeline of jets ordered directly from manufacturers on par with its rivals, though the world's biggest planemakers are mostly sold out of their workhorse single-aisle jets until 2024. https://reut.rs/2nC29HQ
The long wait is not a concern for the Dubai state fund company which wants to double its portfolio to 800 jets within the next six to eight years. 
But Tarapore said the difference between the order price and the rental available in the leasing market was ""so large that it doesn't make any sense to have any hope that the gap narrows in the near future.""
""If you are sold out for four years what is your incentive to sell the first unit of the fifth year at any price other than the absolute highest price you can charge for it?” Tarapore said.
DAE could revisit a direct order in two years time as manufacturers clear their backlog of deliveries, though for now terms were ""completely mispriced,"" Tarapore said.
Instead, the Dubai-headquartered firm will look at expanding through organic growth, including sale and leaseback deals with airlines, as well as a potential takeover of a large rival.
""I think that our DNA is more aligned with doing a large, inorganic transaction and to supplement an inorganic transaction with organic growth,” Tarapore said.
Tarapore said an ideal takeover target would have around 100 to 200 jets in its fleet and none on order, but there are few of these.
“Whatever we end up buying has to advance our strategic objectives. As long as it does that, the price for that can be easily contextualised. That does not mean we are going to pay an insane price. It just means that for the right asset we would be willing to pay the market price.”
DAE was set up in 2006 with the aim of becoming one of the world’s biggest aircraft lessors, but started cancelling orders in 2010 as funds dried up following Dubai’s debt crisis.
The 2017 acquisition of AWAS, the industry’s 10th-biggest firm at the time, tripled DAE’s portfolio to about 400 owned, managed and committed aircraft worth over $14 billion.
Last week, it announced it had received a mandate from a fund manager to source and manage a $1.4 billion portfolio of jets.
That mandate will focus on Airbus A320ceo and Boeing 737NG jets, sourced from outside DAE's existing portfolio.
The company also plans to raise more than $500 million once it obtains credit ratings from agencies S&P and Moodys (NYSE:MCO). DAE has an investment grade credit rating of BBB-(minus) by Fitch.

Part of this money will be used to cover a $500 million debt maturity in August 2020, Tarapore said.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 03:23AM ET</span>","Bank of America, Morgan Stanley eye growth in employee-benefits management","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) are expanding the employee-benefits services they offer, hoping to gain market share in the dull-but-reliable business of managing wealth for companies and employees.
The banks, which operate the two biggest U.S. wealth management firms, are focused on different parts of the benefits business, executives told Reuters. But both strategies create opportunities for the firms to market to younger and middle-class clients. 
Morgan Stanley is building on its $850 million purchase of Solium Capital, which manages employee stock plans for some 3,400 companies and 2.7 million employees.
Morgan Stanley has renamed it Shareworks and is looking to roll out deferred compensation management, health savings accounts and student loan refinancing. The firm is also considering partnering with a payroll company.
Meanwhile, Bank of America has focused on retirement services, with significant growth in its 401(k)s and health service accounts businesses.
The bank now manages plans for about 30,000 companies covering 5 million people. It ranked No. 7 on PlanSponsor.com's annual list of 401(k) record-keepers by assets last year, three notches higher than in 2017.
The two banks typically cater to older, wealthy families. By providing wealth services to companies, they hope to start relationships with young workers that could develop into one-on-one wealth management relationships later. 
The investments Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are making in workplace benefits services reflect the global banking industry's shift toward steadier, fee-driven businesses to offset a secular decline in trading revenue since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
However, the business has become more competitive in recent years. Fidelity, Vanguard and TIAA are consistently ranked as the top three employee-benefits providers, and  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) and E*Trade Financial Corp (O:ETFC) have substantial stock plan businesses.
Companies only consider changing financial institutions about once a decade, and retirement products are fairly standardized, leaving little incentive to switch.
Combined with a push to reduce investor fees and the hefty expense of operating an employee-benefits operation at scale, it could be hard for Morgan Stanley and Bank of America to succeed, analysts said.
""This is a very fee-sensitive industry,"" said Anastasia Krymkowski, an associate director at research firm Cerulli Associates specializing in retirement. ""It's an even bigger deal in 401(k) plan management because you have this idea of being a good fiduciary.""
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH
Nonetheless, executives at the two banks told Reuters in separate interviews that they see opportunity to grow revenues and gain clients through these businesses. 
Bank of America believes it can pick up clients left behind by JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), which both quit the 401(k) business in recent years.
And Morgan Stanley bought the most popular software platform for employee stock plans, making it difficult for rivals to compete.
Morgan Stanley has added 200 new corporate clients since the acquisition and estimates that, overall, employees on Shareworks' platform have $1.5 trillion in other accounts. 
Executives predict that, over the next decade, they can turn hundreds of thousands of employees into customers of the firm's robo-adviser or its full-service brokerage.
""It creates value for the employer, the employee and creates a new source of potential clients for us,"" said Jed Finn, chief operating officer of Morgan Stanley's wealth unit.
Analysts said revenues earned from Shareworks will be minimal in the near-term but later could create substantial business.
Bank of America's strategy to market a full suite of employee benefit products, including 401(k)s, equity compensation plans and health savings accounts, to existing clients in other parts of the bank also makes it money now. 
Bank of America added nearly 3,000 corporate clients to its institutional retirement business in 2018, up about 50% from the prior year. So far this year, it has added another 2,190 of them. That includes 401(k)s, HSAs, employee stock and defined benefit plans.
""The vast amount of wins come from existing clients,"" said Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America's global head of commercial banking. 
Still, only about 10% of Bank of America's corporate clients use its retirement services, presenting the bank with an opportunity, Borthwick said. The institutional retirement business is hiring more retirement specialists to help pitch these products. 

""Getting a company to turn on a 401(k) or a stock plan administration takes time,"" said Glenn Schorr, analyst at Evercore ISI. ""The good news is that they already have relationships with their target market customer and now it is up to them to convince them.""

The strike is the first nationwide walkout at GM since a two-day work stoppage in 2007. 

The UAW has been careful about deploying strikes to gain leverage in bargaining since a 54-day walkout that occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 that cost GM more than $2 billion and accelerated the loss of UAW-GM jobs.

1117,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 01:00AM ET</span>",AIA Can Withstand Hong Kong Visitor Hit,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Turbulent times should mean good business for insurers as people try to protect themselves against the hazards of an uncertain world. Hong Kong’s summer of unrest has proved anything but happy for shares of AIA Group Ltd., the city’s biggest seller of policies. The company may prove more resilient than investors are giving it credit for.
AIA has slumped more than 16% from its July 19 peak, among the worst performers on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index in that period. The insurer has the third-highest weighting in the benchmark after  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd., which have both lost less than 9% over the same time frame. AIA’s steepening decline is unusual for a stock that has mostly seen steady gains since it was spun out of American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG). after the financial crisis in 2010.
Blame the Hong Kong protests. Anti-government demonstrations have led to a precipitous fall in mainland Chinese visitors to the semi-autonomous city. These tourists are an important source of business for Hong Kong insurers, whose dollar-based products offer a hedge against the falling yuan and a route outside China’s restrictive capital controls. Chinese tour groups to Hong Kong for the Golden Week holiday starting Oct. 1 are set to plunge 86% from a year earlier, Jinshan Hong and Qian Ye of Bloomberg News reported last week, citing the city’s Travel Industry Council.
Policies sold to mainland visitors accounted for 26% of total new premiums received from individuals in the first six months of 2019, according to Hong Kong’s Insurance Authority. While AIA sells insurance across Asia, Hong Kong contributed 40% of its new business value in the first half, Michael Chang of CGS-CIMB Securities Ltd. reckons. Of this, mainland Chinese visitors accounted for 20%, Chang estimates.
The physical presence of customers in Hong Kong is important because, unlike most financial assets, the city’s regulators require insurance to be sold face-to-face, at least to new clients. AIA,  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Plc and China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co., a state-controlled company based in Shanghai, are among the most reliant on mainland visitors, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steven Lam.
There’s more to AIA’s China exposure than sales made in Hong Kong, though. The company’s new business value in China surged 26% in the first half to account for 29% of AIA’s total. Demand for insurance is surging in the mainland as incomes rise while health and retirement systems remain under-developed.
Until recently, AIA had failed to make much headway in a market that’s dominated by state behemoths such as China Life Insurance Co., despite being the only foreign insurer allowed to operate without a partner (thanks to roots that stretch back to 1919, when AIG was founded in Shanghai). That may be starting to change as the government, under pressure from slowing economic growth, opens its financial markets further to overseas companies.
This year, the government loosened regulations that restricted AIA to five geographical regions: Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and the provinces of Jiangsu and Guangdong. The insurer has now moved into new provinces and started selling policies in Tianjin municipality and in the city of Shijiazhuang in Hebei province. (German insurer Allianz SE  has been given the green light to set up the first wholly foreign-owned insurance holding company in the country.)
In any event, the collapse in Chinese visitors to Hong Kong is likely to ease even if the protests continue. Investment-linked insurance products denominated in the Hong Kong dollar – which is pegged to the greenback – offer a perennial hard-currency allure for mainland individuals with few opportunities to diversify at home. Insurers in the city also sell policies denominated in the U.S. dollar itself. AIA’s new business value in Hong Kong jumped 19% in the first half.
The slide in AIA stock has taken its price to embedded value to 1.9 times, from a peak of 2.4 times at the end of June. That’s still a premium to rivals such as Ping An Insurance (Group) Co., at 1.3 times, and China Life at 0.5 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prudential, weighed down by its exposure to the slower-growing U.K. market, trades at 0.7 times embedded value. Still, 19 of 22 analysts tracked by Bloomberg rate AIA stock a buy, with only one sell recommendation.
This slump looks to have limits."
1118,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 12:27AM ET</span>",Chinese Stocks Drop as U.S. Considers Limiting Investor Flows,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks fell Monday after a report that the Trump administration is considering ways to limit U.S. investors’ exposure to Chinese assets.
The CSI 300 Index slipped 0.5% as of the mid-day break, on volume that was about 43% lower than the 30-day average. The moves onshore may be volatile due to thin liquidity ahead of the week-long holiday, as well as the closing of positions typically seen at quarter-end. The offshore yuan strengthened 0.2% to 7.1231 per dollar Monday and the onshore rate was little changed.
While a Treasury official said there are no plans to stop Chinese companies from listing on American exchanges, the added uncertainty comes at a particularly sensitive time for China. The country is stepping up measures to open its markets to global capital, just this month removing a hurdle for foreign investment into stocks and bonds. Officials are also preparing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic on Tuesday.
“Some risk-averse investors and those in need of liquidity might sell off stocks ahead of the long holiday just to play it safe,” said Sun Jianbo, president of China Vision Capital Management in Beijing. “I’d expect the downside to be limited as the U.S. and China are resuming trade talks.”
Integrating China’s capital markets into the global financial system has been a priority for the country’s policy makers since late 2017. In the year since MSCI Inc. first added mainland shares to its benchmarks, China has been expediting measures that make it easier for overseas investors to manage risk. Index provider FTSE Russell also embraced A shares this year, though last week it made the surprise decision to spurn Chinese bonds.
Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, also offers indexes for stocks and bonds. Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) started a phased inclusion of some Chinese sovereign debt into its benchmarks in April.
By the 11:30 a.m. break, overseas investors had sold a net 1.4 billion yuan ($197 million) of A shares via exchange links with Hong Kong. September is still on track to be a record month of buying, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Foreigners drive about 10% of daily turnover in China’s domestic stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg earlier this year. They own about 3.1% of the retail-dominated $6.7 trillion market, almost as much as the country’s mutual funds. International investors increased their holdings of Chinese debt to 2 trillion yuan in August, about 2% of the country’s bond market.
While winning index inclusion is one way to attract the billions of dollars pegged to major benchmarks, U.S. investment in onshore markets remains limited. Residents had just over $200 billion of long-term mainland Chinese financial assets as of June, according to the U.S. Treasury. That’s little more than double held in South Africa.
Calm had just returned to mainland markets after months of worsening economic data and the twists and turns of the trade war. While there was evidence of profit-taking in stocks last week, volatility in the Shanghai Composite Index fell to near its lowest in 19 months. The yuan enjoyed its calmest week since July as traders speculated Beijing wanted to ensure stability ahead of the celebrations.
The Shanghai gauge typically performs well before the National Day holiday, rising on the last trading session in all years but one in the past decade.
Monday will be the last chance for investors to price in the possibility of worsening tensions with the U.S. ahead of another round of trade talks scheduled for October. China’s biannual extended holidays have recently proven to be a vulnerability for mainland investors, who have had to wait to react to bleak news.
That’s a risk they may not want to take this time.
“A lot of retail guys are taking money out of the stock market ahead of the holiday week”, said Gerry Alfonso, director of international business department at Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co."

Net foreign selling in the equity market reached $1.2 billion in the third quarter, set for the biggest outflow since the second quarter of 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The selloff trims the year-to-date net inflow to $3.7 billion.
Investors have been worried that earnings will slump as growth in gross domestic product slows to 5.05%, the weakest in two years. To make matters worse, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Jakarta last week as part of countrywide protests aimed at forcing the government to reconsider legislation rights that groups say will curtail civil liberties.
The trouble signals a tough path ahead for President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, before he starts his second term next month. He managed to lead with a wider margin during the re-election in April and is expected to name his new cabinet after the Oct. 20 inauguration.
“The economic slowdown has been caused by a wait-and-see attitude among investors in the lead up to the cabinet formation,” said Harry Su, head of equity capital markets at Samuel International. “Continued demonstrations and skirmishes on the ground are adding to worries and contributed to the biggest net foreign outflow since June 2018.”
Su said he would advise clients to maintain their holdings of defensive stocks and wait for Widodo to decide on his new cabinet.
Widodo also has to deal with new police and military clashes with separatist forces in the province of Papua in which at least 30 people were killed.
“The current situation is undoubtedly not conducive to investment,” Su said. “I find the degree of flash point emergence to be highly unexpected.”"

HONG KONG (Reuters) - AB InBev's Asia-Pacific unit (HK:1876), which raised about $5 billion after relaunching its IPO this month, rose more than 6% on its market debut in Hong Kong, easing concerns of the impact of ongoing anti-government protests on new share offerings.
Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd's initial public offering (IPO) was among a handful of recent floats seen as tests of investor sentiment amid protests that have roiled Hong Kong for nearly four months.
Hong Kong as well as other regional markets more generally are also on edge amid a trade dispute between the United States and China, as well as slowing global economic growth.
The Budweiser APAC IPO is the second-biggest globally so far this year, trailing only the $8.1 billion flotation of  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) in May, data from Refinitiv showed.
 Anheuser-Busch InBev  NV (AB InBev) (BR:ABI), the world's largest brewer, relaunched the unit IPO this month after cancelling a plan for a bigger float in July citing ""several factors, including the prevailing market conditions"".
Budweiser APAC shares rose as high as HK$28.70 on Monday, versus their IPO price of HK$27 apiece, the bottom of a marketed range. The stock was trading at HK$28.55, up 5.7%, at 1138 local time (0338 GMT), while the market index (HSI) was up 0.2%.
""Obviously these are challenging times in Hong Kong, but we are very confident in the strong foundation here and we are very optimistic for the bright future of Hong Kong as one of the most important financial centres in Asia,"" said Budweiser APAC Chief Executive Jan Craps at the listing ceremony.
Hong Kong's metro stations and roads re-opened on Monday, after a chaotic weekend that saw police fire water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who set fires and threw petrol bombs.
The trigger for the protests was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people suspected of criminality to be sent to mainland China for trial, despite Hong Kong having its own much-respected independent judiciary.
The protests have broadened since they began more than three months ago into calls for universal suffrage.
Overall in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, equity capital market volume is down 25% for the first nine-months of the year compared with the same period last year at $162.6 billion, with IPOs seeing their steepest on-year drop at 41.5%, showed data from Refinitiv.
UPCOMING PUBLIC OFFERINGS
Despite the protests, IPO activity in Hong Kong has revived this month. Topsports International Holdings, the sportswear business of Chinese footwear retailer Belle International, last week launched an IPO of up to $1.2 billion.
Companies expected to launch Hong Kong IPOs within a month include logistics real estate developer ESR Cayman, which is expected to raise about $1 billion, and an over $1 billion float of Prague-based consumer lender Home Credit.
China's biggest e-commerce company  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), however, last month delayed its up to $15 billion listing in the city amid the political unrest.
More IPOs will be a boost for Hong Kong as a listings hub, with the city currently lagging its New York rivals.
Companies raised $15 billion in new listings in the Asian financial hub in the first nine months of this year - including that of Budweiser APAC - well short of the $42 billion raised in New York, according to Refinitiv data.
Proceeds from the IPO of Budweiser APAC, whose portfolio of more than 50 beer brands includes Stella Artois and Corona, will help AB InBev reduce debt of over $100 billion accumulated following the purchase of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) in late 2016. 
The brewer also has another goal of creating an Asian champion to spur consolidation. Analysts see the brewing assets of Thai Beverage PCL (SI:TBEV) or the Philippines' San Miguel Corp (PS:SMC) as possible partners or targets.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were the joint sponsors of the Budweiser IPO. They were also among the offering's global coordinators with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and Chinese investment bank CICC.

Shares in Budweiser, AB InBev’s Asia-Pacific unit, gained as much as 4% on their market debut in Hong Kong. 
Budweiser Brewing Company (HK:1876) raised about $5 billion after pricing the Hong Kong float at HK$27 per share, making it the world’s second-biggest IPO so far in 2019.
The company’s IPO was previously cancelled in July due to “several factors, including the prevailing market conditions.” 
Chinese e-commerce giant   Alibaba   (NYSE:BABA) also reportedly delayed its listing in Hong Kong, which was due to take place in August, amid anti-government protests and Sino-U.S. trade tensions. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed at 25,957.5 by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Analysts are paying close attention to the city’s ongoing unrest as a series of protests are reportedly planned for the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China on Tuesday.
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said on Thursday that she took responsibility for the “entire unrest” that has rocked the city since June. 
China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1%, while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.4%. The country’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index came in at 49.8 in September, slightly higher than the 49.5 expected by analysts. 
Beijing said over the weekend that it would continue to open up its financial markets. 
“We will take further steps to promote high-quality, two-way financial opening and encourage foreign financial institutions and funds to invest in the domestic financial market to boost the competitiveness and dynamism of the domestic financial system,” according to a summary from the eighth meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee posted on its website Sunday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 also lost 0.4%. Data from the Trade Ministry showed the country’s factory production dropped 1.2% in August from a month earlier. Analysts had forecast a fall of 0.5%.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.4%.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2019 02:17PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nasdaq cracks down on IPOs of small Chinese companies,"By Echo Wang and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) is cracking down on initial public offerings (IPOs) of small Chinese companies by tightening restrictions and slowing down their approval, according to regulatory filings, corporate executives and investment bankers.
Nasdaq's attempt to limit these stock market flotations comes as a growing number of them end up raising most of the capital in their IPO from Chinese sources, rather than from U.S. investors. 
The shares of most small Chinese companies trade thinly following their U.S. listing, because most of them stay in the hands of a few insiders. Their low liquidity makes them unattractive to many large institutional investors, to whom Nasdaq is seeking to cater.
For example, when  111 Inc  (O:YI), a Chinese online pharmacy network, raised $100 million in its IPO on Nasdaq last year, shares were mainly sold to connections of the company's executives, 111 CEO Liu Junling told Reuters in an interview.
Digital influencer incubator  Ruhnn Holding Ltd  (O:RUHN), after-school education provider  Puxin  Ltd (N:NEW), and pet product manufacturer Dogness International Corp (O:DOGZ) are other examples of Chinese companies that listed on Nasdaq in the last two years with more investors from China snapping up their shares than from the United states, according to sources close to the companies. Ruhnn, Puxin, and Dogness did not respond to requests for comment.
""One critical quality of our capital markets is that we provide non-discriminatory and fair access to all eligible companies. The statutory obligation of all U.S. equity exchanges to do so creates a vibrant market that provides diverse investment opportunities for U.S. investors,"" a Nasdaq spokeswoman said. 
The Nasdaq spokeswoman declined to comment specifically on the impact of the changes in the listing rules on the U.S. IPOs of small Chinese companies. 
At a time of escalating tensions between the United States and China over trade and technology, Nasdaq's curbs on small Chinese IPOs represent the latest flashpoint in the financial relationship between the world's two largest economies.
U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies fell sharply on Friday following reports that the White House was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. A U.S. Treasury official said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was not considering blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges ""at this time"".
A source close to Nasdaq said the changes to its listing rules were not the result of discussions with the White House. A White House spokesman declined to comment on Nasdaq's listing rule changes.
In June, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill, which has yet to be adopted, that would force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits, or face delisting. 
Nasdaq first proposed changing the listing rules in October 2018, and the changes took effect last month.
""Nasdaq's concern about low liquidity and high volatility in the marketplace brought about by such Chinese IPOs has become very obvious since mid-2018,"" said Ralph De Martino, chair of U.S. law firm Schiff Hardin LLP's Asia practice, which advises Chinese companies on their IPOs. 
STRICTER RULES
Nasdaq's new listing rules have raised the average trading volume requirements for a stock, and call for at least 50% of a company's shareholders to invest a minimum of $2,500 each in an IPO.
Nasdaq also said in June that it may delay the U.S. listing of a company that does not demonstrate a strong enough nexus to the U.S. capital markets, including having no shareholders, operations, management or board members with links to the United States.
Small Chinese firms pursue these IPOs because they allow their founders and backers to cash out, rewarding them with U.S. dollars they cannot easily access because of China's capital controls. The companies also use their Nasdaq-listed status to convince lenders in China to fund them and often get subsidies from Chinese local authorities for becoming publicly traded.
Unlike Nasdaq, the Chinese stock market has strict listing criteria that prevent some loss-making companies from going public. The geographically adjacent Hong Kong stock exchange is also viewed by IPO hopefuls as more strict compared to Nasdaq. 
Chinese companies have raised over 70 billion in the U.S. stock market since 2000, according to Refinitiv data. While the biggest ones, such as e-commerce giants  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), Pingduoduo Inc (O:PDD) and JD.com Inc (O:JD), have attracted major U.S. stock market investors, many small ones have proved unpopular.
This is largely due to their poor track record. Shares of Chinese IPOs that raised $200 million or less have traded down 38% on average since their IPO through July 31 in the last 18 months, compared to a rise of 13.9% for U.S. companies of the same size, according to Dealogic data.
Some 19 Chinese companies went public on the Nasdaq in 2018, up from 8 in 2017, based on submissions by investment banks underwriting them to Dealogic.
IPOS HELD UP
Following the listing rule changes, small Chinese IPOs have experienced longer waiting times and scrutiny from Nasdaq before they are allowed to proceed with their IPOs, according to corporate and investment banking sources. 
For example, Xuezhu Wang, CEO of Happiness Biotech Group Ltd (O:HAPP), a Chinese company that manufactures and sells nutraceuticals, told Reuters he promised Nasdaq to secure at least 30% of the IPO proceeds from U.S. investors, in order to be allowed to list.
As most of the small Chinese companies pursuing U.S. IPOs have no U.S. business presence or brand recognition, hiring U.S. citizens as board members is now being adopted as a tactic to get listings approved, Chinese executives and investment bankers say.
China Xiangtai Food Co (O:PLIN), a pork processing company based in Chongqing City in southwest China, had to add two U.S. citizens to its board of directors to be allowed by Nasdaq to complete its IPO in August 2019, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Xiangtai did not respond to a request for comments. 
The New York Stock Exchange, the other major U.S. stock exchange, operated by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), is looking closely at Chinese listings, according to a source familiar with the matter. However, it has yet to introduce rule changes similar to Nasdaq. 

""The New York Stock Exchange has a longstanding commitment to good governance, rigorously adhering to both the letter and spirit of our listing standards,"" a New York Stock Exchange spokesman said.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2019 10:32AM ET</span>",Record U.S. tariff award over Airbus aid could fuel trade tensions,"By Philip Blenkinsop and Tim Hepher
BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - Transatlantic trade ties face renewed disruption this week when global arbiters are expected to grant the United States a record award allowing it to hit European imports with billions of dollars of tariffs in a long-running aircraft subsidy dispute.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has found that both European planemaker Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. 
Both sides have threatened tariffs after the Geneva body found neither adhered fully to its findings. However, the United States has a head start, with the European Union having to wait until early in 2020 to hear what level of retaliation it can exact over Boeing.
The WTO is expected this week to reveal the amount of EU goods the United States can target. People familiar with the case say the three-person tribunal is expected to award it around $7.5 billion, a record for the 24-year-old watchdog.
Such retaliation rights are rarely granted by the WTO - most parties reach settlements - and in many cases complainants do not exercise their rights. The United States though has indicated it will target EU goods to the fullest extent.
It has already published a $25 billion list from which it will pick items to target from aircraft and aerospace parts to wine, cheese and luxury goods.
The WTO award in the world's largest corporate trade dispute could fuel already strained trade tensions, diplomats say.
EU manufacturers are already facing U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to penalize EU cars and car parts. The EU has in turn retaliated.
Trade talks between the two, designed to ease tensions and ward off the threat of a tit-for-tat tariff war, have not gone well. The two sides have made some progress on regulatory cooperation, but a proposed deal to reduce duties is stuck, with Washington saying agriculture should be included and Brussels insisting it cannot.
The Trump administration has concluded that tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade, and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to U.S. products. Washington is unlikely to skip the opportunity to implement tariffs in the case over aircraft subsidies, according to current and former U.S. officials.
Airbus has said this would lead to a 'lose-lose' trade war.
Some U.S. airlines have urged the administration not to go ahead with the tariffs, saying they could lead to layoffs.
NO SETTLEMENT IN SIGHT
The parties could still theoretically resolve the issue and stave off sanctions, but both sides accuse the other of failing to respond to invitations to reach a negotiated settlement.
U.S. officials say the decision about next steps will be up to U.S. President Trump.
The EU cannot retaliate immediately to any tariffs as it did following the U.S. imposition of metal tariffs in 2018.
It can either wait until a pronouncement in the parallel Boeing case or possibly revive an existing right to hit $4 billion of U.S. imports in a WTO dispute over U.S. tax breaks for exports, even though the two sides settled in 2006. Such a move would likely be strongly contested by Washington.
EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom has urged Washington to hold off sanctions and seek an overall deal on aircraft support, but Washington has shown no sign it wants to talk.
A U.S. government official said Washington has been willing since the very beginning to negotiate a solution, but that the EU gave more support to Airbus rather than fixing the problem.

EU-U.S. trade relations are likely to be a major focus in Brussels during a parliamentary hearing of the next trade commissioner, Irishman Phil Hogan, on Monday, and of national trade ministers meeting on Tuesday.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2019 10:16AM ET</span>",Vape product concerns weigh on Canadian cannabis companies looking for sales boost,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - A U.S. recommendation that consumers avoid vaping products containing the active ingredient in marijuana ahead of their legalization in Canada next month could be a blow to Canadian cannabis companies' hopes that the higher-margin products will help propel them to profitability.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday that an investigation into 805 confirmed or probable cases of vaping-related respiratory illnesses suggested that products containing THC, the psychoactive element in cannabis, likely played a role.
The heightened health concerns come at a time when Canadian cannabis companies, whose share prices have tumbled over disappointing sales and supply and quality hiccups, are investing millions of dollars into marijuana derivatives, including vape products.
While keeping a wary eye on U.S. developments, they are betting that already strict Canadian regulations will ensure the safety of their products.
The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF has dropped 54% since its Oct. 16 peak, the day before adult recreational use of cannabis flower and THC and CBD oils were legalized. CBD does not contain the compound that gets people high.
The vaping concerns have contributed to recent declines, and will continue to hurt shares, said Bruce Campbell, portfolio manager at Stonecastle Investment Management, which invests in cannabis stocks.
""It's a case of 'shoot first, ask questions later',"" he said. ""(Investors) probably do some quick back-of-the-envelope math and say, 'we're not going to see the sales we expected, so we're out'.""
Analysts estimate that in some established U.S. markets, vape sales are down as much as 30%, with many marijuana consumers reverting to use of less profitable flower and oil products.  
While a shift away from Canada's illicit cannabis vape market into legal dried flower is positive from a public health standpoint, prolonged uncertainty could hurt legal vape sales. 
""These illnesses ... occurred using non-regulated products,"" said Jason Zandberg, research analyst at investment dealer PI Financial.
Investigators have pointed to vaping products containing THC or vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent often mixed with THC oil in the illicit market, as possible causes of the rash of serious lung problems.
""In theory, it should promote the legal market,"" Zandberg said. ""But if you don't have very aggressive education behind these products, a good portion of the population doesn’t see the difference.""
The regulations that take effect on Oct. 17 take into account the emerging health risks associated with cannabis vaping. They prohibit additives including vitamins and coloring agents, Health Canada, which regulates cannabis producers, said in an email.
The health agency added that it is monitoring the situation, and will take additional action if needed.
""The Canadian government should come out as soon as possible one way or other and either double down on vape products or remove them from the derivatives market. You have to give the industry clarity,"" said Brett Hundley, a cannabis analyst at Seaport Global.
If the government suddenly removes vape products from the roster of expanded legal cannabis offerings, including edibles and extracts, ""that’s going to reverberate back through the supply chain and it’s going to lead to a whole host of near-term issues"" for these companies, Hundley said.
Cannabis companies are trusting that adhering to Health Canada's rules will provide reassurance for investors and consumers.
A spokesman for Canopy Growth Corp, Canada's biggest cannabis producer, in an email, pointed to the importance of the regulatory frameworks for cannabis vape products that Canada has in place.
Hexo Corp, another Canadian company with a variety of cannabis products, said it is focused on ensuring it is compliant with Health Canada's regulations. Hexo is double testing its vape products, James McMillan, vice president of business development, said in a phone interview."

The engineers who created the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) flight-control system more than a decade ago for the military refueling plane designed the system to rely on inputs from multiple sensors and with limited power to move aircraft's nose, the Journal said https://on.wsj.com/2mOypqT.
The newspaper cited one person familiar with the design saying this approach was taken in order to guard against the system acting erroneously or causing a pilot to lose control.
In contrast, the version of MCAS on the 737 MAX passenger plane relied on input from just one of two sensors which measure the angle at which the plane's nose is flying, the newspaper said.
Boeing's expected software fix for its 737 MAX planes will make its MCAS more like the one used on the tanker jet, the Journal said.
Boeing did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment outside regular business hours.
Boeing has previously said that erroneous sensor data fed to the MCAS system was a common link in a chain of events leading to the fatal crashes of a Lion Air 737 MAX airliner in Indonesia in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX in March 2019 which killed all 346 people aboard the two aircraft."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's energy minister on Sunday welcomed a decision by U.S. energy company  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) to continue negotiations rather than seek arbitration to resolve a dispute over who should pay for removing offshore oil and gas platforms.
Thailand wants Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs, estimated by a local newspaper at around $2.5 billion, for infrastructure at the Erawan gas field, which it is due to hand over to Thai state oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl in April 2022 when its concessions expire.
Reuters first reported last week that the U.S. company had ""temporarily suspended"" a plan to seek arbitration in order to allow more time for talks with Thailand's energy ministry, but that arbitration was still a possibility ""within weeks"" if talks do not succeed.
Thailand's energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong said on Sunday the Chevron's decision was a good sign that the two parties could work together to resolve the dispute and ensure a smooth handover of the gas field.
""Chevron's decision to hold off the arbitration process to continue negotiations is welcomed,"" energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong said.
""I also believe that we will arrive at the best agreements while prioritizing Thailand's interests,"" he added.
The dispute arose in 2016 when Thailand retroactively enforced a new energy ministry regulation requiring gas field operators to pay the costs of decommissioning all assets they have installed even if they no longer operate them.
Chevron argues that under the terms of its initial contracts from 1971 it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer deemed usable before it hands over the field to another operator.
The new law would require Chevron to pay the future costs of decommissioning all the infrastructure it has installed at the Erawan field, including still usable assets it will transfer to PTTEP free of charge.
The dispute has implications for other international energy companies such as France's Total and Japan's Mitsui & Co, which also have stakes in offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand.
Outside of the oil and gas industry, other foreign investors in Thailand were also concerned about the retroactive use of laws, and what precedent the case might set for the sanctity of their contracts."
1129,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>","Citing climate risk, investors bet against mortgage market","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - David Burt helped two of the protagonists of Michael Lewis' book The Big Short bet against the U.S. mortgage market in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Now he's betting against the market again, but this time, the risk is not from underwater subprime mortgages, it's from homes sinking under water.
As he did then, Burt has given up his full-time job to make that bet. He left his role as a portfolio manager at the $1 trillion Wellington Management last year to start an investment firm, DeltaTerra Capital, which aims to help clients manage climate risk, and, where possible, take advantage of ways the market has not yet priced in that risk. His first investment strategy is targeting residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, with exposure to climate hot spots like Texas and Florida.
In doing so, Burt is joining the ranks of a small number of investors who have become worried that climate risk is underpriced in these securities, which are pools of home loans sold to investors.
""The market's failure to integrate climate science with investment analysis has created a mispricing phenomenon that is possibly larger than the mortgage credit bubble of the mid-2000s,"" Burt wrote in a presentation to prospective clients.
Most mainstream investors remain skeptical of the impact of climate change on their portfolios or argue that they are diversified enough not to have to worry about the risks.
Burt and at least three other investors said in interviews with Reuters that they think the risk is real. They argue that a growing body of academic research and data shows that hurricanes, flooding and other disasters pose a far larger threat than is currently being priced into mortgage securities.
""I don't think you need any new climate effects to come to draw these conclusions. The ones I see happening right now, I just need to get a little unlucky with them and I'm in trouble,"" said Thomas Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory. Graff abandoned a riskier type of RMBS after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in 2017.
FLOOD MAPS
Climate researchers and investors say a key culprit for the mispriced risk in the U.S. mortgage market is outdated flood maps drawn by the federal government.
These maps determine the premiums on government-sponsored home insurance policies. Due to budget cuts, more than three-quarters of the maps have not been updated in at least five years, according to First Street Foundation, an organization that is developing a publicly accessible database of up-to-date flood risk information.
Outdated maps mean far fewer people are required to have flood insurance than are at risk, the investors and researchers say. A University of Bristol estimate put the actual figure at around three times the 13 million Americans currently living in designated flood zones.
The gaps are evident: About 70% of all damages to homes that were flooded during Harvey were not covered by insurance, according to CoreLogic.
The federal government provides most flood insurance in the United States and the gaps mean the risk is not properly priced. The cost for an average policy in low-risk Green Bay, Wisconsin, for example, is three times that in Gulfport, Mississippi, a town devastated by Hurricane Katrina, according to Burt.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it aims to fix some of these problems with a major risk re-rating on Oct. 1, 2020.
Burt’s bet is that the move will result in significant cost increases. That in turn will lead to home price declines and mortgage losses, which would increase volatility in RMBS prices.
He expects a correction beginning in the next 6-18 months.
""The bet I'm making is that many regional markets will experience large price declines in response to increasing costs related to the geography-specific risks,"" Burt said.
CLIMATE LOSSES
There are many risks to Burt’s thesis. In the past few years, RMBS prices have recovered after disasters such as Harvey. The federal government has stepped in with aid when losses were not covered by flood insurance.
David Goodson, head of securitized fixed income and senior portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management, said he does not dismiss RMBS deals that have significant concentration in flood hot spots like Miami or Houston.
""While there are more vulnerable population centers that are at greater risk, I think it would be imprudent to out-of-hand dismiss deals that have a concentration in a particular"" area, he said.
Burt thinks the mainstream view will be proven wrong. Some of the conditions that allowed prices to recover after Harvey, such as redevelopers bailing out homeowners, could disappear if there is an economic downturn.
Investors also have been taking on more risk. Some RMBS issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae since 2017, called credit risk transfer (CRT) deals, move the risk of default to the investors. In traditional agency RMBS, Fannie and Freddie cover those losses.
Between 2% and 4% of the loans in outstanding CRT deals were located in Houston and other areas badly hit by Hurricane Harvey, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). While prices of these securities recovered, investors in lower tranches of the capital structure in some deals took losses they did not recover.
This is because the most junior tranches have little or no protection. The lowest tranche of the most recent Freddie Mac CRT will start losing principal if mortgage pool losses exceed 0.1%.
""It has been building up,"" Burt said, ""and so when the correction comes, it will probably come in a more meaningful way than people are expecting."""

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2019 02:24AM ET</span>",Hong Kong's sky-high property prices prove resilient in face of protests,"By Clare Jim and Felix Tam
HONG KONG (Reuters) - While months of Hong Kong protests have scared away tourists, sent jitters across the financial center and cast a dark cloud over the local economy, there's one thing residents of the city are confident they can bank on - sky-high property prices.
Home prices in the former British colony have rocketed over 200% in the past decade, driven by limited housing supply and large capital flows from mainland Chinese buyers, angering many residents who can't afford to get on the property ladder.
And despite the worst protests since Hong Kong reverted to China rule, property prices have hardly budged.
Lily Chow, a 32-year-old clerk, is among the lucky ones. She and her husband recently snapped up a two-bedroom apartment off the plans for HK$7.5 million ($957,000) in the New Territories. 
""I am not confident in the government, outlook or economy. I am only confident that Hong Kong property prices will not drop,"" Chow told Reuters in the sales office of the development.
Property firm  Wheelock  (HK:0020) has sold 80% of the 816 flats in its projects since late August, lower than sales at other launches this year, but ""still good"" given the current environment, property agents said.
As Hong Kong gears up for yet another anti-government protest on Oct. 1 - the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China - there was scant sign the prospect of further violence had dampened homebuyer demand. 
Hundreds of prospective buyers queued on Thursday in a sales office in the gleaming International Commerce Centre (ICC) skyscraper for a development near Mong Kok district, the site of some of the most violent protests in recent months. 
""The political environment is shakeable, but I am pretty sure the property market is unshakeable,"" said office assistant Candy Lau, 32, as she queued for an HK$8 million, 273 sq ft, one-room apartment in the development by Sun Hung Kai Properties (HK:0016), Hong Kong's largest developer by market value.
A week earlier, Sun Hung Kai launched its first batch of 352 flats in the same development in Kowloon district, selling all but one to underscore the strong demand. 
""HOUSE LIKE A CELL""
A traditional belief in bricks and mortar investment and a history of strong returns from property has helped Hong Kong home buyers keep the faith.
Official data showed Hong Kong property prices rose close to 10% in the first seven months of the year, including a tiny 0.1% decline in July after the mass protests intensified in mid-June. 
One reason for the smaller-than-expected drop was low transaction volumes during July, caused by a mismatch of price expectations between sellers and buyers.
But with signs last month that sellers were more willing to reduce their initial asking prices, volumes have stabilized, according to realtors.
""There's still much real demand, and when sellers became more willing to cut prices by 10-20%, some buyers chose to enter the market,"" said Derek Chan, realtor Ricacorp's head of research. He estimates a 5% rise in prices for the full year, down from an earlier forecast of 10%. 
August house price data is due on Monday and agents are expecting a bigger fall than July.
Two other buyers told Reuters they expect home prices will climb in the long run, despite any short-term softness, because a fundamental supply shortage simply won't go away.
Every day, Hong Kong grants 150 residential permits to mainland Chinese, according to the government, adding to a population of 7.4 million crammed into just 1,100 sq km (425 square miles), of which 40 percent is country parks or nature reserves. 
Tiny living spaces have become increasingly common in the world's most expensive property market where some of the city's poorest people live in cage homes - wire mesh hutches stacked on top of each other. 
Long-standing frustrations over unaffordable housing have spilled onto the streets during recent protests, which started over a now-suspended extradition bill and have evolved into calls for greater democracy, among other demands. 
""7K for a house like a cell and you really think we out here scared of jail,"" reads graffiti scrawled near one protest site. HK$7,000 ($893) is what the monthly rent for a tiny room in a shared apartment could cost in Hong Kong, which reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Making housing more affordable has been among every post-colonial Hong Kong leaders' top priorities, but each administration has been unable to rein in skyrocketing prices that have fueled discontent in the city.
OPTING TO RENT
Sun Hung Kai Properties deputy managing director Victor Lui told an earnings conference this month that even though the company's schedule for new launches was slightly delayed due to the protests, the company planned to keep pushing out new home sales in coming months.
He expects property prices to be flat for the full year. 
Agents said the most sought-after properties are small to medium-sized apartments below 600 square feet, while the luxury segment continues to slow due to a drop-off in Chinese buyers and caution over the U.S.-China trade war.
Citi Hong Kong's latest survey showed interest in property ownership in the third quarter - 20% of respondents - was little changed from the preceding quarter, even though more respondents expected prices to fall than rise in the next 12 months. 
Taking a ""wait and see"" approach, around 5% of would-be buyers were now opting to rent, agents said, sending average rents in August 4.5% higher than January. 
Thanks to tighter debt servicing requirements in recent years, most home owners are expected to be able to continue meeting repayments even in the case of a big correction, avoiding systematic pressure, analysts say. 
While JP Morgan predicts a 30% slide in prices in a worst-case scenario, many people remain confident in the market. 

""The protests are only a small incident happening in Hong Kong,"" said Josephine Tsang, a 57-year-old retired teacher, who recently bought an apartment for her 28-year old son. ""If I don't buy now, the price will keep rising.""

""The administration is not contemplating blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges at this time,"" Bloomberg quoted https://bloom.bg/2obHkDb Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley as saying.
Reuters reported on Friday that President Donald Trump's administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges in a move that would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies.

1133,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 28, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. Dangerous Charts for  Disney 

The enthusiasm for Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) as a business has been red hot this year, with its control of the Marvel and Star Wars universes and streaming service Disney+ going live in the U.S. and Canada launching Nov. 12.
That positive feeling has finally been reflected in the company’s shares, which had been trading in range of at most $30 for the last four years, but broke out in April, according to technical analyst Rob Moreno.
But the outlook for Disney shares is bearish on daily and weekly timeframes as the charts indicate a head-and-shoulders pattern, Moreno wrote on Rightview Trading.
“Head-and-shoulders patterns are reliable technical patterns that often appear at significant market tops,” he said.
“The daily head and shoulders pattern is clearly defined and a confirmed break below neckline support projects significant downside (for Disney),” he added.

2. Inflation Expectations Temper Again

U.S. consumers’ inflation expectations hit a new low, according to a recent survey by the New York Federal Reserve released this week.
The Survey of Consumer Expectations for August showed another decline in expectations for a rise in prices.

The median expectations for inflation in a one-year time horizon fell 0.2 percentage points last month to 2.4%, which is a series low for the survey, which goes back to June 2013.
On a three-year time horizon, the median expectation dipped 0.1 percentage point to 2.5%.

“The median one-year ahead expected price change in gas, medical care, a college education, and rent all fell in August,” the New York Fed said. “Notably, the measures for price change in medical care and rent both reached new series’ lows.”

3. Texas Instruments Gets a Vote of Confidence
Semiconductor stocks took a blow this week after Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares sank on concerns about the company’s guidance on gross margins.

And Bank of America Merrill Lynch weighed in on the sector with a mixed outlook.
Merrill upgraded Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) to buy from neutral, while also cutting Maxim Integrated (NASDAQ:MXIM) to underperform from neutral.
“We believe the difference in portfolio and solid track record of (free cash flow) returns positions TXN to outperform MXIM over the next twelve months,” Merrill analyst Vivek Arya said in a note.

He raised the price target on Texas Instruments to $150 from $145 and lowered it on Maxim to $60 from $67."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration late on Friday said it would require operators of some Boeing (N:BA) 737 NG jetliners to conduct inspections for structural cracks and make repairs as needed following the discovery of cracks on a small number of planes.
The FAA said Boeing notified it of the issue ""after it discovered the cracks while conducting modifications on a heavily used aircraft."" Subsequent inspections ""uncovered similar cracks in a small number of additional planes."" Boeing said on Friday it has been in contact with 737 NG operators about a cracking issue, but added that ""no in-service issues have been reported.""
Neither the FAA nor Boeing immediately said how many planes were impacted by the required inspections.
The 737 NG, or Next Generation, was introduced in 1997 and is the third generation version of the best-selling Boeing airplane. The 737 MAX, which was grounded in March after two fatal crashes in five months, is not affected by this issue, Boeing said.
The FAA said it would ask operators of the NG to ""report their findings to the agency immediately"" after completing inspections. Boeing said ""over the coming days, we will work closely with our customers to implement a recommended inspection plan for certain airplanes in the fleet.""

KOMO News reported on Friday the issue involved cracked ""pickle forks"" in some 737 NG jets. The pickle fork attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure and manages forces. A failure of the part in flight could pose a serious risk. KOMO said workers found a severely cracked pickle fork on a Boeing 737NG earlier this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, three sources briefed on the matter said on Friday, in what would be a radical escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions.
The move would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two of the sources said. One said it was motivated by the Trump administration's growing security concerns about the companies' activities. 
Major U.S. stock indexes slipped on the news, which came days before China celebrates the 70th anniversary of the birth of the People's Republic on Oct. 1, when the world's No. 2 economy will shut down for a week of festivities.
Shares of Hangzhou, Zhejiang-based  Alibaba  (N:BABA) ended down 5.15%. JD.com (O:JD) fell 5.95% and Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) declined 3.67%. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (P:FXI) shed 1.15%. 
Shares of New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE) ended down 1.88% and shares of Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) declined 1.70%.
It was not immediately clear how any delisting would work. 
In June, U.S. lawmakers from both parties introduced a bill to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits, or face delisting.
Chinese authorities have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms - including member firms of the Big Four international accounting networks - citing national security concerns.
""Beijing should no longer be allowed to shield U.S.-listed Chinese companies from complying with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability,"" Republican Senator Marco Rubio said at the time.
One of the sources briefed on the matter said the idea of delisting was the latest salvo in this longstanding dispute.
""This is a very high priority for the administration. Chinese companies not complying with the PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) process poses risks to U.S. investors,"" the source said.
Any plan is subject to approval by Trump, who has given the green light to the discussion, Bloomberg reported https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-27/us-china-trade-war-latest-us-weighs-limits-on-portfolio-inflows, citing a person close to the deliberations.
Officials are also examining how the United States could put limits on Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms, the agency cited three sources as saying.
No decision or action is imminent, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters. 
As of February, 156 Chinese companies were listed on the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchanges, according to U.S. government data, including at least 11 state-owned firms. (https:// NYSE declined to comment on Friday, while Nasdaq, MSCI, S&P and FTSE Russell did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China's yuan currency, traded in offshore markets , fell against the dollar after the news to trade near its weakest against the greenback in about three weeks.  PLOY? Trade talks between the United States and China are expected to be held Oct. 10-11 after months of tit-for-tat moves by both sides which have weakened global growth and driven rollercoaster moves in markets. While the idea of delisting could be a maneuver ahead of those talks, the main aim was to counteract the civilian-military fusion of Chinese technology firms, the Made in China 2025 industrial development program targeting key industries for domination and a growing surveillance state in Xinjiang, one of the sources said. The source said there are longstanding concerns about U.S. capital enabling these activities, especially as the lines blur between state-owned and private companies in China. ""It's all very disruptive, it just adds to uncertainty and it's a big negative for business investment,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at investment bank Raymond James. He noted, however, that both sides have used aggressive moves in the past ahead of talks.  ""You never know if it's a ploy to get some leverage,"" he said. Trump on Tuesday criticized Beijing's trade practices in a speech at the United Nations, but the next day stoked hopes that the nearly 15-month standoff could be nearing an end.  ""They want to make a deal very badly ... It could happen sooner than you think,"" he told reporters in New York on Wednesday. China says it cannot allow its companies to submit to oversight by PCOAB because of rules prohibiting the storage, processing or transfer of any material considered to be state secrets or national security matters. U.S. hedge fund manager Kyle Bass, a prominent critic of China, said on Friday that Chinese companies should have to play by U.S. rules if they want to sell to U.S. investors.  
""The U.S. should require any securities sold in the US to adhere to US Securities Laws. Crazy huh?"" Bass wrote on Twitter.

The company committed a series of violations of the National Labor Relations Act in 2017 and 2018, Amita Baman Tracy, a California administrative law judge ruled in a court filing.
Among the violations of the law cited in the filing was a tweet sent by Musk in May 2018.
""Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare"", Musk wrote in the tweet from last year.
The tweet amounted to ""threatening employees"" with loss of stock options if they vote in favor of the union, the judge said in her ruling on Friday. 
The ruling has called on the electric carmaker to hold a meeting at its California assembly plant where either Musk or his agent must inform the workers that the National Labor Relations Board has concluded that Tesla broke the law. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Friday's ruling. 

In the past, the company has been plagued by safety complaints brought by workers, allegations that Tesla denies. Workers have said that long hours and pressure to deliver vehicles quickly takes a toll, and some have pushed for a union.

(Reuters) - Hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co is building a stake in Emerson Electric Co (N:EMR) and is planning to push for changes, including a potential split-up of the U.S. industrial conglomerate, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Emerson, which pursued an unsuccessful $29 billion acquisition bid for peer Rockwell Automation Inc (N:ROK) two years ago, has long been seen as a potential break-up candidate among investors and analysts. Its automation solutions business serves mostly industrial clients, while its remaining divisions cater primarily to commercial and residential markets. 
D.E. Shaw is in the process of building a position in Emerson as it prepares to pressure the company to pursue a split and other changes, the sources said.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. D.E. Shaw and Emerson declined to comment.
Emerson shares ended trading up 3.4% to $64.40 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of $41 billion.
Emerson, a diversified manufacturer with $17.4 billion in sales last year, provides dozens of industries with thousands of products, from tools and large industrial valves to refrigeration, lighting and climate control systems. 
Emerson's strength is in process automation, helping power plants and factories in sectors such as mining and cement operate more efficiently. Its commercial and residential solutions businesses supplies products such as air conditioners and refrigeration systems. David Farr has served as the company's CEO since 2000.
Were Emerson to agree to break up, it would be the latest industrial conglomerate to do so under pressure from an activist shareholder.  General Electric  Co (N:GE) has shed many of its divisions following pressure from Trian Fund Management LP, while ThyssenKrupp AG (DE:TKAG) agreed to split into two separate companies after being targeted by Elliott Management Corp.

D.E. Shaw has become more active as an activist shareholder in recent years, pursuing changes at companies such as oil and gas explorer EQT Corp (N:EQT) and grains trader  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG). Quentin Koffey, who joined D.E. Shaw & Co two years ago from Elliott to lead its shareholder activism strategy, left in May to join Senator Investment Group LP.

HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jefferies Financial Group has laid off 15 people in its energy investment banking team, as the bank reacts to a slowdown of mergers and acquisitions activity among oil and gas companies, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The job cuts were concentrated within the group that focuses on sales of acreage and smaller assets, known in the industry as the Acquisitions and Divestitures (A&D) team, and were predominantly junior staff helping with technical roles, according to three of the sources.
Jefferies declined to comment. The sources all spoke on condition of anonymity as the information isn't public.
Dealflow involving oil and gas exploration and production companies has slumped this year to its lowest level in a decade, excluding the large acquisition by Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
The slowdown comes as shareholders, unhappy with years of substandard returns from their investments in oil and gas, have pushed companies to eschew growth and focus on developing existing positions, and cost cutting - all aimed at boosting the amount of cash given back to investors.
This has left investment bankers tasked with advising on such transactions without sufficient work.
Jefferies has one of the largest energy investment banking teams in the United States, meaning the layoffs reflected a small percentage of its overall energy investment banking team, according to one of the sources.
The bank ranks second and third in league tables for oil and gas M&A transactions by volume and value, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.
Earlier this month,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co laid off 13 people, or 7% of its energy investment bank in Houston - a story first reported by Bloomberg News."

AbbVie and Allergan said they still expect the deal to close in early 2020, and were cooperating with the antitrust regulator.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Companies making their debut on the U.S. stock market are getting a rough welcome, especially if they are losing money, casting a shadow over the calendar for initial public offerings for the rest of the year. 
The surprise postponement of the WeWork IPO has underscored how confidence is eroding in the market both for companies looking to raise capital and investors.
A more discerning market for initial public offerings continued to punish  Peloton Interactive Inc  (O:PTON) on Friday, a day after it began trading. Shares of the fitness startup closed down 2% at $25.24 and are now off 13% from their IPO price. The company is now trading 15% below its Wednesday IPO price.
Before trading began on Friday, five of this year's eight deals of $1 billion or more were trading below their IPO price, according to research firm Dealogic. On a broader scale, only about 27% of the 112 deals of $100 million or more were trading below their IPO price.
Venture capital firms and other backers of many of these high profile ""unicorns"" - companies valued at $1 billion or more in the private market - had a higher tolerance for the path to profitability, but eventually they wanted to monetize their stakes. 
INVESTORS GET MORE SELECTIVE
In the past, public market investors have typically expected companies to become profitable within 18 months or so of an IPO. This timeline has been relaxed with money managers eager to add businesses with fast-growing revenue to their portfolios.
Recent deals, however, suggest an uncertain economic outlook is pushing investors to be more selective about which loss-making companies they are willing to back.
Peloton reported rapid top-line growth of 110% during the fiscal year that ended June 30. But the company also showed negative operating leverage, with operating expenses surging 147% over the prior year.
Loss-making teeth-alignment company SmileDirectClub (O:SDC) this month became the first U.S. IPO in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first trading day, according to research firm Renaissance Capital.
BEYOND MEAT, PINTEREST SURGE
SmileDirectClub is the worst performer among $1 billion-plus IPO deals, with its stock down 43% since its debut earlier this month, according to Dealogic.
The best performer in that group is social media company  Pinterest Inc  (N:PINS), whose shares are up 39% since their April debut. Revenue at Pinterest surged 58% to $463.2 million in the first half of 2019. Net cash used in operations during that period narrowed to $16 million from a year-ago $29 million, according to Pinterest's financial statements.
Shares of  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND), which came to market in May in a small $277 million deal, have surged more than 500% since the IPO. The company's operating expenses more than doubled during the first half of the year, but that was outpaced by top-line growth that more than tripled. 
AVERAGE IPO RETURN DROPS
Meanwhile, the average IPO return in 2019 was now about 6% at the end of trading Friday, down from more than 30% at the end of June and more than 18% about two weeks ago.
In the United States, much of the attention in the third quarter has focused on a deal that failed to come to fruition - the planned IPO of WeWork parent We Company.
The company had aimed to launch its IPO earlier in September, then postponed plans to list until later in 2019, before replacing its chief executive officer and saying it was reviewing its timetable to go public.
Endeavor Group Holdings (N:EDR), an entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel with a track record of losses, made a last-minute decision to abandon its IPO due to the tough market conditions. 
Home rental giant Airbnb has said it plans to list its shares in 2020 but provided no details and is widely expected to do a direct listing to go public. In a direct listing no new shares are created and investors can sell their stakes while saving millions of dollars in underwriting fees. 
This month the company said it raked in more than $1 billion in second-quarter revenue. It has not given details on whether it was profitable.
Taking a lesson from the struggles earlier in 2019 of ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable, investors have started to push back on companies with a history of steep losses.
""It will be a dialogue among bankers and boards and senior management teams where they say, 'these were isolated and not comparable,' or say 'we have a sentiment shift and we need to be more conservative and use a different strategy,'"" said David Ethridge, U.S. IPO services leader at audit firm PwC.
WEWORK JUNK BOND DIVES
While WeWork's stock never made it to the market, it did float a $669 million junk bond in May 2018, and that plunged to near a record-low price on Friday. 
The 7.875% note due in May 2025 <96208LAA9=> fell 4 cents on the dollar to 87 cents, just 1.5 cents from its record low of 85.5 cents in early January. 
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, shot above 11%. The spread of its yield over U.S. Treasury debt, a measure of the added compensation demanded by investors to hold the risky paper relative to safer government securities, mushroomed to nearly 9.50 percentage points, the widest ever. 

A month ago, the bond had rallied to a record high price of 105 on We Co's preparations for the IPO. As the deal fell apart in recent weeks, the bond has slid on concerns about the company's lack of access to fresh funding.

1143,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P 500 Ends Lower as White House China Plan Spooks Market,"Investing.com - Stocks finished down Friday -- but well off their lows -- after a Bloomberg News report said the Trump Administration was considering ways to limit Chinese access to U.S. capital markets.
The S&P 500 ended off 0.53%. The Dow Jones industrials  finished down 0.26%, and the Nasdaq Composite ended down 1.13%. The Nasdaq 100 index dropped 1.16%.
Among ideas being discussed, according to Bloomberg, were delisting Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges and limiting investments by, say, pension funds into Chinese companies.
The report gutted a rally at the open that saw the Dow industrials up as many as 122 points early in the session. At their low, the blue chips were off as many as 175 points before late buying kicked in.
The losses ensured stocks ended lower for a second-straight week with just one trading day left in September. 
The S&P 500 was off 1% on the week, with the Dow down 0.4% and the Nasdaq off 2.2%. 
As of Friday, the S&P 500 was up 1.2% for the month, with the Dow up 1.58%. The Nasdaq is down 0.3%.
The year is still quite strong with the S&P still up 18.2%, the Dow up almost 15% and the Nasdaq up 19.7%.
 
 
The selling hit tech stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), down on gross margin guidance, as well as communications services stocks like Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
That said, the stall that's taken over the stock market is still in place. The S&P's close of 2,962 was its sixth-straight below 3,000. The Nasdaq finished under 8,000 for the second time in four sessions. The S&P 500 is now 2.19% below its July all-time high. The Dow is off 2.1% below its peak, with the Nasdaq now 4.8% down. 
The stall is primarily due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade battle, even as negotiators are supposed to meet starting Oct. 10. The Trump impeachment inquiry, begun this week, is adding to the malaise. In addition, consumer spending slowed more than expected in August, suggesting the global economic slowdown is hitting the United States. 
Health care stocks seemed to hold their own Friday. But the week was rocky in part because of Wall Street fears that Sen. Elizabeth Warren could be the Democratic candidate for president next year. She has been is a fierce critic of big pharmaceuticals companies and private health insurers.
The poster child of the worry is Dow component UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), up most of the day until the selling frenzy started. It ended down slightly on the day. It fell 7.6% on the week and is down 8% for the month and 13.6% for the year. 
Financial stocks were higher led by   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC), up 3.8% after naming Charles Scharf CEO, ending a six-month search. Scharf has been CEO of Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK). Wells Fargo has struggled to resolve a host of operational scandals that hurt small customers especially. 
Also higher were retailers, including   Dillards   (NYSE:DDS), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and   Best Buy   (NYSE:BBY) and Macy’s (NYSE:M).
Oil prices moved lower because of trade jitters and the tensions over the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump. WTI  crude fell 50 cents to $55.91 a barrel. Brent crude was off 83 cents to $61.19. 
Gold also fell $8.80 to $1,506.40 an ounce in New York.
Interest rates started higher as stocks rallied at the open, but fell back as investors sought safety in bonds. The 10-Year Treasury yield, once up to 1.725%, fell back to 1.684%, a slight decline on the day."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday after reports that the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, raising worries about a further escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.
The move would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, sources told Reuters.
High-level trade talks between Washington and Beijing are scheduled for Oct. 10-11, before the start of the U.S. third-quarter earnings season.
""If our policies spark a major sell-off in Shanghai where that creates problems for China, that could negatively impact the trade negotiations, which are supposed to start on Oct. 10. That is where the U.S.-based fear would come from,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
The tariff-sensitive Philadelphia semiconductor index (SOX) extended its decline after the reports and ended down 2.4% on the day. The index was already under pressure from Micron Technology Inc's (O:MU), which tumbled after it forecast a disappointing first-quarter profit.
The S&P technology index (SPLRCT) dropped 1.3%. U.S.-listed shares of  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) and JD.com Inc (O:JD) all slid. 
Adding to the negative momentum in afternoon trade, the S&P 500 index briefly fell below its 50-day moving average.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 70.87 points, or 0.26%, to 26,820.25, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 15.83 points, or 0.53%, to 2,961.79 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 91.03 points, or 1.13%, to 7,939.63.
All three indexes ended lower for the week as well, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq registering their biggest weekly percentage drops since August. The Cboe volatility index (VIX) ended at a three-week high. 
Shares of  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) rose 3.8% and the stock was the top gainer in the S&P 500 after the lender named banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer.
Data early in the day showed U.S. consumer spending barely rose in August, suggesting that the economy's main growth engine was slowing after accelerating sharply in the second quarter.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.94-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 118 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.68 billion shares, compared to the 7.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>","Climate movement now 'too loud to handle' for Trump and critics, Greta Thunberg says","By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Teenage activist Greta Thunberg hit back at critics including U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday before she marched in a climate strike in Montreal, saying their mockery of children shows her message has become ""too loud to handle"".
The 16-year-old Swede spoke shortly before the march began alongside aboriginal Canadians, who she invited to lead the march with her because ""they are often the ones who are at the front line"" of global warming.
Trump mocked Thunberg this week and Canadian Member of Parliament Maxime Bernier called her alarmist and mentally unstable.
""I guess they must feel like their world view or their interests or whatever... is threatened by us. We've become too loud for people to handle so they try to silence us,"" she told reporters. ""We should also take that as a compliment.""
On Friday, the climate strikes she inspired started in Asia and continued in Europe. Tens of thousands of students kicked things off in New Zealand, and Thunberg tweeted images from marches held in dozens of cities around the world.
""The strikes have been very successful today,"" she said. ""It is very moving to see everyone, everyone who is so passionate.""
Thunberg - who has inspired millions of young people to take to the streets over climate change - denounced world leaders earlier this week for failing to take effective action on the issue.
Matthew McMillan, 22, a mechanical engineering student at Montreal's Concordia University, held a ""Make America Greta Again"" poster as he joined other students at the protest.
""I think it is the most important event of our generation,"" he said.
Holding placards and chanting ""protect the planet"", nine-year-old Xavier Damien Tremblay joined his three younger siblings and mother Maude Richard in the march. ""It's our planet that's at stake,"" he said.
TRUDEAU TELLS THUNBERG CANADA MUST DO MORE
Thunberg's presence in Canada coincides with campaigning ahead of next month's federal election. She met with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau privately for about 15 minutes in his capacity as a leader of the government not the Liberal Party.
Later she was asked what her message to Trudeau had been.
""He is of course obviously not doing enough but... this is such a huge problem,"" she said. ""My message to all the politicians is the same, to just listen to the science, act on the science.""
Trudeau is promising more climate action but has also had to defend his decision to buy and expand a major oil pipeline in western Canada.
""You are the problem! Climate criminal!"" shouted a man who police hauled away from one of Trudeau's campaign stops. As the prime minister joined the Montreal march, police tackled another man who lunged at him to throw eggs.
Video showed Trudeau consoling his son, who appeared to be frightened and was crying after the incident.
Of his meeting with Thunberg, Trudeau said he had a ""wonderful conversation with Greta"" and that they ""talked directly about the need to do more, much more"".
AVIATION LEADERS MEET IN MONTREAL
United Nations aviation leaders are in Montreal on Friday attending a meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which is debating ways to minimize the sector's impact on climate.
Commercial flying accounts for 2.5% of carbon emissions, but passenger numbers are forecast to double by 2037, so experts say emissions will rise if more is not done.
ICAO expressed ""enthusiasm and support"" for the march on Thursday, adding that ""more action and faster innovation are now required to address aviation's near- and long-term impacts""."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, three sources briefed on the matter said on Friday, in what would be a radical escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions.
The move would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two of the sources said. One said it was motivated by the Trump administration's growing security concerns about their activities.
Major U.S. stock indexes slipped on the news, which came days before China celebrates the 70th anniversary of the birth of the People's Republic on Oct. 1, when the world's No. 2 economy will shut down for a week of festivities.
Shares of  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA), JD.com (O:JD), Baidu (O:BIDU), slipped between 4% to 7% in afternoon trading.
It was not immediately clear how any delisting would work.
In June, U.S. lawmakers from both parties introduced a bill to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits, or face delisting.
Chinese authorities have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms - including member firms of the Big Four international accounting networks - citing national security concerns.
""Beijing should no longer be allowed to shield U.S.-listed Chinese companies from complying with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability,"" Republican Senator Marco Rubio said at the time.
A third source said the idea of delisting was the latest salvo in this longstanding dispute.
""This is a very high priority for the administration. Chinese companies not complying with the PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) process poses risks to U.S. investors,"" the source said.
Any plan is subject to approval by Trump, who has given the green light to the discussion, Bloomberg reported, citing a person close to the deliberations.
Officials are also examining how the United States could put limits on Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms, the agency cited three sources as saying.
As of February, 156 Chinese companies were listed on the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchanges, according to U.S. government data, including at least 11 state-owned firms. (https:// NYSE declined to comment on Friday, while Nasdaq, MSCI, S&P and FTSE Russell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
China's yuan currency, traded in offshore markets , fell against the dollar after the news to trade near its weakest against the greenback in about three weeks.
PLOY?
Trade talks between the United States and China are expected to be held Oct. 10-11 after months of tit-for-tat moves by both sides which have weakened global growth and driven rollercoaster moves in markets.
While the idea of delisting could be a maneuver ahead of those talks, the main aim was to counteract the civilian-military fusion of Chinese technology firms, the Made in China 2025 industrial development program targeting key industries for domination and a growing surveillance state in Xinjiang, one of the sources said.
The source said there are longstanding concerns about U.S. capital enabling these activities, especially as the lines blur between state-owned and private companies in China.
""It's all very disruptive, it just adds to uncertainty and it's a big negative for business investment,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at investment bank Raymond James. He noted, however, that both sides have used aggressive moves in the past ahead of talks.
""You never know if it's a ploy to get some leverage,"" he said.
Trump on Tuesday criticized Beijing's trade practices in a speech at the United Nations, but the next day stoked hopes that the nearly 15-month standoff could be nearing an end.
""They want to make a deal very badly... It could happen sooner than you think,"" he told reporters in New York on Wednesday.
China says it cannot allow its companies to submit to oversight by PCOAB because of rules prohibiting the storage, processing or transfer of any material considered to be state secrets or national security matters.
U.S. hedge fund manager Kyle Bass, a prominent critic of China, said on Friday that Chinese companies should have to play by U.S. rules if they want to sell to U.S. investors.
""The U.S. should require any securities sold in the US to adhere to US Securities Laws. Crazy huh?"" Bass wrote on Twitter."

According to the report, which cites people familiar with the internal deliberations, the Trump administration is considering delisting China-based companies from U.S. exchanges.
Investors bemoaned the news, which they said exacerbated a trade war that has roiled equity markets for months. The move also comes at a critical juncture as China is removing limits on foreign investment in its financial markets.
“To say ‘We’re closing the gates, you can’t invest your money outside U.S. borders, it’s just ludicrous,” Jennifer Ellison, principal at San-Francisco based BOS, said by phone. “The market is a little tired of it.”
Among the most notable Chinese companies traded in the U.S.,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding sank as much as 6.8% on above-average volume; it had been little changed Friday prior to the report.
JD.com Inc. lost as much as 5.9%, also turning abruptly lower following the news. Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). fell 1.3% and Huya Inc. was down 6.8%, building on an earlier decline.
Among exchange-traded funds, the Invesco China Technology ETF dropped 1.6%, with losses accelerating midday. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF fell 1.4% while the broader iShares MSCI China ETF was off 1.9%. The KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund lost 2.6%.
The {{28930|FTSE ChChina A50 index futures shed 1.7% during U.S. trading hours.

The three main indexes are set to end a volatile week slightly lower, after conflicting headlines about U.S.-China trade and as U.S. Democrats launched an impeachment investigation on President Donald Trump.

But 2019 has been marked by an unusually large stampede into the $3.8 trillion state and local government debt market because of a motive that’s nearly as old as civilization itself: avoiding taxes.
Municipal-bond mutual funds and exchange traded funds have pulled in about $46.9 billion over the last 38 straight weeks. That’s the biggest cash haul since 2010 and eclipses the $38.1 billion they picked up during the 54-week stretch that ended in 2016, according to Refinitiv’s Lipper US Fund Flows data.
Several factors are helping to feed the demand, including interest-rate cuts that have pushed up the price of outstanding bonds and sent the market to its biggest gain since 2014. But a major reason is the tax overhaul that capped the federal deduction of state and local taxes, which caused some Americans to use their investments as a way to drive down what they owe.
“Munis have become more of a pure investment. It’s a tax vehicle for many,” said Peter Block, head of municipal bond strategy at Ramirez & Co., who described the appetite for tax shelters as “voracious.”
“Clearly it’s taking off as a tax strategy for the advisory community,” Block said.
While the muni market has weakened recently, it’s still delivered returns of about 6.7% this year, and it has fared better than others as prices retreated after August’s big rally. The muni market’s one-month loss of 0.84% compares with the 0.95% loss for Treasuries and the 0.75% loss for corporate bonds, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indexes.
Meanwhile, offerings of new municipal bonds this year haven’t kept pace with demand because the tax overhaul did away with a major refinancing tactic and states and cities remain hesitant to run up debt. But for those who do sell, they can lock in borrowing costs near historical lows.
“You have this limited supply of bonds-- great for you guys to issue debt,” Terry Goode, a senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management, told municipal representatives at a Bond Buyer conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. “And people like me are clamoring for those particular bonds.”"

(Reuters) - People should stop using e-cigarettes, especially those with marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), U.S. public health officials recommended on Friday, as an investigation into illnesses and deaths related to vaping deepens.
E-cigarettes have been marketed as tools to help smokers quit, but rising use among youth in the United States and a spate of severe lung illnesses tied to the devices have triggered a backlash and heightened regulatory scrutiny.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has in the past advised consumers to avoid the devices, but the latest recommendation focused on THC products follows nationwide data that pointed to a large number of cases related to the use of the high-inducing component of marijuana. 
The CDC and state health officials, along with other health agencies, are investigating 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, as of the latest update on Thursday.
According to the research published by CDC on Friday, 514 of the 805 patients knew about substances used in their vaping products, with nearly 77% using THC-containing vapes. 
However, this does not narrow the focus of the investigation as some users have also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, CDC's principal deputy director Anne Schuchat told reporters on Friday. 
The data showed that 56.8% used nicotine in their vapes, while 16% used vapes containing just nicotine in the 30 days preceding their symptoms. 
""We do not know yet what exactly is making people sick, for example, whether particular solvents or adulterants are leading to lung injury, or whether cases stem from a single supplier or multiple ones,"" Schuchat said. 
Separate data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes"". 

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this month found that more than half of lung illness patients extensively interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported having used the ""Dank Vapes"" brand.

(Reuters) -  Barclays  (L:BARC) has agreed to pay about $6.3 million to settle U.S. charges it violated a federal anti-bribery law by hiring family and friends of foreign officials in the Asia-Pacific region to help win or retain investment banking business.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said the civil settlement resolves charges that the British bank's hiring practices in the region, including China, Hong Kong and South Korea, violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Barclays agreed to pay a $1.5 million civil fine, plus $4.8 million of disgorgement and interest. A bank spokesman, Mark Lane, declined to comment.
According to the SEC, Barclays hired 117 people between April 2009 and August 2013 who had been referred by or connected to government officials or non-government clients, and placed them in permanent jobs, its graduate program, its formal internship program or an unofficial ""work experience program.""
The SEC said Barclays lacked internal controls to ensure that its employees were not engaged in bribery with respect to these ""relationship hires."" It also said some Barclays employees falsified records to conceal who was requesting specific hires and the reasons for those requests.
Settlement papers describe several hires, including in Sept. 2011 when a Barclays banker in Hong Kong told colleagues that a senior executive at a private Korean bank would guarantee business ""as a quid pro quo"" if he could find the executive's daughter a job.

The SEC announced the Barclays settlement nearly three years after JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) agreed in November 2016 to pay $264 million to settle U.S. regulatory charges into its hiring practices in China, known as the Sons and Daughters program.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo chooses BNY Mellon's Scharf as third CEO in three years,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) on Friday named banking veteran Charles Scharf its next chief executive officer, ending a six-month search for a new leader to turn around the fortunes of the scandal-plagued bank, sending its shares up more than 4%. Scharf, who joins the fourth-largest U.S. bank effective next month after a 2-year stint leading Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK), will become Wells Fargo's third CEO in as many years.
Former CEOs Tim Sloan and John Stumpf resigned amid sales practices scandals that have plagued the bank since 2016. 
Some analysts said Scharf's departure from Bank of New York Mellon after a relatively short stint would hurt the bank, and its shares fell 4.5%. Bank of New York Mellon named finance head Thomas Gibbons as its CEO on an interim basis. 
At Wells Fargo, Scharf is taking over a bank that is still operating under a regulatory microscope, trying to rebuild its reputation with customers, investors and politicians. He struck an upbeat tone on a call with analysts. 
""The first priority is to make sure we get the regulatory issues behind us,” he said. 
One source familiar with Scharf’s leadership style said he focuses on making operations more efficient rather than bringing a charismatic vision to the organization. Although Scharf, 54, said he had imagined that BNY would be his last job, he has always had aspirations to be a big bank CEO, the source said. 
Prior to joining the custodian bank, Scharf held the top job at  Visa Inc  (N:V), the world's largest payment network. He started his career in 1987 at Commercial Credit Corp, a consumer finance company run by Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weill - executives who went on to lead two of America's biggest banks. 
HEAVY LIFT 
Wall Street analysts cheered the conclusion of the six-month search and applauded the board's pick of a banking veteran who has experience leading a diverse array of businesses. 
Uncertainty about management has been cited as a top concern for analysts since Sloan's departure in March. Wells Fargo's stock edged up 1% during that period while the KBW Bank Index rallied 7%. 
Bank analysts said clearing regulatory hurdles will still be a tough task, as Wells Fargo is currently operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders.
The appointment got a non-objection from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of Wells Fargo's main regulators. ""The appointment of Mr. Scharf removes a major overhang,"" Saul Martinez of UBS wrote in a note to clients. ""We think getting past the heavy lift of the consent order is necessary for Wells to be able to reduce its cost base."" 
KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said he was unsure what to expect from Scharf as Wells' CEO since his tenure at Bank of New York Mellon lasted only for two years. 
""Scharf's first task will be appeasing regulators and making the changes necessary to remove the asset cap currently in place,"" Kleinhanzl said. 
""He moves from a bank with far less retail business than Wells Fargo, so he will face a steep learning curve,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. 
Separately, BNY Mellon said Scharf had forfeited all of his equity and incentive awards, which were unvested as of Thursday. Wells Fargo's board had considered keeping its interim CEO, Allen Parker, on a permanent basis even after saying it would seek an outsider to fill the role, sources had told Reuters in June. Parker will stay with the company to help the transition and as general counsel. 
Wells said Scharf's base salary at the bank would be $2.5 million - nearly the same as Sloan's base pay in 2018. 
Regulatory filings showed Scharf's total compensation for 2018 at BNY was $9.4 million. Sloan's total compensation for the year was $18.4 million. 

Shares of Wells Fargo were up 4.15% at $50.90 in midday trading.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 01:03PM ET</span>",Explainer: The jet subsidy row that threatens transatlantic trade war,"By Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - The United States and European Union are edging closer to a tit-for-tat tariff war over aircraft subsidies as a 15-year-old dispute at the World Trade Organization reaches its climax. 
Here is what's at stake.
What is the dispute about? 
The United States and EU accuse each other of paying billions of dollars in subsidies to Boeing (N:BA) and European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) in a pair of cases dating back to 2004. It's the largest dispute tackled by the Geneva-based WTO, which has backed some of the claims and rejected others.
The disputed subsidies include cheap government loans to Airbus from Britain, France, Germany and Spain and Washington State tax credits supporting Boeing. Planes affected include the Boeing 787 and Airbus A380.
What does the law say?
The WTO tries to resolve disputes on two types of subsidy:
1) ""Prohibited subsidies"" are viewed as the most damaging and are always illegal. They are tied directly to exports or the use of local goods instead of imported ones. Despite initial successes, neither side made this charge stick in the core case.
2) ""Actionable subsidies"" cause harm or ""adverse effects"" to another country or its industry, but the burden of proof is higher and rules for compliance are less severe. They are only illegal if the complaining nation can prove it was harmed. Such subsidies dominated the thousands of pages of evidence and will drive any retaliation rights awarded to both sides.
Who won?
According to many, the lawyers and multiple expert witnesses. Costs of the cases are estimated to top $100 million.
In the cases themselves, both sides have won partial WTO rulings but nobody can agree which side came out on top. Each has said its own subsidies were smaller or less harmful than those abroad. Both say they have removed any harmful aid, but the WTO says neither has complied fully.
Now WTO arbitrators must decide on mutual claims of billions of dollars of harm inflicted on each side by ""actionable subsidies"" in order to determine the amount of tariffs allowed.
How big are the tariffs?
The United States seeks tariffs on EU goods with an annual trade value of $11.2 billion. The EU seeks tariffs on U.S. goods worth around $10 billion. People close to the case say the WTO is set to allow Washington to impose around $7.5 billion in tariffs. The EU will find out how much it can impose next year.
Which goods are vulnerable?
WTO rules allow counter-measures to be applied to any goods but both sides will be under pressure from domestic importers to be selective, especially when hitting non-aircraft industries.
Both sides included planes, helicopters, wine, foods and leather goods on their provisional target lists. Both lists exceed the value of tariffs sought, so will have to be reduced.
What happens next?
A report from WTO arbitrators authorizing the United States to impose tariffs may be made public next week. This must be signed off by the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. 
It appears too late for the DSB to do this at its upcoming meeting on Sept 30. Its next regular meeting is due on Oct. 28 but the United States could request a special meeting no earlier than 10 days after the arbitrators' report is published.
Can the EU retaliate?
Under WTO rules, the EU cannot retaliate directly but it is expected to win permission to impose its own tariffs when its parallel case catches up in 2020. There has been some EU talk of reviving a $4 billion war chest of tariffs from an earlier case, to be used at once, but this is sure to provoke a new debate. 
Can a transatlantic tariff war be avoided?
There have been various overtures about talks, but none has been successful. The dispute is moving from a phase in which the industry and the WTO judges took center stage to a political phase widely seen as less predictable. Several sources say the United States, believing it is winning a tariff dispute with China, is ready to act, but some analysts still see a delay.
The EU hopes to persuade the WTO to reopen a procedure to let it demonstrate compliance with earlier rulings. The United States opposes this and doubts exist about whether it can delay sanctions.
What does it mean for air fares?
That depends on what sanctions are used and how airlines pass on their costs. Placing tariffs on Airbus or Boeing aircraft would push up airline costs in targeted countries and could raise fares, some airlines say. But proponents of tariffs say enforcement of WTO decisions would ultimately remove trade-distorting support and lower aircraft prices and fares.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Friday that  Herbalife  Nutrition Ltd. (N:HLF) has agreed to pay $20 million to settle charges that it made false and misleading statements about its business operations in China.
The weight-management and nutrition company did not admit or deny the agency charges, but agreed to cease and desist from further antifraud violations, according to the SEC.
Herbalife did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
Herbalife employs 'multi-level marketing', whereby direct sales companies encourage their workforce to recruit new sellers by awarding them a percentage of the sales.
The SEC found that between 2012 and 2018 Herbalife falsely disclosed to investors that, since direct selling was permitted in China but multi-level marketing was prohibited, it had adopted a different compensation model for business in that country. In reality, its business operations and how it paid service providers in China were similar to its worldwide operations, the SEC said.
While Herbalife claimed it paid Chinese providers on an hourly basis, the SEC said those workers did not record their own hours or detail their work, and instead relied on pre-printed forms that assigned a certain number of hours to specific services.
The markets regulator is seeking to stamp out what it regards as inaccurate disclosures from U.S. companies on their global operations.
""Herbalife deprived investors of valuable information necessary to evaluate risk and make informed investment decisions,"" said Marc Berger, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""When making disclosures to investors, issuers must ensure that those disclosures are accurate."""
1162,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 12:43PM ET</span>",White House Weighs Limits on U.S. Portfolio Flows Into China,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
Trump administration officials are discussing ways to limit U.S. investors’ portfolio flows into China in a move that would have repercussions for billions of dollars in investment pegged to major indexes, according to people familiar with the internal deliberations.
The discussions are occurring as Washington and Beijing negotiate a potential truce in their trade war that’s rattled the world’s two biggest economies and investors for more than a year. They also come as China is removing limits on foreign investment in its financial markets. A U.S. crackdown on capital flows would therefore expose a new pressure point in the economic dispute and cause disruption well beyond the hundreds of billions in tariffs the two sides have levied against each other.
Among the options the Trump administration is considering: delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges and limiting Americans’ exposure to the Chinese market through government pension funds. Exact mechanisms for how to do so have not yet been worked out and any plan is subject to approval by President Donald Trump, who has given the green light to the discussion, according to one person close to the deliberations. 
Trump officials are also examining how the U.S. could put limits on the Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms, three of the people said, although it’s not clear how that would be done. More Chinese companies in recent years have been added to major indexes that a broad array of investors have access to.
Trade War Hasn’t Stopped Wall Street’s $9 Billion China Rush
For instance, hundreds of Chinese businesses have been added into the MSCI Inc.’s indexes since last year — raising questions from Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio and others on Capitol Hill who are advocating for stronger investment restraints and greater scrutiny for Chinese companies in stock indexes and U.S. pension funds. Bloomberg Barclays began adding Chinese bonds to its flagship Global Aggregate Bond Index in April.
The S&P 500 Index sold off initially after the news and was down about 0.3%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield fell to its lowest level of the day as investors sought a haven and stabilized little changed from Thursday’s closing level. The offshore yuan fell 0.3% and touched its weakest level since Sept. 6.
The White House has been discussing its plans with Rubio. It is now considering whether to back legislation he put forward over the summer that provoked much debate over the issue of how to protect U.S. investors with funds allocated into what are often opaque Chinese companies.The White House has not had any discussions with the Chinese government over the issue, said one person close to the administration. It also wants to keep any action isolated from the broader trade negotiations now underway, the person said.But high on the list of U.S. concerns is the unusual influence the Chinese government has over private sector companies and restrictions Beijing places on the release of some financial information of even listed Chinese firms.
The fresh momentum behind the effort is partly due to a push from lawmakers to demand reciprocity with Beijing and a pending deadline for the government’s main retirement savings fund — administered by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board — to channel billions of dollars into Chinese companies next year, according to several people involved in the discussions.
The National Economic Council has been chairing meetings on the issue and the Treasury Department and National Security Council are involved as well, people familiar with the discussions said. While action is not imminent, according to the people, Trump’s advisers are talking through the various options and their expected impact.
At a dinner hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington last week, a group of China and finance experts debated the value and risks of a financial decoupling from Beijing, including how it could be done and what the impact on U.S. investors would be.
Among the speakers was White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who declined to discuss any specifics, according to people who attended the dinner.
Supportive Mood
The evening also featured deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, a China hawk who was just appointed the No. 2 at Trump’s NSC, as well as members of Congress.
The push to unilaterally limit Chinese access to American capital is spearheaded by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, one of Trump’s most hawkish aides, and officials at the NSC, but people involved in the process say even more dovish advisers have rallied behind some of their suggestions.An NSC spokesman and Navarro declined to comment, and Pottinger didn’t respond to a request for comment. Spokesmen for the White House and the Treasury also declined to comment. 
The arguments for action inside the Trump team vary from simply enforcing U.S. transparency laws and creating a level of reciprocity, to raising national-security concerns with some of the Chinese companies that American pension funds are exposed to, according to people familiar with the conversations.
Some of those companies are firms that the U.S. government has identified as bad actors or has imposed sanctions against. The argument continues that Americans would unlikely want to invest in those companies if they had the choice.The market capitalization of the 156 Chinese companies, including at least 11 state-owned firms, listed on the three-largest U.S. exchanges — the NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange and NYSE American — stood at a collective $1.2 trillion as of late February, according to a report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
China earlier this month removed a $300 billion cap on overseas purchases of Chinese stocks and bonds meaning global funds no longer need to apply to purchase quotas to buy the assets. The move is designed to lure more foreign capital into Chinese markets.
Next Big Phase
Roger Robinson, president and CEO of RWR Advisory Group who has been working on the issue since the ’90s, said this type of pressure can make a difference. “Treating the unequal financial dimensions and undisclosed material risks associated with China’s presence in the U.S. capital markets will likely represent the next big phase in the bilateral economic relationship,” he said.
One of the most extreme arguments for cutting China off from American capital — advanced by Navarro and outside advisers like Steve Bannon — is that U.S. investments in Chinese companies or on China’s exchanges mean that Americans are unwittingly giving financial support to the Chinese Communist Party and a rising strategic and economic rival.
QuicktakeHow China’s Trying to Woo Foreigners to Buy Bonds
Trump would also have the support of hardline advocates, like Bannon, his former chief strategist, and hedge fund manager Kyle Bass. Both are leading the Committee on the Present Danger: China. It’s a group that advocates for total economic decoupling as a way to secure America’s national security.
In a recent “threat briefing” — which is how the group titles its meetings — Bannon said American financing have helped spur China’s economic ambitions and technological advances.
“The Frankenstein monster that we have to destroy is created by the West. It’s created by our capital,” Bannon said at the Sept. 12 briefing.
Rule of Law 
While some administration officials see these steps as giving the U.S. more leverage in the trade negotiations, others are working hard to ensure the two are kept separate. At the same time, the administration is hesitant to move forward on this out of fear that the already fragile economic relationship between Beijing and Washington could collapse.
In particular, officials at the Treasury Department and the National Economic Council are wary of how any action could spook investors and are trying to signal to relevant stakeholders that the rule of law can be trusted. Those officials would want to frame any move as taking action against known bad actors that have persistently been out of compliance with U.S. laws.
The NEC is still working on an analysis of the potential impact of any moves targeting financial flows. Just when that might be completed is unclear. 
Nathan Sheets, former Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said action to delist Chinese companies or direct American dollars away from certain firms would be “a big deal” for markets and the bilateral relationship. “Both of those would be very disruptive. On the order of a kind of Huawei announcement,” he added, referring to the Trump administration’s blacklisting of China’s biggest telecommunications-equipment manufacturer.
Capital Hill Hawks
Rubio, who sponsored the so-called EQUITABLE Act, is the biggest champion of such efforts on the Hill and his public comments largely mirror what the White House is discussing. The senator applauded the White House’s work on the issue.
“This administration deserves credit for their efforts to deal with the threat that the Chinese government and Communist Party poses to U.S. national and economic security, including how Beijing takes advantage of its access to U.S. capital markets for predatory purposes,” Rubio said in a statement.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The world's two largest consumer goods companies, Nestle (S:NESN) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG), told Reuters this week that they will fall short of their goals to only source key ingredients that do not contribute to deforestation by 2020.
Nestle, which makes products such as KitKat bars and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, says on its website that in 2010 it ""made a commitment to no-deforestation"" by 2020. But on Saturday, a Nestle spokeswoman confirmed to Reuters that Nestle now estimates that it will fall short of that target.
The spokeswoman says the company now predicts ""over 90 percent of our key agricultural commodities to be verified deforestation-free by the end of 2020, up from 77 percent at the beginning of 2019.""
Separately, Procter & Gamble - whose Tide detergent and Olay skincare products use palm oil - says on its website that it aims ""to establish zero deforestation in our supply chain by 2020."" But on Sunday, a Procter & Gamble spokesman confirmed to Reuters that it would not meet the deforestation goal by 2020.
Advocacy groups like Greenpeace have previously said they were skeptical of promises made by consumer companies. The environmental record of global corporations was in the spotlight at the U.N. Climate Action Summit this week and some investors are calling on companies to stop deforestation after more than a month of fires in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
Nestle and P&G, respectively the world's biggest packaged goods companies by market capitalization, made these pledges in 2010 at the urging of the Consumer Goods Forum, an industry trade group.
Hundreds of companies made zero deforestation pledges by 2020, according to the CGF. Ignacio Gavilan, the director of sustainability of CGF, told Reuters its member companies had underestimated increasing demand for consumer goods and lax government forest regulations.
Both Nestle and P&G - which said they have invested towards monitoring deforestation over the past decade and will continue to do so - reference their commitments with the CGF on their websites and executives have referenced them publicly.
PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP), Mars and  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) told Reuters they had no-deforestation pledges but declined to provide specifics on whether they would meet them by 2020. Cargill Inc (CARG.UL), which sources ingredients like corn and soybeans, said on a conference call with reporters in June that it and the broader food industry will not make 2020 zero deforestation pledges.
 Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR),  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) and  General Mills  Inc (N:GIS) – some of the other large members of the CGF – did not respond to requests for comment. Kellogg (N:K) declined to comment."

The so-called plan of adjustment covering $35 billion of bonds and claims and more than $50 billion of pension liabilities would allow Puerto Rico to exit a form of bankruptcy that commenced in May 2017 if approved in U.S. District Court.
“Today we have taken a big step to put bankruptcy behind us and start envisioning what Puerto Rico’s future looks like under fiscal stability and economic sustainability,” the oversight board’s chairman, José Carrión, said in a statement.
Owners of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, its Public Buildings Authority and Employees Retirement System would face haircuts on their initial investments ranging from 28% to 87%.
The board, meanwhile, is trying to void over $6 billion of general obligation bonds sold in 2012 and 2014 on the basis they were issued in violation of Puerto Rico's constitutional debt limit. The plan includes a settlement mechanism for challenged bonds. 
Annual debt service would be reduced to 9% of government revenue from 28%, according to the board.
The plan creates an independent reserve trust for Puerto Rico's pay-as-you-go public sector retirement system. Monthly pension payments totaling over $1,200 would be cut by 8.5%, affecting about 40% of retirees.
So far, Puerto Rico has won court approval for debt restructurings for its Government Development Bank and Sales Tax Financing Corporation known as COFINA. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority moved closer to exiting bankruptcy earlier this month when two holdout bond insurers joined a deal to restructure its debt."

The University of Michigan's final sentiment index rose to 93.2 from a preliminary 92 and August's 89.8, according to data Friday that topped economist estimates. The gauges of current conditions and economic expectations index both showed gains from the first report, as did views on buying conditions for durable goods.
Key Insights

The final reading for the month, while up from the lowest level in almost three years, signals that consumers may be poised to offer the expansion less of a boost than they have in recent quarters despite a still-solid job market.
A near-record one-third of respondents made a negative mention of trade policies when asked to explain their economic expectations, according to the report. In addition, fewer Americans saw wages rising or unemployment falling in the year ahead.
Government data Friday showed the economy cooled in August. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of gross domestic product, rose 0.1% from July, the smallest gain in six months and less than economists had projected.
Other surveys have showed views dimming. The Conference Board's consumer confidence measure dropped the most this year in September while Bloomberg's comfort gauge fell for a third straight week as views of the buying climate deteriorated.

“ The overall trends in the sentiment index remain quite favorable, but show signs of a slow erosion,” Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, said in a statement. “ Some of these concerns are rooted in partisanship, some due to conditions in the global economy.”

The survey’s gauges of inflation expectations, which Federal Reserve officials monitor closely, showed price gains over the coming year were seen at 2.8% versus 2.7% the prior month. The five-year estimate was 2.4% following 2.6%. 
Economists had expected a final sentiment reading of 92.1.
A measure of buying conditions for household durable goods remained near last month's five-year low, though was up from August after the preliminary report showed a decline.
Interviews were conducted Aug. 27 to Sept. 23. The cutoff for the preliminary survey was Sept. 11.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) will raise its stake in Subaru Corp (T:7270) to 20% from around 17%, the two Japanese automakers said on Friday, as they leverage their scale to better compete in developing new vehicle technologies.
The investment comes a month after Toyota and another smaller Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269), said they would take small equity stakes in each other. 
Such tie-ups highlight how automakers are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development required to develop self-driving cars, electric vehicles and new mobility services which are upending the global auto industry.
""In this once-in-a-century period of profound transformation, by strengthening their bonds and aligning their capabilities, Toyota and Subaru aim ... to make ever-better cars,"" Toyota said in a statement.
Japan's biggest automaker whose annual global vehicle sales are 10 times that of Subaru, said its investment would amount to up to 80 billion yen ($742 million) based on Subaru's stock market value. The smaller automaker will reciprocate by buying a stake in Toyota of equal value. 
Traditional car makers, especially smaller ones such as Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to meet the fast pace of change in an industry which is shifting to a business model of providing transportation services from simply selling cars to drivers.
Their deepening partnerships with Toyota, which already oversees a vast, closely knit network of group companies that include suppliers, vendors and commercial vehicle makers, has raised speculation that these smaller automakers may be absorbed into the Toyota fabric in the future.
""The plan appears to be to ultimately make Subaru a fully owned subsidiary, to help create a 'mega Toyota'. This is the first step toward that,"" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. ""It's all about building scale.""
But Subaru President Tomomi Nakamura was adamant that his company would remain independent for now. 
""I can assure you that there was absolutely no talk of Subaru becoming a Toyota subsidiary ... either from our side or theirs,"" Subaru President Tomomi Nakamura told reporters after the announcement.
JOINING FORCES
Car makers around the world are joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.
Friday's deal cements Subaru's place in Toyota's expanding group of Japanese partners, which include Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) and Yamaha Motor Co (T:7272).
Rival Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) has an alliance with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), although that has been shaken following the ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn, and with Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211).
Honda Motor Co (T:7267) has a tie-up with General Motors (N:GM).
Subaru, which produces the Outback and Forester SUVs, is known for its horizontally placed boxer engines, along with its EyeSight autonomous driver assist and all-wheel-drive technologies. 
The two automakers in June said they planned to jointly develop an electric sport-utility vehicle on a platform produced together, to share costs. 
Toyota seems to be keen on investing in smaller, domestic automakers, rather than forging cross-border tie-ups like some of its rivals.
It has been building its holding in Subaru since first acquiring a 9.5% stake in the company, then called Fuji Heavy Industries, in 2005. Its current 17% stake makes Toyota the biggest shareholder.

Toyota shares ended 0.77% lower on Friday and Subaru fell 0.74%.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) is seeking more airlines to partner with in India for code-sharing agreements to expand its presence in the country, a senior company executive told Reuters on Friday.
Lufthansa is focusing on growing its network in India in part because of the grounding of the country's biggest private carrier Jet Airways (NS:JET) which stopped flying in April after running out of cash.
The German airline, which already has a code-share agreement with state-run carrier Air India, has an interline agreement with Vistara, a full service carrier owned by the Tata Group and Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), which it is keen to expand, Alain Chisari, vice president, Asia Pacific, Lufthansa Group, said.
""Vistara fits really well with our product portfolio because they've got the premium proposition as well. We are looking forward to expanding the relationship with Vistara but also other partners,"" he said in an interview in New Delhi.
Airlines with interline agreements share things such as check-in and baggage handling, while code shares allow airlines to market flights to each others customers.
Chisari declined to comment on whether Lufthansa is in talks with Vistara for a code-share agreement.  
The German group is encouraged by the growth in passenger numbers flying to international destinations from India. India's outbound passenger number grew to 25.5 million a year in 2018 from 18.4 million in 2015.
""The growth, the potential, the economy, the distribution of purchasing power is so promising for us,"" said Chisari, adding that he would also like to bring other group carriers like Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines to India."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged Silicon Valley giants on Friday to make sure technological advances such as artificial intelligence do not lead to a new ""form of barbarism"" where the law of the strongest prevails over the common good.
Francis made his comments in an address to participants at a Vatican conference attended by executives from companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Mozilla, and  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) as well as Nobel laureates, Catholic ethicists, government regulators, internet entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists.
The three-day gathering, which ends on Saturday, is discussing topics with tech jargon not commonly heard inside the Vatican such as algorithms and blockchain.
""The remarkable developments in the field of technology, in particular those dealing with artificial intelligence, raise increasingly significant implications in all areas of human activity. For this reason, open and concrete discussions on this theme are needed now more than ever,"" Francis told the participants.
They include Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman of Mozilla, Gavin Corn, associate general counsel and director of the cyber security law team at Facebook, Western Digital senior vice president Jim Welsh and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
Francis said technology needed ""both theoretical and practical moral principles"".
He warned of the dangers of the use of artificial intelligence ""to circulate tendentious opinions and false data that could poison public debates and even manipulate the opinions of millions of people, to the point of endangering the very institutions that guarantee peaceful civil coexistence"".
""If mankind’s so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest,"" he said.
The conference is taking place amid the rise of cyber espionage, online hate speech and misuse of private data, and signs the industry is struggling to respond.
It is the latest example of the Vatican trying to stay ahead of the curve on technology and social issues in order to influence the pioneers of the future, regardless of their religion.
Vatican officials said it could provide material for a possible papal document on artificial intelligence, much as meetings with scientists helped shape his landmark 2015 encyclical ""Laudato Si"" on the protection of the environment and global warming."
1180,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",Trump Has Gutted an Agency That’s Vital to American Farmers,"(Bloomberg) -- Headquartered in a nondescript office building in Washington, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service churns out papers with such scintillating titles as “Cotton and Wool Outlook: September 2019.” The ERS, as it’s often called, is the kind of government bureaucracy few can identify but millions rely on for their livelihoods.
With roots dating to President Theodore Roosevelt’s administration, the agency provides the informational lifeblood of the nation’s $1 trillion agricultural industry. Its research informs the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates, or WASDE, arguably the most important global report of its kind for farmers and investors. Congress uses ERS forecasts to determine how much farm subsidies will cost taxpayers.
Yet today, this key organization has been gutted. As of the end of September, three-quarters of its staff of 250 have retired, quit, were terminated, or plan to leave by year-end, according to internal estimates compiled by staff and their union that were viewed by Bloomberg News, and interviews with 12 current and former employees.
The unit is a casualty of last year’s decision by Donald Trump’s administration to move part of the USDA, including the ERS, from Washington to the Kansas City region. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said it would save money and bring the organization closer geographically to the industry it supports. Perdue has said he wanted all employees to transfer, though he knew some wouldn’t for family reasons.
The USDA declined to discuss the number of departures but cautioned that employment figures are “changing daily,” since the staff has until Friday to decide whether to take a position outside Washington. In a statement, the department said the move will increase, not reduce, research because the $20 million in anticipated annual cost savings can be used to retain and attract staff. The agency said the move will have no impact on the closely followed WASDE reports.
But Susan Offutt, former ERS administrator and previously chief economist at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’s watchdog arm, said the move aims to eliminate researchers whose findings contradict Trump policies on tariffs, climate change and social programs. “The ERS research program produces output that is inconvenient” to the administration, she said.
Last year, for example, two ERS economists found that, among farmers, the Trump tax cuts primarily benefited the richest operators. Later, after the results were reported in the press, the USDA communications office instructed the researchers not to speak publicly, and the Office of the Chief Economist asked them to craft talking points discrediting their own research, people familiar with the conversations said. The USDA declined to discuss the situation.
Those who rely on the data are feeling mounting concern that reports will either be skewed or not produced at all.
Richard Oswald farms more than 2,000 acres of corn and soybeans near the northwestern Missouri city of Rock Port, population 1,200. Amid the wettest spring on record, the nearby Missouri River has been flooding as a result of climate change, threatening a business that has sustained his family here for 80 years. Oswald, 69, looks to ERS reports to build a case for improving bridges and river levees.
“If you can’t talk about climate change, the reason this is happening, then how can you even talk about changing it?,” said Oswald, a board member of the Missouri Farmers Union. “It’s about policy makers, farmers, people who live in the cities -- this is unbiased work that has been done for years. The effort is to slow it down, and that’s what the move has done -- slowed down reporting on climate and the signs.”
Some reports from the ERS, which also focuses on rural America and trade, have already been delayed. These include research on politically sensitive areas such as the causes of the opioid epidemic, market access under tariff rate quotas and U.S. agricultural exports to China. The reason: A group of seven staff who edit the peer-reviewed reports is down to one, causing a backlog.
At the resource and rural economics division, which studies links between agriculture, energy, climate and policies, at least half of its staff of about 65 have already left or will be leaving when the agency moves its headquarters, according to the internal estimates viewed by Bloomberg.
The food team retained only half its staff of 55. The group analyzes areas essential to U.S. well-being: school lunch programs, regular reports on the health of women and children, and food safety and prices. Similarly, half of the researchers compiling the U.S. government’s most detailed report on farm and ranch finances are gone. All five people responsible for farm insurance and risk management have left.
On a recent weekday afternoon at ERS headquarters just south of the Capitol building, rows of chairs and desks stand empty, as if employees had just fled an earthquake, leaving behind coffee-stained mugs and stacks of documents in the hallways, according to a current staffer who asked not to be identified because of a lack of authorization. Entire sections of the office are in darkness since there’s no one to activate the motion sensor lights.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Shares in LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) surged more than 30% at the market open on Friday, the day after Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said it would buy a 20% stake in the company for $1.9 billion, creating a major new airline partnership and ending the Chilean carrier's ties with American Airlines. (O:AAL)
LATAM shares were up by 33% within an hour of Santiago’s blue-chip IPSA's stock exchange opening. U.S.-listed shares were up 39.3% before the market opened.
The surprise deal with Latin America's largest carrier will give Delta a much bigger footprint in the region, a growth market in which LATAM flies to dozens of destinations including cities in Argentina, Peru and Brazil.
The LATAM deal is Delta's largest since it merged with Northwest Airlines a decade ago."

Company veteran Albert Bourla, who succeeded Read, will assume the additional role of chairman.
Read, 66, helped Pfizer weather patent expirations of several blockbusters, including cholesterol drug Lipitor, through dealmaking, expansion in emerging markets and cost cuts.
The drugmaker has since eschewed large, transformative deals because of confidence in the strength of its pipeline.
In July, Pfizer announced plans to spin off its off-patent branded drugs business and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV (O:MYL), a move that will help the company focus on its innovative drugs that generate more profit.
Separately, the drugmaker reported positive data from a late-stage study testing its experimental atopic dermatitis treatment, abrocitinib.

1184,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 08:36AM ET</span>",American Business Scrambled to Beat Big Wave of China Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- Another reminder arrived this week of how President Donald Trump’s trade war is driving business decisions.
U.S. imports of consumer and capital goods jumped by the most all year in August, while other major categories eased. You’ll recall that Trump announced 10% tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese items at the start of that month, which likely left companies scrambling to boost shipments of exactly those goods to save some money before getting hit with higher prices starting Sept. 1.
While the goods trade data release didn’t include merchandise shipments or break down regions, some assumptions can be made because this has happened several times before, when Trump announced or threatened levies on China, and his brief flirtation with levies on Mexico in June. That’s been the ongoing game for U.S. firms, and executives have pointed to the trade uncertainty as a risk to business growth (in the case of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) for example) and to the economy.
Washington’s trade war with Beijing has created supply-chain headaches for U.S. firms that rely on Chinese imports, at the same time capital spending slows in response to weaker global growth. As a result, manufacturing has gone from a bright spot to a soft one.
The tariffs are also obscuring the true picture of economic growth: Boosts in exports and inventories tend to provide temporary strength to quarterly gross domestic product, while emptying warehouses weigh on GDP — a phenomenon that in the past year has bounced the data around. The higher prices have also filtered through somewhat into inflation, and the consumer outlook.
Overall, global goods trade was weaker in August. The merchandise trade gap barely budged (it widened, but less than expected), with exports ticking up slightly and imports rising 0.3%. Watch for the full trade balance report Oct. 4, which will provide more detail, including a regional breakdown."

Four mining billionaires, including Egypt’s Naguib Sawiris and Russia’s Suleiman Kerimov, have grown their fortunes by $1.8 billion this year. Spurred by central bank easing, the metal has gained about 16% in 2019 and is poised for its best year since 2010.
The biggest gainer is Kerimov, whose family controls 78.6% of Polyus (MCX:PLZL), the biggest gold producer in Russia. He’s followed by Sawiris who owns stakes in gold mines through his closely held company, La Mancha Resources. He told Bloomberg last year that he was one of the largest gold-mining investors in the world and expects prices will reach $1,800 an ounce. The metal traded at $1,492 at 6:53 a.m. in New York.
“You have to be buying at any level, frankly,” investor Mark Mobius said in a Bloomberg interview last month. “Gold’s long-term prospect is up, up and up, and the reason why I say that is money supply is up, up and up. With the efforts by the central banks to lower interest rates, they’re going to be printing like crazy.”
Other bulls include Ray Dalio, who runs the world’s largest hedge fund firm. He recommended buying gold in July as a way to profit while central bank stimulus nears its limit.
There’s also skepticism of the current rally. Guy Wolf, the global head of market analytics at Marex Spectron, said it’s difficult to make an argument for gold because it doesn’t pay yields and is battling a rising dollar."

Investing.com -- Europe's stock markets have recovered their poise after U.S. politics caused a fresh bout of jitters on Thursday, but they're still on course to end the week lower. 
The biggest prop to markets across the continent appeared to be a cheap currency. The biggest gainer was the FTSE 100, led by exporters and natural resource companies after Bank of England hawk Michael Saunders said that the U.K. economy would need interest rate cuts, if it can avoid a disorderly 'no-deal Brexit'. 
Saunders' speech depressed sterling by around half a percent against the dollar and a third of a cent against the euro. In response, miners Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), Anglo American (OTC:NGLOY) and BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP) all rose more than 2%, while index heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) rose 1.8% and BP (NYSE:BP) rose 1.4%. The biggest loser in London was Imperial Brands PLC (LON:IMB), which lost another 4.8% in the wake of Thursday's profit warning, which revealed the scale of the damage to its business from the backlash against vaping products. 
The euro for its part was also staying cheap, after more weak business confidence surveys out of Spain and Italy and a sharp drop in German import prices that underlined the return of deflationary pressures to the euro zone. It touched a new two-year low of $1.0905 overnight and recouped only little of that in Friday morning trading in Europe. Export-sensitive chemicals group BASF was the top gainer in the SPDR Euro Stoxx 50 (NYSE:FEZ), with other globally-exposed names including Siemens, Nokia (HE:NOKIA), Daimler and Adidas (DE:ADSGN) all rising between 1% and 1.9%.
By 5:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.3% at 391.40, although that's still on course for a small weekly decline. Germany's DAX was up 0.5%, while France's CAC 40 was up 0.2%.
There was no obvious sense of unease emanating from the U.S. IPO market, which has had a ragged couple of weeks with the postponement of Endeavor Group and We Company's deals in quick succession. While exercise bike-maker Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) got its deal away on Thursday, it fell some 11%. 
By contrast, software group   TeamViewer   (DE:TMV), which became the biggest tech IPO in Germany in 19 years this week, recovered 2.5% on Friday to trade above its IPO price. "

1188,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>","Exclusive: As North Korea expands arsenal, Japan's missile defense shield faces unforeseen costs - sources","By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Additional tests may add at least $500 million to Japan's price tag for two U.S.-built ballistic missile interceptor stations that could struggle to shoot down the latest North Korean missile types, four government and defense sources said.
The tests are required to show the system is working properly, according to  Lockheed Martin , the manufacturer. Held in Hawaii rather than Japan, they would cost about $100 million per launch. 
""Japan is waiting to hear back from the U.S. Missile Defense Agency about what tests will be required,"" said one of the sources. ""Those tests haven't been budgeted for."" 
As part of a major defense upgrade, Japan in 2018 agreed to buy the land-based Aegis Ashore sites offered by Washington, rejecting a new U.S. Navy radar offered by  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN) in favor of one designed by rival Lockheed Martin Corp (N:LMT). 
The Japanese defense minister at the time, Itsunori Onodera, did not know Japan would also have to pay for missile launches to test the Lockheed radar, the sources said. One of the defense sources said the Japanese government had thought computer-simulated tests would be sufficient.
All four asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to talk to the media.
An official at Onodera's parliamentary office declined a request to interview the senior ruling party lawmaker about the issue. It is unclear whether other Japanese officials knew about the tests.
""That topic would have been addressed in government-to-government discussions,"" said Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Mona Neuhass. ""Regardless of the radar selected, a live fire test will be required to verify the fire-control loop."" 
Japan's Ministry of Defense said it had no immediate comment.
The Japanese government, among the top three foreign buyers of U.S. military hardware for the past three years, must now explain additional spending on a multibillion-dollar project.
The contract for the Aegis Ashore systems has not yet been signed. The systems are scheduled to be operational by 2024. 
""It may be an opportunity for Japan to rethink Aegis Ashore in favor of integrated air missile defense,"" said one of the sources, who is familiar with Japan's military planning.
Integrated air missile defense (IAMD) is a broader approach to defense, with multiple components to counter threats ranging from warheads plunging from space to lower-altitude attacks such as cruise missiles.
This year, North Korea tested ballistic missiles whose warheads appeared to maneuver in flight, making them harder to shoot down.
Lockheed Martin referred requests to comment on new North Korean missiles to Japan's Ministry of Defense and the Missile Defense Agency.
So far Japan has budgeted $1.2 billion for Aegis Ashore hardware but expects other costs, including construction, maintenance and operational expenses over three decades to put the final tally for two sites at $4.31 billion. 
Hiranao Honda, a lawmaker with the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and director of its security division, said the additional costs showed the program should be shut down.
""There are a series of costs that have yet to be budgeted for, such as construction, and we still have to pay for the missiles. There has not been an adequate explanation from the government,"" said Honda, who has requested more details from the defense ministry on Aegis Ashore costs.  
He noted that Japan already had eight warships with a similar but less-capable Aegis system that can attack incoming missiles.
ALARM
A recent series of short-range missile tests by Pyongyang, which U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed as unimportant, have prompted alarm in Japan. 
Former defense chief Takeshi Iwaya said last month that those launches appeared to test new missiles with irregular trajectories designed to penetrate ballistic missile defenses, including the Aegis Ashore stations. Typically, such defense systems are designed to counter projectiles on predictable flight paths.
Both Lockheed Martin's Solid-State Radar and Raytheon's SPY-6, which the U.S. Navy is putting in its latest Aegis-equipped ships, promise a major boost to Aegis's ability to detect and hit incoming targets.
Japan will also have to buy interceptor missiles along with the radar. The latest missile for the Aegis system, the SM-3 Block IIA, jointly developed by Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011) and Raytheon, cost about $30 million each. 
Using some of those missiles for tests would add to the cost of setting up the system, as would paying for targets that mimic incoming warheads.
TESTS OVERSEAS
Holding those tests in Japan could crank up tensions in East Asia, so Tokyo would conduct them at a more isolated test site in Hawaii, according to three of the sources.
Japan would have to pay for a temporary Aegis Ashore site there as well as interceptors, including the pricey Block IIA, which would be destroyed in any test.
Aside from personnel and target missiles, Japan would also pay for an exclusion zone to keep commercial shipping and aircraft away from the tests.
One test could cost about $100 million, according to one of the sources, who has knowledge of past tests conducted by the United States in Hawaii.

Configuring Aegis Ashore to fire other interceptors that could target newer North Korean would require additional tests, he added.

CHONBURI, Thailand (Reuters) - When trade war tariffs jolted Chinese tire-maker Prinx Chengshan into speeding up foreign investment plans, the company wound up in Thailand, thanks to that country's relentless courtship.
With an initial investment of $300 million, the company is now racing to build a factory to export tires to the United States next year, based in a Thai industrial zone reinvigorated by the trade war.
Multiple visits to China by Thailand's Board of Investment helped. So did two personal meetings with Thailand's top economic policymaker, said Ju Xunning, a company manager.
""This impressed our company, and this is also one of the main reasons for choosing Thailand,"" Ju told Reuters. ""It's apparent that the government values doing business with us.""
With global economic growth flagging, in part because of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China, competition is growing among Asian countries to win investment from companies moving supply chains to escape higher tariffs.
Tax breaks, promises to slash red tape and trade missions are all on the table.
""Companies have thrown in the towel on the status quo,"" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit.
Vietnam has benefited most from the shifts in terms of the number of companies moving business, according to independent surveys. But other Asian countries are eager to bring in more business as well, including India and Indonesia.
Companies moving production from China - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-TRADE-CHINA-COMPETITION/0100B2CW1GZ/USA-TRADE-CHINA-COMPETITION.jpg
'YOU'RE THE EMPEROR'
The trade war has breathed new life into Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), where Prinx Chengshan is building its factory. The program was set up under the former military junta to boost growth that has for years lagged regional peers.
Pledged investment for the zone rose nearly four-fold year-on-year to 88 billion baht ($2.9 billion) in the first half of 2019. One of the main drivers was investment from companies trying to escape tariffs.
Thailand's biggest industrial estate developer WHA (BK:WHA), which has nine developments in the area, said Chinese companies account for 43 percent of its land sales, up from less than 3 percent before the trade war.
Chinese companies are being catered to carefully, the company's chief executive, Jareeporn Jarukornsakul, told Reuters.
""I told one company, 'This location is very good. You'll be at the heart of the estate, and everyone else will be your tributaries. The feng shui is perfect, you're the emperor,'"" she said.
Hong Kong-listed Prinx Chengshan said it had planned on moving tire production to Malaysia, but wavered after the Malaysian election in early 2018.
""The government couldn't fulfill several of the promises made to us and we eventually gave up,"" Ju said at his makeshift office near the building site.
Malaysia's deputy trade and industry minister, Ong Kian Ming, told Reuters that although Prinx Chengshan had gone elsewhere, the country had attracted another Chinese tire company - Maxtrek Tyres, a subsidiary of Zhaoqing Junhong Corp. Ltd - as well as a paper plant and further Chinese investment.
Both Thailand and Malaysia have since sweetened their deals.
Thailand this month offered a new range of ""relocation incentives"" - including a five-year 50% corporate tax cut - while Malaysia set up an investment board to encourage relocations.
""If approvals took three months earlier, now it would take a month,"" Ong said. ""The trend we see is that many of these strategic investments are reacting to the U.S.-China conflict.""
Foreign direct investment to Malaysia nearly doubled to $12 billion in the first half of 2019, and Ong said he hoped it would accelerate further.
HIGH END, LOW END
Thailand and Malaysia are competing for higher-end manufacturers, but their wages price them out of labor-intensive work such as stitching shirts and sneakers that is more likely to go to Bangladesh, Myanmar or Cambodia.
One Bangladeshi factory owner, Faisal Samad, said new orders from the United States had pushed his export volumes up 20% this year.
Vietnam has taken aim at both the low and high ends, with companies citing relatively low wages, a motivated workforce, relatively simple business procedures and proximity to China.
When Vietnamese industrial park operator DEEP C Industrial Zones set off to China for investment roadshows this month, it saw 180 people sign up this year compared with just 20 last year, said head of sales Hank Kerstens.
Another beneficiary has been Taiwan, whose government is trying to lure back Taiwanese firms in China with incentives on tax, land, water and electricity. Officials hope to get $16 billion investment by the end of the year.
A Nomura study of 56 firms relocating production from China between April 2018 and August 2019, when trade war tensions have been highest, showed 26 going to Vietnam, 11 to Taiwan and eight to Thailand.
Just three companies went to India and two to Indonesia - a situation both countries are trying to change.
India wants to woo companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Foxconn and Wistron Corp with a charm offensive, according to a source and a government document.
A surprise cut to India's headline corporate tax rate to 22% from 30% last week could attract smartphone makers, industry executives said. The federal commerce ministry said the cut was meant to draw in investment.
But businesses also worry about infrastructure and red tape.
One smartphone company executive, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, compared Vietnam to India, saying: ""You meet one guy (in Vietnam) and he takes care of everything from the government side."" That is not the case in India, he added.
Similar concerns are hampering Indonesia, where President Joko Widodo this month told cabinet ministers ""we have a problem"" as he pointed to the lack of companies moving production to Indonesia to escape trade war tariffs.
He ordered ministers to identify which regulations were getting in the way of investment.
""It's a matter of identifying those regulations, fixing them, and making sure no new ones come up,"" said Citi Indonesia chief economist Helmi Arman, who cited ""ad-hoc regulations"" as the main obstacle to attracting trade war-related relocations.
Indonesian ministries did not respond to a request for comment.
In Thailand, Jareeporn said she was optimistic that the recent surge of investment was just the start.
""We now have a shot at becoming the region's number one and overtaking Vietnam in five years,"" she said after closing a land deal with another Chinese business."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday said it would adopt a new rule to modernize how exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are brought to the market and their regulation.
The long-awaited Rule 6c-11 - or the ETF rule as it is more commonly called - is aimed at simplifying rules governing ETFs and seeks to speed up the process of launching new ETFs while reducing associated costs.
Notably, the new rule does away with the exemptive-relief requirement in which would-be ETF issuers had to file with the regulator to get special permission to go around rules outlined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, which did not allow for ETFs.
""As the ETF industry continues to grow in size and importance, particularly to Main Street investors, it is important to have a consistent, transparent and efficient regulatory framework that eliminates regulatory hurdles while maintaining appropriate investor protections,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement.
Since 1992, the SEC has issued over 300 exemptive orders that allowed more than 2,000 ETFs to exist with more than $3.3 trillion in total net assets, according to data from the commission. 
The new ETF rule will replace hundreds of those individual exemptive orders with a single rule. 
""The ETF rule will level the playing field for ETF providers, allowing new participants to enter via a streamlined process,"" said Elisabeth Kashner, FactSet's director of ETF research.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard, and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) currently dominate the ETF space.
""BlackRock has long supported ETF regulation that enhances transparency, market quality and choice for investors,"" BlackRock Inc, the world's largest issuer of ETFs, said in a statement.
""We look forward to reviewing the final rule in detail and sharing our thoughts in due course,"" BlackRock said.
The new rule will allow all ETFs to use custom baskets, containing securities that do not match their ETF's index, in the creation and redemption process instead of a basket that exactly replicates the index or cash in lieu of certain basket of securities.
The use of custom baskets, commonly allowed in the early days of ETFs, but not in recent years, has allowed older ETF firms like BlackRock and State Street to adjust their portfolio's holdings efficiently and minimize capital gains from higher-turnover, active strategies.
""The custom basket provision, now extended to virtually all players, will increase access to the ""heartbeat"" trade, allowing newer entrants to re-balance portfolios without passing along capital gains,"" said Kashner.

""Heartbeat trades"" refer to transactions in which an investor puts money into an ETF only to make a quick withdrawal that is paid out in shares of the stocks held by the ETF, thereby avoiding significant capital gains for the fund.

HANOI (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) is studying the possibility of building another factory in northern Vietnam, already the South Korean electronics giant's key production base, a local official said on Friday.
""Samsung is looking to lease an area of 500-1,000 hectares in Hoa Binh province to build a factory to produce electronics products,"" a senior official of the province told Reuters.
Samsung, which has invested more than $17.3 billion in eight factories and a research and development center in Vietnam, is the country's largest single foreign investor and accounts for around one-fifth of total exports.
""We welcome the investment from Samsung and will create the most favorable conditions for the company to do business here, in terms of infrastructure, labor and administrative procedures,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak with media on the matter and so declined to be identified.
Samsung did not respond to Reuters' emails seeking comment.
Vietnam's exports of smartphones and electronic components, mostly produced by Samsung Electronics, rose 5.6% in the first eight months of 2019 compared with the same period a year earlier to $33.39 billion, government customs data showed."

""Normal production processes at these locations are currently experiencing significant disruption,"" Rheinmetall said in a statement late on Thursday.
Rheinmetall shares, which have risen around 50% since the start of this year, were indicated to open 2.9% lower in early Frankfurt trade on Friday.
""The IT infrastructure in the region has been shut down and is currently being rebuilt"", Rheinmetall spokesman Peter Ruecker said, adding the company could not say who might have been behind it.
Cyber attacks, especially those which affect producers engaged in critical infrastructure, machinery and armament, are becoming a big headache for European blue chip companies.
On Thursday, France's AFP news agency reported that a series of cyber attacks on Airbus (PA:AIR) in the past few months was conducted via the computer systems of its suppliers and security sources suspect a link to China.
In July, German blue-chip companies BASF (DE:BASFn),  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and Henkel (DE:HNKG_p) revealed they had been victims of cyber attacks, confirming a German media report which said the likely culprit was a state-backed Chinese group.
Rheinmetall said the IT shutdown is expected to last two to four weeks, with a financial impact of 3 to 4 million euros ($3.27 to $4.36 million) per week.
""We are still able to deliver according to schedule,"" Ruecker said.
He said that the domain affected by the malware had been cut off from Rheinmetall's corporate network and that only the Automotive branch -- and thus none of Rheinmetall's armament operations -- were affected by the attack."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two former executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) in Australia agreed to co-operate with regulators on condition of immunity in a criminal cartel case by the state against  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), a Sydney court heard on Friday.
The three global banks worked on an A$3 billion ($2.03 billion) stock issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) in 2015. Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and their staff were charged last year with withholding crucial information from shareholders about the sale.
State prosecutors have accused the banks of forming a criminal cartel to either ""directly or indirectly"" restrict the supply of ANZ shares or maintain the price of ANZ shares, according to court documents.
Four phone calls in August 2015, which prosecutors say involved bankers from all the companies, are at the heart of the case, brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
Deutsche's defense lawyer, Murugan Thangaraj, told the court on Friday that former JPMorgan capital markets managers Jeffrey Herbert-Smith and Richard Galvin were given immunity, which added to questions over the credibility of their witness statements.
Thangaraj said JPMorgan had only sought immunity ""to save it being at this bar table"". 
The former JPMorgan managers gave witness statements about the calls after being shown transcripts and other bankers' notes of the conversations, Citi lawyer Dean Jordan told the court.
""Quite obviously we have a circumstance where the ... recollection of a key witness would appear to have been contaminated by the process by which the statement was taken,"" Jordan said.
Two of the phone calls were recorded without the consent of all the participants, and ""it is an offence to do that,"" Jordan said.
Recordings and transcripts of the calls should therefore not be allowed as evidence, he added.
A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.
None of the accused companies or people have entered formal pleas and no trial date has been set, but all have said they would plead not guilty.
The case could have major implications for the underwriting business and lead to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide.
The defense lawyers argued on Friday for the right to question four officers from the competition regulator who worked on the case.
State prosecutors have opposed allowing the officers to testify, saying it may violate legal privilege and inappropriately expose the regulator's private workings.
The next hearing is Nov. 8, when the magistrate, Jennifer Atkinson said she will rule on whether the defense can cross-examine the ACCC officers."

The payments were made over seven years and most of the money had been returned, he said. Shares of the Japanese utility dropped 6.7 percent, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei average's (N225) 1.4 percent slide.
Iwane did not identify the person who made the payments when he spoke at a hastily called press conference following media reports that the executives had received personal payments from a former official of a town that hosts one of the utility's nuclear power plants.
""I offer my heartfelt apology for bringing about this situation, causing worry and trouble for people concerned and the society in general, at a time when trust in nuclear energy needs to be restored,"" Iwane told the news conference.
Public trust in nuclear power generation was shattered in Japan when a massive earthquake and tsunami prompted three reactors to meltdown at Tokyo Electric Power's (T:9501) Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011.
Iwane said no favors were given in exchange for the payments and business between Kansai Electric and a company related to the person who made the payments was conducted properly.
After media reports of the payments, Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Isshu Sugawara said it would be outrageous if the reports are true.
The Kyodo news agency said an investigation by tax authorities had shown the payments were made by a deputy mayor, who had since died. The official told tax authorities that the payments were a token of appreciation to the officials for supporting the town, whose economy relies heavily on the plant, Kyodo reported.
Iwane told the news conference he would implement steps to prevent a recurrence. These measures would be carried out under his leadership, he said.
Iwane said the people involved, including himself, had been punished within the company. He and Chairman Makoto Yagi had taken pay cuts, Iwane said.
A Kansai Electric spokeswoman declined to give details of the paycuts or the penalties."

The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said additional conditions need to be added to amendments proposed by the Australian Banking Association (ABA) to protect low-income consumers and drought affected farmers.
The ABA, which represents 23 banks, including Australia's 'Big Four' and units of several top foreign banks, proposed that certain basic bank accounts have no minimum deposits, free debit cards and facilities and free unlimited domestic transactions.
""While the ACCC strongly supports these objectives, we are proposing to place extra conditions on ABA members to ensure the changes effectively address the Royal Commission's recommendations, and in turn actually deliver these public benefits,"" ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said.
Last year, a Royal Commission inquiry uncovered widespread misconduct at the expense of consumers in the Australia's financial sector, and in a report this year set out a series of recommendations to improve protections and oversight.
The ACCC said that one of its concerns was that under ABA's proposed changes, banks would not be required to tell customers if they were eligible for those types of basic bank accounts.
Under ABA's changes, default interest charged on agricultural loans in drought-affected areas would be prevented.
""We note the ACCC has raised three further conditions which the ABA will consider in more detail following discussions with members,"" the ABA said in an emailed statement."

An escalating battle over aircraft subsidies between the U.S. and the European Union threatens to damage both sides, said Airbus SE Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury.
“A trade war on aviation would be a lose-lose game because the supply chains are very integrated,’’ Faury told reporters Thursday at a briefing in Montreal. “We buy a lot in the U.S., we sell in the U.S. and we are a U.S. player as well.’’
Airbus is at the center of the feud, with the World Trade Organization poised to authorize the U.S. to impose tariffs on almost $8 billion of European goods due to illegal state aid provided to the planemaker. The U.S. duties, which could hit as soon as October, will target jetliners and aircraft parts as well as luxury products such as wine and leather goods, according to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office.
An Airbus factory in Mobile, Alabama, depends on imported components to build the company’s top-selling A320 family jets, which are also made in Europe and China. Airbus plans to expand the U.S. site to build the smaller A220 as orders increase from customers such as Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and JetBlue Airways Corp.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing U.S. carriers, said tariffs on jetliners and aircraft parts would hurt the aviation industry and the broader economy.
Faury echoed that view, saying the imposition of tariffs “will increase prices, it will have an impact on the cost of travel.’’ Airbus’s planes typically source about 40% of their parts from the U.S., he said.
In a separate WTO case, the EU claimed that Boeing (NYSE:BA) benefited from illegal subsidies, including from the state of Washington. That case is likely to conclude next year.
Faury said Airbus would continued to push for a negotiated settlement between the U.S. and the EU.
“We think it’s still possible,’’ he said."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said on Thursday it would buy a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) for $1.9 billion, creating a major new airline partnership and ending the Chilean carrier's ties with American Airlines.
The surprise deal with Latin America's largest carrier will give Delta a much bigger footprint in the region, a key growth market in which LATAM flies to dozens of destinations including cities in Argentina, Peru and Brazil.
The LATAM deal is Delta's largest since it merged with Northwest Airlines a decade ago.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), which has long been the leading U.S. carrier in the region and was pursuing a deeper route alliance with LATAM, said the loss of its Chilean partner would not have a significant impact on its financial results.
American added that its LATAM partnership had limited upside after the Chilean Supreme Court struck down the two carriers' plans for further route cooperation that would have also involved oneworld alliance members British Airways and Iberia.
""This is a body blow for American, but not a lethal body blow. It means that Delta will have more access to Latin America than it did before, but American already has much of that in its back pocket,"" independent aviation analyst Mike Boyd said.
Following its tie-up with Delta, LATAM will exit oneworld and pursue route options with Delta and its partner Grupo  Aeromexico  (MX:AEROMEX), which belong to the rival SkyTeam alliance. It has not, however, decided whether to officially join SkyTeam.
Oneworld said LATAM had advised it would leave the alliance in ""due course"" in line with contractual requirements, without naming a specific date.
Airlines increasingly have bilateral codeshare arrangements outside major alliances. Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN), a oneworld member, said it would retain its codeshare partnership with LATAM despite the Chilean carrier's departure from the alliance.
DELTA PARTNERSHIP
As a result of the deal, Delta will sell its stake in Brazil's largest airline Gol (SA:GOLL4), a LATAM rival.
Delta does not expect regulatory obstacles for its tie-up with LATAM, where it will gain representation on the board of directors. The plan envisions growth for both carriers, which currently overlap on only one route, Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters.
""I think it's a great fit,"" he said.
Atlanta-based Delta expects the LATAM deal to be accretive to earnings per share over the next two years and add $1 billion in revenue growth over five years, Bastian said.
Delta is using newly issued debt and available cash for the deal. It will also provide LATAM with an additional $350 million to help it transition out of oneworld and plug into Delta's network.
The two can start code-sharing before they receive government, regulatory and anti-trust approval for the larger tie-up, a process Bastian said he expects to take between 12 and 24 months.
Delta will also acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM and assume LATAM's commitment to purchase another 10 A350s to be delivered between 2020 and 2025 for an undisclosed sum.
Apart from its stake in Grupo Aeromexico, Delta also has holdings in Air France KLM (PA:AIRF), China Eastern (SS:600115), Virgin Atlantic and Korean Air Lines Co's (KS:003490) parent company.
It has also been negotiating a 10% stake in Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] as part of its strategy to boost its international presence through equity investments.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2019 10:26PM ET</span>","GM reverses, will pay for striking union workers' health insurance; major issues remain","DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Thursday it will pay for the health insurance of its striking hourly workers, reversing a decision to push the costs onto the United Auto Workers union as officials on both sides said major issues remain to be resolved.
No agreement was expected Thursday even as talks were continuing and could continue into the weekend, UAW and GM officials said. 
Because of the complex nature of shifting health care coverage costs, GM said Thursday that UAW members' coverage had never lapsed.
""Given the confusion around what was happening, we chose to work with our providers to ensure that the benefits would remain fully in place,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain said.
The UAW had accused GM of blindsiding its members with the decision to drop coverage during the strike, and some workers had claimed they could not pay their medical bills as a result. The union seized on this issue to rally public and political support for the 48,000 striking workers. 
""There is no doubt that public sentiment sees these actions of GM as a shameful act,"" Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the GM department, said on Thursday in a letter to GM that the union released publicly.
UAW members went on strike at GM on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker's profit and protection of their healthcare benefits. GM immediately shifted responsibility for the health insurance to the union's strike fund.
GM officials had previously indicated that the decision on health insurance had been telegraphed to the union well before the strike and no worker had lacked coverage thanks to the UAW strike fund. 
The strike is costing GM about $100 million a day, analysts said. 
The walkout - the longest autoworker strike in nearly 30 years - has become a political event, attracting the attention of Democratic presidential hopefuls, who have been visiting the striking workers on the picket lines. 
The Democratic candidates have echoed the striking workers in saying GM employees deserve fair treatment from the Detroit automaker they helped get through bankruptcy, and several criticized GM for its previous decision to stop paying for the workers' health insurance.
People familiar with the talks said progress has been made, but the two sides are still grappling with issues over pay and job security of newer and temporary workers. The sides were still meeting late on Thursday. 

GM shares closed up 1.4% at $37.61 on Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday won dismissal of an investor lawsuit accusing them of deceiving investors about the likely impact of a privacy breach on its stock price, though the investors will be have a chance to refile their case.
U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California said the investors had failed to allege that Facebook or its executives knowingly made false statements that led to investor losses.
Facebook and lawyers for the investors could not immediately be reached for comment.
The class action lawsuit, which was consolidated from several investor complaints filed since last year, also targeted Facebook chief organization officer Sheryl Sandberg and chief financial officer David Wehner.
The investors focus on a privacy breach, first reported in December 2015, that allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, to access data for an estimated 87 million Facebook users.
In March 2018, multiple media outlets reported that Facebook was still allowing third parties to access user data, and that data from the Cambridge Analytica breach had been used in connection with U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign. The reports caused the company's stock price to drop more than 18 percent in two weeks.
In July 2018, Facebook's stock price dropped sharply again, by nearly 19 percent, immediately after the company revealed in its quarterly earnings report that growth in the number of active users was slowing and total revenues was declining.
The investors claimed in their lawsuit that Facebook and its executives made dozens of statements downplaying the effect that the Cambridge Analytica leak and related user privacy issues would have on its stock price.
Davila, however, said Thursday that they had failed to identify specific instances of the company or its executives knowingly making false statements. He noted that some were forward-looking predictions and others were general expressions of optimism, which generally cannot be the basis for securities fraud lawsuits.
The judge gave the investors until Oct. 26 to file a new version of their complaint, saying it was ""possible plaintiffs can cure their allegations by alleging, among other things, more particular facts as to why statements by the individual defendants were false when made.""

Facebook is separately facing a nationwide lawsuit from users seeking to hold the company liable under various state and federal laws for allowing third parties, including Cambrdige Analytica, to access their data.

Gaynor, FEMA's deputy administrator, had been acting chief of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.
The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since March, when Brock Long left the post. Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
A different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.
Gaynor's nomination to the post was expected. He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.
Before becoming FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine, the White House said."

China has been cracking down on financial risk and its firms are dogged by accusations of account manipulation, ranging from maintaining two sets of accounts to avoid taxation to falsifying sales.
Under the rules published on the Ministry of Finance's official website, if money set aside for loss provision is more than twice that of regulatory requirements, the firm could be attempting to hide profits.
The loss provisioning ratio currently should be 150%.
The amount of tax a firm pays and also dividends paid to shareholders is linked to the profit it reports.

The United States was granted approval this month to impose tariffs on European Union goods with an annual trade value of around $7.5 billion, over illegal government support for the European planemaker.
""We think a trade war on aviation will be a lose-lose game,” Faury told reporters in Montreal. ""We continue to advocate for a settlement on this topic and we think it's still possible."" 
Tariffs, he warned, would raise costs on planes ordered by carriers at a specific price years ago. 
The World Trade Organization has found that both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) received billions of dollars of subsidies in a pair of cases marking the world’s largest ever corporate trade dispute. Both sides have threatened tariffs after the Geneva body found neither adhered fully to its findings.
Washington sought permission to impose tariffs up to 100% on European goods worth $11.2 billion a year. Those include aircraft and aerospace parts from Airbus host nations - Britain, France, Germany and Spain - as well a range of goods including wine, cheese and luxury goods from across the EU.
Roughly 40% of an Airbus aircraft is U.S. content, Faury said.
The company operates a final assembly line for its narrowbody planes in Alabama.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Passengers commuting to or from Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports by taxi or ride-hail service will have to pay additional fees beginning in October 2020, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said on Thursday.
The fees will hit ride-hail companies such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) harder than the city's traditional taxi industry, which for years has called on regulators to rein in the app-based competitors.
According to the new rules, taxi riders will be charged $1.25 per airport pick-up from next October, increasing to $1.75 in 2022. 
Individual app-based rides with Uber and Lyft will be taxed $2.50 for rides both originating and ending at an airport.
Pooled or shared rides, in which multiple passengers are picked up along the route, will be charged $1.25 for each pick-up and drop-off. Lyft and Uber both offer pool options to their customers, a segment in which they have competition from Via, a New York-based company specializing in shared rides.
The decision comes just months after New York City implemented a congestion surcharge and passed additional regulations aimed at boosting ride-hail drivers' pay and easing congestion in central Manhattan.
Thursday's airport fee approval puts the region on par with the rest of the country, where most large airport operators charge pickup fees for taxis and ride-shares.
The Port Authority, in its public agenda for Thursday's meeting, said the fees were necessary to upgrade rail and airport infrastructure, including the construction of a new terminal at Newark.
""More than virtually anywhere else in the United States, the shared prosperity and continued vitality of the New York/New Jersey region depends on our public transportation infrastructure functioning, and functioning well,"" the Authority said.
Uber on Thursday said the fee structure will have a disproportionate negative impact on New Yorkers who do not live in central Manhattan and do not have easy access to taxicabs.
""We support the Port Authority's goal of improving the customer experience, but are disappointed that they've decided to punish Uber riders by charging them three times more in fees than taxis round trip,"" the company said in a statement.
Lyft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ride-share company Via welcomed the distinction between pooled and private vehicles, saying in a statement that incentivizing multi-passenger rides over single-occupancy vehicles was in line with New York's and New Jersey's ambitious climate goals.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) failed to adequately consider how pilots respond to cockpit emergencies in its 737 MAX safety assessment and may need to make changes to flight deck alerts, pilot procedures and training, the National Transportation Safety Board said.
The U.S. air accident investigator unveiled on Thursday several recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) following the fatal crashes of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX five months apart that killed a total of 346 people. The crashes led to the plane's grounding and raised questions about the FAA's certification of the new aircraft.
The crews in those crashes ""did not react in the ways Boeing and the FAA assumed they would,” said NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt, adding there was a ""gap between the assumptions used to certify the MAX and the real-world experiences of these crews, where pilots were faced with multiple alarms and alerts at the same time.""
Boeing has said the feeding of erroneous Angle of Attack (AOA) data to a system called MCAS that pushed the planes lower was a common link in two wider chains of events leading to the crashes. MCAS stands for Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. 
""We want FAA to ensure that Boeing takes a close look at all these different failure conditions that can activate MCAS and ensure that they have evaluated the pilots' response to that,"" Dana Schulze, director of the NTSB Office of Aviation Safety, told reporters. NTSB wants that assessment completed before the plane's grounding is lifted.
Boeing's 737 MAX simulator tests with test pilots ""did not look at all potential flight deck alerts and indications that pilots might face when this specific failure condition occurred in Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines,"" Schulze said, adding that Boeing did not evaluate the ""actual scenario"" of the two fatal crashes in the simulator.
Boeing should ""more clearly and concisely inform pilots of the highest priority actions when multiple flight deck alerts and indications are present,"" the NTSB said.
U.S. House of Representatives Transportation Committee chairman Peter DeFazio said on Thursday that the NTSB report suggests Boeing ""may not have made realistic assumptions about how pilots respond to multiple simultaneous and potentially confusing warnings in emergency situations.""
""Commercial airplanes should be able to be safely flown by an appropriately-trained pilot on his or her worst day,"" DeFazio added.
The FAA said in a statement it ""will carefully review these and all other recommendations as we continue our review of the proposed changes to the Boeing 737 MAX.""
Boeing, in a statement, said it is ""committed to working with the FAA in reviewing the NTSB recommendations.""
'WAKE-UP CALL'
Robert Clifford, the lead lawyer for families of victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash who are suing Boeing, said the recommendations should be ""a wake-up call"" for the FAA ""to put these measures into effect as soon as possible.""
The NTSB said the FAA should address assumptions Boeing and other manufacturers make in designing software systems to react to emergencies, and whether the systems should be revised to account for varying pilot reactions to cockpit alarms and alerts.
The safety board also said the FAA should develop ""robust tools and methods"" to validate assumptions about pilot response. 
Boeing is revising the 737 MAX software to require the MCAS system to receive input from both AOA sensors, and has added additional safeguards.
The report came a day after Boeing's board said it had created a new permanent safety committee to oversee development, manufacturing and operation of its aircraft and services.
The NTSB said it was not analyzing pilot actions in the two fatal crashes and that the recommendations were not a reflection on the pilots in those crashes.
Boeing's 737 MAX safety system assessments assumed ""immediate and appropriate pilot corrective actions in response to uncommanded flight control inputs, from systems such as MCAS,"" the NTSB said. It should take into account how other possible flight deck alerts and other factors could impact pilots' decision making and makes changes as warranted, the agency added.
The NTSB said it wants the FAA to require the same assessment for all other airplane manufacturers and believes other international regulators that certify airplanes should consider making the same changes.
It is not clear when Boeing will conduct a key certification test flight, a step needed before the FAA can return the plane to service. The company has said it hopes to resume flights early in the fourth quarter.

The FAA said last week it will need a month after the test flight is completed before it could allow flights to resume.

Shares tumbled on all the news coverage of the Trump whistleblower controversy and the potential for impeachment. But a rebound began because of strength in housing stocks and a forecast from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) that third-quarter production might reach 100,000 vehicles for the first time.
The S&P 500 ended off 7 points, or 0.24%, after falling as many as 22 points. The Dow Jones industrials fell 0.3%. The index had been down as many as 166 points and, with the S&P 500, briefly went positive. But late selling starting around 3:30 p.m. PM pushed the indexes lower.
The Nasdaq Composite was the weakest link, down 0.6%. Small-cap stocks were especially weak.
The S&P 500 suffered its third loss in five days and finished below 3,000 for a fifth straight trading day.
The malaise in stocks is continuing largely because of trade jitters and the impeachment threat swirling around President Trump. With Thursday's close, the S&P 500 is 1.66% below its July peak. The Dow is down 1.85%, and the Nasdaq is off 3.7%. 
But a profit warning from cruise-line giant Carnival (NYSE:CCL) on Thursday made investors look at the slowing economies in Europe as well. Carnival's cruise ships operate around the world, and the company noted depressed bookings in the latter half of this year and into next, with economic malaise making Europe the weakest part of their business. Carnival shares fell 8.6% on Thursday and are down 10.9% for the year and 34.5% since a September 2018 peak.
Housing stocks were nearly all higher thanks to reports this week of strong new home sales and buyer interest responding to lower mortgage rates. At least five hit 52-week highs, including DR Horton (NYSE:DHI), PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) and KBHome (NYSE:KBH).
Housing-related stocks like Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) and Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) also moved higher.
Interest-rate sensitive stocks, including commercial real estate developers, utilities stocks and consumer staples stocks led the market as interest rates moved lower.
Energy, communications services and healthcare stocks were weaker. Health-insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) shares fell more than 3% and subtracted 45 points from the Dow by itself. The shares are down 13.5% on the year, the third-worst performer among the 30 Dow stocks. 
 
The 10-Year Treasury yield was 1.704%, down from Wednesday's 1.732%.
Tech stocks were mixed, however. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was modestly higher, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lower.
Meanwhile, Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), which went public at $29 late Wednesday, slumped 11.2% on its first day of trading. The slump disappointed IPO bulls who had hoped it would break a streak of weak opening trading days for highly visible companies going public. 
After the close, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported that talent-representation company Endeavor pulled its expected IPO, with sources telling both that the IPO was attracting weak demand.
After hours, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares added to the late-day gloom with an earnings and revenue beat for its fiscal-fourth quarter but weak guidance for the first quarter. Shares were off 4.4% after hours after falling 1.7% in regular trading. The shares are up 53% for the year, based on Thursday's close, but down nearly 25% from a 2018 peak of $64.66.
Energy shares were weak as oil prices struggled for much of the day. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 8 cents to $56.41. Brent  crude ended up 35 cents to $62.74. Gold was higher."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Thursday as the release of a whistleblower report tied to the Democrats' impeachment move against President Donald Trump kept uncertainty high, while trade comments from China's top diplomat helped to limit losses.
The S&P 500 briefly turned higher late in the session after China's state councilor and foreign minister said China was willing to buy more U.S. products. Wang Yi, in response to questions from Reuters, said the Trump administration had shown goodwill by waiving tariffs on many Chinese products.
Earlier in the day, the released whistleblower report alleged that Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. election, but that the White House also tried to ""lock down"" evidence about that conduct. The report is seen as central to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.
The impeachment push has added to recent market volatility.
For the market, ""whether it turns into something more comes down to how consumers respond. Without that, it's likely short- term volatility and not much else,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. 
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) was among the biggest drags on the S&P 500, dropping 1.5% after a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of the social media company.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 79.59 points, or 0.3%, to 26,891.12, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 7.25 points, or 0.24%, to 2,977.62 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 46.72 points, or 0.58%, to 8,030.66.

Shares of fitness startup  Peloton Interactive Inc  (O:PTON) fell 11.2% in their market debut.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 112 new lows.

(Reuters) - Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc, the fitness startup known for on-demand workout programs on its exercise bikes, slid as much as 7% in their market debut on Thursday, indicating that investors are becoming increasingly skeptical of money-losing startups.
The New York-based company's shares opened at $27.00, down from its initial public offering price of $29.00 that raised about $1.16 billion at a valuation of $8.1 billion.
The listing comes on the heels of an underwhelming debut by teeth alignment firm SmileDirectClub Inc and office sharing company WeWork pushing back its highly anticipated stock market debut on valuation concerns.
Ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) also went public earlier this year with high expectations, but their shares have tumbled since then, after investor concerns over their steep losses.
Investors and experts tracking recent IPOs said several startups thinking of going public in the next 12-18 months would be extremely wary of the recent backlash against loss-making firms and may end up staying private longer.
""Companies will start prioritizing what the market is telling them they're worth in the secondary market,"" said Andrea Lamari Walne, a Silicon Valley-based partner at merchant bank Manhattan Venture Partners.
In secondary markets, investors buy and sell shares of a private company among themselves.
""Companies are taking a very hard look at secondary transactions as an indicator of the possible performance leading into whatever form of public company they're going to be,"" she added.
Founded in 2012, Peloton sells indoor exercise bicycles and offers packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home.
The company was most recently valued at $4.15 billion, according to data provider PitchBook.
Peloton said it plans to use funds from the offering to run its operations, invest in marketing and acquire new technologies.
For the year ended June 30, Peloton's revenue more than doubled to $915 million. However, its net loss widened to $195.6 million from $47.9 million a year earlier.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P. Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) are the lead underwriters for the Peloton IPO."

Shares of the state-controlled bank slumped the most since its 2015 initial public offiering and its bonds fell after the Dutch prosecutor opened a criminal probe into its alleged failures to check on clients and report suspicious transactions.
The Dutch probe adds to a series of money-laundering cases that have engulfed lenders, highlighting weaknesses in the region’s efforts to fight the flow of illicit funds. Only this week, the former head of Danske Bank in Estonia, the unit at the center of a $220 billion money-laundering scandal, was found dead on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Germany’s  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) received a visit from law enforcement officials over its role in the scandal.
ABN Amro said in July said that it needs to review all of its 5 million retail clients after receiving a warning from the Dutch central bank. It took a 114 million-euro ($125 million) provision for the checks in the second quarter, after already setting aside 85 million euros at the end of last year for stepping up financial crime prevention in commercial banking and the credit card business.
The bank said at the time that sanctions may be imposed by the authorities but said it hadn’t made a provision for a possible fine as the “amount cannot be estimated at this time.”
Increased compliance costs and possible penalties add to the headwinds confronting European banks. Negative interest rates, lackluster economies, and Brexit are already taking a toll on profitability, forcing more lenders forcing the lenders to pass rising costs on to customers.
“There’s so much uncertainty for the shareholders now,” said KBW analyst Jean-Pierre Lambert by phone. “The big question is whether there’s actual money laundering involved in this case. That’s what the prosecutor’s investigation probably is trying to find out.”
ABN Amro’s Dutch rival,  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV, paid a record fine last year and acknowledged “serious shortcomings” in its efforts to prevent financial crime.
ABN Amro dropped as much as 14% in Amsterdam trading and was down 13% at 16.25 euros as of 3:16 p.m. The Dutch bank’s Additional Tier 1 bonds fell the most in six months following news of the probe.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“It’s impossible to estimate the extent of any wrong-doing at this stage. The lender took a 114 million-euro provision in 2Q, after the Dutch central bank required it to review all domestic retail clients under customer due diligence requirements, so it has already begun addressing the issue.
-- Philip Richards, BI banking analystTo read the commentary, click here
The investigation and the resulting share price drop may make it harder for the Dutch government -- which still owns 56% after a bailout in 2009 -- to sell off the rest of its stake as it pledged to do during the bank’s IPO. Meanwhile, the bank is still looking for a new chief executive officer after Kees van Dijkhuizen announced in June that he will leave when his term ends in April.
Following the ING fine and the central bank’s criticism, the largest Dutch banks have been stepping up compliance spending, including adding more staff to their crime prevention teams. Earlier this month, five of the country’s largest lenders said they are exploring a system to jointly monitor transactions in the fight against money laundering after the government pledged to clear legal hurdles that might prevent them from doing so.
“With the low interest rates and a looming recession, the banking sector is already in a very difficult position,” said Mediobanca analyst Robin van den Broek. “The money laundering issue comes on top of that. And I don’t think ABN Amro is the only one in Europe with these problems.”

The bank, partly owned by the German government after a bailout, is undertaking the strategy overhaul after its attempt to merge with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) failed. 
It also said on Thursday that board member Bettina Orlopp would succeed Stephan Engels as chief financial officer, while Sabine Schmittroth would become board member responsible for human resources.
""Over the course of 2019, the market environment has continued to deteriorate further. This has been particularly evident in the corporate clients business,"" Commerzbank said, explaining the downgrade in its revenue expectations. 
The supervisory board also approved plans to sell a stake in the bank's Polish subsidiary mBank (WA:MBK) and absorb its Comdirect online brokerage unit.
The lender flagged the strategic overhaul last week. 
The measures were approved by the board during a two-day meeting.
Among the plans, the bank will cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in ""strategic areas"", so the group headcount will fall in total by about 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce. It now employs about 40,700 people.
Commerzbank said the strategy would involve investment of 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion), with 750 million euros going into new technology and the rest earmarked for restructuring.
Germany's banks have been battling a legacy of bad debts, bloated workforces and fines a decade after the global financial crash. Commerzbank had already been reducing staff and is trying to cut back-office work to restore profitability.
Its restructuring plan is negative for the German lender's credit rating, ratings agency Moody's has said.

The agency said plans to sell mBank would ""further limit the bank's growth potential given that mBank meaningfully contributed to the group's revenue and profits, and its growth"".

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The parent of Dunkin' Donuts was sued on Thursday by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who accused the chain of failing to protect hundreds of thousands of customers whose accounts were targeted in a series of ""brute force"" cyberattacks.
James said Dunkin' Brands Group Inc did nothing in 2015 to protect 19,715 customers whose accounts had been targeted in a single five-day period, after learning about the problem from its own app developer.
She said the Canton, Massachusetts-based company failed to notify affected customers of the breaches, reset their passwords or freeze their Dunkin' Donuts cards.
James also said Dunkin' failed to adopt appropriate safeguards to limit future attacks, despite customer reports of continuing fraud on their accounts.
That failure came to roost in late 2018 when more than 300,000 customer accounts were accessed in new attacks, James said in the lawsuit, which concerns accounts created through Dunkin's website or free mobile app.
""Dunkin’ failed to protect the security of its customers,” James said in a statement. ""Dunkin' sat idly by, putting customers at risk.""
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
James' lawsuit filed in a New York state court in Manhattan seeks civil fines, restitution and other remedies for alleged violations of state consumer protection and business laws.

""Dunkin's representation to consumers that it used reasonable safeguards to protect consumers' personal information, and the company's statements concerning the 2018 breach, were false and misleading,"" the complaint said.

The holiday season, which includes Black Friday, Christmas and New Year, is the busiest time of the year for retailers and brings in a majority of their total sales.
A Gap spokeswoman said total seasonal hiring is lower this year to give current employees the opportunity to pick up more hours.
Hiring plans often indicate sales expectations of retailers and come against the backdrop of a softening retail environment and a prolonged U.S.-China trade war that has threatened to increase costs for retailers.
Big-box retailer  Target  Corp (N:TGT) said earlier this month that it planned to hire more than 130,000 store employees for the holiday season, a roughly 8% rise from last year, but much lower than the 20% increase in 2018 and a 43% jump in 2017.
Retail jobs contracted for a seventh straight month in August to hit their lowest since January 2016, which hinted at softer U.S. consumer spending going into the Christmas season.
Gap said on Thursday it would host a one-day event on Oct. 5 at all its stores, as well as select distribution and customer centers across the United States and Canada to hire as many as 5,000 work associates as part of the holiday hiring plan.
Shares of the company were down about 2% in afternoon trading."
1235,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2019 01:51PM ET</span>",Column: U.S. Democrats have wisely moved to the left on ideas for Social Security reform,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
Just a few years ago, Democratic politicians were debating whether to accept cuts to Social Security benefits. No more: the only Social Security reform debate within the party is about how much benefits should be expanded - and how to pay for it.
The shift is a smart political move, considering that large majorities of Americans support maintaining or expanding Social Security benefits, even if it means paying more taxes. More importantly, it is smart policy at a time when many workers are unable to save for retirement and traditional pensions are waning.
Just how far has the Democratic Party moved on this issue? Consider the recent history. In 2010, a bipartisan commission appointed by President Barack Obama recommended cutting benefits through higher retirement ages and a less generous annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). And the following year, Obama agreed to a less generous COLA as part of a “grand bargain” with Republicans to curb federal spending.
None of that ever became law - but the proposals did spark a counteroffensive by progressives, launched in 2013 (https://reut.rs/2kZNbdF), that has been gaining momentum ever since. Progressives aim to shore up Social Security solvency not through benefit cuts but by implementing new taxes - and they want to respond to rising retirement insecurity by expanding benefits.
Among the five top-polling candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, four support expansion of some type: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris. One candidate, Pete Buttigieg, opposes any cuts to benefits.
Meanwhile, reform legislation is now advancing in the U.S. House of Representatives. The only real differences among the various plans are over how much to expand benefits and how to fund the reforms.
The first task of any reform bill will be to restore the long-range solvency of Social Security. The program’s actuaries project that the combined retirement and disability trust funds will be depleted in 2035, with payroll taxes coming in at that time sufficient to pay only 80% of promised benefits. 
The bill advancing in the House - sponsored by Representative John Larson, a Connecticut Democrat - would restore the program’s financial solvency for the next 75 years. Addressing solvency not only avoids those devastating benefit cuts, but would go a long way to address the worries expressed by Americans over the financial health of Social Security. According to Gallup, 67% of Americans worry about Social Security. (https:// Larson also proposes a modest across-the-board benefit increase equal to about 2% of the average benefit (about $30 per month), and shifting to a more generous annual cost-of-living adjustment formula more sensitive to medical inflation and other costs disproportionately affecting older adults. The bill would also increase the special minimum benefit paid to low-income retirees.
The Social Security 2100 Act would use two funding mechanisms to pay for the changes. First, it would increase payroll tax rates by 0.1 percentage point annually through 2043, reaching 14.8% for that year and later, split between workers and employers. Workers now pay 6.2% of earnings, and employers pay a matching amount, up to $132,900, where the tax is capped. Larson also would increase taxes on the wealthy, by resuming payroll tax collections on earnings over $400,000.
PROGRESSIVES BACK BIGGER INCREASES
Meanwhile, candidates Sanders and Warren both have proposals that not only deal with solvency but include more substantial benefit hikes than the House bill.
Expansion makes good political sense. Among current workers, 42% worry that they will not receive any Social Security benefit in the future, and 74% support reforms that do not reduce benefits, according to the Pew Research Center (https://pewrsr.ch/2kSgsaa).
And the policy argument is straightforward. Just 51% of workers say they expect workplace retirement savings will be a major source of income in retirement, according to a survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI). Likewise, just 41% of retirees tell EBRI that they rely on a defined benefit pension as a major source of income - a figure that is expected to fall further in the years ahead.
Meanwhile, Social Security benefits not only are modest - they are inadequate for anyone relying on the program as a primary source of retirement security. “The goal of the program is to ensure basic economic security, but right now benefits are too low,” said Nancy Altman, who heads up Social Security Works, one of the key advocacy groups that has pushed for expansion.
Most financial planners say retirees should aim to replace 70 to 80% of their working income when they retire. Yet a worker with career-averaged earnings of $50,000 who claims benefits this year at full retirement age would receive just over $20,000, or 40% of pre-retirement benefits.
Sanders would boost benefits across the board; for low-income workers, this would translate to a bit more than $100 per month. The bill also would adopt the more generous CPI-E index of inflation as the measure of annual COLAs. It would improve the special minimum benefit for low-income workers by increasing and indexing it to be equal to 125% of the poverty line.
Warren jolted the presidential race a bit when she announced her plan earlier this month (https:// She proposes a larger benefit expansion - $200 a month across the board. Like Sanders, she would adopt the CPI-E, and she also calls for a new credit in the benefit formula for family caregivers. This provision would be especially beneficial for women, who tend to bear caregiving responsibilities disproportionately. Caregiving is a key reason that women tend to work fewer years than men, and it depresses their career earnings. In turn, that reduces their income from Social Security, pensions and savings.
Sanders and Warren also take a more progressive tack than does Larson in funding their plans. Both forego any broad increase in payroll tax rates, instead proposing to increase taxes only for wealthy households.
Warren would impose a 14.8% Social Security contribution requirement on individual wages above $250,000, split between employees and employers. She also would create a new 14.8% tax on investment income for individuals earning more than that amount.
Sanders would apply the current payroll tax rate to wages over $250,000 and apply a 6.2% tax on investment income.
Campaign trail pressure from Warren and Sanders could help get the Larson bill to a vote on the floor of the House this fall. That would have the positive effect of getting Republican House members on the record, argues Altman.
“Until recently, Republicans have been able to get by saying they want to save Social Security, and that they want to see a bipartisan solution,"" she said. ""A vote on the 2100 Act will mean that they can’t keep hiding on the issue.”

Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 530 cases and seven deaths due to severe lung illnesses.
U.S. public health officials have been investigating these illnesses, but have not linked it to any specific e-cigarette product.
As of Sept. 24, the confirmed deaths were reported in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, and Oregon, the CDC said.
The House of Representatives began public hearings about the illness this week while Massachusetts imposed a four-month ban on sales of all vaping products, including those used for tobacco and marijuana, which is legal in the state.
Investigators have, however, pointed to vaping oils containing marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or vitamin E acetate, a substance used in some THC products, as a possible cause of these illnesses.
The increased scrutiny also prompted leading e-cigarette maker Juul Labs to suspend all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the United States and bring in a longtime  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc executive as its CEO.
Altria owns a 35% stake in Juul.
Public health officials have advised consumers to quit vaping and urged those who continue using the devices to avoid buying such products on the street, using marijuana-derived oil with the products or modifying a store-bought vape product."

The so-called “testing-the-waters” rule, which currently only applies to smaller firms preparing to go public, will now be extended to all prospective issuers hoping to gauge broader market interest before filing registration statements for initial public offerings (IPOs), the SEC said.
The move, which the agency's commissioners unanimously voted to approve on Wednesday, is part of a broader push by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to make it easier for companies to go public, amid worries that a 50 percent decline in U.S. listings over the past two decades is hurting investors.
""This benefits all investors - issuers can better identify information that is important to investors and enhance the ability to conduct a successful registered offering,"" Clayton said in a statement.
C. Wallace Dewitt, senior counsel at Allen & Overy LLP said that expanding the ‘testing-the-waters’ coverage to all issuers made good sense.
""There is simply no reason to force issuers to fly blind while incurring the heavy costs associated with an offering,"" he said, adding that it was heartening to see the Commission implementing recommendations in the Treasury’s October 2017 capital markets report - a checklist of how President Donald Trump's administration would like to see the agency perform.
But not all market participants cheered the move.
""By the SEC’s own admission, it proposed and adopted the rule without any concrete understanding of whether it will actually promote capital formation or pose a threat to investors,"" said Dennis Kelleher, President and Chief Executive Officer of Washington-based investor advocacy group Better Markets.
The markets regulator also unanimously voted on Thursday to ease its rules for approving low-risk exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in what could potentially be a major win for the $3.5 trillion market.
ETFs are hybrid investment products that trade on an exchange like a stock or closed-end fund.
The agency said the rule change would allow companies that sell ETFs to launch simple, straightforward funds without first seeking approval from the regulator, boosting competition and innovation.
Dozens of ETF companies currently operate under different requirements in a complex system they say has inadvertently allowed some firms to gain a competitive advantage.
There will be a one-year transition period for the amended rule.
""ETFs are one of the most successful and popular financial innovations in recent years, and the SEC’s new rule signifies an important step in the evolution of these funds,"" said Paul Schott Stevens, President and CEO of the Washington-based Investment Company Institute."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has amassed a stake in  Mobile Mini  Inc (O:MINI), the biggest U.S. provider of portable storage containers for businesses, and is pushing it to merge with WillScot Corp (O:WSC), the largest U.S. vendor of mobile office trailers, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
WillScot has made an offer for Mobile Mini that values it in the mid-to-high $30-per-share range, which would be funded for the most part by using WillScot shares as currency, sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
Mobile Mini shares were trading up 5% at $36.42 before news of Elliott's involvement, giving the company a market value of $1.6 billion. WillScot shares were up 4% at $16.23, giving it a market value of $1.9 billion.
Elliott, which has pursued changes at some of the biggest U.S. companies, including AT&T Inc (N:T) and eBay Inc (O:EBAY), believes that a combination with WillScot is the best transaction available to Mobile Mini, the sources said.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Mobile Mini is also considering alternative transactions, including acquiring the U.S. assets of mobile storage company  General Finance  Corp (O:GFN), should the latter divest its Australian portable buildings and storage container business Royal Wolf Holdings.
There is no certainty that WillScot will successfully negotiate a deal with Mobile Mini, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. The sources did not give details on the size of Elliott's stake in Mobile Mini.
Elliott, Mobile Mini and WillScot declined to comment.
Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, WillScot has a fleet of approximately 160,000 modular space and portable storage units. Private equity firm TDR Capital LLP is a major investor.
Mobile Mini, based in Phoenix, Arizona, has a rental fleet of about 198,000 storage containers and office units, as well 12,700 liquid and solid containment units and pumps that it also rents out.
Besides Elliott, The Donerail Group, an investment firm led by former activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP executive William Wyatt, has built a stake in Mobile Mini to push it to explore a sale, Reuters reported earlier this month.
Beyond Royal Wolf, General Finance owns Lone Star Tank Rental Inc and Pac-Van, providers of portable storage, office and liquid storage tank containers, mobile offices and modular buildings. It is based in Pasadena, California, and has a market capitalization of $280 million."

VENICE, Italy (Reuters) - Loan recoveries are falling short of expectations in a number of Italian bad debt securitizations, including a record deal by bailed-out Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) whose performance has weakened further in the past six months, Moody's said.
Italian banks have offloaded 170 billion euros ($186 billion) in bad loans in recent years, often repackaging them as securities in deals that made use of a complex guarantee scheme introduced by the state to ease disposals.
Lower-than-expected collections increase the risk of potential losses for investors in such deals, and may eventually leave Italian taxpayers on the hook were the guarantee scheme to kick in.
In a bi-annual report on the European bad loan securitization market released on Thursday, Moody's said that nine out of 14 Italian bad loan securitizations examined in the study lagged behind initial projections in terms of the proportion of loans that had been recovered.
""Italian servicers are generally recovering at a slower pace than they initially expected,"" Moody's said, adding it would closely monitor the underperforming deals to see if the difficulties could be a blip or a more lasting issue.
The agency said the slow start may be linked to the complexities of uploading the huge mass of data which collectors need to have access to in order to try to recover the debts.
Moody's said most of the underperforming deals were faring better compared to March, when a similar report was published, with the exception of Monte dei Paschi's 24-billion euro bad loan securitization sale and a 1.4 billion euro deal completed in 2017 by regional lender Creval (MI:PCVI).
The 2018 'Siena' deal, Italy's biggest such transaction so far, was a key plank of the Tuscan bank's 2017 state bailout.
To help its lenders comply with supervisory demands to shed the legacy of a brutal recession, Italy in 2016 launched a scheme that allowed lenders to buy a guarantee from the state to wrap the least risky notes in sales of bad debts repackaged as securities.
Some 62 billion euros in bad loans have been sold so far under the scheme, leaving the state exposed on 11.7 billion euro worth of notes.
In Monte dei Paschi's case, the state provided its guarantee on notes worth 2.9 billion euros out of a total of 4.3 billion euros in debt issued to finance the purchase of the 24 billion euro bad loan portfolio from the bank.
Moody's said estimated recoveries on the Siena deal stood at 1.64 billion euros against a business plan projection of 1.93 billion, pointing to a 15% underperformance. The Creval deal is underperforming its business plan by 28%, the report showed.
That compares with an aggregate performance of the 14 deals which is broadly in line with expectations, Moody's analyst Michelangelo Margaria said."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has chosen SMBC Nikko Securities as a bookrunner for its initial public offering (IPO), the first Japanese financial firm to grab a role in the mega deal, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Aramco has hired over a dozen banks including U.S. and European banks to manage its IPO as it seeks to tap a wider global investor base for a potential $20 billion local listing in Riyadh of around 1% of the company's shares.
The selection of a Japanese financial player comes amid speculation about Tokyo being a possible overseas destination for the Aramco listing.
 Japan Exchange Group  (T:8697), owner of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has contacted Saudi Aramco for a possible meeting with company officials, who are planning to visit Japan in October, Japan's Jiji Press quoted CEO Akira Kiyota as saying.
A spokesman at SMBC Nikko Securities, the brokerage unit of Japanese lender  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group (T:8316) declined to comment. Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Saudi officials have not chosen an overseas destination for the listing, which is expected to be the next phase of the $100 billion share sale after the domestic leg on Tadawul bourse.
The listing is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil, attract foreign investments and create jobs.
Reuters earlier reported that Aramco has approached Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Singapore's GIC and other sovereign wealth funds to invest in the domestic leg of the oil giant's listing at it seeks to achieve a $2 trillion valuation."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Scores of local government officials from 31 U.S. states pressured McDonald's Corp's (N:MCD) on Thursday to do a better job of protecting workers from groping, obscene comments and other forms of sexual harassment, adding their voices to an employee-led campaign that has seen walkouts at several stores.
In a letter to CEO Steve Easterbrook, 115 mayors, commissioners, city councilors and school board members asked McDonald's to meet with workers, hear their stories and together craft tougher policies to effectively stamp out harassment. 
The officials are part of a advocacy network called Local Progress. 
Members of the U.S. Congress have written similar letters and employees have ratcheted up pressure on McDonald's at a time that the chain and other fast food restaurants have struggled to find and retain enough staff.
The letter said McDonald's employees have filed more than 50 sexual harassment complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Reuters could not verify this because EEOC complaints are not public.
When asked to comment on the letter, McDonald's referred Reuters to its Aug. 28 statement announcing a new training program for safe workplaces, which has support from more than 2,000 franchisees.
""Together with our franchisees, we have a responsibility to take action on this issue and are committed to promoting positive change,"" said Chris Kempczinski, McDonald's USA president. ""These actions are one more step we are taking to raise awareness at all levels of McDonald's that will transfer both inside and outside the workplace.""
Workers and those organizing them are trying to pressure McDonald's, the largest U.S. restaurant chain by sales, to boost wages and address violence and harassment problems at its roughly 14,000 U.S. locations, most of them independently owned.
On Tuesday, workers at a Los Angeles McDonald's walked off the job to protest, saying retaliation for reporting sexual harassment is rampant and they have been excluded from policy discussions, according to organizers and news reports - one of several similar protest in the last year and a half.
Last year, McDonald's started working with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in the country, to improve its policies. 

McDonald's August announcement was for an even broader program focused on mitigating violence, harassment, bias and bullying, to start in October.

PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States has been granted approval to impose tariffs on European Union goods with an annual trade value around $7.5 billion over illegal government support for European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR), people familiar with the matter said.
The decision brings the transatlantic trade powers closer to a tit-for-tat tariff war in the aircraft industry after a 15-year-old dispute at the World Trade Organization, although some analysts believe it will be settled without a trade fight.
The WTO has found that both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) received billions of dollars of subsidies in a pair of cases marking the world's largest ever corporate trade dispute. Both sides have threatened tariffs after the Geneva body found neither adhered fully to its findings. 
Washington sought permission to impose tariffs up to 100% on European goods worth $11.2 billion a year. Those include aircraft and aerospace parts from Airbus host nations - Britain, France, Germany and Spain - as well a range of goods including wine, cheese and luxury goods from across the EU.
The scope of the tariffs depends on an arbitration tribunal expected to announce both a value and a methodology next week.
The people said the tribunal had approved U.S. tariffs on goods with an annual trade value of around $7.5 billion - lower than the U.S. request, which is typical in such cases, but still what one person close to the case called a significant amount.
Bloomberg News reported the figure close to $8 billion.
None of the governments or companies agreed to comment.
Washington has drawn up a list of goods worth a total of $25 billion from to choose items to target if it goes ahead with the tariffs.
One person close to the case said Washington was likely to go ahead, opening a new front in global trade tensions, after informal overtures from both sides failed to end deadlock.
The EU cannot retaliate immediately to any tariffs as it did following what it considered to the United States' unlawful imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in 2018.
Its counter-case at the WTO against U.S. support for Boeing, in which it seeks about $10 billion in tariffs, is not expected to reach the same stage for six months - meaning Washington is free to fire the first shot in any potential tariff war.
One option being mooted on the EU side is to use an existing war chest of retaliation left over from an earlier case.
In 2002, the WTO granted the EU the right to hit $4 billion of U.S. imports in a dispute over U.S. tax breaks for sales of exported goods. The two sides reached a settlement in 2006, ending the sanctions and notifying the WTO of their agreement. However, U.S. compliance was never formally tested at the WTO.
The U.S. would contest such a move, sources said.
The EU has also moved to reopen hearings on whether it complied with previous WTO findings, but U.S. sources insist all the procedures on that case have been exhausted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel sent letters to four e-cigarette companies asking them to stop all print, broadcast and digital advertising of their products in the United States, the same day as market-leader Juul said it would pull its ads, the panel said on Thursday.
The panel's request comes amid an outbreak of lung illnesses across the United States associated with vaping. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged people to stop using e-cigarette or vaping products.
""I am writing today to respectfully, but strongly, request your company to do the same,"" Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on economic and consumer policy, wrote on Wednesday to Fontem Ventures, Japan Tobacco International Inc, Reynolds American Inc (NYSE:RAI) and NJOY LLC.
E-cigarettes, which heat a liquid often containing nicotine to create an inhalable vapor, have been popular in the United States for around a decade. Manufacturers have faced criticism that too many children use vaping products.
Fontem Ventures, which makes Blu e-cigarettes, said in a statement it agrees that children should not use vaping products and that it supports initiatives to prevent youth access to its products. Reynolds American said in a statement it is giving the letter ""careful consideration."" Japan Tobacco and NJOY did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Claims that products are healthier or safer than traditional cigarettes must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Krishnamoorthi said.
Juul, which dominates the e-cigarette market and which  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) has a 35 percent stake in, said on Wednesday it would suspend its advertising and replace its chief executive.
The Trump administration has announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarette products from the market in the United States amid concerns that flavors like mint and mango attract children to the products."

The world's largest burger chain joins Tim Hortons, KFC and Dunkin' Brands in moving ahead with versions of a plant-based addition to their menus using Beyond Meat's patties.
Shares of Beyond Meat, which have roughly tripled in value since the company's listing on the stock market in May, surged 17% in early trading, while those of McDonald's were up marginally.
The new PLT sandwich, which the company said was without artificial colors, flavors or preservatives, will be priced at C$6.49 plus tax and will be sold in 28 restaurants in southwestern Ontario, Canada from Monday.
Beyond Meat, one of the pioneers of plant-based meat substitutes, is competing fiercely with Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods for dominance of the plant-based meat market, which  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts say is expected to explode, growing to an estimated $140 billion over the next 10 years.
McDonald's already sells vegan burgers in some European countries. It joined hands with Nestle to launch the ""Big Vegan TS"" plant-based burger in Germany and ""The Big Vegan"" burger in Israel. It also offers the ""McVegan"" burger in Sweden.
""A lot of people have been asking McDonald's if they are going to do this. I do think to offer the consumer another option is nice, but again, it remains to be seen on what the uptake is,"" said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones.
Yarbrough pointed to Tim Horton's, owned by Canada's Restaurant Brands International
McDonald's said the 12-week test would allow it learn more about real-world implications of serving the PLT, including customer demand and impact on restaurant operations.
Separately, Nestle on Thursday launched its ""Awesome"" vegan burger patties in the United States. The company already sells vegan burgers in several European countries under the Garden Gourmet brand."

(Reuters) - The U.S. judge overseeing nationwide litigation over the opioid epidemic on Thursday refused to disqualify himself, after major pharmacies and drug distributors said he was biased against them and pressing too hard for a costly settlement.
Calling the opioid epidemic ""one of the greatest tragedies of our time,"" U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland admitted he had been ""very active"" in encouraging a settlement but said he was ""confident that no reasonable person can legitimately question my impartiality.""
He also said addressing the epidemic should be the job of the government's executive and legislative branches but ""these are not ordinary times,"" and that not settling could overwhelm the courts and drive ""most"" of the defendants into bankruptcy.
""It is important for our citizens to know what I am doing and to have confidence that the judicial branch is up to the task,"" Polster wrote. ""The moving defendants complain that I have had a 'personal mission' from the start of the case. That is true, but it does not suggest any bias or partiality.""
Polster oversees more than 2,000 lawsuits by state and local municipalities over opioids, including a bellwether trial by Ohio's Cuyahoga and Summit counties scheduled for October 21.
The companies that sought Polster's disqualification included the retailers CVS Health Corp (N:CVS),  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT), and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH),  Henry Schein  Inc (O:HSIC) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK).
Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers representing the counties had no immediate comment.
The request for Polster's disqualification followed a series of rulings by him in the counties' favor, including that they could try to show that various corporate defendants created a public nuisance.
Opioid addiction claimed roughly 400,000 lives in the United States form 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The companies had argued that Polster tipped his hand beginning as early as January 2018 when the litigation that they would have to foot the bill for the epidemic.
They have also said the potential costs could be enormous, saying the plaintiffs in the Ohio case were seeking $8 billion in cash to cover fallout.
Polster, however, said the main point of his public comments was to show that the judiciary was ""up to the task"" of addressing the crisis, whether through fairly-negotiated settlements or fairly-fought litigation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) will begin supplying wings for its F-16 combat jets from a facility in southern India from next year, a senior executive said on Thursday.
Lockheed is bidding for a contract, estimated at more than $15 billion, to supply the Indian Air Force with 114 combat planes and has offered to shift its F-16 production line from the United States to India.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is pushing a Make-in-India program under which it wants global firms, including in the defense sector, to set up manufacturing centers in India to build a domestic industrial base and create jobs.
Vivek Lall, vice president of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said the wings of all future F-16s that the company will sell worldwide will be produced in a joint venture with India's Tata Advanced Systems in the southern city of Hyderabad.
""The first wing prototype is being built now. The expectation is we will begin supplying by next year sometime, this will be the sole facility for future F-16 wing production,"" Lall told Reuters.
Lockheed is competing for the Indian air force contract with Boeing (N:BA), which has pitched its F/A-18 Super Hornet, as well as Sweden’s Saab (ST:SAABb) with its Gripen fighter. France’s Dassault (PA:AVMD) Systemes SE’s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also in the fray.
The air force needs new fighter jets to replace its aging fleet of Russian MiG planes. But Indian defense procurement is a lengthy process.
The government's insistence on local manufacture and reduced reliance on expensive imports has delayed decision-making further as foreign firms search for local partners and suppliers.
Lall said Lockheed was already producing the empennage of its C-130J transport aircraft from the Hyderabad facility and also cabins for its Sikorsky helicopters. There were 500 people each involved in two joint ventures set up for the production of the empennage and the cabin.
""We have been doing make-in-India for years now,"" he said. The company has said if it sets up a local production base for the F-16 it will also provide maintenance, repair and spares for the combat jet flying with air forces around the world.
Lall said that with 3,000 F-16s flying around the world and more orders being negotiated with countries such as Bahrain, Lockheed estimated there was a market worth $165 billion for after-sales support.
""It is a huge potential business, India will be plugging into the world's largest fighter jet ecosystem."""

BANJUL (Reuters) - Fatou Jallow borrowed money this year to spruce up her beachside restaurant in Gambia, expecting the usual winter droves of European tourists keen to sample her hearty stews and spicy West African rice dishes.
Then Monday's news hit: Thomas Cook Group (L:TCG), the travel operator that brought around 40% of Gambia's annual visitors seeking sun and white-sand beaches, had collapsed and was cancelling all future flights and hotel bookings. 
The fallout is global, with tourists and tourist destinations affected in North America, Europe, India and Africa. 
But few countries fear the impact like Gambia, mainland Africa's smallest country whose locals make most of their money in the tourist season, which is just about to begin.
""When I heard the news, I nearly collapsed,"" said Jallow, who employs a dozen people at her restaurant in Kololi, a seaside resort town on the Atlantic coast, just outside the capital Banjul.
""Tourism is my life.""
Tourism accounts for 30% of GDP in the former British colony, which has been a popular destination for Europeans since the 1960s. 
The industry has been a key driver behind Gambia's recovery from an economic slump in 2016-17 and the economy had been forecast to grow 5.4% this year. 
Optimism has been on the rise since the end in 2017 of former president Yahya Jammeh's despotic 23-year rule during which he plundered the state's modest coffers. 
Now, workers in the industry, from hotel managers to tour guides, fear more tough times are ahead.
""Many tourists have canceled their bookings in my hotel,"" said Sidi Colley, who manages a complex of bungalows bordering a palm-fringed private beach.
The business had been planning to increase its staff to 60 for the high season - which runs from October to April - from 22 workers currently, but this will not happen if tourists do not come, he said.
Around 57,000 British customers had already booked hotels or seats on charter flights for the upcoming season, according to the national hotel association. This equates to around a quarter of all tourists to Gambia during the whole of last year.
It is not clear how those who booked via Thomas Cook will now make the trip. The government plans to ask other airlines and travel companies to roll out more services to make up for the operator's collapse, Tourism Minister Hamat Bah told journalists on Monday.
""It was a great shock to learn [about] their bankruptcy,"" he said.
Vendors at the Senegambia craft market said they had taken out loans ahead of the tourist season to boost their stocks of traditional instruments, wood carvings and jewelry.
""We borrowed a lot of money. If the government will not intervene to invite other tour operators, it will be catastrophic,"" said Ndey Jeng, who sells a range of dyed cloth at the market.

""Since the announcement of the collapse I cannot eat well, I cannot sleep.""

As the anniversary of 2018’s market carnage approaches, investors wonder whether they should fear an encore of the panic that wiped out as much as $2.1 trillion from the European benchmark, fueled by higher rates and growth concerns. At first glance, things couldn’t be more different: the European Central Bank has just boosted stimulus measures and investors aren’t expecting a U.S. recession until at least next year.
But this week’s release of disappointing economic data in France and Germany came as a sharp and unpleasant wake-up call for the fans of equities that have returned a whopping 19% this year. The seriousness of the slowdown makes investors doubt the potency of the ECB measures without the support of individual nations’ fiscal stimulus. An escalation in the U.K. political crisis and the start of an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump aren’t helping sentiment either.
“Our concerns have increased while euro-zone stocks have outperformed -- not an attractive mix,” said Lars Kreckel, global equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management, which is underweight euro-zone equities versus the U.S. “Recession risk remains uncomfortably high for the euro zone.”
The impact from continuing trade tensions and a global slowdown are taking their toll on Europe. Business expectations in Germany fell to the lowest in a decade this month and the slump in manufacturing pushed the region’s largest economy closer to recession.
Fund managers are echoing the concerns of the departing ECB President Mario Draghi that governments need to join the central bank’s measures in supporting the economy. According to the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) survey, an expansion in German public spending outranks even a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve in its importance to fueling gains in risk assets.
So far, there’s little sign of imminent action, with Chancellor Angela Merkel saying that the problem isn’t a shortage of money for investment. This could break the winning streak for the Stoxx Europe 600, says Edward Park of Brooks Macdonald Asset Management.
“One of the greatest risks to European equities is that the weak manufacturing data is not enough to encourage a fiscal response from Germany,” said Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald, which is underweight European stocks. “If this is the case and markets fear a further downturn in business activity, the fourth quarter could be challenging for European risk assets.”
Ironically enough, the market’s already pessimistic stance on European stocks could serve as a cushion to possible end-of-the-year downside. Funds focused on the region’s equities have lost $97 billion in outflows this year alone and, based on the Bank of America survey, are the least popular assets globally. Plus, strategist cuts to European earnings growth expectations have exceeded upgrades almost every month of this year.
“We don’t expect a repeat of a spectacular drawdown because earnings expectations have come down substantially over the last 12 months, i.e. quite a bit of bad news is discounted,” said Themis Themistocleous, head of the European Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, which is underweight euro-zone equities. “Nevertheless, we expect European stocks to struggle in the fourth quarter amid ongoing earnings downgrades and slowing economic growth.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 12% in the final quarter of 2018, the worst decline since 2011, and spent most of this year making up for this dramatic loss. It is now enjoying the best gain for the first nine months of the year since 2009. Valuations in 2019 have rebounded from December lows, but remain below historical averages.
Equities were up 0.8% on Thursday after Trump, facing an impeachment inquiry, said a trade agreement with China is getting “closer and closer” and there’s a “good chance” a deal can be reached.
As they approach the fourth quarter, fund managers are confronted by the dilemma of risking losing this year’s stellar returns or missing out on further gains if they sell too early. Even such devoted fans of equities as Ken Adams of Aberdeen Standard Investments say the outlook is particularly uncertain at the moment.
“Our overall stance is positive, but only modestly so,” said Adams, the global head of multi-asset strategy at Aberdeen. “My advice over the next three months is to maintain some dry powder in case something unexpected happens. That’s certainly worthwhile in this environment because the crystal ball is especially clouded at the moment.”

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) will weed out some potential suitors for its elevator unit within the next two weeks, two people familiar with the matter said, as the closely-watched auction gathers pace regardless of the planned ousting of CEO Guido Kerkhoff.
Bidders invited to the next round will likely include private equity groups KKR (N:KKR), Blackstone (N:BX), CVC (CVC.UL) and Clayton Dubilier & Rice as well as strategic firms Kone (HE:KNEBV) and Hitachi (T:6501), one of the sources said.
A consortium consisting of private equity firms Advent and Cinven (CINV.UL) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world's third-biggest sovereign wealth fund, is also expected to be included, the people said.
They are among the groups to receive so-called information memorandums, which include a more detailed profile of Thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology (ET), the group's most profitable division, the people said.
""It will be a larger group of bidders who will get the information packages,"" one of the people said. Tentative bids are due at the end of October before bidders can advance to the final round, the people said.
All parties declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.
Thyssenkrupp shares were up 2.2% at 1258 GMT.
Kone's CEO Henrik Ehrnrooth has previously said he's keen on a deal, saying ET and Kone would be a perfect match.
The sale of ET, which analysts have valued at up to 17 billion euros ($18.6 billion), will be the most pressing job for Martina Merz, who will drop her chairwoman role in favor of the CEO job to speed up the process.
Options range from a full or partial sale of the division to a combination with a peer, most likely Finland's Kone, with Thyssenkrupp ending up owning a minority in the combined entity, people familiar with the matter have said.
A full sale of ET would likely draw opposition from labor representatives, according to people familiar with the matter, a substantial hurdle as they control half of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board.
Merz's move to become CEO, announced late on Tuesday, shows the ongoing challenges Thyssenkrupp faces in attracting external candidates for the job after the steel-to-submarines group suffered a drastic loss of confidence among investors.
Since activist fund Elliott announced it had taken a stake in the group in May 2018, a move which was followed by a chain of events that included the resignation of top management, Thyssenkrupp shares have fallen by 45%.
It leaves Merz, who enjoys the confidence of Thyssenkrupp's two largest shareholders, Cevian and the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation, taking on one of the most challenging jobs in corporate Europe.
Her appointment, which would make her Thyssenkrupp's first female CEO, must be approved by the supervisory board at an extraordinary meeting which sources said could take place as soon as this weekend, not ruling out a delay into next week."

LONDON (Reuters) - Positive noises from China on U.S. trade talks lifted European stocks and Wall Street futures on Thursday and snuffed out a modest rally in safe-haven assets that had dominated in Asia.
Europe's main bourses had initially stuttered but muscled 0.7% higher after China said it was in close communication with Washington and preparing to make progress in upcoming trade talks. (EU)
U.S. President Donald Trump had stoked trade hopes on Wednesday when he told reporters the two sides were having ""good conversations"" and that an agreement ""could happen sooner than you think"".
The euro hitting a 28-month low also helped euro zone bond markets as traders chewed over the third German resignation from the European Central Bank's board since 2011.
It had amplified doubts around the sustainability of the bank's aggressive stimulus measures -- Germany, France and the Netherlands have all voiced criticism -- but after a brief early wobble, bond yields went 1-2 basis points lower.,,. 
The major currencies barely budged either, having become largely inured to the constant toing and froing of the more-than year-long trade war.
Just on Tuesday, Trump had sharply criticized China in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, where he said he would not accept a ""bad deal"".
""I think the trade talks will take years if it ever has a solution,"" Makor Capital Markets strategist, Stéphane Barbier de la Serre, said.

The biggest currency riser of the day was the New Zealand dollar, which climbed 0.6% to $0.6305 after the head of the country's central bank said it was unlikely to need unconventional stimulus measures.
Elsewhere in Asia-Pacific, the Philippines joined the army of global central banks that have cut interest rates this month, with a 25 basis point trim to 4%. Mexico is expected to slice its 8% rate by a similar amount later too. 
Much of the rest of Asia had lacked clear direction. MSCI's broadest regional index and Japan's Nikkei both ended fractionally higher helped by a limited trade deal between Japan and the United States..

1266,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 26, 2019 08:11AM ET</span>",ABN Amro Dirty Money Probe Piles Pain on Europe's Troubled Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- A new money-laundering scandal, this time at Dutch lender ABN Amro Bank NV, adds yet another burden to European banks already struggling to improve profitability amid negative interest rates and lackluster economies.
State-controlled ABN Amro disclosed a criminal probe over alleged failures to check on clients and report suspicious transactions, joining an ever-growing list of European lenders under investigation for similar shortcomings.
The broadening scandal puts even more pressure on a European banking industry hit by negative rates, which force them to pay to park their money overnight at the European Central Bank. That’s eating into profits and forcing the lenders to pass rising costs on to customers. The probes have also exposed weaknesses in the region’s efforts to fight the flow of illicit funds and prompted calls for better regulation on a Europe-wide basis.
“With the low interest rates and a looming recession, the banking sector is already in a very difficult position,” said Mediobanca analyst Robin van den Broek. “The money laundering issue comes on top of that. And I don’t think ABN Amro is the only one in Europe with these problems.”
The Dutch prosecutor’s office disclosed the ABN Amro probe on Thursday. The bank said separately that it faces an investigation under the Dutch anti-money laundering and terrorist-financing law, without providing further detail.
Shares Plunge
ABN Amro dropped as much as 10.6% in Amsterdam trading, the most since June 2016, and was down 10.2% at 16.25 euros as of 12:54 p.m. That’s below the 17.75-euro share price from its initial public offering in November 2015. The Dutch bank’s Additional Tier 1 bonds fell the most in six months following news of the probe.
“There’s so much uncertainty for the shareholders now,” said KBW analyst Jean-Pierre Lambert by phone. “The big question is whether there’s actual money laundering involved in this case. That’s what the prosecutor’s investigation probably is trying to find out.”
The money-laundering scandal keeps spreading. On Tuesday, Germany’s  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) received a visit from law enforcement officials over its role in a $220 billion money-laundering scandal, centered around Danske Bank A/S’s branch in Estonia. This week, the former head of the Estonia business was found dead after disappearing from his home on Monday.
ABN said in July said that it needs to review all of its 5 million retail clients after receiving a warning from the Dutch central bank. ABN Amro took a 114 million-euro ($125 million) provision for the checks in the second quarter, after already setting aside 85 million euros at the end of last year for stepping up financial crime prevention in commercial banking and the credit card business.
ABN Amro’s Dutch rival  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV paid a record fine last year and acknowledged “serious shortcomings” in its efforts to prevent financial crime.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“It’s impossible to estimate the extent of any wrong-doing at this stage. The lender took a 114 million-euro provision in 2Q, after the Dutch central bank required it to review all domestic retail clients under customer due diligence requirements, so it has already begun addressing the issue.
-- Philip Richards, BI banking analystTo read the commentary, click here
The bank said at the time that sanctions may be imposed by the authorities but said it hasn’t made a provision for a possible fine as the “amount cannot be estimated at this time.”
The investigation and the resulting share price drop may make it harder for the Dutch government -- which still owns 56% after a bailout in 2009 -- to sell off the rest of its stake as it pledged to do during the bank’s IPO. Meanwhile, the bank is still looking for a new chief executive officer after Kees van Dijkhuizen announced in June that he will leave when his term ends in April.
Following the ING fine and the central bank’s criticism, the largest Dutch banks have been stepping up compliance spending, including adding more staff to their crime prevention teams. Earlier this month, five of the country’s largest lenders said they are exploring a system to jointly monitor transactions in the fight against money laundering after the government pledged to clear legal hurdles that might prevent them from doing so."

The stock suffered a blow on Thursday after the company revised down its full-year revenue forecast and earnings expectations, citing a deterioration in the U.S. vaping market. That follows underwhelming results in May, when first-half sales for next-generation products missed analysts’ expectations.
Imperial Brands shares have lost about a third of their value since reaching a 12-month high in November, a few days after the U.K. maker of Blu vaping devices announced additional investment in its next-generation products, which have been touted as a future driver of growth.
“The category remains unprofitable but management expect it to reach breakeven in 2020, which we believe is unlikely,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts including Sanath Sudarsan wrote in a note. “Imperial provided little comfort on the underlying business model.”"

Osborne, a retail industry veteran with more than two decades of experience, will join Ted Baker ""at a date to be agreed within the next few months"", the company said in a statement and published after Debenhams announced her departure.
Debenhams said its current Group Finance Director Mike Hazell, who has been with the company for nearly a decade, would replace Osborne. She is leaving at a time the group is going through a restructuring under company voluntary arrangement.
Osbourne is set to join Ted Baker's C-suite after its founder Ray Kelvin infamously stepped down in March as chief executive officer following claims that he presided over a culture of ""forced hugging"".
UK retailers are battling severe challenges on Britain's high streets with shoppers tightening their purse strings amid Brexit uncertainties, while competition from online rivals and higher costs also take their toll.
On the back of those struggles, Ted Baker posted its first drop in annual profit since the 2008 financial crisis in March this year. In April, administrators were appointed to assist Debenhams through its restructuring.

LONDON/DUBAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - State-owned Saudi Aramco has approached Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Singapore's GIC and other sovereign wealth funds to invest in the domestic leg of the oil giant's listing at it seeks to achieve a $2 trillion valuation, sources said.
After initial conversations in recent months between Saudi Arabia and governments in the Gulf and Asia, approaches to their sovereign wealth funds have started via the banks appointed to handle Aramco's initial public offering (IPO), the sources said.
A meeting between Aramco's management and a team from Abu Dhabi's ADIA, the world's third-biggest sovereign wealth fund, was set up for October, one of the sources told Reuters.
A second source confirmed the approach to ADIA, while two other sources said GIC had been approached.
All the sources who spoke to Reuters asked to be anonymous as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
Abu Dhabi's state investor Mubadala Investment Co, which has $229 billion under management, has also been approached by Aramco's advisers, two sources said.
One of the sources said the approaches were still at an early stage and some of the funds had yet to study the proposals before deciding whether to invest.
Among Gulf investors, Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat was expected to consider investing in the IPO, another source said.
ADIA and Mubadala declined to comment, while Aramco and Mumtalakat did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The approaches to sovereign funds in countries on friendly terms with Saudi Arabia and wealthy Saudi families indicate bankers aimed to build an investor base to achieve the $2 trillion valuation targeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The listing is the centerpiece of the crown prince's plan to shake up the Saudi economy and diversify away from oil.
The talks show work on the IPO process is still proceeding despite uncertainty over the timeline following a Sept. 14 attack on Aramco's facilities.
LOFTY TARGETS
To achieve the $2 trillion valuation, Aramco needs the initial listing of a 1% stake on the Saudi market to raise at least $20 billion. To beat the record for the world's biggest IPO, it needs to top Alibaba's sale of $25 billion of shares. 
But bankers and company insiders have described the valuation as ambitious, due to a weak outlook for oil prices as deepening climate change activism could dampen investor interest, particularly in the Western world.
A further risk to the $2 trillion target was raised by the Sept. 14 strikes that knocked out more than half the production of the world's top oil exporting nation. Saudi Arabia has been assuring investors it can quickly restore output.
Various sources said the kingdom has been busy looking for a more sympathetic investor base in the Middle East and Asia, while also seeking support from the wealthiest Saudi families.
""It is a natural fit and many in the region would look at it favorably as they want a piece of the pie,"" a Gulf source said.
Preparations for the IPO have gone through various stages since the 2016 announcement.
Issues of governance and disclosure, the acquisition of a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE:2010), disagreements among Saudi officials and advisers over the choice of an international listing venue, all contributed to a temporary halt last year.
Bankers from around 20 international and domestic financial institutions are now working on the company's plan to sell 1% in Riyadh before an international sale in 2020 or 2021.
After securing support from sovereign funds, bankers would focus on Western institutional investors, another source said.
""There's no turning back now,"" one of the sources said, adding that Aramco was ""going ahead"" with the IPO.
One of the sources said Aramco could announce its intention to float on Oct. 20, with analysts' reports expected the same day. Analysts have been holding meetings at Aramco's headquarters in Dhahran this week."

ELVERUM, Norway (Reuters) - Norway does not plan to block China's Huawei Technologies[HWT.UL] from building the country's 5G telecoms network, cabinet minister Nikolai Astrup told Reuters, a decision that puts it at odds with NATO ally the United States.
The United States has alleged Huawei's equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese firm has repeatedly denied. U.S. firms are barred from using some of the firm's equipment and Washington is putting pressure on other countries to follow suit.
""We have a good dialogue with the companies on security, and then it is up to the companies themselves to choose suppliers. We haven't got any bans against any suppliers in Norway,"" said cabinet minister Nikolai Astrup, who spearheads the government's digital strategy.
In January then justice minister Tor Mikkel Wara said banning Huawei was under consideration.
""We share the same concerns as the United States and Britain and that is espionage on private and state actors in Norway,"" Wara told Reuters at the time.
Asked whether there could be actions taken against Huawei specifically, Wara had said: ""Yes, we are considering the steps taken in other countries, that is part of it - the steps taken in the United States and Britain.""
Wara later left the cabinet due to an unrelated matter.
TELENOR
State-controlled Telenor , Norway's largest telecoms provider, plans to pick 5G technology suppliers this year to prepare for commercial rollout in 2020.
The company, which has 182 million subscribers across eight countries in Europe and Asia, signed its first major contract with Huawei in 2009, a deal that helped pave way for the Chinese firm's global expansion.
""We are talking to everybody, everyone is in the process, and we will have to see what we choose in the end. We continue to have a good dialogue with the government,"" said Petter-Boerre Furberg, who heads Telenor's domestic operation.
""We are running a process that is open to all partners.""
Asked what would happen were Telenor to be blacklisted by the United States if it used Huawei components, Furberg replied: ""That is a purely hypothetical question.""
In Elverum, Telenor is developing what it said was Scandinavia's largest 5G pilot, using equipment provided by Ericsson (BS:ERICAs). It runs separate trials elsewhere with equipment from both Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Huawei [HWT.UL].

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>","In Michigan steel towns, tariffs meant to revive industry cost jobs","By Rajesh Kumar Singh
ECORSE/RIVER ROUGE, Michigan (Reuters) - Some steelworkers who cheered U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on foreign steel last year are now being laid off, an unintended consequence of his America First policy as United States Steel Corp (N:X) reacts to sagging demand from automakers reeling from higher steel prices.
Steel prices rallied following the tariffs imposed in March, 2018, feeding optimism in U.S. steel towns. But higher prices later hurt demand from automakers already squeezed by slowing demand for traditional gasoline-powered sedans.
Trump's tariffs still enjoy support in the Rust Belt communities that helped elect him in 2016. But U.S. Steel's layoffs, first reported by Reuters last month, demonstrate some of the risks he faces as he seeks re-election in 2020.
Steel prices peaked in May 2018 and have retreated to pre-tariff levels after American factories boosted production and demand weakened.
In June, U.S. Steel idled a blast furnace at the local Great Lakes Works plant in the cities of Ecorse and River Rouge Michigan, an electoral swing state. Two months later, the company decided to temporarily let go of 48 of employees and warned of up to 200 more layoffs by the end of September.
The Great Lakes plant, situated along the Detroit river, primarily serves the automotive industry which is largely based in Michigan. Top U.S. auto producer General Motors Co (N:GM) is closing production at three assembly plants and last year said tariffs on imported steel cost it $1 billion.
In the primary metal manufacturing industry in Wayne County, Michigan, home of Great Lakes Works and ""The Twin Steel Cities"" of Ecorse and River Rouge, employment in March was down 3.3 percent from a year earlier.
City leaders said that without the tariffs, the situation could have been worse, noting that as far back as 2002, the local plant was on the verge of closing.
""Imported steel was killing us,"" said River Rouge Mayor Michael Bowdler, who was laid off in 1981 from Great Lakes Works. ""Something had to be done,"" said Bowdler, a Democrat.
Last year, U.S. Steel restarted two blast furnaces and hired back about 800 workers at its Granite City plant in Illinois. Trump declared in front of cheering workers that U.S. Steel was ""back"".
Since March 1, 2018, U.S. Steel's shares have plunged 76% on softening steel prices and concerns about its debt-fueled investment program. The Pittsburgh-based company's reliance on to the auto sector has exacerbated the pain, and data compiled by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) shows U.S. Steel's production costs are among the world's highest.
Last week, U.S. Steel warned that falling steel prices would make its third-quarter loss steeper than expected. It said the blast furnace at the Great Lakes Works plant will remain idled through at least the end of the year.
It has proposed a $600 million investment to upgrade Great Lakes Works and make it more efficient, a commitment local officials called encouraging. But U.S. Steel wants a tax break from Ecorse and River Rouge to carry out the investment, which will not create new jobs.
It has negotiated a similar tax deal in Gary, Indiana.
DEMOCRATIC CONUNDRUM
News of temporary layoffs at Great Lakes Works spurred criticism of Trump's trade policies from Democrats including presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke and Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib.
But widespread support for tariffs from members of both parties in manufacturing communities has made it difficult for Democratic candidates to campaign with a distinctive message in swing states like Michigan, which Trump won by less than 11,000 votes in 2016.
A majority of manufacturing workers surveyed in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll had a favorable view of Trump's policies concerning them.
""We wouldn't have the demises of some of these industries, had we done this 30-40 years ago,"" said James Perry, executive director at the Downriver Community Conference (DCC) which runs retraining programs for laid-off workers in Southeast Michigan.
U.S. Steel is the largest employer in the two cities and among the biggest sources of revenues.
The steelmaker accounts for a third of Ecorse's revenues. City officials are also eyeing another $100,000 in new revenues from the company's proposed investment at Great Lakes Works. That is a lifeline for the city of 9,600 residents, which until two years ago was battling a financial emergency and was run by a state-appointed emergency manager.
The city of River Rouge, which was under Michigan's financial oversight for six years, gets 60% of its revenues from U.S. Steel and DTE Energy. But the Detroit-based energy company has announced to close its River Rogue plant in 2021.
In Ecorse, U.S. Steel runs internship and job shadowing programs for students and pays for the city's annual fireworks.
In December 2008, the plant was shut for nine months, with more than 2,000 lay-offs that in turn hurt restaurants and retailers in River Rouge, aggravating the city's fiscal crisis.
When the plant reopened, Bowdler said, excited residents came out in hordes to watch thick clouds of white smoke billowing from its chimneys. Some city officials had tears in their eyes, he said.
The latest layoffs are a blow to employees and families. A laid-off worker from the Great Lakes works said the unemployment benefits of up to $362 a week were not enough to pay her bills.
""You can't survive on that,"" Perry agreed."

A slowing global economy, unresolved U.S.-China trade tensions and the threat of a hard Brexit are among factors denting the appeal of riskier assets such as global equities, according to Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research in New York.
It’s “time to play defense,” Rajadhyaksha wrote in a note Thursday. “Investors should use the September equity rebound and bond market sell-off as a chance to reduce some risk.”
A bond market rally from the U.S. to Australia has stalled this month, as some global economic data steadied and worst-case outcomes for events like the trade war and Brexit failed to materialize. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries have risen over 20 basis points to 1.7% and the S&P 500 Index has risen 2% and the MSCI All-Country World Index is up 2.2%.
Rajadhyaksha didn’t go entirely risk-off, however.
“This is not a call to lock in negative yields in Germany and Japan,” he said, “but to overweight higher yielding fixed income, such as emerging-market dollar debt, U.S. corporate debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities etc.”
Barclays also recommends “going down the credit curve in the U.S. and Europe,” according to the note. “Underpinning this view is our belief that the 2019 bond rally is here to stay, given rock-bottom inflation expectations and a slowing global economy,” Rajadhyaksha said."

1279,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 26, 2019 05:16AM ET</span>","Fed Should Buy $250 Billion in Treasuries, Ex Officials Suggest","(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve should consider increasing its balance sheet by $250 billion over the next two quarters through outright purchases of Treasury securities to help diminish the risk of future money market turmoil, two former U.S. central bank officials said.
In a blog posting on the Peterson Institute for International Economics’ website, Joseph Gagnon and Brian Sack write that “a case can be made’’ for such a move to build up a buffer of bank reserves at the Fed.
After the purchases are completed, “the Fed should continue to grow its balance sheet as needed to expand reserves in line with nominal GDP,’’ or gross domestic product, said Gagnon, now a senior fellow at Peterson, and Sack, currently director of global economics for the D.E. Shaw Group.
Last week’s turmoil in the money markets focused attention on the level of bank reserves and whether the Fed went too far in shrinking its securities holdings. Its balance sheet now totals $3.8 trillion, down from a high of $4.5 trillion in January 2015.
New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said on Monday that policy makers will assess the implications of recent market moves “for the appropriate level of reserves and time to resume organic growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.’’
In a Sept. 23 note, Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) LLC chief economist Lou Crandall reckoned that such an organic approach would result in the Fed increasing its purchases of Treasuries by roughly $15 billion per month.
Last week’s turbulence in the repurchase agreement market indicates that the Fed’s operating framework “is not as resilient as it could be,” according to Gagnon and Sack.
“Volatility in this market threatens the functioning of markets more broadly and could ultimately hurt the economy,’’ they said.
They urged the Fed to adopt a standing fixed-rate repo facility under which banks and other selected financial institutions could borrow from the central bank, arguing that would provide a “guard rail” against unexpected market developments.
Fed policy makers discussed the possibility of establishing such a facility when they met in June, but reached no conclusions, according to the minutes of that gathering.
Gagnon and Sack also called on the central bank to abandon its federal funds rate target and adopt the repo rate -- as measured by the secured overnight financing rate –- as its objective instead.
“The Fed should be explicit about its desire to control the repo rate,” they said.
Sack was formerly an executive vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he served as the head of the Markets Group and the manager of the System Open Market Account for the Fed from 2009 to 2012.
Before joining Peterson in 2009, Gagnon was visiting associate director for the Fed’s Division of Monetary Affairs. He also served in a variety of other posts at the central bank and the Treasury Department in a public sector career that began in 1987."

JOHANNESBURG/KIGALI (Reuters) - When Volkswagen's Africa boss Thomas Schaefer set out to conquer the continent, he quickly realized he needed more than a flashy new product. He needed a new business model.
Study after study showed the same thing: there was no demand for new cars. Low purchasing power and a lack of financing put them out of the reach of most Africans, while competition from used imports gave buyers a cheaper alternative.
So Schaefer is placing a $50 million bet on a new business built around ride-hailing and car-sharing. And VW (DE:VOWG_p) is using Rwanda – a small central African nation with a growing reputation for innovation – as its laboratory.
""It was almost an industrial experiment,"" Schaefer told Reuters.
The German carmaker's project was launched with some fanfare last December in the capital Kigali but since then scant information has been disclosed about how it has progressed.
VW told Reuters the app for its ""Move"" ride-service now had over 23,000 registered users in Kigali. However only around 2,200 of those are active users - a fairly modest uptake so far in the city of 850,000 people.
In July, the ride-hailing service averaged 384 rides per day, a figure VW said it wanted to double.
It may be a longshot but, if successful, the Rwandan gamble could help plot a future course for Volkswagen, and others, in Africa's challenging auto sector by securing a foothold in the region's rapidly growing ride-hailing space.
Industry experts are divided on the merits of the plan, with some questioning whether VW can compete with the likes of Uber (N:UBER) and Bolt in Africa or, in light of those companies' losses, if it should even try.
While VW sees Kigali is an ideal test ground, offering a data sample that's statistically significant at a reasonable cost, critics say the city - where Uber and Bolt are absent - is not an accurate gauge of conditions in bigger markets.
Schaefer cautioned that the experiment was still in its early stages, adding he'd like to give the business model a two-year test run before assessing it.
""Luckily our headquarters leaves us alone. They just say, do what you need to do.""
And though it hasn't yet set a timeframe, Volkswagen told Reuters it was already looking to Ghana in West Africa and Ethiopia, a rapidly reforming market of some 100 million people, as initial targets for an expansion of its mobility business.
ADAPT TO SURVIVE
Global automakers like VW, Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Peugeot, are waking up to the potential in Africa, where incomes and consumer aspirations are rising.
But the region accounted for less than 1% of global new passenger car sales last year, making it hard to justify investing in local manufacturing and assembly.
VW's ride-hailing cars are assembled in Kigali at a new $20 million plant that also produces vehicles for the relatively few customers able to afford a brand new Polo, Passat or Teramont.
Employers can also access VWs to transport their workers, and VW plans to launch car-sharing, where customers can drive themselves and are charged for the time they've used a vehicle.
All those vehicles are owned by VW, which after a year or two of service will sell them onto the second-hand market at a price more accessible to average Rwandans. VW is also opening certified service centers.
VW hopes combining all these businesses - new car sales, ride-hailing, car-sharing, used car sales, parts and service - can make the company's investment in Rwanda worthwhile.
""If we were to focus only on selling new cars, in a few years we can close business,"" said Michaella Rugwizangoga, CEO of Volkswagen Mobility Solutions. ""We had to think bigger.""
Schaefer believes VW will eventually need around 800 cars on the road in the city for ride-hailing and sharing. The company will begin introducing its E-Golf electric vehicle into the mobility fleet next year.
FUTURE OR FAILURE?
Joseline Iradukunda quit her old job as a secretary in a law firm to go to work behind the wheel of a new Polo for VW's app-driven ride-hailing service. The 25-year-old now spends her days plying the hilly, winding streets of Kigali.
""This car works 24/7,"" she said proudly, parking near the city's beehive-shaped convention center to pick up a client, one of roughly a dozen she will transport during her shift.
Jean-Jacques Koffi, a Kigali-based entrepreneur from Ivory Coast, is a regular Move customer.
""During the week, I use it twice a day,"" he said as Iradukunda drove him to his office. ""You know it's a brand-new car. It's comfortable.""
Rwanda has already earned a reputation for innovation - from a cashless public transport system to medical drones. The city's budding IT sector allowed VW to develop its app locally.
VW's project is hailed by some as ahead of its time.
""This truly is a fantastic case study for future mobility in progressive frontier economies,"" said Martyn Davies, managing director for emerging markets at Deloitte.
But others, like Justin Coetzee - a transport engineer and founder of GoMetro, a mapping platform that allows cities to optimize transport investments - don't see a market for what VW is offering.
Most Kigali residents, he said, use existing, cheaper public transport like motor taxis and buses. Others drive themselves.
And while VW faces no direct competition in Kigali, that won't be the case in many other markets, with Uber and Bolt established in major African cities, a fact that hasn't yet translated into profits.
""No ride-sharing service is making money, even with scale. No model creates positive cash return,"" Coetzee said.
So far, the app's rating on Google's Play Store - the download platform for Android devices - trails both Uber and Bolt, while the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) version has been widely panned by iPhone users.
Despite these problems, Deloitte's Davies thinks VW has leverage that Uber and Bolt lack.
The promise of assembly plants and factory jobs, he argued, could earn the carmaker tax breaks from governments looking to industrialize along with a voice in policymaking.
""That's VW's significant competitive advantage here,"" he said."
1281,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 26, 2019 04:23AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Up Day Punctured by Big Falls in ABN, Imperial","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The stench of money-laundering is hanging over Europe’s banks again.
ABN Amro (AS:ABNd) fell 8.5% Thursday after it said Dutch prosecutors were investigating it for possible breaches of anti-money-laundering law, an investigation which reports said encompassed years of transactions by ABN clients.
That put it at the bottom of the local AEX index, on a day when most indices in Europe were enjoying an up day as they bob helplessly up and down on the tide of inconsistent news out of the U.S. and China about their trade dispute.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.7% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 1.1% and the German Dax was up 0.6%.
Domestic investors are in no mood to trust to the leniency of the authorities, who slapped ABN’s bigger rival   ING Groep   (AS:INGA) with a $900 million fine for missing years of illegal payments by its clients – a fine that also reflected the breadth of public hostility to pay levels at the top of the bank.
As a result, ABN shares are now back to within 6% of the three-year low that they hit in August.
The news comes only a day after police confirmed the death of Aivar Rehe, who had overseen the suspected laundering of over 200 billion euros through the Estonian branch of   Danske Bank   (CSE:DANSKE) between 2006 and 2015. Rehe was a witness, but not a suspect, in Estonian prosecutors’ investigations.
Danske shares have fallen by more than 60% since the scandal erupted early last year. So much bad news has now been priced into the share price that news of Rehe’s death failed to move it. 
Sub-par behavior isn’t limited to banks, of course. Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), the Swedish maker of telecoms network gear, fell 0.4% after setting aside $1 billion to cover the cost of settling historical corruption allegations. The company had warned about the potential costs some months back but had so far failed to put a price on them. The final price could be more or less than the provision announced late on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, software group   TeamViewer   (DE:TMV) got off to a labored start after its IPO in Frankfurt, the biggest tech IPO in Germany since chipmaker Infineon in 2000. The company’s shares were down 1.0% at 25.05 euros, after listing on Wednesday at a price of 26.25.
TeamViewer’s problems paled in comparison to those of tobacco giant Imperial Brands (LON:IMB), which fell 10.3% after it cut its sales forecast for this year due to “challenging” conditions for its non-traditional products. The merger of Altria (NYSE:MO) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) fell apart on Wednesday as Juul labs, the maker of vaping products in which Altria has invested heavily, lost its CEO and suspended U.S. advertising in response to a widening health scare around its products."

The plan would increase the Japanese firm's initially planned investment of $1.5 billion in WeWork as part of the agreement, giving the U.S. company the right to receive the money in April next year in exchange for Class A common stock.
SoftBank and its Saudi-backed Vision Fund are WeWork's biggest backers and have already funneled more than $10 billon into the U.S. company, including the promised $1.5 billion.
The potential new investment from SoftBank could unlock more financing options for WeWork, which is in talks for a $3 billion to $4 billion loan from a consortium of banks contingent on it raising additional capital, FT added.
A new deal would reduce the price per share at which SoftBank acquires WeWork stock, giving it a larger stake in the unprofitable property group, FT said on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter. It was unclear how renegotiations would affect the Japanese group's valuation of its investment, FT said.
WeWork declined to comment on the report. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
SoftBank invested in WeWork parent We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January, but investor skepticism led to a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion earlier this month, Reuters reported. 
The startup postponed its IPO last week, and on Tuesday, its co-founder Adam Neumann resigned as CEO, giving up the majority of his voting control after SoftBank and other shareholders turned on him.
WeWork appointed two insiders as co-CEOs and said Neumann will stay on the board as non-executive chairman.
We Company said it is evaluating the ""optimal timing"" for an IPO. 
MORE MONEY
In the run-up to the planned IPO, investors questioned WeWork's corporate governance standards, as well as the sustainability of its business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue.
The lowered valuation is a blow to SoftBank as it tries to amass $108 billion for its second Vision Fund. Reuters sources said it was likely that SoftBank would have to pony up more cash to support its biggest bet, or take a writedown in case of an IPO.
SoftBank's stock is down 8% since the beginning of this month.
The renegotiation of the warrant agreement is one of several options being considered, FT said. 

The talks are in early stages and SoftBank, led by billionaire Masayoshi Son, could decide against investing altogether, the business daily said.

The proposed plan will create two trusts, a $14.5 billion trust for compensating individual wildfire victims and an $11 billion trust for paying insurers with subrogation claims against PG&E for payments they had made after the blazes in 2017 and last year, according to the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco.
The plan will give the noteholders new debt and a controlling equity stake in a reorganized PG&E.
Subrogation allows insurers to recoup funds that they have paid to policy holders for insured losses from third parties that they hold responsible for the losses.
The committee representing the wildfire victims in PG&E's bankruptcy is supporting the noteholders' group. 
PG&E, joined by major shareholders, is opposing efforts by the noteholders to be allowed to file their reorganization plan. The company on Sept. 19 outlined its own plan that will pay $17.9 billion for wildfire claims and caps payouts to victims at $8.4 billion and to insurers at $8.5 billion.
Earlier this month, the company reached an $11 billion settlement to resolve most claims by insurance carriers related to the wildfires.

At the time of its Chapter 11 filing in January, PG&E projected it could face more than $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires, including last year's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire of California's modern history.

Investing.com - Asian equities were mixed in morning trade on Thursday. The Nikkei 225 rose after the U.S. and Japan signed a limited trade deal.
The first stage of the accord will open markets up to about $7 billion in U.S. agricultural products, U.S. President Donald Trump said at a signing ceremony with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The nations also made commitments for $40 billion worth of digital trade.
The agreement does not cover trade in autos, but Abe later said in a news conference that Trump assured him that Washington will not impose the “Section 232” tariffs on Japanese car imports.
""Between President Trump and I, myself, this has been firmly confirmed that no further, additional tariffs will be imposed,"" said Abe. ""And with the entry into force of our trade agreements, I believe both of our economies will be able to further grow and develop.""
Trump has previously complained multiple times that the U.S. automakers did not get enough access to Japan’s market.
According to a joint statement that was cited by Reuters, Japan and the U.S. said they wanted to finish their trade talks within about four months. They said that, “while faithfully implementing these agreements, both nations will refrain from taking measures against the spirit of these agreements and this joint statement.”
Reports from earlier this week suggested the U.S.-Japan talks hit a last-minute snag as Japan had wanted assurances that Trump would not impose the Section 232 tariffs.
The Nikkei 225 gained 0.3% to 22,078.50 by 10:32 PM ET (02:32 GMT).
The Sino-U.S. trade talks also seemed to have made some positive progress, as Trump said a U.S.-China trade deal could arrive sooner than expected.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Juul Labs Inc has become one the biggest bets in the portfolio of Fidelity’s $28 billion Blue Chip Growth Fund, whose exposure to the troubled e-cigarette maker has climbed to $761 million amid a regulatory backlash and departure of its top executive.
Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund's (O:FBGKX) manager Sonu Kalra had 2.7% of the giant fund's assets invested in Juul as of July 31, the latest fund disclosures show, up from 1.7% of assets a year earlier.
Although Juul remains privately held, some Fidelity funds have made a practice of taking stakes in pre-IPO companies that have paid off big when they go public.
But the tactic can also put Fidelity fund holders into volatile situations like the one at rideshare leader  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), which is trading well below its IPO price in May.
Juul is the latest example of pre-IPO drama. On Wednesday the company's CEO stepped down as merger talks between its biggest investor  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) and Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM) collapsed in the face of a regulatory backlash against vaping.
Products made by Juul and others vaporize liquid containing nicotine. While they can help people quit smoking, the company faces a U.S. ban on some products and concerns about illnesses linked to vaping. 
Flavored e-cigarettes represent 80% of Juul's sales. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's plan to pull all e-cig flavors from the market, along with bans in some markets already, have pushed Juul's valuation down to about $25 billion, from $38 billion when Altria invested in it, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
A spokesman for Boston-based Fidelity declined to comment. Fidelity's Kalra acknowledged scrutiny of Juul from regulators but wrote that ""Juul's success in penetrating the U.S. market and continuing to grow its sales and earnings supported a higher valuation for this position,"" according to a note to investors dated July 31.
Juul was in the Fidelity's fund top 10 holdings at the end of July, sandwiched between  Visa Inc  (N:V) and Salesforce.com Inc (N:CRM).
John Bonnanzio, an editor of independent newsletter Fidelity Monitor & Insight, said the Juul stake has become risky but managers may be tempted by the chance to deliver outsize returns to help beat their benchmark and rival index funds.
Some managers have decided, ""You can't beat the index without investing outside of it,"" Bonnanzio said.

Blue Chip Growth's three-year average annual return of 17.1% is better than 79% of peer large cap growth funds, according to Morningstar Inc.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Peloton Interactive Inc  (O:PTON), the U.S. fitness startup known for on-demand workout programs on its exercise bikes, on Wednesday raised $1.16 billion in its initial public offering after pricing shares at the top end of its target range. 
The IPO by Peloton, which has not turned a profit for at least the past three years, was seen by some in the market as a test of investor appetite for loss-making stocks. 
Peloton priced its IPO at $29 per share, compared to a price range of $26-$29, the company said in a statement, confirming an earlier Reuters report. 
This valued Peloton at around $8.1 billion, almost double its most recent valuation in the private market of $4.15 billion, according to data provider PitchBook.
Peloton's listing comes after teeth alignment company SmileDirectClub (O:SDC), whose $74.8 million losses like Peloton's more than doubled last year, priced its shares above its target range in its IPO. The stock tumbled on their market debut earlier this month.
Ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable, have also struggled since going public earlier this year. 
Founded in 2012, Peloton sells indoor bicycles in packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home.
For the year ended June 30, Peloton's revenue more than doubled to $915 million but net losses widened to $195.6 million from $47.9 million.
The stock is due to begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol ""PTON.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P. Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) are among the underwriters to the IPO.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 09:04PM ET</span>",How a sanctions-busting smartphone business thrives in North Korea,"By Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea is evading U.N. sanctions to cash in on soaring domestic demand for smartphones, using low-cost hardware imports to generate significant income for the regime, according to defectors, experts and an analysis of North Korean-made phones. 
Economists estimate as many as six million North Koreans - a quarter of the population - now have mobile phones, a critical tool for participating in an informal market economy that has become a key income source for many.
Reuters spoke to some 10 defectors and experts about the use of mobile devices in North Korea, as well as reviewing state media reports and advertisements for mobile devices, and examining two North Korean-branded smartphones. 
The phones feature Taiwanese semiconductors, batteries made in China and a version of Google's open-source Android operating system, analysis of the North Korean phones revealed.
United Nations sanctions imposed in 2017 https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc13141.doc.htm because of the North's weapons programs prohibit imports of mobile phone hardware. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has endorsed wireless networks, some reportedly built with the help of China's Huawei Technologies, and local mobile phone brands through public speeches and a tour to a mobile phone factory reported by state media.
BIG OUTLAY
Basic North Korean phones typically cost between $100 and $400 at state stores or private markets, experts and defectors say. Subscriptions to mobile carriers are registered at the telecom ministry's stores.
Phones are typically sold with service plans that include 200 minutes of calling time. Prepaid plans cost about $13 dollars for 100 minutes, North Korean phone advertisements show. 
While those prices are comparable to or higher than what mobile phone customers pay in other countries, North Koreans earn an average of about $100 per month, only about 4% of their southern neighbors, according to South Korean government data. 
International brands such as Apple (O:AAPL) iPhones are not publicly on sale, but traders and wealthy North Koreans can buy them outside the country and use them with local SIM cards, defectors say.
North Korean phones can only be used to call domestic numbers and have some unique security features. 
Downloading or transferring files is severely restricted. Reuters found a warning pop-up when installing an ""unidentified program"" on the Pyongyang 2418 smartphone stating: ""If you install illegal programs, your phone can malfunction or data will get destroyed.""
""North Korea puts algorithms and software in its mobile phones to keep data from being copied or transferred,"" said Lee Young-hwan, a South Korean software expert studying North Korean smartphones.
Apps such as maps, games and an English dictionary show they are developed by North Korean engineers at state-run enterprises or state universities.
The regime has also developed a home-grown surveillance tool on mobile phones, according the U.K.-based cybersecurity company Hacker House.
When a user accesses illegal or non-state approved media, an alert is generated and stored inside the phone. A modified version of Android also conducts surveillance and tracks users, Hacker House said. 
North Korea's representatives at the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment.
TOOL FOR BUSINESS
Still, the phones are a big asset in North Korea's grey market economy, which has flourished since a devastating famine in the 1990s.
One young North Korean woman surnamed Choi recalled selling two pigs and smuggling herbs from China to raise the 1,300 Chinese yuan ($183) her family needed to buy a mobile phone in 2013. 
She used the phone to help successfully run a retail business selling Chinese clothes and shampoos, arranging deliveries from wholesalers. 
“It turned out we could make a way more money than our official salaries,"" said Choi, who has since defected to South Korea, declining to give her full name for fear of retribution against relatives still in North Korea.
In a survey this year of 126 North Korean defectors who had used mobile phones, more than 90% said cellphones improved their daily lives and about half said they used them for market activities. ""Millions of people are using mobile phones and need them to make a living or show off their wealth,"" said Shin Mi-nyeo, executive director of the Organization for One Korea, a South Korean support group for defectors that conducted the poll. ""Then their phone bills create huge income for the government."" 
Kim Bong-sik, a researcher at South Korea’s Korea Information Society Development Institute, said estimating revenues was difficult, but it was likely to be one of the state's biggest earners given the scale of the business.
SANCTIONS-BUSTING
The two Pyongyang-branded smartphones examined by Reuters are powered by chips from Taiwan’s MediaTek (TW:2454) and run a version of Google’s Android operating system, along with the North Korean security software. Ads for an Arirang-branded handset also claimed to use MediaTek chips.
The Pyongyang 2423 smartphone manufactured last year featured Mediatek's MT6737 chipset and a slot for one SIM card and one memory card. The memory card's serial number showed it was produced by Japanese chip-maker Toshiba (T:6502).
The device's identification number showed the phone was manufactured by the Chinese firm Gionee, a maker of low-end smartphones.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said any hardware maker can use open-source Android software at no cost, meaning no export rules are being violated in regards to North Korean smartphones.
 Mediatek  said in a statement to Reuters it had not shipped any products to North Korea, and was in full compliance with sanctions. Toshiba also said the company had no business with North Korea.
Gionee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“North Korea cannot make phones without using foreign components and technology,"" said Kim, the researcher. ""That means it is violating sanctions to keep running the business.” 
Official customs data show North Korea imported $82 million worth of mobile phones from China in 2017, the third biggest import item after soybean oil and fabrics. 
That number dropped to zero in 2018 as sanctions bit. 
But while sanctions eliminated official imports, informal trade along the China-North Korea border appears to be ongoing, experts and defectors say. 
William Brown, a retired U.S. intelligence official who studies North Korea said mobile phone hardware parts ""are very easily smuggled across the Chinese border."" 
Intermediaries make it hard to find those responsible for breaching sanctions, he added. 
China is North Korea’s sole major ally, and its mobile phone industry is crowded with little-known local smartphone manufacturers.
Chinese officials referred questions to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which declined to comment. China has repeatedly said it upholds U.N. sanctions but has defended what it calls ""normal trade"" with North Korea.
Big Chinese telecommunications brands have previously supplied North Korea as well. 
Huawei supplied 3G network equipment to North Korea after late leader Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un, toured the Chinese tech giant in 2006, according to U.S. Nautilus Institute and monitoring group 38North.
The U.S. Commerce Department has been investigating Huawei since 2016 and is reviewing whether the company violated export control rules in relation to sanctions on North Korea, sources have said.
ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) agreed last year to pay a $1 billion fine for violating U.S. sanctions involving shipment of telecom equipment to Iran and North Korea.

Huawei and ZTE did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

BMW, Peugeot, Honda and Jaguar Land Rover all closed factories ranging from a few days to four weeks in April over concerns that Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union in March could lead to disruption, including delays to the arrival of parts.
The move led to a 44.5% decline in output in April, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and ended up being in vain as Brexit was eventually pushed back to the end of October.
August saw a small bounceback with output rising 3.3% to 92,158 cars, helped by a 15.2% increase in domestic demand, data showed.
""Today's figures mask the underlying downward trend and strengthening global headwinds facing the sector, including international trade tensions, massive technological upheaval and, in the UK, political and economic uncertainty,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
""We now need parliament and government to redouble efforts to get a deal that maintains free and frictionless trade."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted Wednesday to advance legislation that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in states where it is legal.
By a vote of 321-103, lawmakers approved the bill, which now heads to the Senate. The bill received nearly unanimous support from Democrats, as well as nearly half of all Republicans.
The measure now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain fate. Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo has said he wants to consider similar legislation in the coming months, but it is not clear if the full Senate will vote on such a measure, analysts say.
Some Republicans are wary of giving banks the green light to engage in marijuana business while it is still federally illegal. And some Democrats have said they would rather consider broader legislation around marijuana legalization or criminal justice reform rather than a targeted banking bill.
The bill clarifies that proceeds from legitimate cannabis businesses would not be considered illegal, and directs federal regulators to write up rules for how they would supervise such banking activity.
Banks have thrown their weight behind the legislation, telling lawmakers they need clarity on whether they can do business with cannabis companies where it is legal at the state level despite the fact that marijuana remains illegal in the eyes of the federal government.
""Our members are committed to serving the financial needs of their communities – including those that have voted to legalize cannabis,"" said the American Bankers Association in a letter sent to lawmakers Tuesday seeking their support.
Thirty-three states allow for some form of legal cannabis use, but banks have by and large been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related enterprises, out of concern they could run afoul of federal laws.
In particular, banks are wary that taking deposits from pot businesses could violate federal anti-money laundering laws, which in turn could put at risk their federal charters or access to federal payments systems.
That has left companies in the marijuana industry with extremely limited options, including relying on just a handful of small financial institutions or strictly doing business in cash."
1294,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 06:03PM ET</span>",GM and UAW union making progress in talks for new labor deal: sources,"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and the union that represents its 48,000 striking hourly workers in the United States have made progress in talks toward a new labor deal but are grappling with issues over the pay and job security of newer and temporary workers, two people familiar with the talks said on Wednesday.
United Auto Workers (UAW) Vice President Terry Dittes told union members in a statement issued late in the day that ""all unsettled proposals are now at the Main Table and have been presented to General Motors.
""We are awaiting their response,"" Dittes said, adding: ""This back and forth will continue until negotiations are complete.""
There are still significant issues that need to be addressed, a person briefed on the matter said. More meetings were set for the evening, but the source said no deal was expected Wednesday.
UAW members went on strike at GM on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker's profit and protection of their healthcare benefits. 
The strike has cost GM about $100 million a day, analysts said.
IHS analyst Joe Langley said at a conference on Wednesday the company could lose about 70,000 vehicles of production from a two-week strike and be challenged to make up the loss over the short term.
The walkout - the longest autoworker strike in nearly 30 years - has become a political event, attracting the attention of Democratic politicians, who have been visiting the striking workers and voicing their support.
The Democratic presidential candidates have echoed the striking workers in saying GM employees deserve fair treatment from the Detroit automaker they helped through bankruptcy. 
President Donald Trump, a Republican, convinced numerous UAW members to vote for him in 2016, helping him win Michigan, Ohio and other states. He has repeatedly demanded GM find a new vehicle for its now-shuttered assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, a key state for him in the 2020 presidential election.
GM officials have tried to counter charges that they are abandoning U.S. workers, releasing details of an offer to the UAW that included the promise of investing $7 billion in U.S. plants, annual raises in a new four-year deal, increased profit sharing and retention of existing healthcare insurance.
However, the sources familiar with the negotiations said some of the bigger remaining issues relate to how fast newer hires progress to the top UAW pay scale of about $31 an hour. Currently, it takes eight years to reach that level for newer hires and the union wants a faster ramp to the top.
Another big issue is the use of temporary workers, who have no pathway to full-time job status and few rights related to sick time or vacation days, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the talks are ongoing.

GM has said it can reduce its cost disadvantage with the international automakers in the U.S. market and safeguard union jobs by using temporary workers. The use of temps also allows Detroit automakers to cover for high rates of absenteeism among UAW workers.

(Reuters) - WillScot Corp (O:WSC), the largest U.S. provider of mobile office trailers, has made an offer to acquire  Mobile Mini  Inc (O:MINI), the biggest U.S. provider of portable storage solutions, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Were WillScot to succeed with its bid, the combination would create a modular space and portable storage powerhouse, one year after WillScot acquired Modular Space Holdings Inc, another office trailer company, for about $1.2 billion. That deal left WillScot with a $1.7 billion debt pile, almost as much as its $1.8 billion market capitalization. 
WillScot has made an offer that values Mobile Mini in the mid-to-high $30-per-share range, and would be funded for the most part by using WillScot shares as currency, the sources said.
Mobile Mini shares jumped as much as 5.2% on the news, and ended trading up 3.4% at $34.75 on Wednesday, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.6 billion. 
Negotiations between the two companies are ongoing and there is no certainty a deal will be agreed, the sources said.
Mobile Mini is also considering alternative transactions, including acquiring the U.S. assets of mobile storage company  General Finance  Corp (O:GFN), should the latter divest its Australian portable buildings and storage container business Royal Wolf Holdings, one of the sources added. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Mobile Mini declined to comment, while representatives for WillScot and General Finance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, WillScot has a fleet of approximately 160,000 modular space and portable storage units. Private equity firm TDR Capital LLP is a major investor in WillScot. 
Mobile Mini, based in Phoenix, Arizona, has a rental fleet of about 198,000 storage containers and office units, as well 12,700 liquid and solid containment units and pumps that it also rents out. 
The Donerail Group, an investment firm led by former activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP executive William Wyatt, has built a stake in Mobile Mini to push it to explore a sale, Reuters reported earlier this month.
Beyond Royal Wolf, General Finance owns Lone Star Tank Rental Inc and Pac-Van, providers of portable storage, office and liquid storage tank containers, mobile offices and modular buildings. It is based in Pasadena, California, and has a market capitalization of $280 million.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 05:03PM ET</span>",Boeing expected to testify at U.S. Senate hearing on aviation safety,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is expected to testify at an upcoming U.S. Senate Commerce Committee hearing on aviation safety, a spokeswoman for the panel said Wednesday.
The announcement came after the company's board said on Wednesday it had created a new permanent safety committee to oversee development, manufacturing and operation of its aircraft and services in the aftermath of two fatal 737 MAX crashes.
It was not clear who from Boeing will testify.
Separately, deputy Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Dan Elwell told a U.S. House committee hearing the agency currently was not seeking additional funding for safety efforts, but that could change depending on various reviews.
Both the House and Senate have proposed boosting spending on aviation safety spending but have not reached agreement. Elwell said the FAA was considering creating an innovation office.
Elwell also denied any rift between U.S. and foreign aviation regulators over the 737 MAX. ""We have to get it right and we have to get it right globally,"" Elwell said.
The committee's chairman, Senator Roger Wicker, said he was happy to see Boeing had released long-awaited recommendations and looks forward to learning more about the recommendations ""and other conclusions Boeing has made at the aviation safety hearing I plan to call very soon.""
Boeing declined to comment Wednesday.
Last week, the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee asked Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg to testify on Oct. 30 about the grounded 737 MAX involved in two deadly crashes since October 2018 that killed 346 people.
The panel’s chair, Representative Peter DeFazio, also asked John Hamilton, the chief engineer of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division, to testify. Boeing said last week it was studying the invitation.
A spokeswoman for the House panel said Wednesday no response had been received from Boeing.
Earlier this month DeFazio asked Muilenburg to make several employees available for interviews as part of a congressional probe into the design, development and certification of 737 MAX aircraft.
Boeing has said it hopes the plane can resume flights early in the fourth quarter but still has a series of steps to complete before the 737 MAX can return to service, including submitting a pre-production version of a software update, FAA chief Steve Dickson told Reuters last week.
It remains uncertain when Boeing will conduct a certification test flight, a step needed before its best-selling plane can fly again. Dickson said once that flight occurs the FAA will need a month before it can allow flights to resume unless something unforeseen arises.

Some government officials have said they do not believe Boeing will conduct the certification flight until at least mid-October. Asked if there are at least several weeks of work to be done before that flight can occur, Dickson said he thought that was a ""fair statement"" but did not want to set a specific date.

Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday moved to launch a formal inquiry into whether to impeach Trump, and indexes weakened briefly early Wednesday after the White House released a summary of a telephone call between Trump and Ukraine's president that is at the center of the inquiry.

Adding to the stronger tone, Trump said a trade deal with China could happen sooner than expected, comments that were in contrast to his harsh rhetoric the day before.
Also on the trade front, Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced initial details of an emerging trade deal between the two countries, with Trump saying it would open up Japanese markets to $7 billion worth of American products.

1301,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 03:55PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Protests Threaten Billionaires' Ties With Beijing,"(Bloomberg) -- Less than a decade ago, Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, was granted an exclusive audience with China’s then-President Hu Jintao, a rare honor. State television lauded the September 2010 meeting, saying Hu lavished praise on the tycoon for contributing to the city’s prosperity and stability.
These days, as Hong Kong reels from months of violent demonstrations, China’s government is weaving a much harsher narrative around the billionaires who dominate the business and politics of the city. In recent weeks, it’s linked them to the rising inequality it blames for the social unrest, a new stance that threatens the close ties Hong Kong dynasties have forged with Beijing.
While most of Hong Kong’s wealthiest families have sprawling property holdings, they also dominate industries from telecommunications to retail, giving them outsize influence. The 20 Hong Kong tycoons tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index -- including moguls like Li and property magnate Lee Shau Kee -- have a combined net worth of more than $200 billion. So any shift in China’s posture toward those wealthy families has the potential in coming years to ripple through the city’s $360 billion economy.
In a scathing article posted on social media earlier this month, China’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the nation’s most powerful law-enforcement body, lashed out at Hong Kong’s property tycoons for “hoarding land and grabbing money.” Next, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, said the government should take away land from Hong Kong developers through compulsory acquisition.
“It is very clear that Beijing’s attitude toward Hong Kong’s property tycoons has changed,” said Joseph Wong, who was secretary for commerce, industry and technology under the city’s former leader, or chief executive, Donald Tsang.
China appears to be encouraging state-backed enterprises to expand in Hong Kong, a special administrative region, and, over the coming years, these companies likely will play a leading role in industries the tycoons have controlled, Wong said.
China Mobile Ltd., the mainland’s biggest carrier, has increased its subscriber base in Hong Kong by more than 50% since 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Mainland developers, including China Resources Land Ltd., bought almost 60% of the residential land sold by Hong Kong’s government in the first half of this year.
Representatives at family holding companies of Li and Lee didn’t respond to requests for comment.
While much of their power comes from these informal relationships, members of the wealthiest families in Hong Kong also have official positions, including on the election committee of about 1,200 people that selects the city’s leader. Hong Kong business people sit on the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body that meets once a year in Beijing.
Chinese leaders were friendly toward the tycoons when the mainland economy was opening up because they wanted to encourage them to invest across the border, said Ding Yifan, a former senior government researcher who now teaches world economy at Beijing Foreign Studies University.
“Now that things have hit the fan, they realize there are many things quite unfair in Hong Kong,” he said. “Of course they need to deal with these problems.”
Hong Kong’s protests erupted in June in response to a proposed bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. They’ve continued even after that legislation was shelved, with protesters making other demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation into police actions toward demonstrators.
China’s office for Hong Kong and Macau affairs this month said it would support Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, in efforts to address social problems such as the housing shortage, the large wealth gap and the difficulty in upward social mobility. Hong Kong has the world’s least affordable housing.
At the end of July, about half of Hong Kong’s new apartments for sale came from five of its largest developers -- including the Li family’s CK Asset Holdings Ltd.; Henderson Land Development Co. of the Lee family; and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., controlled by the Kwok family -- according to an analysis of data from realtor Centaline Property Agency.
Meanwhile, half of the city’s mobile-phone users subscribe to providers controlled by the Li and Kwok families, according to government data and earnings reports. In some industries, the wealthiest Hong Kong Chinese families share power with dynasties that are a holdover from the British.
The Li family’s AS Watson Group and Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd., linked to the Keswick family, control 70% of the supermarkets, according to data from Euromonitor International. Representatives for the Kwok and Keswick family businesses declined to comment.
Beijing’s priority has shifted toward pursuing social equality, said Li Xiaobing, a professor at Nankai University in Tianjin who has written on Chinese regional politics. “The central government wishes tycoons to contribute more to society,” Li said. That shift has come as China searches for answers to end Hong Kong’s protests.
In recent weeks, several tycoons, including real-estate and casino magnate Lui Che-woo, have attempted to show Beijing their loyalty by issuing statements or placing newspaper advertisements condemning violence and pledging full support to the government.
Li earlier this month called for the government to “have mercy” on Hong Kong’s young people and for the youth to show more understanding. But China’s highest law-enforcement body lashed out, accusing Li of encouraging crime. The 91-year-old billionaire then said his remarks were misinterpreted.
Hong Kong’s billionaire families long hedged their risks because they knew their political and economic favors wouldn’t last forever, said Joseph Fan, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies family-run businesses.
Some tycoons, in recent years, sold their businesses to mainland firms. In 2018, former city Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa’s family sold its stake in a shipping line to state-owned Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. That year, the real-estate arm of Li’s business group sold its stake in an office tower, The Center, for about $5 billion to a consortium controlled by mainland companies.
Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong and a deputy to China’s National People’s Congress, expects more mainland firms to play leading roles in Hong Kong industries traditionally controlled by tycoons.
“In the long run, we all know that the future belongs to mainland Chinese capital,” he said."
1302,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 03:55PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Protests Threaten Billionaires' Ties With Beijing,"(Bloomberg) -- Less than a decade ago, Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, was granted an exclusive audience with China’s then-President Hu Jintao, a rare honor. State television lauded the September 2010 meeting, saying Hu lavished praise on the tycoon for contributing to the city’s prosperity and stability.
These days, as Hong Kong reels from months of violent demonstrations, China’s government is weaving a much harsher narrative around the billionaires who dominate the business and politics of the city. In recent weeks, it’s linked them to the rising inequality it blames for the social unrest, a new stance that threatens the close ties Hong Kong dynasties have forged with Beijing.
While most of Hong Kong’s wealthiest families have sprawling property holdings, they also dominate industries from telecommunications to retail, giving them outsize influence. The 20 Hong Kong tycoons tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index -- including moguls like Li and property magnate Lee Shau Kee -- have a combined net worth of more than $200 billion. So any shift in China’s posture toward those wealthy families has the potential in coming years to ripple through the city’s $360 billion economy.
In a scathing article posted on social media earlier this month, China’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the nation’s most powerful law-enforcement body, lashed out at Hong Kong’s property tycoons for “hoarding land and grabbing money.” Next, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, said the government should take away land from Hong Kong developers through compulsory acquisition.
“It is very clear that Beijing’s attitude toward Hong Kong’s property tycoons has changed,” said Joseph Wong, who was secretary for commerce, industry and technology under the city’s former leader, or chief executive, Donald Tsang.
China appears to be encouraging state-backed enterprises to expand in Hong Kong, a special administrative region, and, over the coming years, these companies likely will play a leading role in industries the tycoons have controlled, Wong said.
China Mobile Ltd., the mainland’s biggest carrier, has increased its subscriber base in Hong Kong by more than 50% since 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Mainland developers, including China Resources Land Ltd., bought almost 60% of the residential land sold by Hong Kong’s government in the first half of this year.
Representatives at family holding companies of Li and Lee didn’t respond to requests for comment.
While much of their power comes from these informal relationships, members of the wealthiest families in Hong Kong also have official positions, including on the election committee of about 1,200 people that selects the city’s leader. Hong Kong business people sit on the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body that meets once a year in Beijing.
Chinese leaders were friendly toward the tycoons when the mainland economy was opening up because they wanted to encourage them to invest across the border, said Ding Yifan, a former senior government researcher who now teaches world economy at Beijing Foreign Studies University.
“Now that things have hit the fan, they realize there are many things quite unfair in Hong Kong,” he said. “Of course they need to deal with these problems.”
Hong Kong’s protests erupted in June in response to a proposed bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. They’ve continued even after that legislation was shelved, with protesters making other demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation into police actions toward demonstrators.
China’s office for Hong Kong and Macau affairs this month said it would support Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, in efforts to address social problems such as the housing shortage, the large wealth gap and the difficulty in upward social mobility. Hong Kong has the world’s least affordable housing.
At the end of July, about half of Hong Kong’s new apartments for sale came from five of its largest developers -- including the Li family’s CK Asset Holdings Ltd.; Henderson Land Development Co. of the Lee family; and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., controlled by the Kwok family -- according to an analysis of data from realtor Centaline Property Agency.
Meanwhile, half of the city’s mobile-phone users subscribe to providers controlled by the Li and Kwok families, according to government data and earnings reports. In some industries, the wealthiest Hong Kong Chinese families share power with dynasties that are a holdover from the British.
The Li family’s AS Watson Group and Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd., linked to the Keswick family, control 70% of the supermarkets, according to data from Euromonitor International. Representatives for the Kwok and Keswick family businesses declined to comment.
Beijing’s priority has shifted toward pursuing social equality, said Li Xiaobing, a professor at Nankai University in Tianjin who has written on Chinese regional politics. “The central government wishes tycoons to contribute more to society,” Li said. That shift has come as China searches for answers to end Hong Kong’s protests.
In recent weeks, several tycoons, including real-estate and casino magnate Lui Che-woo, have attempted to show Beijing their loyalty by issuing statements or placing newspaper advertisements condemning violence and pledging full support to the government.
Li earlier this month called for the government to “have mercy” on Hong Kong’s young people and for the youth to show more understanding. But China’s highest law-enforcement body lashed out, accusing Li of encouraging crime. The 91-year-old billionaire then said his remarks were misinterpreted.
Hong Kong’s billionaire families long hedged their risks because they knew their political and economic favors wouldn’t last forever, said Joseph Fan, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies family-run businesses.
Some tycoons, in recent years, sold their businesses to mainland firms. In 2018, former city Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa’s family sold its stake in a shipping line to state-owned Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. That year, the real-estate arm of Li’s business group sold its stake in an office tower, The Center, for about $5 billion to a consortium controlled by mainland companies.
Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong and a deputy to China’s National People’s Congress, expects more mainland firms to play leading roles in Hong Kong industries traditionally controlled by tycoons.
“In the long run, we all know that the future belongs to mainland Chinese capital,” he said."
1303,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 03:53PM ET</span>",Rouhani Rules Out Trump Talks With Time Running Out in New York,"(Bloomberg) -- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed not to enter talks with President Donald Trump while under what he called America’s “merciless economic terrorism,” the latest sign that efforts to bring the two leaders together at the United Nations are foundering.
Speaking after an evening of shuttle diplomacy by French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Rouhani said Iranians would rely on their “national dignity, pride and strength” rather than negotiate while enduring stringent economic sanctions.
“Our response to negotiations, while under sanctions, is no,” Rouhani said during his speech Wednesday to the General Assembly. “There is no way that we will negotiate with an enemy that wants to force Iran’s capitulation using the weapons of poverty, pressure and sanctions.”
Rouhani’s remarks signal Iran’s leadership hasn’t shifted its stance despite a rapid-fire effort on Tuesday by Macron, who met separately with Trump and Rouhani into the evening as he continued to press for negotiations between the antagonists on his final day at the UN. Rouhani’s speech also suggests that no significant offer to ease sanctions was put forth by Trump, who has repeatedly said he would like to have a meeting without any preconditions.
After a year of casting around for ways to save the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal after Trump withdrew from the accord and reapplied crippling economic sanctions, European leaders have come up short and are trying instead to get the two leaders in a room in a bid to defuse tensions. The effort to de-escalate took on a new sense of urgency after an attack this month on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, which the U.S. and Western allies have blamed on Iran.
“If he leaves the country without meeting with President Trump this is a lost opportunity,” Macron said of Rouhani on Tuesday. “Because he will not come back in a few months. And President Trump will not go to Tehran so they have to meet now.”
With Iran’s economy suffering from Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, the country’s leaders are looking for a way back to the negotiating table as well, but they can’t afford to look like they’re capitulating to American demands, especially after Trump unilaterally left the 2015 deal. For Rouhani, sitting down with Trump would be an immense political gamble, with no guarantee of an agreement that would allow Tehran to legally sell oil again.
‘Stop the Sanctions’
“The only way for talks to begin is to return to commitments and to compliance,” Rouhani said. “Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for negotiations.”
France, the U.K. and Germany have led efforts to keep alive the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, after Trump quit the accord. But on Monday the three European nations issued a statement raising the pressure on Tehran by blaming it for the attack on Saudi oil facilities and saying Rouhani’s government should agree to talks that would go beyond the JCPOA by including Iran’s ballistic missile program.
Saudi officials, who say they are weighing how to respond to the attacks, praised the European statement. The announcement was “a very significant step forward in terms of the European position,” Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Tuesday. Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have long argued that any new agreement needs to address Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support for regional proxies in Yemen and Syria.
Yemen War
Addressing Saudi Arabia, Rouhani said the kingdom’s security can be achieved only “by ending the aggression in Yemen.” He said peace requires a solution from countries in the Middle East and Persian Gulf and “cannot be purchased or secured through foreign governments.”
Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign affairs minister, signaled Europe is still trying to save the nuclear agreement, but added in comments on the sidelines of the UN gatheringthat anything that builds on it “is very much welcomed.”
Talks between the U.S. and Iran appeared more likely a few weeks ago before the attack on Saudi Arabia. That incident, which caused a surge in oil prices and renewed fears of military conflict, appear to have shifted the calculation in Europe, which has been squeezed between Washington’s pressure campaign against Iran and threats from Tehran that it will gradually unwind its commitments to the nuclear accord if Europe doesn’t deliver economic benefits.
Macron previously sought to broker a breakthrough between the U.S. and Iran when he hosted the Group of Seven summit in France last month, winning verbal support from Trump for a proposal extending a $15 billion credit line to Tehran. It wasn’t clear whether he is still pushing for that idea in meetings this week.
Macron said his goal is “to be a mediating power” and “to play a useful role.”
“France is neither Iran nor the U.S., we have done what we could to create the conditions, it is now up to the others,” he added."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - U.S. energy major  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) has decided to continue negotiations with Thailand rather than seek arbitration to resolve a dispute over who should pay the bill for removing offshore oil and gas platforms, the company told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Thailand wants Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs for the energy infrastructure, estimated by one local newspaper at up to $2.5 billion. 
The dispute has implications for other international energy companies such as France's  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and Japan's Mitsui & Co (T:8031), which also have stakes in offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand. 
""We have agreed to temporarily suspend the arbitration process to allow more time for resolution discussions,"" a Chevron spokesman told Reuters, adding that the company was ""encouraged"" by the Thai energy minister's desire to come to an agreement. 
A spokesman for Thailand's energy ministry on Wednesday said he could not comment on talks with Chevron. 
Minister of Energy Sontirat Sontijirawong said in July he wanted to resolve the dispute as a matter of urgency to avoid arbitration, but that the issue was complicated. 
The dispute arose in 2016 when Thailand retroactively enforced a new energy ministry regulation requiring gas field operators to pay the costs to decommission all installed assets even if they no longer operate those assets.
Chevron argues that under the terms of its initial contracts dating from 1971, it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer usable. 
Chevron is due to hand over operation of the Erawan gas field to Thailand's state-owned oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl (BK:PTTEP) in April 2022 when its concessions expire. The new law would require Chevron to pay the future costs of decommissioning the assets it has installed, including those it transfers over to PTTEP.
Chevron told Reuters in July that moving to an arbitration process provided for by the 1971 contracts was a possibility. 
The company had objected to a request by Thailand's energy ministry to pay a security deposit for the full decommissioning cost of all of the company's assets in the Erawan gas field. 
Neither Chevron nor the ministry would disclose the amount of the requested guarantee when asked by Reuters. But local newspaper Thansettakij has reported it as around 75 billion baht ($2.5 billion), citing industry sources. 
The Chevron spokesman said arbitration was still a possibility if talks do not succeed. 
RETROACTIVE LAW 
Other operators in Thailand are watching the dispute closely in case it changes their future liabilities for assets in Thailand. Foreign investors in Thailand in other industries were also concerned about what precedent the case might set for the sanctity of their contracts.
""It will snowball, as it's not just Chevron,"" said Kornkasiwat Kasemsri, director of the Energy and Resources Policy Research Center at Thailand's Rangsit University.
""What decision is made in this case could affect other cases to follow.""
Chevron won the concessions to operate four blocks constituting the Erawan gas field, Thailand's second largest, from 1972 to 2012, after which the contracts were extended for 10 more years.
The contracts, for blocks 10-11 and 12-13, were first signed under the Petroleum Act of 1971. The act has been amended six times since. 
Chevron lost out to PTTEP, a unit of the state-owned PTT Pcl (BK:PTT), in a bidding round for the new concession in December.

1305,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 03:52PM ET</span>",U.S. Can Tariff About $8 Billion of EU Goods Over Airbus Aid,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
The World Trade Organization will authorize the U.S. to impose tariffs on nearly $8 billion of European goods due to illegal state aid provided to aircraft maker Airbus SE, according to people familiar with the decision, a move that will likely trigger retaliatory measures from the European Union.
The U.S. duties, which could hit as soon as October, will target planes and parts as well as luxury products, such as wine and spirits like Dom Perignon and Moet & Chandon -- and leather goods under labels such as Givenchy and Louis Vuitton, according to a list published by the U.S. Trade Representative’s office.
WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell and a spokesperson for Boeing (NYSE:BA) both declined requests from Bloomberg for comment.
The people who spoke of the ruling asked not to be identified because the confidential WTO decision isn’t due to be published until Sept. 30.
The verdict marks the latest chapter in the WTO’s longest-running dispute and will further test transatlantic relations, which have deteriorated under Trump’s “America First” strategy. And while the scope of this conflict is limited, Washington is separately mulling tariffs on auto imports, which would dramatically increase Europe’s stake in the American trade war.
The EU is pursuing a similar case at the WTO over illegal subsidies the U.S. provided to  Boeing Co ., and has published a preliminary list of U.S. goods -- from ketchup to video-game consoles -- it will target in a $12 billion plan for retaliatory levies. A decision in that case is expected from the Geneva-based trade organization in the first half of 2020.
Boeing Shares Rise
Boeing climbed 1.6% to $387.70 at 12:59 p.m. in New York, hovering near the highest intraday mark in more than five months. Airbus advanced 1.8% to 120.96 euros at the close in Paris.
A spokesperson for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The WTO award is lower than the Trump administration’s request to impose tariffs on up to $11.2 billion worth of European exports stemming from the nearly 15-year-old dispute. The U.S. hasn’t finalized which goods it will hit, but the preliminary list also includes whiskey, motorcycles, leather handbags, cheese and wine.
The proposed list could damage the sustainability of Airbus’ U.S.-based operations -- like the A320 manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama -- because it targets more than $9 billion worth of American-bound exports of European aircraft, helicopters and parts.
The U.S. tariffs may also hit products made by Europe’s producers of luxury brands -- like LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, Christian Dior SE and  Hermes International  (PA:HRMS).
New Approach
The new U.S. tariffs mark a significant escalation in tensions with the EU, which has implemented retaliatory duties on 2.8 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of U.S. imports following Trump’s trade restrictions on foreign steel and aluminum.
The EU has also said it’s prepared to hit 20 billion euros of U.S. goods with tariffs if Trump follows through on the threat to impose duties on European cars and car parts.
Separately, the EU is weighing an aggressive new approach to its trade dispute with the U.S., and is considering imposing tariffs on more than $4 billion of U.S. exports, citing as justification a 22-year-old World Trade Organization dispute over prohibited subsidies, according to people familiar with the plan. This is despite the fact that the two sides reached a “mutually acceptable solution” to the claim in 2006.
European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she advocated for a settlement that would avoid the tit-for-tat aircraft tariffs, but said that the U.S. never responded to the bloc’s offers.
“Our view is that we have enough tariffs in the world as it is, so imposing tariffs on each other, which strictly speaking we are allowed to do according to the World Trade Organization, would not be a good solution to this,” Malmstrom said Sept. 16.
“We have made a quite detailed proposal,” she said. “So far, unfortunately, the U.S. has not said that they are willing to negotiate.”

BEIJING (Reuters) - Nio Inc, one of China’s high-profile electric car startups, disclosed a fresh money-raising push this week, saying it had issued $200 million worth of bonds and was accelerating cost-cutting programs to slow cash burn as the company seeks to attract more investors in a slumping market.
Loss-making Nio is the most prominent among dozens of Chinese electric vehicle startups vying to become the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. All are hampered by dwindling demand in the world's largest car market, reduced government subsidies for EVs and nagging concerns over the China-U.S. trade war.
In an unusual move, Nio canceled a scheduled earnings conference call on Tuesday. But it rescheduled the call on Wednesday after the company's shares touched a record low of $1.97.
The company reported a second-quarter loss of $478.6 million, 25.2% more than its first-quarter loss, after the recall of 4,803 vehicles in June.
Nio's revenues fell 8% to 1.41 billion yuan ($198.40 million) from 1.54 billion yuan in the preceding quarter. Nio sold 3,140 ES8 cars, down from 3,989 in the first quarter. It sold just 413 of its cheaper ES6 model.
Nick Wang, Nio Group's head of finance, said the company's gross margins ""will still be negative for the rest of the year."" But Chief Financial Officer Tung-June Hsieh said Nio has made ""significant, positive progress"" in its latest fund-raising efforts, without providing details.
In May, Nio signed a pact with a government-backed fund for an investment of about $1.5 billion.
Nio also announced a $200 million private placement of convertible notes, split equally between early investor Tencent Holdings and founder Li. Nio had $503.4 million in cash on the balance sheet as of June 30.
CASH BURN
To help cope with cash burn, Nio is expanding its sales network with smaller showrooms called Nio Spaces, according to Hsieh.
Nio Spaces ""will allow us to quickly, cost-effectively and meaningfully increase the number of sale points in the market,"" Hsieh said. ""By the end of 2019, we aim to have established around 200 Nio Spaces in over 100 cities across China.""
Nio will also encourage more regionally driven promotion, introduce a vehicle subscription program and push sales to corporate users and fleet operators.
After reducing headcount to around 7,800 by the end of the third quarter from over 9,900 in January, Nio plans further headcount reduction by the end of this year through both restructuring and spinning off some business units, Hsieh said.
Nationally, sales of new energy vehicles, including EVs, contracted for the second month in a row in August, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
Nio led a pack of EV startups and became the first to get internationally listed. It counts Tencent and investor Hillhouse Capital Management among its shareholders and raised $1 billion last year in an initial public offering that valued it at $6.4 billion. However, bankers have said Chinese EV makers face increasingly tough funding efforts while jostling for attention in a crowded sector."

CHICAGO/JAKARTA (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has settled the first claims stemming from the crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia, a U.S. plaintiffs' lawyer said, and three other sources said that families of those killed will receive at least $1.2 million apiece.
Floyd Wisner of Wisner Law Firm said he has settled 11 of his 17 claims against Boeing on behalf of families who lost their relatives when a brand-new MAX crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 soon after take-off, killing all 189 aboard.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe declined comment. Boeing did not admit liability in its 11 settlements, Wisner said. 
The claims, each representing one victim, are the first to be settled out of some 55 lawsuits against Boeing in U.S. federal court in Chicago and could set the bar for mediation talks by other Lion Air plaintiffs' lawyers that are scheduled through next month, three people familiar with the matter said.
Wisner said he could not disclose the amount of the settlements because of a confidentiality agreement with Boeing. The three people familiar with the matter said families of Lion Air victims, who were nearly all from Indonesia, are set to receive at least $1.2 million each. That amount would be for a single victim without any dependents.
The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.
Boeing's shares rose as much as 2 percent on Wednesday. Awards can vary according to victims' nationality, age, marital status, income, dependents and life expectancy. The Lion Air victims were mainly from Indonesia, where incomes and crash awards tend to be lower than in the United States.
The manufacturer is also facing nearly 100 lawsuits over an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash on March 10 that killed 157 people on its way from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. 
Lawsuits over both crashes highlight the role of MCAS automated software that pushed the nose of the two planes lower. They claim that design flaws allowed erroneous sensor data to set off the automated system and overwhelm pilots.
The Lion Air lawsuits are being mediated before Donald O'Connell, a retired judge of the Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois, a jurisdiction often used for air accidents situated in Chicago, where Boeing is based.
'COMMON LINK'
Lawyers for the Ethiopian Airlines crash are pushing for a jury trial in U.S. federal court in Chicago, demanding to know why Boeing allowed the 737 MAX to go on flying after the Lion Air incident.
The planemaker has said it is sorry for the lives lost in both crashes but has stopped short of admitting any fault in how it developed the 737 MAX or the software.
It has said the two crashes - like most air disasters - were caused by a chain of events, with a common link between the two MAX accidents being ""erroneous activation"" of MCAS. 
In the Lion Air case, families of victims who were married with one to three children could receive between $2 million and $3 million, the people said. 
Industry veteran Wisner said he had settled lawsuits for other plane crashes that took place in Indonesia in years prior to the Lion Air 737 MAX crash for around $500,000 or $600,000. He will receive one third of his Lion Air settlements in fees. The settlements come on top of $144,500 that Boeing is paying out of a $50 million financial assistance fund it set up in July for families of victims of the two crashes. Any settlement or jury award in the Ethiopian cases is likely to be larger than for Lion Air, the people said. 
Many of the Ethiopian crash victims, who came from 35 different countries, included United Nations employees and young working adults in their twenties or thirties. There were nine U.S. citizens among the victims. Boeing is also the target of a U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation into the development of the 737 MAX. The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide following the Ethiopian crash while Boeing develops software updates and new pilot training. It has already estimated a cost of more than $8 billion from the grounding, mainly due to production setbacks and compensation it will owe airlines that have canceled thousands of flights as they manage schedules without the fuel-efficient jetliner they had counted on.

Boeing has said it hopes the 737 MAX jetliner will fly again in the United States early in the final quarter of this year.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 02:36PM ET</span>","Luxury leader LVMH, in green mode, laments Thunberg's pessimism","PARIS (Reuters) - Environmental activist Greta Thunberg's discourse on climate change was overly pessimistic and demoralizing for young people, LVMH (PA:LVMH) boss Bernard Arnault said on Wednesday, as the group behind brands like Louis Vuitton raised its ""green"" goals.
LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods conglomerate, which like its peers is seeking to improve its environmental credentials and keep young consumers onside, said it was further cutting emissions and improving sourcing on materials like animal fur.
But the group's billionaire owner and CEO Bernard Arnault said he rejected what he called Thunberg's doom-mongering.
The 16-year-old Swedish campaigner berated world leaders and business executives at a United Nations climate summit in New York this week for failing to act more decisively on climate change, saying they had ""stolen her dreams.""
Her vision ""has a demoralizing side to it for young people. She's not proposing anyway, aside from criticism,"" Arnault, 70, told journalists. ""I prefer positive solutions that allow us to get towards a more optimistic position.""
Fashion and textile groups are under pressure from consumers and environmentalists to try and reduce industry waste, including unsold clothing, and improve their manufacturing methods.
Luxury companies turn out pricey products that are not mass produced, but they also face questions on everything from animal welfare to carbon emissions involved in exporting their wares around the world.
Many LVMH fashion brands, which include Fendi, Christian Dior and Givenchy, make accessories such as handbags from exotic skins like python or crocodile.
The group said it was bringing in a charter to ensure full traceability for all of its raw materials by 2025, which would allow it to track them back to precise farms in the case of farmed fur.
Some rivals have dropped fur altogether, including France's Chanel, Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci.
LVMH said it was on course to exceed its goal to cover 30% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2020 and also on track to cut its CO2 emissions by 25% by the same time.
The group was glaringly absent from an industry ""fashion pact"" launched under the auspices of  Kering  in August with broad targets to reduce emissions.
Signatories included France's Hermes (PA:HRMS) as well as lower end and sportswear groups like Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and Adidas (DE:ADSGn).
Stella McCartney, a pioneer in vegan-friendly fashion and whose namesake brand is now part-owned by LVMH, also backed the agreement.
Arnault said the deal did not make sense for LVMH - beyond clothing brands it also owns champagne labels like Moet & Chandon - and that its business model was a world away from that of fast fashion firms.
""We prefer action to pacts,"" Arnault said.
Younger luxury consumers - including the ""millenials"" in their late 20s and mid-30s who are driving industry sales - are more readily influenced in their purchases by sustainability matters than their elders, a Boston Consulting Group survey this year showed.
Kering said earlier this week that it would become fully carbon neutral by offsetting all greenhouse gases from 2018 within the group and across its supply chain."

Investing.com - Can't buy me love, Match?

Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) shares are down 2.6% after the Federal Trade Commission sued the owner of Match.com, Tinder, OKCupid, PlentyOfFish and other sites, alleging they used fake love ads to entice users to buy subscriptions.

Match lets users create Match.com profiles free of charge. But a user can't respond to messages without upgrading to a paid subscription. Match would send emails to users saying someone had expressed an interest in meeting them. ""You caught his eye"" has been a typical tagline.

That would lead to offers to connect users to the senders for a price, the FTC said. But many of the contacts provided by Match or its sites came from users the company already knew were scammers or fraudulent, the FTC alleges. That left the subscribers exposed.
In a statement, Dallas-based Match called the lawsuit ""completely meritless,"" adding that ""(f)raud isn't good for business."" The company said it catches 85% of improper accounts within four hours and 96% within a day.
Match operates in more than 42 languages across 192 countries.
Match shares already were under pressure. They peaked at $95.32 in August and have fallen 25% since. But they're still up 67% on the year.

The company went public in November 2015 at $12 and has been profitable. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the September quarter to show 43 cents a share in earnings on revenue of $541 million, up from 39 cents a share and revenue of $444 million a year earlier.
The company carries more than $1.6 billion in total debt against about $210 million in equity.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday dismissed three lawsuits accusing  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) of misleading investors about a complex product for betting on stock market swings, and causing huge losses when it lost 96% of its value in one harrowing day.
U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said Credit Suisse had warned investors about risks in its VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Notes (""XIV Notes""), and the investors did not show that the Swiss bank intended to defraud them.
Torres adopted U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn's recommendation on Aug. 16 that the lawsuits be dismissed.
Lawyers for the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Credit Suisse did not immediately respond to similar requests.
The XIV notes were among several investment casualties on Feb. 5, 2018, when the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) dropped 4.1% and a surprise increase in market turbulence punished investors betting on low volatility.
Investors said the price of the notes sank that day to $4.22 from $108.37, a plunge exacerbated by Credit Suisse's huge purchase of futures contracts -roughly a quarter of the entire VIX futures market - to benefit from the higher volatility.
Credit Suisse soon redeemed the notes at $5.99 each, and according to the investors reaped between $475 million and $542 million of profit in doing so at their expense.
The investors said Credit Suisse concealed their impending distress by failing to regularly update the price of the notes, or warn when it sold 16.28 million of the notes just a week earlier, on Jan. 29, that the prices were vastly inflated.
Torres, however, found no reason to upset Netburn's findings that Credit Suisse was simply taking advantage of market conditions, and was not trying to saddle investors with losses.
""Judge Netburn did not clearly err in concluding that, notwithstanding the size of the January sale, the innocent explanation for the large volume of XIV notes sales in January 2018 was more plausible than the inference that Credit Suisse engaged in those sales in order to later cause a liquidity crash,"" Torres wrote.
Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, a defendant in one of the lawsuits, had called the XIV notes ""legitimate,"" and that investors accepted the risks they would not be successful.
The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York are Set Capital LLC v Credit Suisse Group AG et al, No. 18-02286; Eisenberg v Credit Suisse AG et al, No. 18-02319; and Qiu v Credit Suisse Group AG, No. 18-04045."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A House of Representatives budget panel has proposed raising the budget of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by $40 million, a more than 10% rise at a time when the antitrust and consumer protection agency has undertaken a probe of Facebook (O:FB).
The FTC, whose budget was $310 million this fiscal year, divides its antitrust enforcement work with the Justice Department.
The agency has said it was conducting an antitrust investigation of Facebook, while sources had told Reuters in June it was gearing up to investigate Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Facebook over possible misuse of market power.
The extra funds proposed by a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee would mean the FTC could add about 90 staff, allowing the agency to double the size of its technology task force, Chairman Joe Simons told the panel at a hearing.
In its big tech probes, Simons said the task force would look at past mergers and any allegations of exclusionary conduct, where a dominant firm tries to prevent a smaller rival from gaining market share.
Commissioner Rohit Chopra said the investigation could include looking at fake reviews and use of facial recognition.
Lawmakers at the hearing pressed Simons, a Republican, and Chopra, a Democrat, on disagreements on key decisions such as whether the $5 billion settlement with Facebook over its privacy practices was adequate.
""The settlement was far greater than we could have got in litigation,"" said Simons about the Facebook settlement.
Chopra said it was not enough to stop Facebook re-offending.
Lawmakers at the hearing pushed Simons and Chopra on what they were doing to fight robocalls, innovations in scamming like ""sim swapping,"" when a fraudster convinces a telecom carrier to move a victim's phone number to the scammer.
They also asked about scammers that target service members and the elderly, sale of geolocation data and the skyrocketing cost of insulin."

They are investigating whether Germany's biggest bank facilitated money laundering and whether it failed to alert authorities about suspicious transactions quickly enough, the prosecutors said. 
Danske Bank is under investigation in several countries, including the United States, Denmark, Britain and Estonia, over suspicious payments totalling 200 billion euros ($220 billion) moved through its tiny Estonian branch.  Deutsche Bank  acted as a correspondent bank for Danske.
The search, which began on Tuesday and concluded on Wednesday evening, involved three prosecutors and nine agents from Germany's federal criminal police. 
Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating. ""Deutsche Bank has comprehensively examined the facts of the matter and has voluntarily provided the requested documents as far as possible,"" the bank said in a statement. 
Prosecutors said the period in question is 2014 to 2018, and that there was a suspect who worked at the bank during that period.
Deutsche Bank had alerted authorities to 1.1 million suspicious transactions, prosecutors said. 
Prosecutors also said that a double-digit number of transactions, with a volume of 12.5 million euros, were either registered by Deutsche too late with authorities, or the bank should have blocked them from the start.
The Sueddeutsche Zeitung was the first to report the raid on Deutsche.
Deutsche Bank has previously faced issues over money laundering and the controls in place to prevent it.
Last year, dozens of police raided six Deutsche Bank offices in and around Frankfurt over money laundering allegations linked to the ""Panama Papers"".
Germany's financial market watchdog BaFin last year ordered Deutsche to do more to prevent money laundering. 

In 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $700 million for artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that could have been used for money laundering. An investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice is still ongoing.

(Reuters) - The chief executive of e-cigarette maker Juul stepped down on Wednesday as merger talks between its biggest investor Altria and Philip Morris collapsed in the face of a regulatory backlash against vaping that could reshape the industry.
Juul Labs, in which tobacco giant  Altria Group  (N:MO) owns a 35% stake, is facing intense scrutiny in its home market as teen use of e-cigarettes surges. The company, which faces a U.S. ban on some products, said on Wednesday that it would suspend all advertising in the country. 
Marlboro makers Philip Morris International (N:PM) and Altria, announcing the end of their $187 billion merger talks, said they would instead focus on the joint launch of tobacco-heating product iQOS in the United States.
""It appears to us the talks fell apart over Juul,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note, adding she was not surprised, given the litany of negative health headlines. Philip Morris and Altria did not mention the e-cigarette firm, however.
Vaping devices such as Juul's, which vaporize liquid containing nicotine, have borne the brunt of the regulatory crackdown globally. 
The iQOS, which heats but does not burn tobacco, is a rival non-smoking technology and, crucially, has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
When the talks were announced last month, the potential for Juul and iQOS to dominate the biggest vaping markets globally was seen as central to the logic of a deal. It would have seen the tobacco companies reunite a decade after their split and created an industry heavyweight with a combined market value of $187 billion, triple its closest rival  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS). 
However, some investors were skeptical of the synergies the deal would generate and a steady rise in number of vaping-related deaths and illnesses reported in the United States may also have changed the companies' thinking. 
""After much deliberation, the companies have agreed to focus on launching iQOS in the U.S. as part of their mutual interest to achieve a smoke-free future,"" Philip Morris CEO André Calantzopoulos said. 
SURGE IN YOUNG VAPERS
The Trump administration in the United States has announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves due to the rising appeal among teenagers. 
The share of high school students using e-cigarettes has more than doubled over the past two years, with 27.5% reporting they had tried an e-cigarette in the past month, according to preliminary federal data released this month. 
U.S. health officials are also investigating an outbreak of hundreds of severe lung illnesses and nine deaths linked to vaping. 
In its announcements on Wednesday, Juul also said it would not lobby the administration over the proposed ban on flavored products. 
The FDA earlier this month warned the company about marketing its products as safer than traditional cigarettes and requested more documents and information within 30 days.
Federal prosecutors in California are conducting a criminal probe into e-cigarette maker Juul, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, though the focus of the probe was unclear. 
Elsewhere in the world, South Korea and India last week became the latest countries after Brazil and Thailand to ban or warn about the sale of e-cigarettes, dealing further blows to the still-young industry.
Factbox on global backlash:
'FULL-FORCE' IQOS LAUNCH
Stifel analyst Chrisopher Growe said Altria, which holds the license to sell iQOS in the United States, would embark on a ""full-force"" effort to launch the product, taking advantage of being the only tobacco-heating product approved for sale. 
The company is expected to launch the product in Atlanta ""imminently"" and then quickly broaden distribution, he said. Philip Morris will sell iQOS in all other markets. 
San Francisco-based Juul said it was replacing CEO Burns with K.C. Crosthwaite, a longtime Philip Morris USA veteran and most recently the chief strategy and growth officer of Altria, a sign of Altria's growing influence over Juul after its $12.8 billion investment in the e-cigarette maker last December.
Burns, a former private equity executive who came to Juul in late 2017 from yogurt maker Chobani, presided over meteoric growth at the company, as it morphed from a 300-person startup to an international operation employing thousands.
His tenure also coincided with the sharp rise in teenage e-cigarette use and a regulatory crackdown on the industry,.
Altria has many more years of experience than Juul dealing with regulators such as the FDA. 
Shares in Philip Morris were up 5.7%, while Altria was down 2.5% in afternoon trading. 

Rivals British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands (L:IMB) rose 3.2% and 2.2% respectively on Wednesday's announcements.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors jumped back into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks last week by sending approximately $11.8 billion in net assets into the category, the greatest weekly surge into domestic equities since early June, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute. 
The money flowing into stock funds came as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week as expected, helping further a rally that has pushed the benchmark S&P 500 stock index up 18.5% since the beginning of the year. 
Over the last two weeks, investors have sent nearly $20 billion into U.S. stock funds.
Despite those gains, U.S. equity funds have lost a total of nearly $84 billion for the year to date. Instead, investors have continued to seek the safety of bond funds, which garnered an additional $9.3 billion in new assets last week. For the year to date, bond funds have pulled in a net of nearly $306 billion in new assets. 
World stock funds, meanwhile, lost nearly $1.8 billion in outflows, continuing a streak in which investors have pulled nearly $41 billion from the category since the start of the year.

BONN (Reuters) - A British banker told Germany's biggest fraud trial this week how he worked his way from office clerk to jet-setting trader before his dream career came to an early end.
Nicholas Diable, 38, is one of two British bankers who German prosecutors allege orchestrated a sham trading scheme to make illegitimate double tax reclaims of more than 450 million euros ($495 million).
Diable, who has not denied he was involved in the 'cum-ex' trading but says he had no reason to believe it was illegal, played down his role during the court hearing in Bonn.
He described his work as that of a salaried technician with a focus on getting trades done rather than a mastermind.
""For me, it was only a question of whether the trade was possible or not,"" Diable told the German judges on Wednesday.
State prosecutor Anne Brorhilker this month outlined criminal charges against Diable and Martin Shields, who both face a possible jail term as well as a court order to repay money they earned from the trades if found guilty.
Diable answered the accusation at his trial, the first criminal case brought against those involved in 'cum-ex' trading, a practice described by German finance minister Olaf Scholz as a ""scandal"".
Prosecutors allege that players in the scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit. Germany estimates such trades cost it more than 5 billion euros in total.
If successful, this case would make it easier to pursue others and recover the money lost.
Brorhilker said the two men had targeted companies including carmaker BMW and airline Lufthansa, outlining more than 30 instances of double-tax reclaims totaling 447 million euros.
Shields told the court last week that he regretted his involvement in the ""industrial scale"" trading scheme, but that the practice was common knowledge and that he had no reason to believe at the time that it was legally questionable.[L5N2693EB]
The 41-year-old Oxford university graduate said the trading thrived between 2005 and 2012, as investors from around the globe made multi-billion-euro trades on German companies.
Diable emphasized his more technical, junior role, telling judges about his modest start in the City of London, inputting data, taking lunch orders and rituals such as running through an office as colleagues threw objects at him.
He later became a trader and worked with Shields at German bank HVB, carrying out such trades, before following him to Gibraltar, when Shields set up his own company.
Both jobs involved entertaining customers and contacts in ""bars and restaurants"" in London, at Germany's Oktoberfest beer festival, as well as in Gibraltar, Diable said.
Diable said he had been under investigation since he was 31 during a statement made to the court over two days outlining the mechanics of the trading.
The alleged scheme involved trading shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to give the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.
The case, Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation, is being closely followed in London and Frankfurt, where much of the trading was organized, according to bankers and court documents.
HVB, which has blamed its involvement on wrongdoing by individuals, has declined further comment."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Juan Martín Landa swipes a finger across his smartphone, carefully checking the latest exchange rate. He is buying dollars, one of many Argentines turning to apps to trade currency after a sharp crash in the country's peso last month.
Landa, a 38-year-old entrepreneur in Buenos Aires, uses a currency exchange platform from digital lender Brubank after his salary lands each month - a routine part of organizing his savings with inflation above 50% and the peso down 33.5% this year.
Argentina, which has a long tradition of savers hoarding dollars, was hit hard in August when a landslide defeat for President Mauricio Macri in a primary election triggered a currency sell-off and pushed the country toward default.
The government imposed capital controls to stem the rout as people shifted their savings to dollars It also sought to protect foreign currency reserves, which fell by nearly $12 billion in August, the steepest monthly decline in at least five years. 
""As soon as Argentines get their salary, they convert it to dollars to protect themselves against currency depreciation. Then they spend it little by little as they need it,"" Carlos Sicchar, founder of recently launched app Dolares Libre, told Reuters.
The currency exchange app, which translates as ""Free Dollars,"" lets people buy and sell dollars among themselves at a free-market rate. On its website it claims to ""democratize, innovate and facilitate the currency exchange market.""
Sicchar said the app, which started operating last week, saw $30,000 worth of transactions within the first few days and $100,000 in the first week. The trades are legal and the app says it is approved by the country's central bank.
Others recently introduced apps include Bull Exchange, Naranja X, Wilobank and Balanz, which launched a platform last year and says it offers the dollars at the ""best price"" 24-hours a day. The lure is lower commission costs and faster trades.
Argentina has a long history of recurring economic crises, creating a lack of trust in the local peso, globally one of the worst performing currencies this year. 
That has created dollar demand both through official and illicit channels, with savers looking for the best rates.
""I buy the dollars from the app because it is cheaper, and I prefer to do that rather than take out the money and go shopping through the black market,"" Landa said.
These trades are, however, limited by new rules capping how much people can convert into dollars at $10,000 per month - controls that have created a divergence between the official price of the U.S. currency and quotations on the black market.
That gap has expanded sharply to around 10% over the last month, while there is an even larger gap between the spot rate and the average price obtained via trades using the buying and selling of securities to convert pesos to dollars.
The apps claim to give the best official price, cutting down on middlemen fees and commissions. On Tuesday, the average dollar price on various apps was 58.6 pesos, versus 60 pesos on official financial boards for retail trades.
""If there were a bank that would sell cheaper they would all go to that bank,"" said Daniel Vicien, commercial director of the Balanz Common Investment Fund, adding the firm's currency exchange app had seen a big spike in users since the primary election.
""What Argentines want from the app is just the best price.""

The confrontation in Zurich last week triggered a criminal investigation by Swiss prosecutors and raised questions about who ordered a detective bureau to trail star banker Khan, who left Credit Suisse in July and will co-head private banking at arch rival UBS (S:UBSG) from next month.
A number of sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that Credit Suisse hired security firm Investigo to tail Khan to try to ensure he did not poach any colleagues before joining UBS.
Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-biggest bank, has declined to comment publicly on either the confrontation or whether it hired detectives to tail Kahn.
The confrontation between Kahn and the private detectives has been the talk of Switzerland's banking community for days after it was widely reported in local media.
Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner and Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam told staff in an internal memo this week they would get to the bottom of the matter, which they said had prompted ""significant inaccuracies"" in sensational media reporting.
Sources had pointed to a serious fallout between CEO Thiam and rising wealth management star Khan, who shared side-by-side villas in Zurich's Herrliberg suburb, prior to Khan's departure in July.
A spokesman for Khan, 43, has denied as ""absurd"" Credit Suisse suspicions that he might be trying to poach former colleagues away to join his new employer.
Contradictory versions of the confrontation have emerged.
Khan filed a criminal complaint alleging threats and coercion after the confrontation on Sept. 17, during which Swiss media reported that Investigo agency detectives sought to take Khan's mobile phone after he tried to take a photo of their car.
But an Investigo memo seen by Reuters said a single detective had taken only defensive action when Khan tried to photograph him with his mobile phone.
An Investigo representative has said he could not comment on the memo or any details of the incident, but it was very unlikely that one of the firm's detectives would try to pull the phone from the hands of someone being tailed.
Three employees of the security firm were briefly detained by authorities over the incident, Investigo's representative has said.
Credit Suisse hired an external law firm to conduct the inquiry, according to a source.
Khan is due to begin his new job at UBS on Oct. 1."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Thomas Cook's German tour business filed for insolvency on Wednesday in a move aimed at separating its brands and operations from its failed parent, and said it was in talks with potential new investors.
The German government said it was considering an application for a bridging loan from Thomas Cook Germany, a day after it said it would guarantee a 380 million euro ($418 million) bridging loan for the British group's German airline, Condor.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, collapsed earlier this week, sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history and a scramble for survival among many of its subsidiaries. 
The German regional state of Hesse, which is also providing help to Condor, said on Wednesday it would examine a request for financial assistance from Thomas Cook GmbH, and would discuss the matter with the federal government.
Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier said support would only be possible if it was certain that the company had good prospects.
Torsten Kirstges, professor of tourism business at the Jade University of Applied Sciences, said it was unlikely the government would bail the company out as it was not as critical to the travel sector as Condor.
Condor and Thomas Cook GmbH, the second-biggest tour operator in Germany after TUI, are both independent units of the insolvent British parent company.
Condor is also expected to undertake insolvency proceedings under self-administration to avoid being entangled in the winding up of the parent company's financial affairs.
CONDOR LOOKING FOR NEW OWNERS
Christoph Debus, head of Thomas Cook Airlines which includes Condor, said the German airline was selling tickets as normal and was hopeful it could compensate for the 20% of its business that comes from Thomas Cook holidays.
Condor is also looking for new investors, he said: ""There are very concrete offers and partners we are speaking to and we are confident that we will find a good new ownership structure.""
Thomas Cook's Nordic arm, meantime, has said it is looking for new owners, while Polish unit Neckermann Polska said on Wednesday it was insolvent. Its Dutch unit was granted protection from creditors on Wednesday.
Thomas Cook Germany said it had filed for insolvency in an attempt to restructure the business in an orderly fashion and continue profitable operations. It added that a German court could appoint a liquidator as soon as on Wednesday.
""Intensive talks over the last two days with strategic and private equity investors ... have shown us that the German branches of former Thomas Cook with its brands Neckermann Reisen, Oeger Tours and Bucher Reisen have the chance to have a future,"" the unit said in a statement. 
The business, which serves around three million customers a year, said it had been weighed down by the weakness of its British parent and the impact of Brexit on the German business.
But Stefanie Berk, the unit's head, said she was optimistic the business would survive. 
""We owe this to our long-standing customers, committed employees and other partners who have supported us so much over the years and in the last difficult weeks,"" Berk said.
The company said it was in contact with the German foreign ministry, insurers and other partners to get customers home. Zurich Insurance, which provided insolvency cover to Thomas Cook Germany, will cover the costs for those on holiday.
About 97,000 holidaymakers are still stranded on Thursday.
Trade union Verdi called for efforts to save the German business and its 2,000 employees, noting that thousands of travel agencies in the country depended on its survival.

Thomas Cook Austria, which belongs to the German unit, also filed for insolvency on Wednesday, with the aim of continuing in business.

The state-owned carrier has been downsizing its fleet and route network following a failed strategy to rapidly expand to compete with more established Gulf airlines like Emirates.
""Etihad Airways will re-time the entry into service of five new Airbus A350-1000 aircraft as part of its ongoing business transformation plan,"" an airline spokesman said on Wednesday.
The spokesman said the largest version of the A350 jet remained important to Etihad's future plans, but did not say when the airline would start using it.
""A decision on introduction date will be made as part of the airline’s broader strategy planning,"" he said.
Airbus declined to comment, referring questions to Etihad.
Etihad has canceled billions of dollars in aircraft orders, including for 40 of the smaller A350-900 jets and two A350-1000s, as part of a five-year turnaround strategy started in 2016.
It has committed to taking delivery of five A350-1000s from a current order for 20. 
Etihad replaced the management who led the aggressive expansion strategy, which also included investments in airlines that later ceased operations due to their own financial turbulence.

Chief Executive Tony Douglas, who joined in 2017, told Reuters last year the airline would be ""more rational"", focusing on carrying passengers to and from Abu Dhabi as opposed to its previous hub model of connecting east and west.

TALLINN (Reuters) - A former head of Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) Estonian branch, which is at the center of inquiries into the world's largest money laundering scandal, was found dead on Wednesday. 
Police in Estonia discovered the body of Aivar Rehe, who ran the Danish bank's Estonian business between 2007 and 2015 and had been among those questioned as a witness in a probe by Estonian prosecutors, following a search which began on Monday.
 Danske Bank , Denmark's largest lender, is under investigation in several countries, including the United States, Denmark, Britain and Estonia, over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($220 billion) which were moved through its tiny Estonian branch during the period Rehe was in charge.
Rehe's death is likely to complicate investigations into Danske Bank's Estonian operation, including by U.S. authorities.
The former banker's importance in investigating the case was highlighted by the fact that he had been quizzed, as a witness, by Estonian prosecutors.
Danske Bank's is the largest in a series of European money laundering scandals, stretching from Latvia to Sweden.
And in a sign of the wider ramifications of the case, Frankfurt prosecutors said they had raided Deutsche Bank's headquarters in the German financial capital in relation to Danske Bank.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it was cooperating.
Estonian police said that Rehe had not been seen since he left his home in Tallinn, Estonia's capital, on Monday.
Estonian prosecutors confirmed that Rehe had been questioned as a witness, not a suspect, in a case opened in December last year against 10 former Danske Bank employees. This involves the alleged laundering of around 300 million euros.
The police said Rehe's death would not be investigated. 
""There are no signs of violence on the corpse, and there is no indication of an accident ... There will be no investigation opened,"" police said after finding Rehe's body near his home.
WITNESS IN CASE 
Estonian police had issued a missing persons appeal on Monday, saying Rehe had left his home that morning and his family had no information about his whereabouts.
Dozens of people had joined a search for the 56-year-old in forests around his home in a Tallinn suburb, a well-off neighborhood of small houses which is surrounded by large areas of parkland.
""He was questioned as a witness in the case,"" a spokeswoman for the Estonian prosecutor's office said of Rehe, adding that the investigation was continuing.
The spokeswoman declined to give any further details, while the Danish prosecutor declined to say whether Rehe was or had been the subject of its investigation. 
Danske Bank extended its condolences to Rehe's family.
""We are sad to receive the news that the former chief of our Estonian brand, Aivar Rehe, is dead. Or thoughts go out to the family,"" it said in a statement.
Rehe rarely spoke publicly about the case, which began to come to light in 2017, but he had said that he felt responsible even though he thought anti-money laundering measures had been sufficient at the time.

""I do. Naturally. I spent 10 years running that bank, and they were all my people,"" he said in an interview with Estonian media outlet Postimees in March.

(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Wednesday it will add Austin, Texas, to the short list of cities where it plans to launch a commercial transportation service using automated vehicles in 2021.
The U.S. automaker previously said it would begin transporting people and goods in automated vehicles in Miami and Washington.
Ford's self-driving system, now being tested in Fusion Hybrid sedans, is being jointly developed with Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup in which Ford and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) together hold a majority stake.
Sherif Marakby, chief executive of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, said Ford plans to launch the commercial transportation service in 2021 in a purpose-built hybrid vehicle that can be equipped to carry either people or goods.
Peter Rander, president of Argo AI, said development teams soon will be manually driving the Fusion test vehicles in Austin, mapping the city streets and assessing driver and pedestrian behaviors ahead of the commercial launch.
Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo last year introduced an automated ride service with human attendants in Phoenix, using specially outfitted Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans it buys from  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA).
General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cruise Automation said in July it planned to delay commercial deployment of automated vehicles in San Francisco beyond its initial target of 2019 because more testing was required."

Law enforcement officials on Tuesday visited the bank’s headquarters in Frankfurt to ask for information, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said, confirming a report in German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
“Deutsche Bank has comprehensively examined the facts of the matter and has voluntarily provided the requested documents as far as possible,” the spokesman said by email. “The bank will continue to cooperate with the prosecutor.”
Germany’s biggest lender has long faced questions over its role in a scandal that saw more than $200 billion in suspicious transfers made through Danske Bank A/S’s Estonian unit. The vast majority of the money was routed through Deutsche Bank, which at the time served as correspondence bank for U.S. dollar payments at the Estonian business, people familiar with the matter have said.
The German lender’s role first came into focus a year ago when a whistle-blower highlighted its role in testimony to Danish lawmakers. The bank has since initiated a second internal review and has said that it’s investigation so far has not produced any evidence of wrongdoing.
In yet another twist in the Danske Bank saga, the former head of the bank’s Estonian unit has been found dead, according to police in the Baltic country."

VIENNA (Reuters) - An unprecedented bidding war has erupted over German lighting group Osram (DE:OSRn), with private equity group Bain swapping partners to team up with Advent to prepare to outbid Austria's  AMS  (S:AMS) (VI:AMS).
The Austrian sensor specialist made a 4.3 billion euro ($4.7 billion) bid for the larger Osram earlier this month.
AMS had itself surpassed a 4 billion euro offer that Bain had made, that time in combination with  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG). Bain turned to Advent as Carlyle did not want to put any more cash on the table, people close to the matter have said.
The clock is ticking with the AMS offer set to expire on Oct. 1. However, AMS could still lift its own offer before then, which would lead to an extension of the offer period until Oct. 15.
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
Bain and Carlyle had until mid August been optimistic about acquiring the market leader in automotive lighting for 35 euros per share, having secured the support of Osram's management and its supervisory board.
Then AMS entered the fray, first announcing then launching a higher offer pitched at 38.50 euros per share. The German group was not enthusiastic initially, since the much smaller company said it would sell certain divisions and cut jobs if successful.
Osram employee representatives spoke out against the AMS offer.
However, the ""financial attractiveness"" of AMS's bid led Osram to advise its shareholders to sell its stock to the Austrian group.
AMS has said it would be happy with 62.5% of Osram shares, of which it currently holds 5.5%. Bain and Carlyle had set a 70% threshold.
HOW WOULD ADVENT JOIN THE RACE?
As the offers expire in a few days, there is no way legally for Advent to simply join the Bain & Carlyle consortium and add funds.
There is also not enough time left for it to enter the race as part of a new bidding consortium, as the German watchdog needs to be given two weeks to approve a new offer.
However, there are ways around this: After Bain & Advent committed to making a ""meaningfully"" higher offer than AMS, investors may decide not to tender their shares to the Austrian company.
If neither Bain & Carlyle nor AMS reached the necessary threshold to buy Osram, everything could start from scratch.
Bain's new offer would have to be at least 0.50 euros per share higher than AMS's offer of 38.50 euros per share, because Bain has made a corresponding commitment to Osram.
A key question is, to what extent its lenders are willing to support it. The sensor specialist agreed to take on more than 4 billion euros in additional debt to finance its current bid."
1338,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 09:28AM ET</span>","Impeaching Trump Is Like ‘Bill Clinton 2.0,’ Wall Street Says","(Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to launch a formal impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump is reminding analysts of proceedings against Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which failed to topple a popular president. Other events had more of a market impact then, and might now, too.
Observers also expect little from Congress ahead of the 2020 elections, as the inquiry may sideline potential moves on drug pricing, infrastructure and the USMCA. A deal with China is still up in the air, while an already slipping Joe Biden seems to have been weakened, and Elizabeth Warren’s chances seem to have brightened.
U.S. futures dipped in pre-market trading on Wednesday, amid mixed reactions to the prospect of an impeachment investigation and news China is preparing to buy more U.S. pork.
Here’s a sample of the latest commentary:
KBW, Brian Gardner
KBW is “confident that regardless of whether or not the House votes to impeach Mr. Trump, the Senate will not remove him from office,” Gardner wrote. He noted that using the 1998-1999 impeachment of President Bill Clinton as a proxy shows impeachment had “little impact on the market,” with events connected to the Russian default crisis and the Asian financial crisis triggering greater market moves.
Gardner also sees Trump’s reelection prospects as improving slightly, as the president “has a unique ability to manipulate these kinds of situations to his advantage.” A House move to impeach may backfire and unite Republicans. The news coverage is hurting Biden, he added, and helps Warren, while “Trump has a better shot at beating Sen. Warren in the general election than he does against Mr. Biden.”
Raymond James, Ed Mills
“Legislating is dead,” Mills wrote in a note, as “impeachment will lead to Congress doing nothing except that which it must do by established deadlines (like funding the government).” That means there probably won’t be bipartisan action on drug pricing, infrastructure, and passing the USMCA until after the 2020 election.
Regarding China, he said, “the debate will be about a Trump pivot towards a win via a ‘mini deal’ or doubling down to cater to his base,” as per his U.N. speech on Tuesday. Mills also said “impeachment is bad for Biden,” as hearings will keep the “Trump-claimed Biden and his son issue in the news,” and undercuts Biden’s “return to normalcy” campaign.
There’s a “real risk that Democrats overplay their hand, increasing Trump’s reelection chances,” Mills added. At the same time, more uncertainty might hurt consumer and business confidence, he said, with any increased risk for recession possibly dooming Trump’s reelection.
Beacon Policy Advisors
“The latest impeachment imbroglio is a negative catalyst for markets,” the firm wrote. “While political gridlock is often good for markets by reducing the risk of government interference, dysfunctional paralysis of government is not because it increases uncertainty over the government’s ability to handle a crisis.”
Beacon sees a higher risk of a “Trump-induced event, akin to the government shutdown last year, in order to distract attention from the impeachment headlines.”
Evercore ISI, Sarah Bianchi
“Putting the focus on impeachment is an enormous undertaking that makes everything else harder,” Bianchi wrote, including prescription drug pricing legislation and the USMCA.
As for whether it matters for the election, Bianchi said “impeachment politics are tricky and unpredictable. It is very possible that it will just further put each side in their respective camps and further polarize the country. What it does to the moderate middle of the road voters is very hard to say.”
Cowen, Chris Krueger
On Tuesday, Krueger said he expected the House will impeach Trump, while the Senate won’t convict, a scenario he called “Bill Clinton 2.0,” adding that “this could all be over by the end of 2019.”
RBC, Brian Abrahams, biotech analyst
Investors may want to come back to biotech as drug pricing probably won’t be overhauled now, Abrahams wrote in a note. An impeachment investigation may create “a sustained impasse,” he said, and “reaffirm the low likelihood of draconian price cuts and over time improve investor confidence returning to the biotech space.”
RBC, Adam Cole, currency strategist
“We would note that this is only a small step on the road to impeachment, which would ultimately require a 2/3 majority in the Republican-controlled Senate and that it is not clear yet whether the House will vote to endorse the inquiry,” Cole wrote. He flagged Betfair’s probability of Trump leaving before the end of his first term jumping to 22% from 14%, which was “still far below levels that prevailed in the early part of his presidency.”
“Beyond the knee-jerk reaction to rising uncertainty, it is also unclear that diminishing risk of a returned Trump would be negative for risk assets.”"

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) board of directors said on Wednesday it created a new permanent safety committee to oversee development, manufacturing and operation of its aircraft and services in the aftermath of two fatal 737 MAX crashes.
It also said a five-month internal review by a special board panel set up to assess aircraft development recommended that the world's largest planemaker reorganize its engineering reporting lines company-wide to boost oversight by top company officials.
The new safety committee and company recommendations were reported first by Reuters in August. They are the first structural shifts as part of Boeing's response to the ongoing crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX after deadly crashes killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
The board's review is just one of numerous probes into the development of the 737 MAX by global regulators and U.S. lawmakers and the Department of Justice. Boeing also faces more than 100 lawsuits by victims' families alleging it designed a flawed airplane.
The changes will be rolled out over the next couple of months, pending further review, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters in August. 
They are intended to boost the transparency and oversight of engineering decisions and accelerate efforts to share safety information as widely and swiftly as possible across Boeing's global businesses and factories.
The board of directors approved a new Aerospace Safety Committee at its August 2019 meeting, it said on Wednesday.
The six recommendations following the special panel's review include the creation of a new Product and Services Safety organization that reviews all aspects of product safety and investigates cases of undue pressure and anonymous employee concerns. 
The board also recommended that all Boeing engineers, including the new Product and Services Safety organization, report directly to the chief engineer, who reports directly to Muilenburg.
Boeing should also work with airlines to ""re-examine assumptions around flight deck design and operation"" and recommend pilot training criteria beyond traditional training programs ""where warranted"", it said.

""Design assumptions have evolved over time, and the company should ensure flight deck designs continue to anticipate the needs of the changing demographics and future pilot populations,"" the board said.

The company said it will first offer three plots of agricultural land in the New Territories, totaling 28,000 square feet, to a non-governmental organization called ""Light Be"" to build over 100 small-sized apartments by 2022 at the earliest.
New World Development, which announced a 22% fall in annual net profit on Wednesday, had an agricultural landbank with an attributable total site area of around 16.9 million square feet pending for land use conversion, according to its financial report for the year ended June 30.
In an attempt to address a housing shortage in Hong Kong - where millions of anti-government protesters have taken to the streets for more than three months - political parties have called on the government to make more use of an ordinance to resume agricultural land from property developers to build public housing.
On Sept. 13 China's state newspaper People's Daily in a commentary criticized Hong Kong developers for hoarding land and said it was time for them ""to release the greatest goodwill, instead of just playing their own calculations, smashing the land, earning the last copper plate"".
Adrian Cheng, executive vice chairman of New World Development, told the group's results press conference on Wednesday that the donation was a separate issue from the ordinance, and that the company had an open attitude if the government needed to look for land for public housing."

The world’s biggest tour operator is working to retain leased aircraft it has been operating through the summer in preparation for an anticipated surge in bookings, Chief Executive Officer Fritz Joussen said in an interview.
“We are extending some leases that would otherwise expire as we believe the need for some extra capacity is there following Thomas Cook,” Joussen said by telephone, adding that the U.K. company’s demise will bring “significant opportunities” for remaining players, especially in Britain.
While 150,000 of Thomas Cook’s U.K. customers who were already on holiday when the company failed on Monday should be able to complete their trips, the collapse will leave many more who had yet to travel in the market for alternative plans. In the longer term, Germany’s TUI should also benefit from the exit of its biggest rival in Europe’s $47 billion package-holiday market.
TUI has already been leasing planes because of the global grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 737 Max after two fatal crashes, of which it has 15 in the fleet with several more due to have been taken this year.
The Hanover-based company earlier moved to calm investors after Thomas Cook’s failure, saying in a statement that the summer season is “closing out in line with expectations,” with its model of owning hotels and cruise ships outright proving resilient.
Industry Squeeze
Joussen said the market is “still not where it should be” as the tourism sector is roiled slowing economies, fluctuating oil prices, a strong dollar, uncertainty around Brexit and changing booking patterns in response to warmer summers in northern Europe.
Asked what Thomas Cook’s failure says about the industry, he said that “those who change will be successful, those who don’t won’t.” European leisure airlines still have too much capacity and with so many external risks in play TUI must be “careful,” he said.
A TUI spokesman said the company is not interested in Thomas Cook’s Frankfurt-based airline Condor, which is continuing to operate while seeking a buyer. The carrier is set to receive a 380 million-euro ($420 million) bridge loan from the German government, valid for six months, provided that the European Commission approves the plan.
In contrast, Thomas Cook’s German tour operating arm with the Neckermann Reisen, Oeger Tours and Bucher Reisen brands filed for insolvency, according to a statement Wednesday.
UBS analyst Cristian Nedelcu said in a note Tuesday that any boost to TUI’s profitability and free cash flow could prove to be fleeting as other companies also move to fill the gap left by Thomas Cook within a year or two.
Joussen said he remains hopeful that the Boeing Max will return to service this year as the U.S. manufacturer works with regulators on changes to flight-control software blamed for the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Mahindra & Mahindra  (NS:MAHM) are likely to sign a deal next week to form a joint venture in India, two sources told Reuters, in a move that will see the U.S. carmaker end most of its independent operations in the country.
The two companies have for months been structuring the deal to create a new entity in which Ford will hold a 49% stake, while Indian rival Mahindra will own 51%, Reuters reported in April.
Under the deal Ford will transfer most of its automotive assets and employees in India to the new company, but the carmaker will retain an engine plant in Sanand in the western state of Gujarat, according to the two sources, who asked not to be named as the talks are private.
A Ford spokeswoman did not comment directly on the deal, but said the company was engaged with Mahindra ""to develop avenues of strategic cooperation that help us achieve commercial, manufacturing and business efficiencies"".
Mahindra did not respond to a request for comment.
By shifting to a joint venture, Ford is changing its decades-old India strategy focused on running an independent operation. Under pressure from shareholders to make profits, the U.S. carmaker has been globally restructuring its businesses with an aim to save $11 billion over the next few years.
Ford's decision is a setback for the country at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration is trying to boost local manufacturing by cutting corporate tax rates and offering cheap loans to push car sales. Sale of cars by manufacturers to dealers have fallen at their steepest pace in two decades.
Ford's two manufacturing plants - one in Chennai in southern India and the other in Sanand which was inaugurated in 2015 - will be moved to the new joint venture, but Ford will keep the engine plant at Sanand. Together, they have a maximum annual manufacturing capacity of 440,000 vehicles.
Ford-brand cars will continue to be built and sold in India and exported by the new company, one of the sources said.
Over two decades, Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford invested more than $2 billion in India but it has consistently struggled - it currently has a share of about 3% in a market where Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI) is the top player with a 50% share.
""The Mahindra deal is an opportunity for Ford to recover some of the money it has invested in India,"" said one of the sources.
In India, currently, Ford manufactures and sells its cars via its wholly owned subsidiary. In 2017 it formed a strategic alliance with Mahindra under which, among other things, they will develop new cars together, including SUVs and electric variants."

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) said it was preparing to replace its chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, making him the latest casualty at the German steel-to-submarines conglomerate which has been in crisis mode for more than a year.
The plan to ditch Kerkhoff after 14 months follows a dramatic loss of confidence among key investors, who no longer believe the 51-year old can deliver a turnaround that includes selling the company's most profitable division, elevators.
It adds to turmoil at a company that has struggled to cope with falling steel prices, a weak car market and a cooling global economy. Since Kerkhoff became CEO in July 2018, the firm has issued four profit warnings.
""Most importantly, we see an increasing risk surrounding a timely execution of the elevator business strategy, in turn creating further questions over whether the company's stretched balance sheet can be fixed over the next 6-12 months,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote, keeping an ""underperform"" rating.
Shares in the group traded 1.1% lower at 1038 GMT.
Kerkhoff is set to be replaced on an interim basis by Supervisory Board Chairwoman Martina Merz, who will face pressure to quickly find a buyer for the elevator business, which is valued at up to 17 billion euros ($18.7 billion), more than twice that of its parent.
Kerkhoff's plan to sell or list elevators, raise margins and find new ownership structures for Thyssenkrupp's other divisions was executed poorly and failed to create momentum, said two people familiar with the matter.
""That's why Thyssenkrupp's key owners had to hit the 'emergency brake',"" one of the sources said, after Thyssenkrupp did not give a reason for Kerkhoff's departure in its statement.
Growing scepticism has been reflected in a 40% share price decline since Kerkhoff became CEO, compounded by two failed restructuring plans under his watch: a spin off of the capital goods units and a joint venture with  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC).
Lars Foerberg, founding partner of Thyssenkrupp's second-largest shareholder, Cevian, said he fully supported the appointment of Merz, a former Bosch (ROBG.UL) manager who became chairwoman in February.
FASTER TURNAROUND
This echoed remarks by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation, the biggest shareholder with a 21% stake.
If elected CEO, Merz's duties as chairwoman will be taken over on an interim basis by former  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) board member Siegfried Russwurm, who sits on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board.
The company said it would recommend that Klaus Keysberg, head of the group's Materials Services business, join the board.
""We expect that the new leadership will speed up the transformation process that Thyssenkrupp so urgently needs, and improve the quality of implementation. We are confident that Thyssenkrupp will now finally get a crystal clear strategy and a well-defined plan of action,"" Foerberg said.
Under Merz, who also sits on the steering committees of Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Volvo (ST:VOLVb) and automotive supplier SAF Holland (DE:SFQN), the existing turnaround plan is expected to gather pace.
Dirk Sievers, head of Thyssenkrupp's works council and a member of the group's supervisory board, said the group's strategy needed to be implemented faster and more consistently now, adding there would be no change to the existing plans.
Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board will decide on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting shortly, the company said.
""The realignment of the group announced in May 2019 and unanimously approved by the supervisory board will be systematically continued. The focus will be on the three areas 'performance first', 'flexible portfolio' and 'efficient organization',"" it said.
Kerkhoff, who joined Thyssenkrupp as finance chief in 2011, took over as CEO last year following tumultuous weeks during which the conglomerate's former CEO and chairman also left due to mounting investor pressure over strategic issues.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 07:23AM ET</span>","Rheinmetall, Voith vie for Volkswagen's transmissions maker Renk: sources","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German auto and defense supplier Rheinmetall and engineering group Voith are vying for transmissions maker Renk, which Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has put up for sale to free up funds for investment in electric vehicles, people close to the matter said.
The industrials groups are among those expected to submit first-round bids for Renk by a mid-October deadline, they said. The bids could give the company an enterprise value of around 700 million euros ($769.37 million).
Private equity groups KKR, Carlyle and Advent are also among the potential suitors, while defense firm KraussMaffeiWegmann's interest was expected to be muted, they said, adding that the signing of a deal is not expected before next year.
Voith, Rheinmetall and Carlyle declined to comment while the other potential bidders were not immediately available for comment.
Volkswagen declined to comment on specifics of the deal, saying it was working on a forward-looking solution for Renk in the wider context of developing a growth perspective for the group's mechanical engineering division.
Renk's vehicle transmissions unit - which makes transmissions used in tanks and other heavy vehicles - saw sales spike by 23% in the first six months. Its units making standard gears, and gears for ships as well its slide bearings unit saw business decline or stagnate, according to its financial report.
Volkswagen said that it was developing a growth perspective for the group's mechanical engineering business.
""In this context, we are working on a forward-looking solution for Renk,"" a company spokesman said, declining to comment on specifics of the deal.
TOP NOTCH
Renk is benefiting among others from a large order by the British Army for Ajax branded tanks, which are being delivered until 2026.
""The military ops are top notch, the rest is more or less a restructuring case,"" one of the people said, adding that the German government was expected to scrutinize the deal to safeguard German defense technology from falling into the wrong hands.
Renk is 76%-owned by Volkswagen's family ownership holding  Porsche  SE (DE:PSHG_p), with the rest of the shares widely held. It currently has a market capitalization of 721 million euros.
The company's large exposure to the defense industry - which it supplies with transmissions for tanks and gear units for navy ships - will make it hard for buyers headquartered outside NATO countries to acquire Renk, the sources said.
In 2018, Renk posted flat earnings before taxes of 62 million euros on slightly higher sales of 502 million euros, while orders surged 22% to 529 million.
While peers such as Rexnord, Timken, Allison and Mitsubishi Heavy trade at 6.5-8.5 times their expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, Renk could be valued at 8-9 times its expected core earnings, one of the people said."
1349,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 07:21AM ET</span>",German industry raises pressure on Merkel to ditch policy of no new debt,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should ditch its policy of not taking on new debt in light of zero borrowing costs and huge investment needs, the head of the powerful BDI industry association said on Wednesday, raising the pressure on Berlin to rethink its budget priorities.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition faces growing calls at home and from abroad to abandon its self-imposed ""black zero"" budget policy of no new borrowing and instead take on new debt within the limits of the more formal debt brake as a way to help a slowing economy teetering on the brink of recession.
BDI President Dieter Kempf said that the government should use the fiscal leeway of the constitutionally enshrined debt rules and ditch the balanced-budget policy.
""Under the rules of the debt brake, the government could raise between 10 and 12 billion euros a year, which Berlin could use for public investment,"" Kempf told members of the foreign press association in Berlin.
The business leader pointed out that the economic circumstances had changed as the economy was faltering.
At the same time, the country was facing massive pent-up investment needs and investors were willing to even pay Berlin a premium for issuing debt as German bond yields across the board turned negative, Kempf said.
Merkel's ruling coalition last week agreed a package of budget-neutral measures to protect the climate and restore its green credentials, but drew criticism from environmental groups that had hoped it would go further.
Merkel and her Social Democrat Finance Minister Olaf Scholz so far have shown little appetite to abandon their joint pledge to refrain from taking on new debt, though Scholz himself has changed his tone over the past weeks."
1350,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",Your Money: How to use ETFs as a buffer in volatile markets,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When it comes to investing, how much are you willing to put on the line for the biggest possible gains? If bumpy markets are making you nervous, there is a middle ground emerging between being all-in or sitting on the sidelines. 
Defined outcome exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a buffer against losses - meaning, if the market goes down, you do not necessarily lose money. 
Most ETFs track an index and are a lower-cost alternative to funds that aim to beat the market. However, defined outcome ETFs are managed more actively - and act more like structured notes or certain annuities than plain-vanilla index funds. 
""The whole idea is very simple, but it’s profound: It’s the ability to know upfront what your outcomes will be relative to what the S&P 500 does over the next year,"" said Bruce Bond, CEO of Innovator, who co-founded ETF giant PowerShares, now owned by Invesco.
To date, the funds offered by Innovator have tracked the S&P 500. The company said it will soon add defined outcome funds that track other indexes, like the Russell 2000. 
THE FINE PRINT
Defined outcome funds are complex in nature. The structured notes they grew out of are a combination of bond and options contracts that investment advisers negotiate with financial institutions to help counter risk. 
The defined outcome ETFs offered by Innovator are structured at three different levels to buffer against losses. The base option protects the holder from a 9% drop in the S&P 500 over the 365 days from the issue date. (A 15% buffer level operates the same way.) 
A major catch is that there is also a cap on gains, meaning the holder knows they will not earn more than a certain amount, even if the market goes higher. There is no guaranteed return, as there might be in an annuity structure. 
The cap on Innovator's September S&P 500 Buffer ETF  is 14.07%; it is 9.39% for the 15% level . 
The S&P 500 is currently up more than 19% for the year, but what it does from Sept. 1 for the next 365 days is anyone's guess.
Moreover, the details listed are only applicable if you buy a defined outcome ETF in the first days of issuance. After that, market conditions shift the parameters.
Since you can buy or sell an ETF at any time, you need to keep an eye on your gains and losses - s well as your tax consequences if not in a deferred account. 
At the end of a defined outcome ETF's year-long term, your fund rolls forward into the next available issue for another 365 days, Bond said. 
The most conservative option Innovator offers is a 30% buffer, but this does not kick in until after the first 5% of losses. So if the market is down 5%, that is all on you. The next 30% of losses are covered, and anything beyond that is back on you. 
If the S&P falls 38% - like it did in 2008 - you would be out only 8%. 
Such protection comes at a premium. Buyers pay a fee of 0.79% - higher than typical for ETF funds, but less than for mutual funds or a structured note. 
Financial advisers are obviously taking notice, because assets under management at Innovator are about $1.3 billion to date, Bond said. 
For one thing, these ETFs are easier to manage than dealing with negotiated contracts with banks, and you avoid credit risk issues. Plus, new clients can come in without waiting until the next contract, said Tom Balcom, a certified financial planner based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
DRAWBACKS
Peter Palion, a certified financial planner in New York who investigated this option for clients, ultimately decided defined outcome ETFs are too complex. 
""This does not give you full protection, and the amount of protection it gives is fairly expensive,"" he said.
Ken Nuttall, a certified financial planner in New York, is intrigued about defined outcome ETFs, but also worries about stress-testing the concept. 
""That’s always the issue on any new ETF. The proof is in the pudding,"" he said. 
Bond notes that the Innovator funds prevailed during a rocky period last October, when the S&P went below the buffer. 
""It traded through. We had no issues,"" Bond said.

(Reuters) - European shares were on course for their worst day in more than a month on Wednesday, as an impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump and worsening rhetoric on U.S.-China trade relations fanned fears about global economic growth.
Trade-sensitive tech stocks (SX8P) fell 2%, driving a more than 1% fall in the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX), after Trump issued a stinging rebuke to China's trade practices in a speech to the United Nations.
The fallout of the speech, given late in the European session on Tuesday, rippled through Wall Street and other global markets overnight and sent all of Europe's industrial sectors into the red in the first hour of trading.
Semiconductor shares including AMS (S:AMS) and ASM International (AS:ASMI) were among the top losers while export-reliant Germany (GDAXI) slipped 1%, putting the STOXX overall firmly on course for its first weekly fall since mid August. ""Markets may be caught flat-footed by the apparent tone shift (on trade),"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""A prolonged period of trade tensions, with a comprehensive U.S.-China trade deal is unlikely before the 2020 U.S. presidential elections.""
Equity markets have been rankled by a slew of poor euro zone economic and political news in the past week.
Data on Monday showed business growth had stalled across the currency bloc, and while a UK Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday may help head off a no-deal Brexit it was also likely further to delay the country's tortured European Union exit process.
Weak PMI surveys, recent profit warnings from European companies and the political uncertainty on the back of the Trump impeachment probe were leading markets to take a pause, said Will James, senior investment director for European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Germany's  Pfeiffer Vacuum  (DE:PV) plunged 14%, as it became the latest European industrial machinery company to cut guidance, citing order delays.
German truck supplier SAF Holland (DE:SFQN) also cut its 2019 outlook for the second time this year on Tuesday, blaming a deterioration of economic conditions, particularly in Europe, China and India.
""The issue at the moment is - for some of the more cyclical sectors - the market expectations (for company earnings) are not particularly high. It will be much more to do with the outlook statements,"" James said.
Shares in France's EDF (PA:EDF) dropped 6.1%, to the bottom of the STOXX 600, after the state-controlled power group raised its cost estimate for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Britain.

Investing.com -- You may remember Thomas Piquemal. He resigned as chief financial officer of Electricite de France (PA:EDF) three years ago after warning that the French government’s determination to have EdF build the Hinkley Point C reactor in south-west England could bankrupt the company.
Fast forward three years and, while bankruptcy may still seem fanciful given the French state’s backing for its national champion, the flawed economics of the project are once again standing in the harshest of spotlights after EdF warned of yet more overruns to the project. It now expects up to $3.6 billion in additional costs and warned that it’s more likely than ever that the project will be delayed.
EdF’s shares fell 6.6% in early trading on Wednesday to a new two-year low of 9.97 euros. EdF was worth 107 billion euros back in 2010 when the British government announced the sites where it wanted to build a new generation of nuclear plants. It’s now worth 30 billion ($33 billion).
This year alone, it has fallen nearly 28%, while most of Europe’s biggest energy suppliers have posted double-digit gains. At 21 times earnings, according to data compiled by Investing.com, it’s still one of the more expensive stocks in a peer group which trades largely in the teens.
The timing of the announcement is particularly painful for the company, coming only a couple of weeks after it was faced with potentially high costs for fixing faulty welds at its reactors across France.
The folly of locking U.K. energy consumers into financing such a project is now painfully apparent. Nor is this hindsight: the British parliament was warned repeatedly back at the start of the decade that, while renewable costs would plummet as various technologies matured, there was no such falling price curve to be hoped for in nuclear, whatever technological advances the new generation of plants brought. The U.K. guaranteed EdF a price of 92.50 pounds per megawatt-hour for Hinkley Point C in 2012. Last week, it auctioned offshore wind power projects at a strike price of as low as £39.65/MWh.
EdF may get some consolation from the fact that its bad news is being buried Wednesday under bigger concerns about global growth and the U.S.-China trade war after President Donald Trump’s harsh anti-China and anti-Iran rhetoric at the UN on Tuesday. The benchmark STOXX 600 was down 1.3% at 384.60, while the CAC 40 was down 1.5% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.9%."
1355,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 05:51AM ET</span>","Sibanye to cut over 5,000 jobs in Marikana restructuring","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African miner Sibanye-Stillwater (J:SGLJ) said on Wednesday that it could cut around 5,270 jobs as it restructures its loss-making Marikana mine.
 Sibanye  said the restructuring was aimed at returning the mine to profit and ensuring the sustainability of the remaining shafts, driving its share price up 6% to 21.28 rand.
After a review into the mine's operations, some shafts at risk of closure would continue to operate, lessening job losses, Sibanye-Stillwater CEO Neal Froneman said.
""Overall, the outcome will be a more sustainable business which is able to secure employment for the majority of the Marikana workforce for a much longer period,"" he said in a statement.
Marikana was previously owned by Lonmin before the struggling platinum miner was taken over by Sibanye-Stillwater in a deal seen as the only way to save its 29,000-strong workforce. The mine was where 34 striking miners died in 2012 after being shot by police in an event that would become known as the 'Marikana massacre'.
The job losses at the operations taken over from Lonmin - which account for over 26,000 staff - are significantly smaller than those Lonmin announced in 2017, thanks to an improvement in prices for platinum group metals, Sibanye-Stillwater said.
The company has also been cutting jobs in its gold mining operations in a country where job cuts are politically sensitive due to widespread unemployment - especially in the mining sector, where frequent, mass redundancies often affect poor, black workers.
South Africa's unemployment rate hit a 11-year high of 29% in the second quarter of the year, with mining suffering the biggest decline as it lost 54,000 positions.
Sibanye-Stillwater said the cuts at Marikana would be subject to a consultation process, which would seek to avoid retrenchments and seek alternatives to the closure or downscaling of operations at the affected shafts."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) move to take charge of one of the country's top five co-operative banks on Tuesday has left thousands of depositors in the lurch and sparked renewed concerns about the health of India's troubled banking sector.
Depositors of the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank were informed on Tuesday they can withdraw only a sum of 1,000 rupees ($14.1) from their bank account over the next six months, while the bank itself has been put under the direction of the central bank and barred from renewing, or granting any loans, or making fresh investments without prior approval of the RBI.
The sudden move caused PMC Bank depositors to panic and led to protests and long queues outside the bank's branches. It has 137 branches that are spread across seven states in India.
""My money is gone now,"" said Ashok Mahto who stood forlorn outside a bank branch in Santacruz, a suburb in Mumbai city, convinced that the 65,000 rupees that had taken him six months to accumulate has been lost forever.
Mahto, who said he needs the money urgently for his sister's wedding next month, is not alone. Thousands of depositors across various branches have stood outside demanding answers about their life's savings.
India has more than 1,500 small urban co-operative banks that typically service small local communities in certain districts or states.
Over two dozen of these co-operative banks are now under RBI administration, but PMC Bank - with deposits of 116.17 billion rupees as of March 31 - is by far the largest to be hit by such RBI measures.
Its plight has also raised fresh fears about the broader Indian banking sector that has been rocked by a multi-billion dollar fraud at a state-run lender, the collapse of a major infrastructure lender, bad loan issues at state-run banks and a liquidity squeeze that has hit shadow lenders.
The public sector bank index (NIFTYPSU), which surged 10.4% over two trading sessions following a government announcement of a big cut in corporate tax rates last week, has since fallen as much as 7.3% in trading on Tuesday and Wednesday.
PMC Bank itself sought to calm depositors and Managing Director Joy Thomas, in a text message to customers on Tuesday, attempted to reassure them that the bank's issues would be resolved within six months.
""We have ample assets to cover all our liabilities toward the depositors. All my loans are backed by adequate securities. It is just a question of time,"" Thomas said in an interview with CNBC TV18 on Wednesday.
Still, depositors remained unconvinced and bank employees were despondent.
""Our staff has worked hard to win the confidence of clients over the years. After this incident, it'll be very difficult to revive that confidence,"" said Sonia Malik, a branch manager at a PMC Bank outlet in New Delhi, adding employees are worried about their jobs too."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has asked banks to submit proposals for a project finance loan of more than $1 billion, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The state oil company's request for proposals (RFPs) was sent this week, one of the sources said.
It was not immediately clear from the RFP the specific nature of the projects the funds will be used for, the sources said.
Aramco was not immediately available to comment.
The request to banks went in a few days after the Sept. 14 attack on two giant Aramco plants which initially halved the crude output of the world's top oil exporter, by shutting down 5.7 million barrels per day of production.
Aramco's Chief Executive Amin Nasser has said the company, which is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), was still in the process of estimating repair work but that it was ""not that significant,"" given the company's size. 
Saudi Arabia has restored its oil production capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day after the attacks on oil facilities, three sources briefed on Saudi Aramco's operations told Reuters.
Aramco, the most profitable oil company in the world, earlier this year raised $12 billion with its first international bond issue after receiving more than $100 billion in orders.
Last year, Aramco and Malaysia's Petronas approached banks to replace a short-term $8 billion loan raised for a joint venture with long-term financing of approximately the same size, banking sources said.
Aramco is preparing for the domestic leg of its IPO, although some investors and sources close to the company's thinking say it is unlikely to proceed with a listing this year after the attacks.

Aramco officials are meeting bank analysts this week in Dhahran as part of the preparations for the IPO, two sources said.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks fell to a two-week low and risk assets dipped lower on Wednesday after U.S. lawmakers called for an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, increasing the prospects of prolonged political uncertainty.
The move by Democrats in the House of Representatives exacerbated market anxieties running high over global recession risks as well as the U.S.-China trade dispute.
Trump delivered a stinging rebuke to China's trade practices in a speech on Tuesday, adding to the pressure after more conciliatory tones in recent days.
Adding to geopolitical tensions is uncertainty over the outlook for Britain's Brexit chaos after the Supreme Court ruled Prime Minister Boris Johnson had unlawfully suspended parliament.
MSCI's global stock index dropped 0.4% in a fourth straight day in the red - the longest losing streak since the end of July rout. 
European shares suffered broadly with the pan-European STOXX 600 dropping 1.4% as technology stocks lead the losses. France's CAC tumbled 1.6% with export-reliant Germany falling 1.3%. 
""It is hard to imagine how long can the truce with China remain on trade and that is adding to the general cautious environment for stocks,"" said Neil Mellor at BNY Mellon in London. ""As soon as markets start worrying about trade, they look at central banks for help but there is increasing pushback from them too.""
The downturn in Europe followed declines in Asia where Tokyo's Nikkei suffered its largest loss in three weeks while China and Hong Kong dropped 1% or more. 
Risk assets elsewhere also took a beating with China's offshore yuan fell, while oil futures extended declines.
""Chinese shares were already exposed to downside risks. Trump's comments likely increased those risks,"" said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co in Tokyo. ""There are worries about U.S. consumer sentiment. There are also concerns that China's economic slowdown hasn't stopped.""
The downturn looked to continue in the United States, with U.S. stock futures indicating a 0.1% decline at open.
The impeachment inquiry push and disappointing U.S. economic data had knocked Wall Street on Tuesday, sending the S&P 500 0.84% lower, its biggest daily decline in a month.
The U.S. House of Representatives will launch a formal impeachment inquiry over whether Trump sought help from the Ukraine to smear former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It is unlikely that the impeachment inquiry would lead to Trump's removal from office. Even if the Democratic-controlled House voted to impeach Trump, the Republican-majority Senate would have to take the next step of removing him from office after a trial.
PRETTY REMARKABLE
Markets have already been roiled by political disquiet in Hong Kong to Britain to Italy and the Middle East.
""Although nothing seems that abnormal these days, yesterday was pretty remarkable as two of the most powerful leaders in the world faced serious misconduct/legal charges and accusations,"" said Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid. 
The dollar index measuring the greenback against a basket of six major currencies nudged 0.2% higher.
Sterling dropped 0.4% to $1.2445, reversing most of its gains from Tuesday. Johnson vowed Britain would leave the EU by an Oct. 31 deadline come what may but is facing reinvigorated opposition to his plans after the Supreme Court ruled he had unlawfully suspended parliament. Britain's FTSE index dropped 0.8%.
""Predicting the ultimate outcome of Brexit remains difficult,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer, UBS Global Wealth Management. ""As a result, the longer-term risk-return outlook for UK equities looks uncertain. We still advise being nimble on sterling.""

Forex markets elsewhere were also in a risk risk-off mood, with the Australian dollar and most emerging-market currencies lower.
The move safe haven assets also saw euro zone government bond yields edge lower, with 10-year benchmark euro zone government bond yields down 1 to 2 bps on the day,,
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.6387%, while the two-year yield stood at 1.6076%.
U.S. crude dipped to $56.51 a barrel while Brent crude eased to $62.12 per barrel - both down nearly 1 dollar.

Kering, which owns fashion brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, still has a 15.7% stake after spinning off 70% of Puma to its shareholders last year.
These investors include Artemis, the holding company for the Pinault family that founded and controls Kering, and which is now Puma's leading investor with a stake of just under 29%. 
In recent years Kering has increasingly focused on its high-margin luxury businesses, but even within this portfolio it has disposed of smaller brands like Christopher Kane. 
Kering's 500 million euro ($550 million) bond issue, which is due in 2022, will be equivalent to 3.5% to 3.7% of the share capital of Puma, which has been performing strongly, thanks in part to sports partnerships including with English soccer club Manchester United, and celebrity marketing deals..
Puma raised its sales and profit forecasts in July, and its shares have been on a roll, reaching record highs in early September. Puma shares were down 2.6% on Wednesday in early trading, while Kering's fell 0.7%. 
Kering said in its statement that the initial exchange price set for the bonds would represent an exchange premium of 30%-35% over a reference share price for Puma.
Executives at the French luxury group had said in July that Kering was looking at ""alternatives"" for its Puma stake given how the shares had rallied, but added that the company did not intend to dispose of all of it.

1361,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 04:58AM ET</span>",Thyssenkrupp Plans to Replace CEO as Pressure Grows,"(Bloomberg) -- Thyssenkrupp AG plans to fire Chief Executive Officer Guido Kerkhoff after only a year on the job as the ailing engineering conglomerate faces pressure to speed up its turnaround.
Members of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board lost confidence in Kerkhoff’s leadership and believed he was moving too slowly on executing a revamp that included selling divisions of the sprawling steel-to-submarines manufacturer, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
The company’s personnel committee plans to start negotiations to dismiss Kerkhoff, according to a company statement on Tuesday evening. Martina Merz, the supervisory board chairwoman, will take over the CEO duties on an interim basis, but not more than 12 months. Siegfried Russwurm would fill in for Merz as chairman.
The overhaul at the top adds to the chaos at embattled Thyssenkrupp, which is already struggling in the face of an ailing auto industry, trade concerns, falling steel prices and a weakening German economy. Its share price has been cut in half since the start of 2018, and the company plans to raise much-needed cash by selling a stake in or publicly listing the elevator unit.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) shares fell 1.7% to 12.26 euros at 9:04 a.m. in Frankfurt.
‘Stay Away’
”Tough times are getting tougher for Thyssenkrupp,” said Christian Obst, an analyst at Baader Bank. “We recommend to stay away from any investment.”
Thyssenkrupp said the board will meet soon to discuss the committee’s recommendation and make a decision. These steps are largely a formality before the company moves on the leadership changes.
The tradition-rich icon of German industry shied away from hiring an external chief for now to speed up the execution of the strategy overhaul. Kerkhoff has long faced pressure internally to whittle down and restructure the company’s sprawling business portfolio.
Some members of the supervisory board were frustrated by the pace of the restructuring for several divisions, including components technology, steel and industrial plant-building, according to the people familiar with the matter.
Strategic U-Turn
Thyssenkrupp in May announced a strategic u-turn that foresees selling a stake in its prized elevator unit and reviewing other operations including springs and stabilizers from the auto-parts unit, the system engineering and the heavy plate operations as well as trimming overhead structures.
Several private equity firms have expressed interest in these activities, but Kerkhoff has solely focused on an elevator transaction to boost the company’s equity cushion before turning to the other units.
Frustrated with Kerkhoff’s slow pace, several board members informally discussed a potential replacement for Kerkhoff already over summer because the company’s financial crisis may require an executive with restructuring experience, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News at the time.
Thyssenkrupp’s elevator unit may be worth about 15 billion euros ($16.6 billion), according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. Potential suitors for the division -- a high-margin business that’s profiting from urbanization around the world -- include rivals like Kone Oyj and about 10 private equity firms.
Kerkhoff had signaled to private-equity bidders that he would prefer to sell a minority stake in the elevator unit to them. That way, the company could retain some control and skirt the kind of anti-competitive regulatory roadblocks that torpedoed a planned steel joint venture with Tata Steel Ltd.

Relatively muted swings and a wide price gap between bullish and bearish options bets means it is attractive to sell a medium-term put on the S&P 500 Index and buy a shorter-dated call, strategists including Gonzalo Asis and Stefano Pascale wrote in a note Tuesday.
Such trades generally outperform if the underlying index breaks higher and they are cheaper than simply purchasing calls until any equity sell-off reaches about 5%, a rare occurrence, the strategists said. As of Tuesday morning, the entry point for their preferred trade was the most attractive in 18 years, they added.
“At today’s levels, we like calendar risk reversals for equity replacement to position for a breakout higher in U.S. equities while reducing exposure to moderate drawdowns,” they wrote. “It is clearly the preferred trade when the S&P is flat to mildly lower.”
U.S. stocks sold off and volatility rose Tuesday as the Democrat-controlled House opened a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. While the move added to a raft of investor concerns including trade tensions and disappointing economic data, by some measures implied volatility is above its realized counterpart.
The Bank of America team suggests investors look at selling three-month puts to buy a one-month call, and recommended closing the trade when the shorter-dated option expires. That fits with their bullish view on risk assets amid a myriad of headwinds and risks, they said.
“Our house view remains bullish risk assets, but an abundance of headwinds and risks are challenging a stronger move higher in U.S. equities,” they said. “Have your equity cake without ‘eating it’ if risks materialize.”"

ZURICH (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group repeatedly provided false reports about the real owners of its former stake in duty free group Dufry (S:DUFN), Swiss markets watchdog FINMA said, calling it a ""serious breach of disclosure obligations"".
""FINMA will be registering a complaint with the Criminal Law Division of the Federal Department of Finance,"" the markets supervisor said on Wednesday. It concluded that HNA submitted six incorrect reports to the SIX Swiss Exchange between April 2017 and February 2019.
FINMA's report marks the latest instance in which Swiss officials have found fault in HNA Group's reporting after concluding in 2017 that the Chinese travel conglomerate gave ""untrue"" details during its takeover of airline caterer Gategroup.
HNA sold Gategroup this year to RRJ Capital, but owns Swiss cargo handling unit Swissport.
With Dufry, FINMA found HNA Group Chairman Feng Chen and former co-Chairman Jian Wang, who died in 2018 after suffering a fall while traveling in France, should have been named as the shareholders behind the Dufry stake, not the Hainan Province Cihang Foundation that they founded.
FINMA Enforcement Division Chief Patric Eymann said Swiss law requires transparent disclosure to ensure fairness for all investors.
""The market needs transparency when it comes to who is actually behind qualified stakes taken in listed companies,"" Eymann said. ""The actual control situation must be disclosed in Switzerland so that the stakeholders in question cannot be concealed through opaque structures and technicalities, as was the case here.""

The local units of JPMorgan, Citi and Deutsche all worked on a share issue for the country's then third-largest bank Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) in 2015.
Last year, the ACCC brought charges against Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of those companies' top employees alleging they colluded to keep from regular shareholders the fact that the issue was undersubscribed.
The previously undisclosed involvement of witnesses who worked at JPMorgan, which was not charged, raises the chances the case will involve global investment banks testifying against each other when it goes to trial, as well as defending themselves against government prosecutors.
The lawyer for Citi's former Australia head, Stephen Roberts, named as witnesses Richard Galvin, JPMorgan's former head of equity and derivative capital markets, and Jeffrey Herbert-Smith, JPMorgan's former managing director and head of markets, in an application to be allowed to cross-examine them.
Roberts' lawyer, Robert Dick, told the court he wanted to question the two ex-JPMorgan people on written statements about Roberts' participation in a phone call at the time of the capital raising.
Herbert-Smith's statement gave only limited detail about Roberts' involvement in the phone call while Galvin's statement made ""no reference to Mr Roberts saying anything at all"", Dick told the court.
""Is this a case that says 'by silence Mr Roberts is said to have consented to something'?"" Dick said.
""We should be entitled to know.""
Between the two witness statements, ""there's not a shred of material that explains to us what that involves,"" Dick said.
A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment, while Galvin and Herbert-Smith did not respond to requests for comment on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD). Both left the bank in 2016.
Lawyers for Citi, Deutsche and ANZ also said they want to cross-examine the ACCC's general manager of financial services competition, Leah Won, also named publicly as a witness for the first time. An ACCC spokeswoman declined to comment on Won's behalf.
Prosecution lawyers said they would respond to requests to allow their witnesses to be cross-examined when the matter returns to court on Sept. 27.
All the people and companies charged in the case have said they will plead not guilty, but no trial date has been set."
1372,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 12:45AM ET</span>","WeWork's Neumann surrenders control, CEO role following investor revolt","By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann agreed on Tuesday to resign as CEO and give up majority voting control, after SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) and other shareholders turned on him over a plunge in the U.S. office-sharing start-up's estimated valuation.
Neumann's dramatic fall from grace came after WeWork parent We Company postponed its initial public offering last week following push-back from prospective investors in its stock, not just over its widening losses but also over Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.
This was a blow for SoftBank, which was hoping for We Company's IPO to bolster its fortunes as it seeks to woo investors for its second giant Vision Fund, totaling $108 billion.
SoftBank invested in We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January. But investor skepticism led to We Company considering earlier this month a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.
We Company had vowed to press ahead with an IPO by the end of the year. But there was little sign that IPO investor sentiment would change, threatening the value of the stakes held not just by outside investors, but by Neumann as well.
What was the venture capital world's biggest upset then morphed into one of corporate America's most high-profile boardroom dramas.
SoftBank managed to muster enough opposition to Neumann in a meeting of We Company's seven-member board on Tuesday to convince him to step down. Reuters had reported on Monday that Neumann had engaged in talks about changes to his role.
""In recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,"" Neumann said in a statement.
Artie Minson, currently chief financial officer of We Company, and Sebastian Gunningham, a vice chairman for the New York-based start-up, will become co-chief executives, the company said. Neumann will stay on the board as non-executive chairman, the company added.
Minson, a former chief financial officer of Time Warner Cable who joined We Company in 2015, will oversee its finance, legal, human resources, real estate and public communications. Gunningham, a former executive at Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) who joined We Company last year, will take responsibility for product, design, development, sales, marketing, technology and regional teams.
We Company is considering slowing its expansion so it burns through less cash and would require less funding in the absence of an IPO in the near team, Reuters reported on Monday. The company is also contemplating laying off staff, according to a person familiar with the deliberations.
""While we anticipate difficult decisions ahead, each decision will be made with rigorous analysis, always bearing in mind the company's long-term interests and health,"" Minson and Gunningham wrote in an internal company memo seen by Reuters.
Neumann also agreed to reduce the power of his voting shares, losing majority voting control, according to the sources. Each of his shares will now have the same voting rights as three We Company common shares, not the 10 common shares previously, the sources said.
Neumann's shares used to have the same voting power as 20 We Company common shares, before he agreed to reduce his grip slightly earlier this month in an unsuccessful attempt to make the IPO more attractive to investors.
Neumann's wife Rebekah also found herself without a job at We Company as part of the changes, one of the sources said. She was co-chief brand and impact officer.
She is also the founder and CEO of WeGrow, an elementary school set up by We Company. However, We Company has decided to do away with such ventures that are not core to the WeWork brand, the source added. We Company declined to comment on Rebekah Neumann's role.
We Company said on Tuesday it was now evaluating the ""optimal timing"" for an IPO.
FIRM GRIP
Neumann, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $2.2 billion, developed a cult following among many We Company employees, vowing to ""elevate the world's consciousness"" as he sought to establish WeWork as a brand that transcended office sharing.
While his investors were willing to entertain his eccentricities over the decade he led WeWork since its founding in 2010, his free-wheeling ways and party-heavy lifestyle came into focus once he failed to get the company's IPO underway.
During the attempts to woo IPO investors this month, Neumann was criticized by corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.
These included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.
Neumann had also entered several transactions with We Company, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.
LATE CONCESSIONS
Following criticism by potential investors, Neumann agreed to some concessions without relinquishing majority control. He agreed to give We Company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has reached with the New York-based firm.
These changes did little to address concerns about the business model for We Company, which rents workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent under long-term leases. This mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue raised questions among investors about how the company would weather an economic downturn.
Neumann, 40, is not the first founder of a major start-up to be forced to step down recently.  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing start-up in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture.
Uber replaced Kalanick with an outsider, former  Expedia  Group Inc (O:EXPE) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and completed its IPO in May."
1373,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2019 12:08AM ET</span>",Collapse of Thomas Cook Is a Reality Check for China's Fosun,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.
The collapse of Fosun Group’s flagship European investment, Thomas Cook, is proving to be a reality check for the Chinese conglomerate’s ambitions to create a global travel empire via flashy acquisitions.
After months of talks to hammer out a $1.1 billion bailout package, Shanghai-based Fosun -- the biggest shareholder in Thomas Cook Group Plc -- decided against committing any more money toward rescuing the British inventor of the package vacation. For want of an additional 200 million pounds ($249 million) demanded by creditors, the indebted tour operator filed for liquidation this week.
Thomas Cook’s Final Adventure Ends in Early-Morning Liquidation
Banking on a boom in Chinese outbound travel, particularly to Europe, Fosun’s pursuit of Thomas Cook made sense initially. But its reluctance to see the deal through shows the company may be reconsidering a game plan that saw it buy about $18 billion of assets over the last five years at home and abroad, including iconic French resorts brand Club Med SAS in 2015.
With the global economy cooling and the trade war altering the landscape for offshore acquisitions, the Thomas Cook setback could also signal a pause in the wider plans of Hong Kong-listed Fosun, which has assets spanning brewing to fashion labels.
“Fosun is facing the headwinds of a slowdown,” said Andrew Collier, managing director at Oriental Capital Research Inc. in Hong Kong. “It’s a difficult time to be expanding.”
Led by billionaire Guo Guangchang and founded in 1992, Fosun has lately been focusing on hospitality, health care and finance -- businesses its chairman prefers to refer to as happiness, health and wealth. They operate broadly under its listed units Fosun International Ltd., Fosun Tourism Group and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co.
What Bloomberg Opinion Says
It’s almost impossible for investors to calculate Fosun’s return on capital at the brand level, or discern which part of its acquisition strategy is actually working.
In the long term, the company’s opaque structure will only derail its ambitions as an investment powerhouse.
--Bloomberg Opinion columnist Shuli Ren
Fosun is the last of the few Chinese conglomerates still chasing overseas deals, while giants such as HNA Group Co., Dalian Wanda Group Co. and Anbang Insurance Co. have been reined in and are selling off assets to pare hefty leverage piles racked up by offshore acquisition sprees. Total debt at Fosun International stood at $28 billion as of June 30, compared with cash and equivalents at $22 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In the tourism space, Fosun started expanding by acquiring control of Club Med in 2015 after a protracted takeover battle. Later the same year is bought the stake in Thomas Cook.
After building an 18% holding in the London-based company, Fosun was seeking to replicate its model at Club Med -- the once flagging resorts brand -- by tapping wealthy Chinese tourists traveling to destinations in Europe. Official data show about 150 million travelers from China traveled overseas last year.
As China’s Economy Slows, Why the World Should Care: QuickTake
But sputtering growth in the world’s second-biggest economy means a dip in demand. China’s slowdown, partly triggered by the fight over trade with the U.S., has hit consumer spending, factory output and the job market. A weaker yuan has also added to concerns over tourism and spending.
It isn’t just China that is under pressure. Parts of Europe are in recession or close to it, with World Bank President David Malpass saying this month the global economy is poised to decelerate more than previously estimated. Brexit has also roiled the U.K.
Failing Business
Going after an already flailing business like Thomas Cook wasn’t a great strategy for Fosun, said Brock Silvers, managing director at investment advisory firm Kaiyuan Capital in Shanghai. Sinking under the weight of debt from deals made a decade ago, Thomas Cook had trouble keeping up with rivals as the travel business shifted online and the package holidays it made its name with fell out of favor.
“Thomas Cook was massively indebted, bleeding red ink, with an outdated business model and no obvious fit with Fosun’s portfolio,” Silvers said. The latest developments raise concerns over Fosun’s deal-making, making the conglomerate look “unfocused and undisciplined,” he said.
A representative for Fosun declined to comment. Fosun had said last month it won’t spend more than the 450 million pounds it committed to the bailout, and any additional amount needs to come from others such as core lending banks. The Financial Times, citing insolvency documents, reported that Thomas Cook was facing demands of almost 500 million pounds from hotel partners and creditors at the end of September.
Position Unchanged
In a statement on Monday -- hours after Thomas Cook filed for bankruptcy -- Fosun said it was disappointed Thomas Cook couldn’t find a viable solution to secure the extra capital it needed. “Fosun confirms that its position remained unchanged throughout the process, but unfortunately other factors have changed,” it said.
Shares of Fosun Tourism, which led the Thomas Cook rescue negotiations, fell 0.1% in Hong Kong as of 11:52 a.m. Wednesday, after slumping almost 7% in the first two days of the week. They have dropped 39% this year, compared with a gain of less than 1% for the benchmark Hang Seng Index.
Thomas Cook isn’t the only troubled acquisition under Fosun. Folli Follie, a Greek retailer in which it is the second-biggest shareholder, is battling a crisis after a hedge fund disputed its sales figures last year and shorted the stock.
And Fosun still has other deals in the works. It plans to buy assets in the mining industry as well, with a consortium led by the group in talks to acquire a majority stake in a Russian gold miner -- a deal could value the target at about $1 billion -- people familiar with the matter said in June. Fosun has about $2.2 billion of pending deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In an interview in May, Kevin Xie, Fosun’s chief representative in the U.S., said the conglomerate is easing up on investments in the U.S. because of growing regulatory scrutiny from the trade war, and is shifting its focus to emerging markets.
“The global atmosphere is now less favorable for China’s outbound investors,” Silvers said. “Chinese conglomerates face increased skepticism, and potential partners will now find little comfort in Fosun’s interaction with Thomas Cook.”"

(Reuters) - Asian countries are looking for catalysts beyond China to drive their economies as the Sino-U.S. trade war forces Chinese demand for their exports to shrink.
Luring foreign companies to their shores, finding ways to boost domestic consumption and scouring for alternate export markets are part of that policy mix as China's neighbors cope with flagging demand from the mainland, hitherto a large market for Asia in the regional supply chain.
Thailand has unveiled a ""relocation package"" comprising tax incentives and changes in laws to attract foreign firms.
Malaysia set up a panel to fast-track investments to woo businesses, and said it approved more than $500 million in proposals this month.
Indonesia's central bank cut its benchmark interest rates for the third time in three months last week, while also announcing measures to prop up domestic spending. India and the Philippines have cut rates multiple times.
(Graphic: Asian exports to China - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5238/5195/Asian%20exports%20to%20China.jpg)
Exports to China from Asia have slowed this year, prompting the sellers to look for substitute markets. Japan and South Korea saw their exports to China fall in the first half, but their shipments to the United States, United Kingdom and Russia rose during that period.
Malaysia and Thailand's exports to markets such as United States, Singapore and Vietnam grew.
""Efforts to look for unconventional markets have seen an increase in shipments to countries like Chile, Qatar, and Sri Lanka,"" Bank Indonesia deputy governor Dody Budi Waluyo told Reuters.
""We have diversified our export destinations so we can cover the disappearing shipments to China or to America.""

A Reuters analysis of eight major economies including South Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan showed the contribution of export revenue from China to the total GDP fell to 8% at the end of 2019's first half, compared with 9.3% a year earlier.

Meanwhile, domestic demand added 0.7 percentage point to Japan's GDP growth of 1.8% in the second quarter, more than offsetting the 0.3 point negative contribution from external demand.
Malaysia's economy saw solid growth of 4.9% in the second quarter, on the back of strong private consumption.
""Economic growth is showing signs of slowing in emerging Asia, partly due to trade tensions. However, domestic private consumption is holding up well,"" OECD said in a July report.
SUPPLY CHAIN SHIFT
A recent trend of Asian companies shutting factories in China and shifting them home would help lower their dependence on China, economists said.
According to a Nomura note this month , Taiwanese companies such as  Flexium  Interconnect (TW:6269) and  Quanta  Computer (TW:2382), South Korean firm SK Hynix (KS:000660) and Japanese firms such as Mitsubishi Electric (T:6503) and Toshiba Machine (T:6104) are looking to move production back to home from China.
Also, some U.S. and European companies are shifting their factories from China to other lower-cost countries such as Vietnam, Philippines and Cambodia.
German sportswear group Puma (DE:PUMG) has moved some of its production to Vietnam and Bangladesh from China, while U.S. retailers like Gap Inc (N:GPS), Steve Madden Ltd (O:SHOO) and Macy's Inc (N:M) are also moving out of China.
India is targeting companies including Apple (O:AAPL), Foxconn (TW:2354) and Wilstrong Crop (TW:3231), according to a document seen by Reuters.
(Graphic: FDI into Asia - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5669/5619/fdi%20into%20Asia.jpg)
Foreign direct investment (FDI) has risen sharply in some of these low-cost markets in the region, bolstering their current account balances and helping give more room for their central banks to cut policy rates this year.
FDI into Vietnam climbed to $12 billion in the first eight months of 2019, from $11.25 billion a year earlier. Malaysia and Thailand have also seen an increase in FDI.
(Graphic: Comparative advantages of Asia's supply chains - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5670/5620/comparative%20advantages.jpg)
Tommy Wu, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said production processes that require high skills would move to economies such as South Korea and Taiwan while others would likely go to countries such as India and Vietnam.
    ""Even before the U.S-China trade war, a lot of companies had been looking to relocate due to rising production costs in China. But then, the U.S.-China trade war is a stimulating factor to speed up this whole process."""

And subscribe to Terms of Trade, our daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
Vietnam’s campaign to tamp down the Trump administration’s trade gap ire has come to a coastal commune better known for growing dragon fruit along one-lane potholed roads.
The community could soon be home to a $5 billion liquefied natural gas project that would include an import terminal and gas-fired power plant and eventually import billions of dollars of U.S. fuel into the country. It’s being fast-tracked with the blessing of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc as part of a push to buy American products in Vietnam, where the Communist government has embarked on a crash course in modern U.S. politics.
“I’ve never seen the Vietnamese government move so quickly,” said John Rockhold, an engineer with 28 years experience shepherding infrastructure projects in Vietnam. He is country director of Energy Capital Vietnam, which is leading a consortium of companies backing the development on salt beds in southern Binh Thuan province. “I think they see LNG as a way of lowering the trade deficit the U.S. has with Vietnam. There is a lot of pressure from the White House right now.”
Indeed, the nation’s leaders are doing all they can to avoid China’s fate after President Donald Trump in June described Vietnam as “almost the single worst abuser of everybody” when asked if he wanted to impose tariffs on the nation. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer “has a scoreboard: if you have a trade surplus with the U.S. of over $10 billion, you are in the middle of his dart board,” said Ernest Bower, president of Fairfax, Virginia-based Bower Group Asia, which advises businesses on operating in Southeast Asia.
Under pressure from the U.S., Vietnam is also cracking down on the fake labeling of Chinese goods being routed through the Southeast Asian country to bypass Trump’s tariffs.
Vietnam has become perhaps Asia’s biggest beneficiary of the U.S.-China trade war as companies including Nintendo Co (T:7974). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google shift production to the country. So Vietnamese officials, from the politburo to local governments, are looking for ways to trim the nation’s trade surplus with the U.S., which hit $40 billion in 2018. That gap totaled $30 billion in the first seven months of this year, 39% higher than in the same period last year, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
“If we buy more from the U.S., it will surely help boost our relationship with them,” said Mai Anh Tung, a government official in Binh Thuan province, where the LNG project involving companies such as  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co., KBR Inc. and Korea Gas is planned.
Coal, Engines
Vietnam’s Communist Party Secretary and President Nguyen Phu Trong is expected to visit the White House next month with a deal list for made-in-America products. Think natural gas from Texas, coal from Pennsylvania, pork from Iowa, and even aircraft engines -- a shopping cart that could total billions of dollars. It’s no coincidence that many of these products come from regions that are important to Trump’s re-election hopes in 2020.
“They have hired trade advisers,” Bower said. “They’ve learned you have to have a game in Washington.”
This isn’t the first time Trump has pressured Vietnam on trade. The U.S. president prodded Vietnamese leaders to buy U.S. military equipment during his 2017 visit to the country, reminding his hosts that he would face re-election. Vietnam, which until 2016 was barred from buying U.S. military weapons systems, has received training from the U.S. on navigating America’s procurement process, said Tuong Vu, a professor of political science at the University of Oregon.
Vietnam’s one-party government can influence decisions of private companies, state-owned enterprises and local authorities, such as those overseeing the LNG project in Binh Thuan province, 212 kilometers (132 miles) northeast of Ho Chi Minh City. The project will buy U.S. LNG, though discussions with suppliers haven’t begun yet, Rockhold said.
“If private companies support the policies of the government, the government can support the private companies in other ways,” said Le Dang Doanh, a Hanoi-based economist and former government adviser. “All the tycoons in Vietnam are well-connected with the leadership of the government.”
In fact, Phuc hasn’t been shy about his U.S. shopping spree. He made a beeline for the U.S. president at the Group of 20 summit in Japan for an impromptu huddle, promising to buy “large volumes” of LNG. The country’s total LNG demand is estimated to reach 4 million tons a year by 2030, according to BloombergNEF analysts. Importing all of that fuel from the U.S. -- valued at about $1.5 billion a year -- would equal 3.7% of the country’s 2018 trade surplus with America.
This month Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. announced a non-binding term sheet that could lead to the first deal to supply U.S. gas to Vietnam for a Mekong Delta power plant. The agreement, which could result in $30 billion of exports from the U.S. over the 25-year project, would “help balance Vietnam’s trade surplus with the U.S.,” Singapore-based Delta Offshore Energy PTE LTD, which plans to build the plant, said in a press release.
Phuc in a January interview promised that his country would buy more Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. aircraft. A month later, during Trump’s visit to Hanoi to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, Vietnam’s Bamboo Airways and VietJet Aviation JSC signed agreements to purchase 110 Boeing jets. State-owned Vietnam Airlines JSC says it is considering an order for 50-100 737 Max.
“Doing business with U.S. partners is safe and it can help develop the relationship between Vietnam and the U.S.,” Bamboo Airways Chairman Trinh Van Quyet said.
In August, state-run Vietnam National Coal-Mineral Industries announced it was negotiating to buy U.S. coal for the first time from Xcoal Energy & Resources LLC, which is based in Pennsylvania, a state expected to play a pivotal role in the 2020 election and which Trump won in 2016.
Pork Shortage
Meanwhile, Nestor Scherbey, a licensed U.S. customs broker and consultant based in Ho Chi Minh City, is working with U.S. meat suppliers to help fill an estimated 500,000-ton pork shortage -- valued at $1.29 billion -- expected between now and the Tet Lunar New Year amid a swine fever epidemic that has reduced Vietnam’s hog population.
“You’ll start seeing things like packaged ham shipped from Texas in Vietnam supermarkets,” he said.
Vietnamese consumers already favor American products. The nation imported more than $3.1 billion in U.S. electronics, such as iPhones and Dell Technologies Inc. laptops, in the first eight months of the year, a 52% increase from last year, according to government statistics. U.S. vegetable and fruit imports have soared 72% as Washington Gala apples and Thompson seedless grapes are showing up in supermarket checkout lines.
Still, with an average annual per capita income of 58.5 million dong ($2,522), boosting other pricey imports isn’t a given. Alaskan lobster, which sells for the equivalent of $56 per kilogram in Ho Chi Minh City, and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s Explorer sport utility vehicle, with a price tag of about $97,700 in Vietnam, are out of reach for most Vietnamese consumers.
Vietnam’s efforts to boost imports from the U.S. faces another complication: Trump’s decision to exit the 12-nation transpacific trade deal. The pact will eventually slash 90% of tariffs from nations such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Canada -- putting U.S. exports at a disadvantage, said Fred Burke, managing partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie.
“Many of the most significant tariff reductions will begin taking effect in the run-up to the presidential election in the U.S.,” he said.

Political uncertainty in the U.S. rose after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced overnight a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump. 
“The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of integrity of our elections,” Pelosi said in remarks to the nation. “Therefore, today, I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I’m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.”
The move came as the president promised to release a transcript of his phone call with Ukraine's president. The phone call has sparked questions of whether the Administration was trying to bully the eastern European country into investigating former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
Trump quickly fired off multiple tweets in response to Pelosi, calling her accusation as “witch hunt” and “presidential harassment.”
“Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!” he said. 
Meanwhile, renewed Sino-U.S. trade concerns are also weighing on investor sentiment.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Trump said he will not accept a “bad deal” in trade talks with China, while slamming Beijing for “unfair trade practices.”
“Hopefully we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial for both countries. But as I have made very clear I will not accept a bad deal for the American people,” Trump said."

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou returned to a Vancouver court on Tuesday as her lawyers argued that Canadian authorities abused their powers and violated her rights to gather evidence against her, a claim the government denies.
Meng, 47, was detained at Vancouver's airport on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business in Iran. She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.
Meng was searched and questioned by border officials at the airport after she landed on a flight from Hong Kong. However, it was not until three hours after her arrival that Canadian police arrested Meng and her constitutional rights were invoked.
On Tuesday, the second day of a hearing before Justice Heather Holmes in British Columbia Supreme Court, Meng lawyers continued to push for more disclosure from the government about her detention and arrest.
Evidence shows police originally planned to board Meng's flight from once it landed in Vancouver and arrest her, her lawyers said, noting the warrant called for immediate arrest. However, that plan changed after a meeting between border and police officials, although the reasons for the change were not clear and, they said, resulted in Meng's constitutional rights being violated. 
Meng lawyer Richard Peck told the judge no one answered Meng when she repeatedly asked border officials why she was being detained. ""She was not told she was the subject of an arrest warrant,"" Peck said. ""She was not told this was a warrant that came out of the U.S. that had to do with activities some years ago.""
As her lawyers spoke, Meng sat next to an interpreter in the well of the courtroom, wearing a short black dress with glittering sequins around the neckline and sleeves. An electronic monitoring device was strapped to her left ankle.
Meng's lawyers plan to complete their arguments on Wednesday and counsel for the Attorney General of Canada is expected to tell the judge the government view when the hearing resumes on Monday. 
The extradition hearing itself is set to begin in January in a legal effort that could go on for years.
'FISHING EXPEDITION'
The defense claims that, if the process was abused, it justifies halting extradition proceedings. The government claims Meng's lawyers have not shown her claims could stop the proceedings. In its filing, it called the defense's effort for more disclosure a ""fishing expedition.""
At Tuesday's hearing, Scott Fenton, another Meng lawyer, told the judge authorities committed ""serious violations"" of Meng's charter rights when border officials gathered evidence for the Canadian police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, including seizing Meng's phones and getting her to reveal their passwords.
""There was no legitimate reason for the warrant not to be executed according to the terms,"" Fenton said, referring to plans to arrest her immediately upon arrival.
Fenton said Meng had a right to be free from arbitrary detention and from unreasonable search and seizure, a right to understand the reason for her detention, a right to counsel and a right to silence. 
In a filing released on Monday, the attorney general of Canada said there was no evidence border officials or police acted improperly, or that the conduct of Canadian or foreign officials compromised the fairness of the extradition proceedings.
The arrest has strained China's relations with both the United States and Canada. In Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry reiterated the government's call for Meng to be released and allowed to return to China.
Meng's lawyers say the United States is using the CFO for economic and political gain, noting that after her arrest, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would intervene if it would help close a trade deal. 
Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, spent 10 days in jail in December but was then released on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail and is living in one of her two multimillion-dollar homes in Vancouver. 

Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, has been accused by the United States of activities contrary to national security or foreign policy interests. It is also a defendant in the U.S. case against Meng. Huawei denies the charges.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2019 07:12PM ET</span>",Hydrogen hurdles: a deadly blast hampers South Korea's big fuel cell car bet,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Jane Chung
SEOUL (Reuters) - Aiming to cash in on a major push by South Korea to promote fuel cell vehicles, Sung Won-young opened a hydrogen refueling station in the city of Ulsan last September. Just one year on, he's thinking about closing it down.
Sung's new hydrogen station is one of five in Ulsan, home to  Hyundai Motor  Co's (KS:005380) main plants and roughly 1,100 fuel cell cars - the most of any South Korean city.
The government paid the 3 billion won ($2.5 million) cost - six times more than fast charging equipment for battery electric cars - and the two pumps, located next to Sung's gasoline stand, see a steady flow of Hyundai Nexo SUVs daily.
Even so, Sung hasn't been able to turn a profit, hamstrung as the equipment can only refuel a limited number of cars each day and by the government's decision to set retail hydrogen prices low to bring consumers on board.
""All hydrogen stations will have no choice but to shut down unless the government subsidizes operating costs,"" Sung, 32, told Reuters. ""Otherwise, this place will just become a 3 billion won chunk of steel.""
If those impediments to commercial viability were not enough, a fatal hydrogen storage tank explosion this year has spurred protests against the government and Hyundai's ambitious campaign to promote the zero-emissions fuel.
Calling hydrogen power the ""future bread and butter"" of Asia's No. 4 economy, President Moon Jae-in has declared himself an ambassador for the technology and targeted 850,000 fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) on South Korean roads by 2030.
That's no mean feat given fewer than 3,000 have been sold so far. Japan, also a big proponent of FCVs and with an auto market three times larger, plans 800,000 in the same timeframe.
The challenges of building out refueling infrastructure in South Korea underscore the long and uphill battle FCVs face to widespread adoption at a time when electric cars are stealing much of the green car limelight.
And for the government and Hyundai, the only automaker selling a fuel cell car in the country, it is an expensive project with no guarantee of success.
Moon is set to spend $1.8 billion in central government funds to subsidize car sales and to build refueling stations for the five years to 2022 at current subsidy levels, Reuters calculations show.
Subsidies cut Nexo's price by half to about 35 million won ($29,300) and sales of the model, launched in March 2018, have surged this year. In contrast, Japanese subsidies fund one third of Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) Mirai FCV, bringing its price to around $46,200.
Some critics argue Hyundai is the main beneficiary of the government's ardent backing, but the automaker also has much at stake. With its suppliers, it plans to invest $6.5 billion by 2030 on hydrogen R&D and facilities.
""There are risks that come with the need to make large-scale investments in building (hydrogen car) production facilities, securing supply channels and establishing sales networks,"" Hyundai said in an e-mailed statement.

HIGH PRESSURE
In May, a hydrogen storage tank at a government research project in the rural city of Gangneung exploded. It destroyed a complex about half the size of a soccer field, killing two and injuring six. A preliminary investigation found the blast was caused by a spark after oxygen found its way into the tank.
""One victim was blown away by pressure and then killed after being hit by rock,"" said Kong Gikwang, a lawyer who represents the family of one of the two who died in a lawsuit against the research complex.
One month later, there was an explosion at a hydrogen refueling station in Norway. This week, a hydrogen gas leak and subsequent fire at a South Korean chemical plant caused three workers to suffer burns.
Such safety concerns have fueled protests by South Korean resident groups worried about hydrogen facilities being built in their areas.
Kim Jong-ho, who began a month-long hunger strike against a planned fuel cell power plant in the port city of Incheon two days before the Gangneung blast, said the explosion refocused attention from pollution risks of hydrogen production to safety. Incheon has since agreed to review the safety and environmental impact of the plant.
Potential station operators have also gotten cold feet since the explosions.
Pyeongtaek city in April picked two gasoline stand operators to run hydrogen stands but within three months, both decided to bow out, forcing the city to restart its search.
""At first, I had great interest. But once I looked closely, I realized the government was pushing for something that can't make profits,"" one of the prospective operators said, asking not to be identified.
""And I couldn't live worrying about whether there would be an explosion.""
To counter such fears, the government is holding briefings for residents, while Hyundai said it is working to convince consumers of hydrogen's safety with information promoted through Youtube and social media.
'VALLEY OF DEATH'
Despite government plans for 114 hydrogen stations - key for the widespread adoption of FCVs - to be built by end-2019, only 29 have been completed. Difficulties in gaining funds from local governments or businesses meant to help shoulder half the costs, delays in finding sites and opposition from residents have also hobbled efforts.
Those constructing the stations know they are in for a slog.
""There will be a period of going through the valley of death,"" Yoo Jong-soo, CEO of a consortium which has been tasked with building 100 stations but which does not expect to make money until 2025, said in a June presentation.
The consortium, which includes Hyundai, has also called on the government to subsidize operating costs for hydrogen stands. Such a move is under consideration, an industry ministry official told Reuters, declining to be identified as the plan has not been finalised.
""This will only increase the burden for taxpayers who have to pay for the government's hydrogen society splurge,"" said Ryu Yen-hwa, a former Hyundai Motor engineer and auto analyst who believes FCVs do not make commercial sense.
Just last month, Moon's administration announced it would more than double spending on the 'hydrogen economy' to over 500 billion won next year.
That includes 359 billion won on FCVs and refueling stations, up 52% from this year and a huge leap from the 29.8 billion won spent in 2018.
DRIVER FRUSTRATIONS
Hyundai, which touts the Nexo as an ""air purifier on the road"", is banking on Seoul's aggressive targets to help it achieve economies of scale and bring down costs.
It aims to cut the cost of a hydrogen car before subsidies to 50 million won once annual FCV production reaches 35,000. It hopes to make 40,000 per year by 2022, compared with plans for 11,000 next year.
In the meantime, however, the constraints around refueling and the limited number of stations are causing much frustration.
Hydrogen stand operator Sung said while refueling itself takes about 5-7 minutes, the next driver must wait another 20 minutes before sufficient pressure builds in the storage tank to supply the hydrogen or the car's tank will not be full.
    That means he can only service about 100 fuel cell cars a day, compared to up to 1,000 at his gasoline stand. Many drivers can also not be bothered to wait 20 minutes and leave without a full tank.
Choi Gyu-ho, who bought his Nexo to take advantage of low fuel prices, also noted that a lack of stations elsewhere made it hard to leave Ulsan.
""It is very inconvenient. I feel anxious when I drive out of the city,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc's (N:NKE) quarterly revenue and profit beat market expectations on Tuesday as a push to sell sneakers and apparels to consumers through its own stores and online retailers gained pace, boosting margins and sending its shares up 5%.
Wall Street has been bullish about Nike ever since the world's largest footwear maker unveiled ""Nike Direct,"" a strategy to focus on online sales, product launches and supply chain improvements to bring new products to shelves faster.
Nike has also launched pop-up stores that cater to ""sneakerheads"" or loyal fans of the brand in several big U.S. cities and opened flagships in New York and Beijing to build a strong relationship with its customers.
These efforts helped the company sell more products at full price, driving a 150 basis points expansion in gross margins in the first quarter to 45.7%, well above analysts' expectations. 
""When they sell through their own website, that's a very strong margin and that's growing very rapidly, becoming a bigger and bigger part of the business,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.
Nike said it expects gross margin to increase by roughly 25 basis points in the second quarter, when the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports are likely to be more pronounced.
""We nonetheless expand gross margin over the balance of the fiscal year, though of course not to the same level as we saw in Q1,"" Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion told analysts.
Shares of the Oregon-based company were up at $91.80 in extended trading, putting them on course for a record open on Wednesday.

CHINA DELIVERS 
Nike's popularity in China continued to power its revenue growth, especially at a time when rivals Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and  Under Armour  (N:UAA) ramps up in the United States, its biggest market.
Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker said the company has seen double-digit growth in Greater China every quarter for more than five years, in part helped by its digital initiatives.
Revenue from China rose 22% to $1.68 billion, but in North America it rose by a slower-than-expected 3.6%.
The results ""exemplify Nike's persistent defiance of retail gravity, led by China"", CFRA analyst Camilla Yanushevsky said.
Sales from its digital platform, which includes apps and websites, grew 42%.

Overall revenue rose 7.2% to $10.66 billion and it earned 86 cents per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $10.44 billion and profit of 70 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The state will block all sales of e-cigarettes and supplies, both those used for tobacco and marijuana, which is legal in the state, Governor Charlie Baker and state officials told a news conference.
The move goes further than New York state and Michigan, which earlier this month banned the sale of flavored vaping products, out of concern that those products appeal to children.
The ban, which applies to flavored and non-flavored products, took immediate effect and will last through Jan. 25, officials said.
""The use of e-cigarettes and marijuana vaping products is exploding and we are seeing reports of serious lung illnesses, particularly in our young people,"" Baker told a news conference.
The four-month period is intended to give medical experts time to determine what aspect of vaping is causing the illnesses and for the state to determine whether new regulations could allow for safer vaping products, Baker said. 
A mysterious lung disease linked to vaping has sickened at least 530 people in 38 states, and its toll is expected to rise, federal health officials told a congressional hearing on vaping on Tuesday.
The popularity of e-cigarettes has now grown to the point where one in four 12th-graders reported vaping a nicotine product during the previous 30 days. It is nearly one in 10 for 8th-graders, a study by the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor reported. 

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found that a growing number of Americans believe vaping is at least as harmful as smoking traditional cigarettes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) is facing fresh claims that it violated New York City's labor laws after the city sued the fast casual restaurant chain two weeks ago.
Employees from five additional stores filed complaints with the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection on Tuesday and walked off their jobs at lunchtime, according to Service Employees International Union 32BJ, the union organizing the workers.
The violations make it hard for fast-food workers to plan their lives, 32BJ President Kyle Bragg said in a statement.
""When fast food companies violate these provisions, workers lack the advance notice they need to plan other responsibilities such as second jobs, doctors' appointments or childcare,"" he said.
On Sept. 10, the city sued Chipotle, accusing it of violating its Fair Workweek Law by failing to provide schedules at least two weeks in advance and failing to pay premiums for last-minute schedule changes, among other claims.
The lawsuit stemmed from complaints by more than 30 workers at five Chipotle restaurants in Brooklyn. 
""Chipotle has been working cooperatively with the city to ensure we have systems and processes in place to comply with the law, so we believe the filing of charges was unnecessary,"" Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's chief corporate reputation officer, said in a statement at the time. 
""Regardless, we will continue to cooperate with the city and we are addressing any prior noncompliance concerns,"" she said.
Tuesday's complaints bring the total number of New York City Chipotle locations facing accusations to more than 20, 32BJ said.
The National Restaurant Association, the industry's main lobbying group, the International Franchise Association (IFA) and the New York State Restaurant Association have been fighting the city's law in court since December.
They argue the policy is prohibitively expensive for franchises, which are independently owned and operate more like a small business than a major corporation.
""The unaffordable costs associated with this well-intentioned policy make it a challenge for these franchise small businesses to operate, which unfortunately jeopardizes the livelihoods of the very employees it aims to protect,"" said IFA spokesman Stephen Worley. 

Seattle, the California cities of San Francisco, San Jose and Emeryville; and the state of Oregon have approved similar measures.

(Reuters) - Four Alabama men agreed to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges of insider trading related to the 2016 merger of the makers of Utz and Golden Flake potato chips, the regulator said on Tuesday.
The SEC said Birmingham real estate developer James Nall III had learned about privately-held Utz Quality Foods LLC's planned purchase of Golden Enterprises Inc from his father, a longtime Golden director.
It said Nall, known locally as ""Mr. Potato Chip"" because of his father's role, passed information about the merger to his close friend and business partner, and that the information was later passed on to three other men.
While Nall did not trade on the information, the SEC said the other men traded Golden stock before Hanover, Pennsylvania-based Utz announced its roughly $135 million purchase of the Birmingham company, generating about $437,000 of illegal profit.
The business partner Michael Hale Smith, his father Michael Dwaine Smith, his brother Robert Smith and his boss Walter Tutt agreed to pay a combined $936,000 in fines, disgorged profit and interest to settle with the SEC.
None admitted wrongdoing. Their lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A grand jury indicted a senior manager at  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) on charges he lied to regulators about diesel emissions, alleging the deception continued even after a scandal over cheating on government environmental tests had engulfed rival Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
The indictment of the Fiat Chrysler manager, unsealed Tuesday, said others ""known and unknown"" to the grand jury also criminally conspired to mislead regulators and customers about emissions in diesel-powered vehicles, a scheme they described in emails seized upon by U.S. Justice Department officials.
The charges came on the same day that prosecutors in Germany indicted Volkswagen's current and former CEOs and the company's board chairman on charges they failed to inform investors of that company's diesel-emissions fraud after they learned of it in 2015. Also on Tuesday, German automaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) agreed to pay 870 million euros in fines connected to a separate investigation of diesel emissions cheating.
Emanuele Palma, a senior manager of diesel drivability and emissions at Fiat Chrysler, faces charges of conspiracy, fraud, violating federal environmental law and making false statements stemming from work on Fiat Chrysler's emissions system in U.S. vehicles with diesel engines, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday. 
Palma, a 40-year-old Italian citizen, was arrested by the FBI Tuesday morning at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. In the afternoon, he appeared before a federal judge in Detroit in shackles, a hooded sweatshirt and sweatpants. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Stafford released him on a $10,000 unsecured bond and ordered him to surrender his passport. 
Prosecutors argued Palma represented a ""significant flight risk"" and sought unsuccessfully to have him placed under GPS monitoring. Palma's lawyer, Kenneth Mogill, argued his client has family in the Detroit area and is cooperating with prosecutors. 
The indictment describes what it refers to as a ""scheme"" to use sophisticated software tricks to deceive regulators about the emissions performance of diesel engines offered in Ram pickup trucks and Jeep sport-utility vehicles. 
Palma led a team of engineers who developed diesel engines and calibrated them with software allowing the vehicles to pollute less when undergoing government testing and more when driven on roads, U.S. officials said. 
After the disclosure of Volkswagen's emissions fraud in September 2015, the indictment states that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asked Fiat Chrysler for more testing of its diesel vehicles. In November 2015, the EPA warned Fiat Chrysler that it suspected some of its vehicles were using secret software to defeat emissions tests.
The indictment charges that months later, in a June 2016 meeting, Palma ""personally provided false and misleading representations"" to regulators. 
Before 2016, Palma worked for VM Motori SpA, a diesel engine manufacturer that was 50% owned by Fiat Chrysler until 2013, when it purchased the remainder of the company.
Fiat Chrysler, which has previously denied purposefully attempting to evade emissions requirements, said in a statement it would ""continue to fully cooperate with the authorities, as we have throughout this issue"" and declined to comment further.
""The indictment in this case should signal to corporations and individuals working for them that there are significant consequences for attempting to bypass U.S. emissions tests and defraud the American people,” said Special Agent in Charge Steven M. D'Antuono of the FBI’s Detroit Field Office in statement.
Fiat Chrysler's U.S.-listed shares (N:FCAU) lost 3 percent to $13 on Tuesday. Milan-listed shared closed down 2 percent.
SETTLED CIVIL CLAIMS
The developments in the U.S. criminal probe signal additional scrutiny of Fiat Chrysler's environmental practices on the horizon, despite the automaker's January settlement of civil claims stemming from the alleged emissions violations. 
Fiat Chrysler agreed to pay about $800 million to resolve civil claims from the Justice Department, state officials and customers alleging the company installed illegal software allowing more than 100,000 diesel-powered vehicles to dupe government emissions tests and then pollute beyond legal limits on the road. 
The settlement did not resolve any potential criminal liability, the Justice Department said when unveiling the agreement. 
Fiat Chrysler at the time said the settlement did not change the company's ""position that it did not engage in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat emissions tests.""
Defeat devices are hardware or software designed to stymie emissions controls, according to regulators. 
The renewed focus from U.S. prosecutors on Fiat Chrysler's alleged emissions violations follows cases against Volkswagen and a number of that automaker's current and former executives over use of illegal software to fool government diesel-emissions tests and mislead regulators and consumers. 
Volkswagen and some of its executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the scandal, and the German automaker paid billions of dollars in penalties. 
German prosecutors on Tuesday charged former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn and other company executives in the scandal. A Winterkorn lawyer said the former CEO rejected the claims. He was previously charged in the United States.
The indictment unsealed Tuesday says Palma and unnamed co-conspirators ""purposefully calibrated the emissions control system"" in Fiat Chrysler vehicles to produce lower emissions under federal test cycles and release higher amounts of nitrogen oxides during real world driving conditions. They concealed the those moves from U.S. environmental regulators, the indictment alleged. 

The alleged fraud allowed Palma and the unnamed co-conspirators to obtain a favorable fuel economy rating that made Fiat Chrysler vehicles more attractive to potential customers, the indictment said. Prosecutors alleged the conduct resulted in deceptive claims to customers that the vehicles featured ""clean EcoDiesel engines,"" the indictment said.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2019 04:11PM ET</span>",UAW-GM picket lines become 2020 U.S. presidential campaign battleground,"By Ben Klayman and David Shepardson
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is scheduled to join United Auto Workers members on a picket line in Detroit on Wednesday, underscoring the extent to which the longest auto worker strike in nearly 30 years has become a political event.
The U.S. senator from Vermont, an independent, joins a parade of Democrats who have met with some of the 48,000 striking hourly workers, using the walkout against General Motors Co (N:GM) to amplify their messages about income inequality and corporate power. Their oratory comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's vows to protect U.S. manufacturing jobs with tariffs on imported cars, and his frequent criticism of GM for shutting UAW-represented factories in Ohio and Michigan.
GM workers went on strike on Sept. 16, seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of GM's profit and protection of their healthcare benefits. Talks between the two sides continued on Tuesday.
The politicians' appearances at plants throughout the Midwest over the past week emphasize the importance of the UAW to winning in states that will be pivotal to the 2020 presidential election.
In 2016, Republican Trump convinced numerous UAW members to vote for him, helping him win Michigan, Ohio and other states. The UAW has traditionally supported Democratic candidates. The union and its members contributed almost $16 million during the 2012 election cycle when former President Barack Obama was re-elected, making it one of the most politically active groups tracked by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. However, UAW contributions dropped to less than $5.8 million in 2016.
UAW workers gave Trump a higher than normal share of their votes in 2016 - 32% of the almost 400,000 members by the union's reckoning.
""He is president because of this group of voters,"" Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California-Berkeley, said of blue-collar workers in the Midwest. ""The strike has become a symbol for how the U.S. might compete in the global economy.""
UAW officials are not commenting publicly about the visits, but they are closely watching the 2020 candidates to see who is most involved with the strike effort as an audition for winning the union's support.
On Sunday outside a GM plant in Kansas City, Kansas, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said, ""There used to be a basic deal in the old days. If you contributed to the welfare of the corporation you worked for, you got to share in the benefit ... That's not the deal anymore.
""We didn’t bail out GM, the UAW bailed out GM,"" he told the striking workers. ""You gave up more than anybody. That's why GM made it.""
In Detroit on the same day, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of Biden's rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, credited unions with building the middle class in America, but said the middle class was now under attack.
""GM is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or to the people of America,"" she told striking workers outside GM's Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. ""Their only loyalty is to their own bottom line and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.""
Other Democratic candidates who have visited striking workers include U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar and U.S. Representative Tim Ryan. Former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke is visiting UAW members in West Chester, Ohio, on Tuesday and Lordstown, Ohio, on Wednesday.
GM REJECTS CRITICISM
The White House has said it is not involved in the talks, but Trump has repeatedly demanded GM find a new vehicle for its now-shuttered assembly plant in Lordstown. That region in the northeastern part of the state historically supported Democrats in presidential races but backed Trump in 2016.
Democratic candidates and labor leaders have blasted GM's decision to stop paying healthcare benefits for striking UAW workers. The union's strike fund is supposed to pay for coverage during a walkout.
GM officials have tried to counter charges that they are abandoning U.S. workers, releasing details of an offer to the UAW that included the promise of investing $7 billion in U.S. plants, annual raises in a new four-year deal, increased profit sharing and retention of existing healthcare insurance.
GM officials have expressed frustration with the attacks by the UAW and politicians on the company's worker compensation.
""Criticism about the wages and benefits GM pays is unwarranted,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain said on Tuesday. ""The total compensation of our UAW workforce – including wages, profit sharing and benefits – is the highest in the U.S. auto industry.""
GM officials also privately say the decision on the health insurance was telegraphed well before the strike and no worker is without coverage thanks to the UAW strike fund.
Steven Bernstein, a management-side labor attorney from Tampa, Florida, said GM officials cannot afford to be drawn into a war of words.
""The best advice for management in circumstances like this is to make sure they don't lose sight of their end objective,"" he said."

(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) said on Tuesday it would invest as much as $1.6 billion over the next four years to turn around its business, raising concerns about its earnings and sending its shares lower.
In a presentation to investors, the company said its capital spending would range between $200 million and $250 million a year through 2022, including $225 million to $275 million to develop electric, middle and lightweight bikes.
Additionally, it would make an ""operating investment"" of $450 million to $550 million.
Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA, said the investments would reduce Harley's cash flow and pressure earnings.
""A lot of analysts had not included these kinds of numbers in their (earnings) estimates,"" he said.
Harley's shares were last trading down 3.7% at $34.11 in afternoon trade.
The Milwaukee-based company has been struggling to increase sales in the United States, its biggest market, where its core baby boomer customers are ageing and efforts to attract new and young riders have yet to show results.
To offset weak demand at home, it is trying to make deeper inroads into some of the fastest growing two-wheeler markets in Asia through lightweight motorcycles. The push is part of a strategy to get half of the company's revenue from overseas by 2027.
The company, known for its heavy touring motorcycles, expects the investment strategy to generate more than $1 billion of incremental annual revenue in 2022 as compared with 2017.
Harley expects the plan will expand its operating margins and add up to $250 million in operating profit in 2022.
The motorcycle maker said it would cut costs and reallocate resources to fund the investments."

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were set for their worst drops in one month on Tuesday as calls for impeachment of U.S. President Donald Trump gained momentum, while weak consumer confidence data added to worries over the prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war.
Losses in U.S. stocks accelerated, with the Dow Industrials (DJI) set for its sharpest drop in three weeks after U.S. Representative John Lewis on Tuesday became one of the most senior Democrat leaders in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin against Trump.
Calls from some Democrats for Trump's impeachment for trying to enlist a foreign power to smear a domestic opponent increased after a whistleblower from within the U.S. intelligence community lodged a complaint with an internal watchdog about a phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump denied that he had held back U.S. aid to Ukraine as leverage to initiate an investigation that would damage Democratic political rival Joe Biden.
""The situation between the President and what occurred in the Ukraine and of course possibly bringing charges towards (his) impeachment, I think that's what led to the selloff largely being run by the algorithms,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
Wall Street's major indexes lost footing earlier in the day as Trump took a harsh tone in addressing China's trade practices, while disappointing consumer confidence data raised concerns over the economic impact of a prolonged trade war between the two nations.
U.S. stocks had opened higher on positive comments on trade talks from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
The retail index slipped 1.3%, while a 2.2% drop in ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Nasdaq (IXIC).
The report is a bit of a concern, said Everett Millman, precious metals specialist at Gainesville Coins in Lutz, Florida, especially as ""consumer confidence has been pretty high at least in the U.S.""
Investors will now look to other data due later this week, including the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation, for more clues on the strength of the U.S. economy.
At 13:46 ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 187.54 points, or 0.70%, at 26,762.45, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 27.03 points, or 0.90%, at 2,964.75. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 118.36 points, or 1.46%, at 7,994.11.

Fiat Chrysler withdrew its $35 billion offer for Renault after blaming French politics for derailing the talks. The French state, which has a 15% stake in Renault, had welcomed the plan but pushed for guarantees and concessions that exhausted the patience of FCA, sources said at the time.
In the months since the deal was abandoned, the two groups had looked at ways to potentially revive it, sources have told Reuters, including by reshaping the Renault-Nissan alliance and the shareholding structure.
""This matter is behind us today,"" Senard told a hearing in the French senate, echoing similar remarks by Renault's CEO Thierry Bollore earlier in September.
The aborted project, which would have created the world's third-biggest carmaker, had caused a further headache for Renault at a time of already strained relations with its alliance partner Nissan.
The companies were rocked last year by the arrest in Japan of alliance architect Carlos Ghosn. He is now awaiting trial there on financial misconduct charges, which he denies, linked to his role as Nissan chairman.
The Renault-Nissan alliance was ""fundamental"", Senard said.
Carmakers are under pressure as sales falter on softening demand in markets like China and India. They are also grappling with more stringent rules on emissions and are racing to try and produce costlier, clean auto models, adding to pressures that might make alliances or mergers desirable.
A Renault-FCA tie-up would have helped to give the alliance with Nissan a more global dimension it lacks, Senard said.
""The matter is not on the table today. If (the project) were to come back one day on terms and conditions that would be acceptable for all parties I'd be delighted. But it's not in the works,"" he said.
Senard added that more consolidation in the auto sector in Europe would be needed to counter competition from China."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Netflix (O:NFLX) dropped nearly 4% on Tuesday and were on track for their deepest quarterly decline in seven years after two analysts added to growing worries about an impending wave of competition from Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) and other rivals.
Netflix has lost 30% since the end of June, and if that decline holds until Monday, it will have been the worst quarterly performance for the video streaming heavyweight's shares since 2012.
Upcoming streaming services from Walt Disney and Apple (O:AAPL) have added to worries about Netflix's slowing subscriber growth and rising costs as it increases spending to create top-tier series like ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"".
Viewed as the most dangerous threat to Netflix, Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12, with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the world's most popular entertainment franchises. Disney's shares are up 14% since April 11, when it unveiled its new service. Apple's Apple TV+ service debuts on Nov. 1, adding to competition from Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Hulu and others.
(Graphic: Netflix's stock reacts to growing competition, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6492/6423/Netflix.png)
Pointing to growing competition and higher costs, Pivotal Research on Tuesday slashed its price target for Netflix's stock to $350 from $515.
""Our new forecasts imply they are going to respond to content cost acceleration by revving up their own content spend that will allow them to maintain their subscriber growth while pushing back profitability materially,"" Pivotal analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak wrote in a client note.
In another report, KeyBanc Capital Markets warned that weak results or guidance when Netflix posts its third-quarter report on Oct. 16 could worsen investors' concerns about long-term growth.
""Only very significant upside in 3Q is likely to drive sustainable upside in the shares, and we have little to provide confidence in that outcome,"" KeyBanc equity research analyst Andy Hargreaves wrote.
Disney’s stock in the past month has traded at 23 times expected earnings, its highest forward earnings valuation since 2004, according to Refinitiv data. As investors reconsider the value of Netflix, its forward earnings multiple has tumbled to 52, the lowest since 2011, from 82 in early July.
Forty-five analysts cover Netflix's stock, with a median price target of $410, down from $420 in late June. Its current price target is 60% above Netflix's current price of $255."

(Reuters) - Six U.S. life insurers have agreed to pay a total of $1.83 million for improperly causing customers to switch their existing annuities to a different type that generated less income, New York State's financial regulator said on Tuesday.
The action is part of an industrywide investigation into some practices related to insurers' recommendations to replace a specific type of annuity with another, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said.
The insurers will collectively return a total of $1.15 million to New York customers and pay $673,000 in penalties, the regulator said.
At issue is a regulation that NYDFS issued last year requiring that recommendations for buying life insurance and annuities be in a consumer's ""best interest"" and ""appropriately address"" the consumer's insurance needs and financial objectives of the consumer at the time of the transaction.
""The Department is putting New York's life insurers on notice: they must comply with our regulations,"" said NYDFS superintendent Linda Lacewell in a statement.
In the most basic annuity, a customer gives a lump sum of cash to an insurer and receives a payment each month over a set number of years, sometimes for life. 
The NYDFS case involved consumers who had bought ""deferred annuities,"" in which payments start at a future date, but allow consumers to earn interest on their premiums until that time. The insurers had recommended replacing them with ""immediate annuities,"" in which payments start after 13 months.
But the insurers did not properly disclose information to consumers about income they would receive from the two different types of annuities and whether the replacement annuity was suitable, the regulator said. The recommendation to switch could cost consumers ""substantial lifetime income,"" NYDFS said.
Companion Life Insurance Co, a unit of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company [MUOMH.UL] is to return to New York consumers $462,122 of the total and pay a $186,000 penalty, the largest share of the total amount, followed by the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company in Horsham, Pennsylvania, which agreed to return $322,584 and pay a $133,000 penalty.
The Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company Inc agreed to return $218,589 and pay a $224,000 penalty.
Other insurers are Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co, The  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Insurance Company of America [PRUXBA.UL], and The United States Life Insurance Company. Prudential Insurance Company of America is a unit of Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU).
Representatives for Penn Mutual, Prudential, and United States Life Insurance declined to immediately comment. Representatives for the other insurers could not immediately be reached. The insurers agreed to revise their disclosure statements, the regulator said.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2019 12:56PM ET</span>",Four Colombia fracking projects could bring $5 billion in annual investment,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Four fracking pilot projects in Colombia could bring in $5 billion annually in investment once they are in the production phase, industry leaders said on Tuesday, as the country awaits regulation that will allow the projects to begin. 
The potential use of fracking in the Andean country has sparked impassioned debate, with environmental groups saying it could damage water supplies and cause earthquakes, while supporters say it is a key to energy self-sufficiency.
The top administrative court, the Council of State, is hearing a case on whether hydraulic fracturing, which breaks up rock formations with pressurized liquid, should be allowed but it has said pilot projects recommended by an expert commission can go ahead.
Four pilot projects -- one run by coal company Drummond [DRMND.UL] and the others by oil companies Ecopetrol,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Conoco Phillips  -- will generate billions of dollars in investment over the next few years, the head of the private Colombia Petroleum Association, or ACP, said.
""In the first phase of the four pilots they will require investments of around $600 million per year - so we'll surely have two, even up to three years, with investment of that amount and once we pass to the production phase they will require investments of around $5 billion per year,"" Francisco Lloreda told journalists.
Lloreda said he hoped work on the pilots, or at least the infrastructure required for them, could begin next year.
""We hope to start at least the civil works next year and hopefully we can be perforating next year,"" he said, adding the four pilots could generate around 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) in their production phase.
Colombia currently produces about 860,000 bpd.
The tribunal's decision to allow the pilot projects has separated them from the larger case on fracking, said German Espinosa, the head of oil services guild Campetrol.
""The pilots have nothing to do with the regulation that exists currently so surely what will happen is that (the government) will need to create some technical protocols and the national environmental authorities will need to say how this experimental phase will be managed,"" Espinosa said.
ACP's Lloreda said: ""We have faith the government will soon have those instruments so we can advance.""

State-run oil company Ecopetrol, which is acting as a co-defendant in the court case, had its request to start a pilot project suspended by the environmental licensing authority before the court's ruling. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Canacol also had requests for licenses shelved prior to the decision.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump delivered a stinging rebuke to China's trade practices, while disappointing consumer confidence data raised concerns over the impact of a prolonged trade war between the two nations.
Trump said he would not accept a ""bad deal"" in the trade negotiations and that Beijing had failed to keep promises that it made when China joined the World Trade Organization.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Private detectives from security firm Investigo, hired to shadow a former  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) manager Iqbal Khan, took defensive action when Khan tried to photograph one of them with his mobile phone, an Investigo memo seen by Reuters said.
Credit Suisse hired security firm Investigo to tail former International Wealth Management boss Iqbal Khan, who left the bank in July, to try to ensure he did not poach any colleagues before starting a new job next month at rival UBS (S:UBSG), two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on Tuesday.
Khan filed a criminal complaint last week alleging threats and coercion after a confrontation on Sept. 17, during which Swiss media reported that Investigo detectives sought to take Khan's mobile phone after he tried to take a photo of their car.
A spokesman for Khan declined to comment on the incident. Khan's spokesman denied that Khan tried to poach Credit Suisse staff for his new employer, calling such suspicions ""absurd.""
Prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible threats or coercion. Credit Suisse on Monday said an internal inquiry was under way.
The Investigo memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday, which referred to the alleged confrontation with Khan, said the detectives were taking defensive action.
""Our employee acted as per instructions defensively,"" the Investigo memo, seen by Reuters, stated.
An Investigo representative said he could not comment on the memo or any details of the incident prior to the release of other parties' statements, but said it was very unlikely that one of the firm's detectives would act in such a way.
""I can't imagine that any of the employees, as I know them, would pull the phone out of Mr Khan's hands,"" he said. ""That would be one of the most ill-advised actions you could take.""
Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner and CEO Tidjane Thiam had earlier pointed to ""significant inaccuracies"" in media reporting of the incident, which they said in a staff memo ""sensationalised"" the facts and events.
Three employees of the security firm were detained by authorities over the incident last week, Investigo's representative said, but were released the same day."

The Kaspar brothers were executives at Avexis, the company that developed the drug and was acquired by Novartis for $8.7 billion last year.
Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Novartis could face civil or criminal penalties because of the data manipulation and the possibility the company had waited to notify regulators.
The new allegations were in Novartis' response to the FDA's inspection report. They were written by the company in late August and released by the regulator on Tuesday.
Representatives for the Kaspars could not be immediately reached for comment.
After its investigation Novartis fired Avexis’ Chief Scientific Officer Brian Kaspar and Senior Vice President of Research and Development Allan Kaspar for cause on Aug. 13.
The company also said its internal investigation was drawn out because of the Kaspars' ""lack of cooperation and categorical denial of the allegations.""
Zolgensma - the world's most expensive drug - was approved as a one-time treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in late May.
The disease often leads to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death within months for babies born with the most serious Type I form. SMA affects about one in 10,000 live births, with 50% to 70% having Type I disease, and is the leading genetic cause of death in infants."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors urged a Manhattan federal judge to reject Michael Avenatti's request to subpoena  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), calling it a ""fishing expedition"" unrelated to a criminal case accusing the embattled lawyer of extortion.
In a letter late on Monday, prosecutors said they and Nike had already turned over 3,360 pages of documents to Avenatti, and the added materials he wanted were irrelevant to his knowledge or state of mind when he allegedly broke the law.
Prosecutors accused Avenatti of threatening to publicize claims that Nike arranged for payments to elite college basketball recruits, unless the athletic wear company paid him more than $20 million and hired him to manage an internal probe.
Avenatti appeared to be on ""a mission to uncover evidence that he speculates might show payments (that he asserts, without explanation, might be unlawful) to unidentified 'other' players,"" prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe.
They called the proposed subpoena ""a fishing expedition for material without relevance to the forthcoming trial.""
Avenatti, 48, became famous for representing porn star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in lawsuits involving U.S. President Donald Trump and his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.
""I look forward to a jury hearing the real truth as to what happened as opposed to the fairytale scripted by Trump's DOJ,"" Avenatti said in an email on Tuesday, referring to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Avenatti's lawyers have said their client was entitled to present ""evidence of broader misconduct directed by Nike across amateur basketball"" in his defense, which a subpoena could help unearth.
Nike has denied Avenatti's claims, and in a letter made public on Friday, opposed a subpoena. ""It is Mr. Avenatti--not Nike--on trial,"" the company's lawyers wrote.
Avenatti also faces federal charges in Manhattan of stealing about $300,000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract.
Federal prosecutors in Southern (NYSE:SO) California have separately charged Avenatti with wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, saying he stole millions of dollars from clients.
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to the various charges.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2019 10:37AM ET</span>",German prosecutors indict top VW bosses over emissions scandal,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors have accused Volkswagen's CEO of holding back market-moving information on rigged emissions tests four years ago, raising the prospect of fresh upheaval at the carmaker just as it tries to reinvent itself as a champion of clean driving. 
Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig said on Tuesday they would press criminal charges of stock market manipulation against Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, as well as non-executive Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn.
The charges show how the German company, which in September 2015 admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests, is struggling to move on from a scandal which has cost it more than $30 billion in vehicle refits, fines and provisions. 
Court proceedings are under way over that admission. The indictment from the prosecutors in Braunschweig - in Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) home region of Lower Saxony - is part of a separate legal push to try managers over an alleged delay in informing investors of the company's wrongdoing. 
Lawyers for the three accused said they would contest the charges that they knowingly held back vital information. Volkswagen said its full supervisory board would convene on Wednesday to discuss the indictments.
In a statement issued after an emergency meeting, the board's executive committee said it ""cannot see that there was any deliberate attempt not to inform the capital market"".
If accepted by a Braunschweig state court, the indictment would lead to a trial date being set.
The former U.S. regulator who helped bring Volkswagen's cheating to light dismissed the company's arguments.
""The excuse that top managers knew nothing is very weak,"" Alberto Ayala, who served at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) until 2017, told German news magazine Spiegel.
Separately on Tuesday, German prosecutors hit rival carmaker Daimler with an 870 million euro fine for breaking diesel emissions rules. The Stuttgart-based maker of Mercedes-Benz cars said it would not appeal.
Volkswagen this year bucked a trend of falling demand for passenger cars by launching a range of popular sport utility vehicles, and is investing billions to try to become a leader in electric and self-driving technologies.
Its shares were down 2% at 153.42 euros in afternoon trade.
NO HINDRANCE
Diess's lawyer said the indictment would not hinder him in his role as CEO, adding that as Diess did not join Volkswagen until July 2015 he could not have foreseen the scandal would have such a huge impact on the company. 
Volkswagen shares lost up to 37% in value in the days after the scandal broke. Had investors known about the emissions test cheating, they might have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, plaintiffs have argued.
Volkswagen and its executives have said the fallout from the scandal was not foreseeable, and that they had expected to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities prior to the disclosure of the test cheating. 
Braunschweig prosecutors said the accused should have kept investors informed.
""They pursued a strategy to achieve a settlement with the U.S. authorities without disclosing all relevant information,"" they said in a statement. 
Winterkorn resigned in the days after the scandal broke, having been CEO for eight years. He told German lawmakers in early 2017 that he did not find out about the cheating any earlier than Volkswagen had officially admitted. 
Poetsch became a management board member at Volkswagen in 2003 and was made chairman in 2015. 
The 636-page indictment alleges Winterkorn was fully aware of the matter and potential financial damage to Volkswagen as of March 2015. Poetsch was allegedly informed on June 29 and Diess on July 27.
Investigations into the alleged perpetrators of the illegal engine control software, also known as defeat devices, have seen the arrest of the then CEO of Volkswagen's Audi unit, Rupert Stadler. In July 2019, Stadler - whose contract was later terminated by Volkswagen - and three defendants were charged with fraud, false certification and criminal advertising practices. Investigations into a further 23 suspects continue, the Munich prosecutor said at the time.

Braunschweig prosecutors in April charged Winterkorn and four other managers with fraud over their role in the manipulation of emissions testing.

DUBAI/LONDON/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is unlikely to list its state-owned oil giant Aramco this year after attacks this month on its facilities, two sources with direct knowledge of the company's thinking said.
The initial public offering (IPO) of Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, is the pillar of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's economic reform agenda that aims to raise billions of dollars to help diversify the kingdom away from oil. 
Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources declined to be identified because the information is not public.
Aramco Chairman Yassir al-Rumayyan said last week after the attacks, which initially halved the crude output of the world's top oil exporter, that it would be ready for the IPO within one year. 
Saudi officials have said in the past the Aramco IPO could happen in 2020 or 2021
The deal, which was delayed last year, had been slated to take place as early as November, sources previously said. The plan was to offer a 1% stake on the Saudi bourse, the first step of the planned 5% sale that could potentially raise $100 billion.
The deal was now expected to slip to next year after the Sept. 14 attacks on Aramco's Khurais and Abqaiq plants, which process and clean crude, said the sources.
""They need to build confidence – in addition to restoring production,"" one of them said.
Riyadh and Washington have blamed Iran for the strikes, which escalated tensions in the Middle East and raised concerns about further attacks or a new war. Tehran denies the charge. 
A source told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia had restored more than 75% of crude output lost after the attacks and would return to full volumes by early next week.
Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman and Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser have previously said output would be fully back up by the end of September.
The attacks have spooked investors by exposing how ill-prepared Saudi Arabia is to defend itself despite repeated attacks on vital assets during the more than four years it has been embroiled in a conflict in neighboring Yemen.
""I think that the attacks on the Aramco facilities have surprised portfolio managers in that they show Saudi assets as being more vulnerable to attack and disruption than many had assumed,"" said Ross Teverson, head of emerging markets strategy at Jupiter Asset Management, a London-based fund.
Aramco has held meetings with bankers and analysts since the strikes, but doubts emerged among investors about the timeline of the potentially $20 billion domestic leg of the IPO.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Shares in mBank (WA:MBK) hit their highest level since early August on Tuesday, partly in response to speculation that Poland's fourth largest lender by assets is up for sale.
mBank shares rose 5.7% to 346.4 zloty ($86.90) by 1053 GMT.
Last week, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), partly owned by the German government after a bailout and struggling to generate profits, said it aims to sell a stake in mBank in which it has a 69.3% shareholding worth about $2.56 billion.
""I expect there will be a significant interest in mBank. Among local favorites would name state-run PKO  BP  (LON:BP) and Pekao,"" Kamil Stolarski, banking analyst at Santander (MC:SAN) in Warsaw said.
""Other banks that have ambitions to increase market share could (also) engage in the transaction, for example  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), ING, or even maybe Bank Millennium.""
Marta Czajkowska-Baldyga, banking analyst at Haitong Bank in Warsaw, said the share price rise was connected with speculation about the mBank sale.
""Both state-run banks and other smaller lenders interested in increasing their market share might be interested in mBank.""
Poland's Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Tuesday that any decision to buy mBank should be taken on business grounds, commenting on speculation about potential interest in the bank from state-run banks.
Analysts expected that Poland's financial sector authority KNF would require Commerzbank to sell mBank without a portfolio of around 3.7 billion Swiss franc mortgages as the regulator did in number of previous transactions.

The Swiss franc mortgage problems date back to the early 2000s when people in Poland took out loans denominated in Swiss francs, attracted by interest rates far below those available in the local currency.
But more recently the Swiss franc has risen in value so that many borrowers are having to pay far more than they expected. Many borrowers in Poland have taken their banks to court over these loans."

Walmart will offer seven bachelor's degrees and two diplomas in fields such as health science and healthcare management through a program that already offers degrees in the fields of business, supply chain management, computer science and cyber security, the company said.
The new offerings will help the retailer train staff to fill critical healthcare roles across its stores, which include more than 5,000 retail pharmacies as well as vision and hearing centers, it said.
Medical services, which typically have higher margins than retail products on shelves, allow Walmart to not only tap into the healthcare needs of senior citizens and low income shoppers but also boost its retail business by getting customers visiting its pharmacies to pick up additional items along the way.
Last year, Walmart signed a deal with Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), one of the country's largest insurers, to attract more Medicare enrollees to buy over-the-counter medicines and supplies at its stores.
This month, it opened a facility in Georgia to offer low-priced health services that include dental, x-rays, and mental health counseling.
Walmart also runs one of the largest pharmacy chains in the country and has been aggressive in offering low priced generic drugs and prescriptions.
Health and wellness products have accounted for 11% of its merchandise sales in recent years, according to analysts. The company does not separately break out such data.
Walmart's move is also tied to U.S. retailers struggling to hire and retain talent, especially young workers, with unemployment at its lowest in nearly half a century.
A year after the launch of Walmart's education program, more than 13,000 Walmart workers have been accepted to at least one of the courses and over 100,000 employees have expressed an interest in joining, the retailer said.
Walmart is the largest U.S. private sector employer, with a nearly 1.5 million workforce."

LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing (HKEX) said it was ""thinking big"" in its $39 billion London Stock Exchange bid as LSE CEO David Schwimmer said he was sticking with his $27 billion purchase of data and analytics company Refinitiv.
After LSE rebuffed its offer, HKEX is appealing directly to LSE shareholders and has until Oct. 9 to decide whether to go hostile.
HKEX has said that the LSE must ditch its bid for Refinitiv for its offer to go ahead. Thomson Reuters, a professional information company that is the parent of Reuters News, holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv.
But Schwimmer said that buying Refinitiv bolsters the LSE's position in a growing data market and broadens assets traded to include foreign exchange and fixed income.
""The Refinitiv transaction does that, and does it very well,"" Schwimmer said.
HKEX Chief Executive Charles Li said the timing for its bid for the LSE was not good, but it was a case of ""now ""or never"" as the London bourse offered an opportunity for HKEX to become a more global company.
""Now is the time to think big, when the world is polarizing to the east and west, it is time to become global,"" Li told the Sibos conference.
""Together we can unlock the last frontier.""
Several ""big bang"" exchange mergers have failed in recent years, opposed by politicians and regulators.
Li said that although HKEX's bid for the LSE is ""disruptive and unusual"", it would bring the huge Chinese market and the West together.
Unlike previous big merger attempts, the deal is not about cost savings, Li said.
GOVERNANCE
Li and Schwimmer offered contrasting views on trends in China's capital market.
Schwimmer said Shanghai would become China's top financial center in the longer term, and the trend of the market opening up would ""slowly but surely"" continue.
The LSE has just launched a type of cross listing connection with Shanghai in June but only one Chinese company has so far made use of it.
Li, however, said China would only relax capital controls in the long term.
""Capital controls will continue to be with us for our generation,"" Li said.
HKEX's bid for the LSE has raised concerns that China would have undue influence over the London bourse given that some HKEX board members are appointed by the Hong Kong government.
Li said if the LSE deal is allowed to go ahead, the current governance structure for HKEX may no longer be appropriate.
""We are completely open to having a discussion on governance,"" Li said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rekindled U.S.-China trade hopes lifted share markets on Tuesday, while the pound was whipsawed by another dramatic Brexit twist after the UK's top court ruled the government's suspension of parliament had been unlawful.
There was more gloomy data from Germany to contend with too, but Monday's confirmation that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in two weeks' time raised spirits. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3%, with the eurozone banking index up 0.6% after it had slumped 2.8% in the previous session. (EU) Germany's bond yields were also a touch higher after Monday's dour PMI data had triggered their biggest fall since June. 
""A perceived lull in U.S.-China trade tensions has eased market fears about an economic downturn,"" a group of BlackRock's investment strategists wrote in a note.
Currency market moves were mostly small-scale, with one notable exception - the pound. 
Traders had waited for a Supreme Court ruling on UK Prime Minister's Boris Johnson five-week suspension of parliament -- a move known as prorogation in Westminster speak -- and when it came it was dramatic and blunt. The move was ""unlawful"".
Sterling initially climbed as high $1.2487 on the view it would help prevent the UK being bundled toward a 'no-deal' Brexit at the end of October. But it quickly ran out of momentum and retreated to $1.2460, up a modest 0.2% on the day.
""I wasn't surprised to see the currency hop higher but I also wasn't surprised to see cable (pound vs the dollar) run out of steam ahead of $1.25,"" said TD Securities' European head of currency strategy Ned Rumpeltin.
Johnson is now likely to head to his Conservative party's annual conference at the weekend and rally his troops in preparation for a likely national election which will be a bitter fight over Brexit.
""He is going to have to rally his base and he is going to do that around hard Brexit,"" Rumpeltin said. ""That will be a moment of clarity for the FX market. It will look at the polling and the Conservatives are leading in the polls.""
GOOD TO TALK
MSCI's broadest regional Asia share index inched up 0.1%, led by 0.6% gains in mainland Chinese shares after the vice head of China's state planner said Beijing will step up efforts to stabilize growth.
Japan's Nikkei ended up 0.2% after a market holiday on Monday. Wall Street looked on track for modest gains, with S&P futures up 0.25%.
Japan's yen traded at 107.62 yen per dollar, after reaching two-week highs of 107.32 the previous day.
""The comments (from Mnuchin on China trade talks) gave a little bit of boost to sentiment, but markets are still not that optimistic, either,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.
""It seems there have been a lot going on behind the scenes,"" he said, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's questioning a decision by his top trade negotiators to ask Chinese officials to delay a planned trip to U.S. farming regions.
That cancellation was seen by markets as a sign all is not well in the U.S.-China talks and had helped send share prices lower on Friday.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>","Argentina's markets, caged by controls, strain beneath the surface","By Gabriel Burin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's volatile markets look to have been tamed by capital controls imposed by President Mauricio Macri after a sharp sell-off in August. Beneath the surface, however, signs suggest trouble is brewing.
The country's peso currency and bonds crashed to record lows last month after a primary election landslide defeat for Macri, prompting the market-friendly leader to announce plans to delay debt payments and impose currency controls.
That tamed the volatility of the peso and sovereign bonds and staunched an outflow of dollars, as investors await the outcome of an Oct. 27 general vote and size up the likely policy stance of opposition front-runner Alberto Fernandez.
However, economists say the surface calm masks tensions below, as caged markets struggle against the controls. Black market dollar trades are on the rise, banks are cutting risk with shorter-term lending and key fiscal targets look shaky.
""We are in a moment of tranquility but things are happening beneath the surface that reveal the imbalances,"" said Alejandro Rodríguez, Buenos Aires-based director of the Department of Economics at the University of CEMA.
""There's an internal pressure, and it's hard to see it being released gradually.""
SHORT PASSES
Since the Aug. 11 primary, increasingly risk-averse banks have started to turn toward shorter 1-day debt instruments known as ""pases pasivos"", similar to reverse repos, in their financial dealings with the central bank.
The volume of these ""pases"" has climbed above 150 billion pesos ($2.65 billion) from almost nothing at the start of August. The volume of longer 7-day Leliq notes has edged down, though it remains the dominant central bank instrument.
(Graphic: Short ""pases"", https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ARGENTINA-ECONOMY-RISKS/0H001QX7X8HR/eikon.png)
FISCAL PRESSURES RISE
Argentina, which agreed to Spartan fiscal targets when Macri struck a $57 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund last year, faces rising uncertainty about meeting its targets, as he tries to soften the blow of economic turmoil by boosting payments and cutting taxes.
This has prompted some ratings agencies such as Moody's to cut their forecasts to reflect how the country will struggle to meet its fiscal obligations next year, central to its critical ongoing relationship with the IMF.
""We think that fiscal consolidation will become harder and less likely, leading to larger primary and fiscal deficits than previously anticipated,"" Moody's said in a recent report.
(Graphic: Fiscal pressure , https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ARGENTINA-ECONOMY-RISKS/0H001QX878JN/eikon.png)
BLACK MARKET PESO
Currency controls, which have put limits on forex trades, have prompted growing demand for greenbacks in the unapproved parallel market, as well as channels using the buying and selling of bonds to convert pesos to dollars.
This has led to a rising gap - currently over 11% - between the official spot rate and the dollar price in the black market, underscoring the market tension as people turn to informal channels.
(Graphic: Diverging prices , https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ARGENTINA-ECONOMY-PESO-BLACKMARKET/0H001QETJ86K/eikon.png)
DOLLARS LEAK AWAY
Currency controls have helped stem a sharp drop in central bank forex reserves, which are down to the lowest level since last year, raising concerns about Argentina's ability to service its dollar debts.
Economists say that any more uncertainty could spark renewed flight and hit reserves further.
""Adverse psychology is latent and in the face of any spark, we all go out to protect our savings,"" Victoria Giarrizzo, an economist at Elypsis, told Reuters.
(Graphic: Dollar decline , https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ARGENTINA-ECONOMY-RESERVES/0H001QX5P8B8/eikon.png)
RATES, INFLATION SPIKE
Even as global central banks cut rates to bolster growth, Argentina has been forced to hike its benchmark rate to over 80% since the August crash to help keep investments in pesos and to help keep down inflation that accelerated again in August.
Constantino Hevia, professor of economics at the Torcuato Di Tella University, said the country's political leaders would likely avoid stoking volatility further ahead of the election.
""If they make incendiary statements, the next government could receive a broken central bank,"" he said.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Starbucks (O:SBUX) won its fight on Tuesday against an EU demand to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) in Dutch back taxes, while  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) lost its challenge against an order to stump up a similar amount to Luxembourg.
Both cases were part of European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's crackdown on unlawful tax breaks offered by EU countries to multinationals, which has also extended to Apple's (O:AAPL) Irish deal and Amazon's (O:AMZN) Luxembourg deal, among others.
The judgments show that the General Court, Europe's second-highest court, in general endorses the European Commission's methodology in its tax crackdown but stipulates the Commission must do its homework properly to prove its case - potentially a bad omen for Apple fighting a record 13-billion-euro Irish tax order.
It is an important legal victory for the Commission, said Dimitrios Kyriazis, head of Law Faculty at New College of the Humanities London.
""Regardless of the outcome of individual cases, the General Court seems to have sanctioned the Commission's approach,"" he said.
In Starbucks' case, the EU competition enforcer failed to show that the U.S. coffee chain benefited unfairly from the Dutch tax deal, the court said.
""The Commission was unable to demonstrate the existence of an advantage in favor of Starbucks,"" judges said.
The Dutch finance ministry said the judgment showed that the multinational was treated the same as other companies.
Starbucks also welcomed the ruling, saying it had not received any special tax treatment from the Netherlands and that it ""pays all of its taxes wherever they are due"".
In a separate ruling, the Court upheld the Commission's decision against Fiat's Luxembourg's tax deal, saying that the Commission had applied its state aid rules correctly to assess if there was an illegal advantage and was not seeking to harmonize tax rules across the bloc, an argument cited by critics.
It also agreed with the Commission's finding that the Luxembourg tax ruling was a selective one, meaning that such rulings were not available to all companies, a key argument used by companies ordered to pay back taxes.
Luxembourg said it would analyze the judgment and reserved all its rights. Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe said it was disappointed with the judgment and was considering its next steps, adding that the matter was not material to the group.
Vestager said the court endorsed the Commission's approach in using state aid rules in tax cases, adding however that a more comprehensive strategy was needed to tackle tax avoidance.
""The ultimate goal that all companies pay their fair share of tax can only be achieved by a combination of efforts to make legislative changes, enforce state aid rules and a change in corporate philosophies,"" she said. 
The Commission in its 2015 decisions said Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler set prices for goods and services sold between subsidiaries, known as transfer prices, that were below market rates and which artificially lowered their taxes.
The losing side can appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union on points of law.
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland are among countries whose economies have benefited from attracting multinationals. They have amended their tax regimes in recent years following the EU tax drive.
The European Commission is currently investigating Ikea AB  and  Nike  Inc's (N:NKE) Dutch deals and  Huhtamaki  Oyi's (HE:HUH1V) Luxembourg tax ruling.

The cases are T-755/15 Luxembourg v Commission and T-759/15 Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe v Commission, and T-760/15 Netherlands v Commission and T-636/16 Starbucks and Starbucks Manufacturing Emea v Commission.

Investing.com -- For 150,000 tourists stranded abroad, the collapse of U.K. travel group Thomas Cook is obviously somewhat awkward, to say the least.
For others, the silver lining is so thick that they can hardly see the cloud any more.
German tour operator Tui (DE:TUIGn) rose another 2.1% in early trading Tuesday after rising over 6% on Monday, as its biggest competitor among Europe package tour operators gave up the ghost. It’s now up over 25% from its August low, although it’s still lost around half its value since May 2018.
Likewise, Ryanair (LON:RYA) and EasyJet (LON:EZJ), two of the online-savvy discount flyers who created the opportunities for people to take their business away from Thomas Cook, also extended their rally, rising 2.2% and 0.9%, respectively.
EasyJet is now testing a four-month high, having recovered in recent weeks amid growing confidence that a disorderly “Hard Brexit” can be avoided at the end of October. Ryanair, which is exposed to almost all the same risks as its rival, has made less of a recovery due to rolling strikes by its aircrew, but that issue also seems as if it may be edging closer to resolution after pilots based in the U.K. called off a series of strikes that were scheduled for this week.
So, all-clear for take-off then? Probably not. Here’s what Tui had to say about the underlying market conditions in a statement to the stock exchange on Monday. A roaring bull case, it isn’t. It starts by saying its vertically integrated business model is “resilient”, but quickly goes on to list some formidable and long-running challenges: “Our Markets & Airlines business faces a number of ongoing external challenges such as the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft, airline overcapacities and continued Brexit uncertainty.“
Underlying operating profit this year is still expected to drop 26% from 2018, and “these external challenges will continue in (2020) – therefore, we will focus on becoming more cost competitive in our Markets & Airlines business to protect and extend our market share where possible.”
And that's before the weakening labor market in Germany starts hitting people's travel budgets.
The travel companies are all outperforming their local benchmarks for a second day, after the German ifo business survey reinforced the picture of gloom around Europe's largest economy and the comparable French Insee business confidence index also inched down. The benchmark STOXX 600 was up 0.2% at 390.58, while the German DAX was up 0.1% and the FTSE 100 was essentially unchanged."

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG), Nippon Life and MS&AD Insurance are vying with rivals to buy the Singapore and Vietnam businesses of Britain's  Aviva  (LON:AV) in a deal likely to be worth up to $2.5 billion, sources said.
Canada's Sun Life Financial and Manulife Financial Corp are also among roughly half a dozen suitors for the businesses, said the people with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential.
The combined deal value for the businesses is estimated to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, they said, adding that talks were at an early stage and terms could change.
Asia's fast-growing economies and its relatively low number of insured people make the region a promising market for global insurers - the regional market, worth $1.7 trillion in premiums, is expected to account for 42% of global premiums by 2029 from about a third currently, a Swiss Re Institute report showed.
But some overseas insurers have struggled to scale up in the face of tough competition from larger regional players, as well as regulatory restrictions on foreign ownership in large markets including China and India.
The divestment of the Aviva units, if completed, would add to strong regional insurance sector M&A momentum in the last couple of years, which has also been aided by local banks looking to exit this capital-intensive business. 
FWD, controlled by Richard Li, the entrepreneur and son of Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing, has spent more than $6 billion on half a dozen deals in the last six years to expand its regional footprint.
Sources said last week was the deadline for the first round of formal bids in a transaction Aviva aims to finalize by year-end.
Aviva, Allianz, Nippon Life, MS&AD and Sun Life declined to comment on the deal process. Manulife did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The names of the potential buyers and the specifics of Aviva's planned divestment in Asia have not been previously reported. 
COMPETITIVE MARKET
Last month, in his first interim results since being appointed Aviva chief executive officer in March, Maurice Tulloch announced a review of the group's Asian operations.
Aviva runs businesses in China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam. The Asian operations posted a 25% rise in operating profit to 284 million pounds ($352.67 million) in 2018, according to Aviva's annual report.
Aviva operates wholly owned businesses in Singapore and Vietnam, with Singapore contributing nearly half of the Asian businesses' operating profits.
Singapore has a very competitive and fragmented market, with demand for life insurance mainly driven by the affluent segment. Unlike larger insurers who have distribution tie-ups with banks, Aviva mainly relies on hundreds of agents to sell its products.
One source said that since Aviva was not combining its other smaller Asian businesses in the sale process, interest in the two assets was strong and strategic buyers could end up paying more than $2.5 billion.

The latest move comes after Aviva unveiled hundreds of job cuts globally in June and overhauled its UK business.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber on Tuesday received only a two-month London operating license, failing to secure a maximum five-year term in a battle with the regulator which has previously stripped the app of its right to take rides.
Transport for London (TfL) rejected the Silicon Valley company's license renewal request in 2017 due to failings it said it found in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks, prompting legal action.
A judge in 2018 then granted Uber (N:UBER) a probationary 15-month license, which expires on Sep. 25, after the firm had made several changes to its business model in London, its most important European market.
TfL said the new two-month license comes with ""new conditions to ensure passenger safety"" and it wanted more details from the company.
""Uber London Limited has been granted a two-month private hire operator license to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application,"" said a spokesman.
Uber said it will work closely with TfL and provide any additional information.
""We will keep listening, learning and improving to provide the best service while being a trusted partner to London,"" said Jamie Heywood, Uber's Regional General Manager for Northern & Eastern Europe.
The 2017 license loss came just weeks after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi took over and became a test of his ability to assuage regulator concerns as the app faced disputes with rival firms and the authorities in different markets.
Drivers of the city's traditional black taxis have lobbied hard against a license renewal, having long cited safety issues, working standards and the undercutting of their business model.
Uber (N:UBER) says its roughly 45,000 drivers in the city enjoy the flexibility of their work and that it has taken several steps to improve safety for its passengers.
The new conditions set by TfL cover ride-sharing, appropriate insurance and driver document checks by Uber.
Uber received a five-year license in 2012 but fellow ride-hailing service Ola gained just a 15-month right to operate earlier this year, in a possible sign that the regulator wants to have more power over new entrants.
Mayor Sadiq Khan, who is also the chairman of TfL, has long been critical of Uber, telling LBC radio last month that they need to play by the rules.
""You will know my track record which is standing up to the big boys, and they are boys, and make sure everyone plays by the rules,"" he told listeners to a phone-in. ""I don't care how many lawyers you employ or how big your PR budget."""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Brewer AB InBev priced the Hong Kong IPO of its Asia-Pacific unit at the bottom of a marketed range to raise about $5 billion, indicating deals in the pipeline may need subdued valuations to succeed as protests in the city unnerve investors.
Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (AB InBev), the world's largest brewer, relaunched the initial public offering (IPO) this month after cancelling a plan for a bigger IPO of the unit in July citing ""several factors, including the prevailing market conditions"".
Separately, Topsports International Holdings, the sportswear business of Chinese footwear retailer Belle International, launched on Tuesday a Hong Kong IPO of up to $1.2 billion, as per a marketing term sheet seen by Reuters.
The AB InBev and Topsports offerings are among a handful of recent sizeable IPOs seen as tests of investor sentiment following anti-government protests that have roiled Hong Kong for nearly four months and weighed on its stock market.
Markets more generally are also on edge amid a trade dispute between the United States and China, as well as slowing global growth.
The IPO of Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd is still the second-biggest globally so far this year, trailing only the $8.1 billion flotation of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc in May, data from Refinitiv showed.
AB InBev, whose portfolio of more than 50 beer brands includes Stella Artois and Corona, said on Tuesday the Budweiser IPO was priced at HK$27 ($3.44) per share, the bottom end of the HK$27 to HK$30 indicative range, confirming what sources had earlier told Reuters.
AB InBev's revived IPO excludes its Australian operations, which it agreed to sell to Japan's Asahi Group for $11 billion shortly after the previous IPO was shelved.
Without Australia, a large but mature market, AB InBev's Asia-Pacific operations would be more focused on faster growth markets such as China, India and Vietnam, which has made the IPO an easier sell, sources have said.
""The company has top-notch assets and without the slow-growing Australian operations the deal has become more attractive than last time,"" said one source with knowledge of the Budweiser IPO.
""And today's low end pricing would give the stock more upside potential in the public market.""
BOOST FOR HONG KONG?
The IPO pricing comes as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday that she hoped peaceful and rational dialogue will help find a way out of the protests gripping the former British colony. 
At HK$27 per share, Budweiser will have a market value of $45.6 billion, and a forward enterprise value (EV) to expected EBITDA - earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization - valuation of 17 times, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. By comparison, the aborted July float was aiming for a forward EV/EBITDA of up to 18.2 times. 
The new valuation is cheaper than the 23.5 times forward EV/EBITDA that its rival China Resources Beer Holdings commands. 
Budweiser said last week it had lined up Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC to invest $1 billion in the IPO as its cornerstone investor, lending some stability to the IPO. It did not have a cornerstone investor during the July float attempt.
A successful completion of the Budweiser IPO, though, could encourage more Hong Kong IPO candidates to firm up their plans. China's biggest e-commerce company  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd delayed last month its up to $15 billion listing in the city amid the growing political unrest there.
More IPOs will be a boost for Hong Kong as a listings hub, with the city currently lagging its New York rivals. Companies raised $10.8 billion in new listings in Hong Kong as of mid-September, well short of the $41 billion raised in New York, according to Refinitiv data.
The Budweiser IPO included a rare ""upsize"" option that enabled the Belgium-based brewer to sell up to 36.8% more shares in the offering. That option was partially exercised, it said.
Proceeds from the IPO will help AB InBev reduce debt of over $100 billion accumulated following the purchase of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) in late 2016. The stock of Budweiser will debut on Sept. 30.
The brewer also has another goal - creating an Asian champion to spur consolidation.
Analysts see the brewing assets of San Miguel of the Philippines or of ThaiBev as possible partners or targets.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are the joint sponsors of the flotation. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and Chinese investment bank CICC are the global coordinators for the offering.
Topsports, the largest sportswear retailer in China, is set to price its IPO on Oct. 3 and trading of its shares is scheduled to start on Oct 10.

Topsports declined to comment on its IPO.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2019 04:57AM ET</span>",Defensive plays rule as European shares grind higher,"By Shreyashi Sanyal and Sruthi Shankar
(Reuters) - European shares inched higher on Tuesday, with gains dominated by sectors perceived as defensive plays against the risk of a deeper economic slowdown and the chance of new body blows from U.S.-China trade talks.
The European healthcare (SXDP) and food and beverage (SX3P) sectors - commonly considered as industries where demand and results hold up relatively better when the economy slows - were among the top gainers on the main European index (STOXX).
Stock markets have been spooked in the past week by a run of poor economic data on the euro zone as well as mixed signals on Donald Trump's trade war with China, weakening investors appetite for riskier plays.
Germany's IFO business climate index for September also came in just shy of expectations on Tuesday.
Central banks continue to plow money into the financial system with a combination of interest rate cuts and other monetary moves but traders seem far from convinced that will see off the risk of a broader recession.
""Investors have to invest because of the low interest environment, but the best sectors currently are defensives,"" said Christian Stocker, strategist at UniCredit.
The food and beverage index has surged 30% this year, the most among its peers.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.2%. 
Trade-sensitive Frankfurt shares (GDAXI) rose 0.1%, supported by comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin overnight that high-level trade talks with China were set to resume in two weeks.
Shares of German biotech company Evotec (DE:EVTG) jumped 6.0% after it expanded a partnership with Japan's Takeda Pharma (T:4502).
The eurozone banking index (SX7E) up 0.5% after a 2.8% tumble in the previous session after surveys showed growth in services and manufacturing across the euro zone stalled in September.
A day after the collapse of British travel giant Thomas Cook (L:TCG), the travel and leisure sector (SXTP) gained another 0.5%, with rival airlines and travel operators rising on expectations they will pick up the lost business. 
Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Ryanair Holdings (I:RYA) and TUI (L:TUIT) all rose between 1.6% and 2% in early trading. 
Among other stocks, Belgian materials and technology group  Umicore  (BR:UMI) gained 8.1%, the most on the STOXX 600, after it partnered with LG Chem (KS:051910) for the supply of NMC cathode materials.
 Weir Group  PLC (L:WEIR) fell 2.8%, to the bottom of the STOXX 600, after Peel Hunt cut its rating on UK-based engineering firm to ""hold."" 

London's FTSE index (FTSE) also moved 0.2% higher ahead of a Supreme Court decision on U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of parliament. If the verdict goes against Johnson's government, however, sterling is expected to rise - normally a negative for the multinational-heavy index.

The Paris-based firm, which oversees 1.5 trillion euros ($1.6 trillion), has cut its exposure to long-dated U.S. Treasuries, which had climbed over a period from May to August.
“Following the huge bond rally we’ve seen in the last three months or so, we took the view that too much was expected from central banks,” Blanque said in an interview in Singapore. “This should translate globally into more bond volatility and less support for risky assets in the short term, until the end of the year.”
The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Bond Index, which tracks investment-grade debt worldwide, has fallen almost 1% since the end of August and is on track for its worst month since last October.
A possible re-acceleration in global growth in the fourth quarter, spurred by monetary loosening over the past 12 months, poses a risk to bonds, Blanque said.
With so much global debt having negative yields, emerging markets may be a bright spot for investors, he said. Blanque likes dollar-denominated debt from Brazil, Mexico, Ukraine, Russia, Bahrain, Serbia and Indonesia. Those countries may be more insulated from the U.S.-China trade war and in some cases have attraction thanks to fiscal credibility, according to him."

Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, will announce the investment next month, Yonhap said, citing unidentified industry sources. It did not mention a timeframe for the investment.
A spokeswoman for Samsung Display, which operates two LCD production sites in South Korea and one in China, said nothing had been decided on its future investment plans.
South Korea's panel makers have been struggling to cope amid slower LCD demand for TV and smartphones as well as rising competition from Chinese rivals and a shift by major clients to organic light emitting diode (OLED) panels.
In August, Samsung Display said it was looking at suspending one of its South Korean LCD production lines due to a supply glut.
LG Display last week announced a voluntary redundancy program for domestic production line employees amid mounting financial losses.
Samsung Electronics has said it spent 500 billion won on its display business during the April-June quarter."

Incoming European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde’s comments received some focus as she said the Sino-U.S. trade is the biggest hurdle to the global economy.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were both up 0.6% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also gained 0.6%.
Developments on the Sino-U.S. trade front are being closely watched after the U.S. requested China to cancel a planned visit to U.S. farming regions over the weekend, sparking concerns tensions between the two nations might have escalated once again.
U.S. President Donald Trump apparently was not happy with the decision, according to Reuters which cited people familiar with an exchange between Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that was held overnight.
""Why was that our request, just out of curiosity?"" Trump asked.
Mnuchin explained that the U.S. side ""didn't want confusion around the trade issues.""
Trump then interjected: ""Yeah, but I want them to buy farm products.""
""There was no confusion,"" Mnuchin replied. ""We want them to buy agriculture. They have committed to buy agriculture. And they're doing that.""
""We just decided the timing of the trip wasn't necessarily the perfect timing, so they'll be rescheduling that to after our trade meetings,"" he added.
In a separate interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said ""it's a sign of good gesture that they (China) are back at the table buying agriculture.”
Cancellation of the planned trip sent U.S. and Chinese stocks lower.
Lagarde, who was selected in July to replace Mario Draghi as ECB President starting Nov 1, told CNBC in an interview that she thinks the ongoing trade war is weighing “like a big, dark cloud on the global economy.”
“It’s fewer jobs. It’s less business going on. It’s less investment. It’s more uncertainty,” she said.
The Nikkei 225 climbed 0.2%. Masato Ohtaka, Japanese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters that Japan still wants to sign a trade deal with the U.S. by the end of this month.
Ohtaka noted that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi would discuss remaining trade issues at a meeting in New York later in the day.
On the data front, Japan’s Jibun Bank Flash Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index slipped to a seasonally adjusted 48.9 from a final 49.3 in the previous month, marking the quickest pace of deterioration since February.

1436,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 11:36PM ET</span>",Huawei CFO Returns to the Courtroom as U.S. Tensions Run High,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer returned to a Vancouver courtroom Monday, beginning in earnest her efforts to convince a Canadian court that her rights got trampled when she was arrested on a U.S. extradition request last December.
Defense lawyers for Meng Wanzhou presented videos and thousands of pages of documents to back claims that Canadian authorities collaborated with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to engage in a “covert criminal investigation” to unlawfully detain, search and interrogate the Chinese executive.
The case against Meng, eldest daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, has cast a spotlight on a broader Trump administration effort to contain China and its largest technology company, which Washington sees as a national security threat. The U.S. wants to extradite Meng after accusing her and others at Huawei of conspiring to trick banks into conducting more than $100 million of transactions that may have violated American sanctions. The company has denied it committed any violations.

Meng’s team aims to show there was an abuse of process, which if successful, could result in the judge ordering a halt to the extradition proceedings. In a current round of disclosure hearings set to run through Oct. 4, Meng also seeks a court order to force the Canadian government to share more details about the circumstances of her arrest. Huawei spokesman Benjamin Howe declined to comment on Monday’s proceedings as the case is currently ongoing.
Meng showed up to court Monday in a glamorous outfit replete with four-inch sparkly heels that exposed the GPS monitor on her left ankle -- one of the conditions of her C$10 million bail ($7.5 million). She was accompanied by her husband Xiaozong Liu, also known as Carlos, who could be seen occasionally nodding off in the public gallery during the lengthy proceedings.
Among the arguments Meng’s defense put forth Monday were:
That Canadian border officials -- working with Canadian police and the FBI -- deliberately delayed Meng’s arrest at the airport for three hours, using the pretext of a customs inspection to obtain access to her electronic devices and interrogate her.That U.S. authorities historically have misused border checks to scrutinize Huawei executives’ electronic devices. The lawyers cited a former company employee whose devices were seized or searched by U.S. airport authorities numerous times between 2013 and 2018. The defense plans to call as a witness a special agent who conducted one of those searches.Her defense questioned how the FBI obtained details from outside its jurisdiction about what Meng was wearing on the flight from Hong Kong before it landed.Read more: Huawei CFO Awakens Canadians to the Long, Strong Arm of China
“It’s a question of pulling out all the stops,” said Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based lawyer who’s been involved in hundreds of Canadian extradition cases and watched part of Monday’s proceedings.
Meng’s defense is likely trying to show that Canadian authorities collected evidence and statements irrelevant to the extradition proceedings but “will no doubt be considered gold by the FBI, who will likely use them in an attempt to bolster their case against her in the Eastern District of New York,” Botting said."
1437,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 10:13PM ET</span>",GM-UAW contract talks focus on temp workers,"(Reuters) - The use of temporary workers is a key bargaining issue in negotiations between General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and the striking United Auto Workers union over a new four-year contract.
Details of their proposals have not been disclosed. The union approved the occasional use of temporary workers by U.S. automakers during the last contract talks in 2015, when the two sides agreed to gradually phase out the existing two-tier wage structure.
Temporary workers represent about 20% of the workforce at Japanese automakers in the United Sates and are paid an average of $50 an hour, according to figures compiled by Automotive News and the Center for Auto Safety. In comparison, GM pays its workers an average $63 an hour. Temp workers, who typically make less than $20 an hour and have limited benefits, account for about 7% of its U.S. workforce.
GM says it can reduce labor costs and safeguard union jobs by using more temporary workers.
The use of temporary workers also allows the Detroit automakers to cover for high rates of absenteeism among UAW workers. The companies want the UAW to agree to stricter rules to discourage workers from failing to show up for their shifts.
The union, which has seen its membership dwindle to less than 400,000 from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979, granted U.S. automakers numerous concessions 10 years ago to help the industry weather the Great Recession and the resulting bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler.
One of the biggest givebacks was an agreement in 2009 to end the controversial jobs bank, which guaranteed laid-off workers would receive up to 90% of their regular pay. The jobs bank was approved in 1984 and expanded in 1990. Ultimately, it cost U.S. automakers billions of dollars to keep unemployed automakers on the payroll. 

The two sides also are wrangling over how much union members should pay for spiraling health care costs, which once were covered entirely by the manufacturers.

Honda is the latest automaker cutting production of diesel cars to meet stringent global emissions regulations. The plan is part of its long-term goal to make electric cars, including all battery-electric vehicles, to account for two-thirds of its line ups by 2030 from less than 10% now.
By next year, according to European Union emission targets, CO2 must be cut to 95 gram per km for 95% of cars from the current 120.5 gram average, a figure that has increased of late as consumers spurn fuel-efficient diesels and embrace SUVs. All new cars in the EU must be compliant in 2021. 
For Honda, declining demand for diesel vehicles and tougher emissions regulations have clouded its manufacturing prospects in Europe.
Honda said in February it would close its only British car plant in 2021 with the loss of up to 3,500 jobs.

Japan's No. 3 automaker has said it would cut the number of car model variations to a third of current offerings by 2025, reducing global production costs by 10% and redirecting those savings toward advanced research and development.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan state prosecutor on Monday urged a federal judge to dismiss U.S. President Donald Trump's bid to block a subpoena seeking eight years of his tax returns as part of a criminal investigation.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance argued in a court filing that Trump must not be allowed to assert ""blanket immunity from criminal prosecution,"" including for conduct before he took office. Vance also argued that the dispute belongs in New York state court, where a grand jury issued the subpoena, not in federal court.
U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan is scheduled to hear arguments in the case on Wednesday.
Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Trump filed the lawsuit on Thursday seeking to block enforcement of grand jury subpoena that Vance issued on Aug. 29 to Mazars USA, Trump's longtime accounting firm, for personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018.
Mazars is also named as a defendant in Trump's lawsuit.
The firm said in a statement it ""will respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations,"" though as a matter of policy it does not comment on its work for clients.
Vance issued the subpoena four weeks after issuing another subpoena to the Trump Organization for records of hush money payments, including to two women prior to the 2016 election. The women, porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, have said they had sexual relationships with Trump, which he has denied.
Michael Cohen, the president's former lawyer, has admitted to paying $130,000 to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, to keep her from talking about her alleged relationship with Trump in 2016. He also admitted to helping arrange a payment of $150,000 to McDougal.
Cohen is serving a three-year prison term for campaign finance violations, including through the hush money payments, as well as tax evasion and lying to Congress."

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's richest families are worried about the U.S.-China trade spat, Brexit, populism and climate change and are keeping more of their money in cash, according to a survey of family offices by the world's largest wealth manager.
Forty-two percent of family offices - set up to manage the wealth of one or more rich families - have increased their cash piles this year, according to the survey of 360 family offices by Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) and Campden Wealth Research.
Total cash reserves were 7.6% of family office investments in 2019, up 70 basis points from a year earlier. 
Fifty-five percent of family office executives expect recession to begin by next year, 63% believe Brexit is negative for Britain as an investment destination in the long term and 84% think populism will not fade by next year.
""Family offices are taking a dim view of geopolitical events,"" Sara Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), head of UBS’ Global Family Office Group, told Reuters. 
Fifty-three percent of family offices see climate change as the single greatest threat to the world, with newer generations running the family money putting sustainable investing high on the agenda, the survey said.
Family offices' views did not necessarily differ from those of institutional investors - pension funds, insurers and sovereign wealth funds - or of the asset managers who help invest their money, Ferrari said.
But family offices had more flexibility in their investments, were less tied to specific benchmark indices and tended to invest more in illiquid long-term assets, she said.
Private equity was the second largest investment class in 2019 behind developed market equities. Family offices said they plan to focus more on private equity next year - buying stakes in unlisted companies or the funds which invest in those companies - with a particular interest in technology firms.
Direct private equity investment achieved the best returns for the families this year, at 16%.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 07:18PM ET</span>",Tesla's Musk pushed for SolarCity deal despite major cash crunch: lawsuit,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk urged investors to approve the 2016 purchase of SolarCity at a big premium to its market value despite knowing the solar installer faced a cash crunch and publicly stating he had recused himself from involvement in the deal, according to court documents unsealed on Monday.
The filing was part of a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders alleging the company’s board breached its duties to investors by approving the $2.6 billion acquisition of the struggling company, which was run by Musk's first cousins and of which he was a chairman and the largest stakeholder. The former SolarCity operations have been a drag on Tesla, with panel installations slumping since they were acquired.
Defendants asked the Delaware Court of Chancery judge to dismiss the case before it heads to a trial in March. Shareholder lawsuits that survive a motion to dismiss often settle before trial, which in this case might involve a payment to shareholders by Musk as well as money from directors’ insurance.
Tesla did not immediate respond to a request for comment on the allegations revealed in the documents. 
The suit represents another legal headache for Musk, the high-profile entrepreneur who settled a lawsuit by U.S. securities regulators last year over his use of Twitter and is being sued by for defamation by a British diver who said Musk falsely branded him a pedophile. Just last week, a Delaware judge ruled that Tesla must defend at trial Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package.
According to the filing, Musk was informed at a SolarCity board meeting in October 2015 that SolarCity needed to raise up to $300 million and was slashing its solar installation forecast for the year. The company issued $113 million in convertible notes a month later, of which Musk bought $10 million.
By February 2016, SolarCity management told the board its cash balances were forecast to drop below amounts required for a key line of credit for several months of the year. A default on that line of credit would trigger defaults on other debt instruments, the filing said.
Despite the bad news, Musk proposed the acquisition of SolarCity to the Tesla board later that month after a Lake Tahoe family vacation with his cousin, SolarCity Chief Executive and founder Lyndon Rive.
SolarCity did not disclose the details of its liquidity concerns to investors.
At a meeting of Tesla’s board on June 20, 2016, Musk advocated to fellow board members an initial acquisition price of $28.50 per share for SolarCity - a 30% premium to its market price - even though Tesla's financial adviser, Evercore, had recommended $25 to $27 a share.
The board ultimately approved an exchange ratio that represented a share price of $26.50 to $28.50 a share, though the offer was lowered later prior to the deal closing.
Once Tesla made the offer for SolarCity on June 21, Musk publicly recused himself from the deal. But according to the filings he held frequent meetings with Evercore and pushed investors in a series of phone calls to support the purchase.
""I could not be recused from all discussions ... I needed to voice my opinion, obviously,"" Musk said during questioning under oath by lawyers for the suing shareholders.
In the meantime, Musk assured Rive that he would ""have [him] covered"" with respect to cash needs until the acquisition closed as SolarCity ""was running crazy close"" to its liquidity covenants, the documents said.
The companies said SolarCity accepted the offer on Aug. 1, 2016.  The stock swap offer valued SolarCity at $25.37 a share, less than the initial proposal, and in line with the Evercore proposal. Shareholders approved the deal on Nov. 17.

At the time, Musk called the merger a ""no brainer"" that would create a renewable energy powerhouse, but many on Wall Street have billed it as a bailout of an affiliated firm. Tesla has since gutted its solar sales force and faced an 85% drop in installations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will on Tuesday promise to ""roll out the red carpet"" for American businesses with the most competitive tax rates in the hemisphere after Britain leaves the European Union.
Addressing U.S. and Canadian business leaders at a breakfast reception on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Johnson will say he plans to make Britain ""the best place in the world to start, run and build a business"".
""We are going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give. Whether that is new tax allowances for investment...or devising better regulation for the sectors in which the UK leads the world,"" he will say, according to advance extracts of the speech provided by his office.
""We want a market that is open to the world. With the most competitive tax rates and the best skilled workforce in the hemisphere. And so I say to our American friends we will roll out the red carpet.""
Johnson, who has pledged to take Britain out of the EU by the end of October, is due to discuss the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States during a meeting with President Donald Trump on Tuesday.
The United States is Britain's second biggest trading partner after the EU. It was the biggest individual country destination for UK exports in 2018, accounting for 19 percent of all British exports, or 118.2 billion pounds ($146.90 billion), and the second biggest source of imports to Britain, worth 72 billion pounds.
""This year our country takes a giant step out into the world,"" he will tell the event, which will also be attended by British companies operating in the United States. 
""We do it with confidence to make Britain the best place in the world to start, run and build a business. The place you will want to be, the place you will want your business to be. And that’s why I say to everyone here come and join us.""
Johnson's pitch could raise concern in the EU, which has voiced concern that it could be faced with a low-tax, low-regulation ""Singapore on Thames"" after Brexit - an economically powerful, immediate neighbor that seeks to attract investment through cutthroat competition with the bloc. 
The EU has insisted on firm ""level-playing field"" commitments from Britain in any Brexit deal - yet to be finalised - to ensure it could not put substandard products into the bloc's single market at dumping prices.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 06:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: We Company CEO Neumann starts talks on his role at WeWork parent - sources,"By Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann has started talks with board directors and investors to discuss his future role at the U.S. office-sharing start-up, including the possibility of giving up his title as chief executive, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Neumann has not yet agreed to step aside as CEO of WeWork parent We Company, and there is no certainty he will do so, the sources said. However, a board challenge planned by investors, including SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) and Benchmark Capital, has been put on hold until these discussions produce an outcome, the sources added.
Were the talks with Neumann to lead to a resolution, they could avert a showdown between SoftBank and one of its biggest investments. We Company postponed its initial public offering last week following push-back from perspective investors, not just over its widening losses, but also over Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.
This was a blow for SoftBank, which was hoping for We Company's IPO to bolster its fortunes as it seeks to woo investors for its second $108 billion Vision Fund. It invested in We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January.
But investor skepticism led to the start-up considering a potential IPO valuation earlier this month of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.
One possibility that Neumann is discussing is transitioning to a chairman role, the sources said. Details of the discussions and what Neumann would request in exchange for giving up his CEO title could not be learned. 
Another option would be for Neumann to remain as CEO, with an independent chairman brought in to join the board, according to one of the sources. 
Were Neumann to agree to a leadership transition, it would make it unlikely that We Company can proceed with its plans to complete an initial public offering by the end of the year. This would mean it would have replace a $6 billion debt deal it reached with banks this summer that is contingent on the start-up going public.
We Company is considering slowing its expansion so it burns through less cash and would therefore require less funding in the absence of an IPO in the near team, one of the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. WeWork and SoftBank declined to comment. Neumann and Benchmark Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As co-founder of We Company, Neumann holds special voting shares that enable him to dismiss dissident board directors and shoot down any challenge to his authority.
However, SoftBank also has leverage. It could choose not to back We Company's IPO or provide it with more funding. It has already funded the cash-burning start-up to the tune of $10 billion and was discussing committing another $1 billion to the IPO.
POWERFUL CEO
It is not uncommon for founders of fast-growing start-ups to be eccentric and control their companies tightly, even as they seek to attract stock market investors. Neumann, however, was criticized by investors and corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.
These included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.
Neumann also entered several transactions with We Company over the years, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.
Following criticism by potential investors, Neumann agreed to some concessions without relinquishing majority control. He agreed to give We Company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has reached with the New York-based start-up.
No member of Neumann's family will be on the company’s board and any successor will be selected by the board, scrapping a plan for his wife and co-founder, Rebekah Neumann, to help pick the successor.

These changes did little to address concerns about the business model for We Company, which rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent under long-term leases. This mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue raised questions among investors about how the company would weather an economic downturn.

It is not expected to be as disruptive as a Sept. 19 walkout organized by four unions protesting plans to restructure EDF, which cut power generation by over 10%.
A CGT spokesman said earlier on Monday that the 24-hour stoppage was part of nationwide action by unions in several sectors against the government's pension reform, which are expected to hit schools, public transport, hospitals and courts on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) will pay the families of 346 people killed in two fatal 737 MAX crashes $144,500 each from a $50 million financial assistance fund announced in July, the fund's administrators said on Monday.
The fund, overseen by Washington lawyers Ken Feinberg and Camille S. Biros, will begin accepting claims from family members immediately. Family members will not be required to waive or release the right to litigate as a condition of participation. The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
Claims must be postmarked no later than Dec. 31, the fund said.
Feinberg said Monday in an email to Reuters that ""finding all of these heirs and making sure the funds will be safe and secure will be a real challenge since the families can be found in 35 foreign countries.""
In a statement, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company continued to extend its ""deepest sympathies"" to the families and loved ones of victims of the twin crashes.
""The opening of this fund is an important step in our efforts to help affected families,"" he said.
Boeing also announced in July it planned to spend an additional $50 million to support education and economic empowerment in impacted communities.
Nearly 100 lawsuits have been filed against Boeing by at least a dozen law firms representing families of the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims, who came from 35 different countries, including nine U.S. citizens and 19 Canadians.
Families of about 60 victims have yet to file lawsuits but plaintiffs’ lawyers said they anticipate more to come. Most of the lawsuits do not make a specific dollar claim, though one law firm has said its clients are seeking more than $1 billion.
The lawsuits assert that Boeing defectively designed the automated flight control system. The system is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in both accidents.
Boeing has said it aims to win approval to resume flights early in the fourth quarter.
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration head Steve Dickson told Reuters last week it was not clear when Boeing will be able to conduct a certification test flight. But he said the agency should approve the plane's return about a month after the test flight occurs unless something unforeseen turns up.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>",Nigeria will do 'whatever it takes' to shield country from $9 bln claim,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Nigeria's government will do ""whatever it takes"" to protect its economy from a more than $9 billion arbitration claim over a failed gas project, policy makers said, but the government will not rule out a settlement with a firm registered in the British Virgin Islands.
In August, a judge in London granted Process and Industrial Developments Ltd (P&ID) the right to attempt to seize some $9 billion in assets from the Nigerian government over the gas project. The sum would be one of the largest financial penalties imposed on Nigeria, representing 20% of the currency reserves of Africa's largest economy and top oil producer.
""We will do whatever it takes to ensure the protection of the interests of the Nigerian government and the Nigerian people,"" the country's attorney general, Abubakar Malami, told Reuters.
Asked if the country would be open to an out-of-court settlement, Malami said he was not ruling out any possibilities, though Nigeria had not been approached formally by P&ID.
The company said earlier this month that if the government would ""come to the negotiating table, P&ID is ready for serious talks."" It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
Malami is part of a sizeable Nigerian delegation that traveled to London to meet investors, financial institutions and energy firms ahead of a hearing on Thursday, after which the court is expected to rule on the state’s efforts to fight the August decision.
""One of the argument we are putting up is that the court is not supposed to grant the application of P&ID relating to the attachment of Nigerian international assets,"" said Malami.
The little-known company founded by two Irishmen was awarded $6.6 billion in an arbitration decision over a failed project to build a gas processing plant in the southern Nigerian city of Calabar. It was based on what P&ID could have earned during the two-decade long agreement as part of a deal struck in 2010.
The judge's decision converted the arbitration award to a legal judgment and the sum, including interest accrued since 2013, soared to more than $9 billion.
Once the court issues a ruling, P&ID could start targeting assets such as real estate, bank accounts or any kind of moveable wealth. However, it has to prove the property is unrelated to Nigeria's operations as a sovereign state.
Information minister Lai Mohammed, also on the delegation, said he expected most assets would not be affected but said the government was assessing for vulnerabilities.
Last week, one former petroleum ministry official was charged with accepting bribes and failing to follow protocol, while two men linked to P&ID pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and tax evasion on behalf of the company.
""Investigations are ongoing,"" said Ibrahim Magu, chief of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
Central bank governor Godwin Emefiele warned that having assets to the tune of $9 billion seized would have ramifications well beyond the economic impact on Nigeria.
""You can imagine what sort of refugee situation it will create as Nigeria has the largest populated country in Africa,"" he said. ""This should not be allowed to happen. If it happens... what you’ll see with refugees through Libya will be a small thing."""

1. Consumer Confidence Seen Dipping
The economic calendar is fairly light tomorrow, but there will be a report on the U.S. consumer.
The Conference Board will issue its measure of consumer confidence for September at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The index is expected to tick down to 134.1 from 135.1 in August, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
In Europe, given today’s weak German economic numbers, investors will be closely watching the Ifo September business climate index, which comes out at 4:00 AM ET (08:00 GMT).
The index is seen edging up to 94.5 from 94.3 the month before.
2.   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) Holding Strong in Face of Tariffs?
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) reports earnings after the bell tomorrow and, apart from the numbers, investors will be looking again for any more insight about how trade battles are affecting the company.
On average, analysts are looking for  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) to post a profit of 70 cents per share, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Sales are seen coming in at about $10.4 billion.
Last month, Guggenheim put  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) on its Best Ideas List, nothing that despite a high multiple, the company has strong recent result, an innovative pipeline and one of the best names to mitigate tariff risk. The stock is up nearly 3.8% this month and 18.3% on the year.
Before the bell there will be results from the auto and auto parts sector, with AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and CarMax (NYSE:KMX) reporting.
3. API on Tap
The oil market will be watching for any progress between the U.S. and Iran at the UN General Assembly tomorrow.
But there will also be some number on which to focus.
The American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of weekly U.S. oil inventories at 4:30 PM ET (20:30 GMT).

The opening slump, which pushed the Dow down as many as 104 points, appeared to be a continuation of Friday's selloff, which was generated by reports of Chinese trade delegates opting to go home rather than visit farms in Nebraska and Montana.

1457,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>","Stocks sink on dismal euro zone data, dollar gains","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher while global shares slid on Monday as euro zone equities clocked their worst day in a month after dismal business activity readings in Europe deepened fears of a looming recession there.
Bond yields across the euro area tumbled after German private sector activity shrank for the first time in 6-1/2 years in September as a manufacturing recession worsened and service-sector growth also lost momentum.
Growth also slowed unexpectedly in France, the only other euro zone country for which IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index is published.
Germany's DAX stock index fell 1% to its biggest one-day fall since Aug. 23. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.80%.
Copper prices fell to their lowest in 2-1/2 weeks on weak demand prospects, reinforced after U.S.-China trade talks failed to yield a breakthrough last week.
""Trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world are having an impact ... the dreadful manufacturing figures from Germany this morning is a great example of how the problem spills out beyond the U.S. and China,"" said CMC Markets analyst David Madden in London.
Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex LLC said the euro zone flash PMI dashed hope that the worst was past.
The euro zone economy is not showing convincing signs of a rebound and a persistent downturn in manufacturing puts at risk the rest of the economy, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.22% and its emerging markets index lost 0.60%. 
U.S. stocks barely budged, with gains in shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) offset by mixed economic data that added to caution over the prolonged U.S.-China trade war. Apple Inc rose 0.46% after U.S. trade regulators approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions by the iPhone maker. U.S. employment in the services sector shrank in September for the first time in 9-1/2 years, IHS Markit's PMI showed. At 50.9 it was below expectations of 51.3. But data also showed manufacturing activity rose, topping expectations.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.92 points, or 0.06%, to 26,949.99. The S&P 500 lost 0.29 points, or 0.01%, to 2,991.78 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.21 points, or 0.06%, to 8,112.46.
The dollar climbed, buoyant in recent months as its relatively high yield and a strong U.S. economy attracted investors. 
The dollar index rose 0.11%, with the euro fell 0.23% to $1.0992. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.12% versus the greenback at 107.46 per dollar.
Bond yields across the euro area tumbled after the weak business activity data. The yield on Germany's benchmark 10-year bond fell to negative 0.59%, its lowest since the ECB meeting on Sept. 12 concluded with rate cuts and fresh asset purchases to boost weak growth.
U.S. Treasury yields dropped in line with the European bond market. U.S. 30-year, 10-year and 2-year yields all fell to two-week lows.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 10/32 in price to push its yield down to 1.718%. Crude oil futures stabilized after nearly a 7% gain last week. Concerns about global supplies following the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities offset prospects for quick restoration of the kingdom's output and worries about a weak European economy.
Global benchmark Brent futures settled up 49 cents to $64.77 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 55 cents to settle at $58.64.

Worries about Europe helped lift gold to its highest in more than two weeks. U.S. gold futures settled up 1.1% at $1,531.50 an ounce.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Wall Street investment banker Sean Stewart was found guilty on Monday of insider trading a second time for passing tips about healthcare industry mergers to his father.
The verdict was handed down by a Manhattan federal jury, according to a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors, less than a year after an appeals court overturned Stewart’s earlier conviction and ordered a retrial.
A lawyer for Stewart, 38, could not immediately be reached for comment. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 29.
Prosecutors said Stewart, who worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Perella Weinberg Partners, passed tips to his father Robert from 2011 to 2015. They said the tips yielded $1.16 million of profit for Robert Stewart and his friend Richard Cunniffe, to whom he had forwarded some of them.
Stewart was convicted of the charges for the first time in August 2017. In Feburary 2017, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain sentenced him to three years in prison.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year overturned his conviction and ordered a new trial. He had served about a year of his sentence.
The appeals court ruled that Stewart should have been allowed to challenge a crucial piece of evidence, a recorded conversation between his father and Cunniffe.
In the conversation, the elder Stewart recounted that his son complained about his failure to act on a tip by saying: ""I handed you this on a silver platter and you didn't invest in this.""
Swain barred Sean Stewart from introducing evidence about his father's later statements to investigators suggesting that Stewart did not intend to commit insider trading and had been drinking when he made the ""silver platter"" comment.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who oversaw the second trial, barred any mention of the ""silver platter"" comment altogether.
Robert Stewart pleaded guilty to a related conspiracy charge, and Cunniffe to fraud and conspiracy charges. Both were sentenced to probation."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission suffered a setback on Monday in a long-running legal battle when a federal appeals court struck down its latest effort to loosen U.S. media ownership rules.
The Republican-led FCC in 2017 voted 3-2 to eliminate the 42-year-old ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market. It also voted to make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market, and for local stations to jointly sell advertising time and for companies to buy additional radio stations in some markets.
The court told the FCC to take up the issue again, saying the regulator ""did not adequately consider the effect its sweeping rule changes will have on ownership of broadcast media by women and racial minorities.""
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement that despite instructions from Congress to review media ownership regulations a majority of federal appeals court judges for 15 years ""has taken that authority for themselves, blocking any attempt to modernize these regulations to match the obvious realities of the modern media marketplace.""
Pai added that ""there is no evidence or reasoning — newspapers going out of business, broadcast radio struggling, broadcast TV facing stiffer competition than ever — that will persuade them to change their minds.""
The FCC plans to challenge the decision, he added.
Big media companies including  Tegna Inc  (N:TGNA), CBS Corp (N:CBS) and Nexstar Media Group Inc (O:NXST) cited the 2017 rule change as motivation for considering expansion opportunities.
The FCC is weighing other changes to U.S. media ownership rules. In December, it sought comments on a rule that bars one company from owning two TV stations in the same market except under certain circumstances. The FCC asked if those rules continue ""to serve the public interest and remains necessary.""

The FCC is also considering if existing rules that limit the number of local radio stations in a single market should be rescinded, asking if the rule ""remains necessary to promote competition, localism, or viewpoint diversity.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Troubled British lender  Metro Bank  (L:MTRO) ditched a 250 million pound ($311 million) bond issue on Monday after failing to attract investors despite offering a hefty yield.
Metro, which launched on British high streets in 2010, has endured a torrid year after disclosing a major loan book error in January that wiped more than 1.5 billion pounds off its stock value.
The bank has struggled to rebuild investor confidence since the error, while investor concerns about the economic impact of a potential disorderly Brexit have also weighed on its share price.
The British challenger bank had launched the deal on Monday morning, looking to raise a minimum of 250 million pounds of bail-in debt known as 'MREL' to meet an interim regulatory deadline of Jan. 1 2020.
Even though the bank offered a chunky 7.5% yield on the new four-year bond issue -- in November last year the bank was targeting a yield of 2%-4% for MREL debt -- orders had only reached 175 million pounds by around 2 pm London time (1300 GMT).
The banks managing the transaction had also reduced the size of the deal sought from a minimum of 250 million pounds to 200-250 million pounds.
""Metro Bank PLC thanks the broad number of investors who have met with the company and shown interest in their potential inaugural MREL issuance. Given the current market conditions though Metro have elected to not proceed with a transaction at this time,"" the lender said in a statement."

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 12:37PM ET</span>",RIP Thomas Cook: holiday dreams washed away by tide of debt,"By Paul Sandle and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Thomas Cook sold tens of millions of Britons a summer holiday to remember with the slogan ""Don't just book it, Thomas Cook it"".
But behind the glossy brochures, it was struggling to adapt to market changes: while taking over rivals delivered short-term savings, it propelled the British brand toward a $2.1 billion debt pile that would ultimately seal its fate.
It narrowly avoided collapse in 2011 when, reeling from the Arab Spring, Icelandic volcano and a squeeze on British incomes, it had to beg for a 200 million pound ($249 million) lifeline. 
Eight years later it was in the same position, but its creditors had enough. With the business draining cash, Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser found its lenders, bondholders and even the government were no longer willing to step in.
Its collapse in the early hours of Monday left hundreds of thousands of people stranded at holiday destinations around the world and the British government leading the biggest peacetime repatriation in British history. 
One person familiar with the situation said lenders and bondholders had backed Thomas Cook through the busy summer months, when up to 2 million people were on holiday in peak weeks, and then pulled the plug at the first opportunity. 
""It wasn't a deal (the lenders) wanted to do,"" the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""It is exposed to events that can't be predicted, they didn't understand it.""
The British government decided Thomas Cook was a bet it did not want to take after the banks had lost patience. 
Media reports in recent weeks had prompted suppliers to call in debts and future customers to go elsewhere, draining the business of the cash it needed to continue. ""It got to a full scale run on the business,"" the person said. 
MORTGAGING THE FUTURE
The pressure on the balance sheet stemmed from the 2007 merger of Thomas Cook, which was German owned at the time, with Airtours-brand owner MyTravel, creating a 2.8 billion-pound group. 
Both companies had survived an industry downturn a few years earlier by slashing jobs, and boss Manny Fontenla-Novoa delivered more cuts, helping him to take home 7 million pounds in 2008 as his reward. 
Two years later, Thomas Cook drove more consolidation by buying the Co-operative Group's high street travel and foreign exchange business, giving it a total of 1,200 shops.
By betting on size, the company had burdened itself with expensive shops just as more customers were moving online.
In 2010, the industry was rocked by disruption from the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud and the Arab Spring, leading to a string of profit warnings. 
Fontenla-Novoa quit in 2011, after he had earned 17.2 million pounds during his tenure.
Months later the company agreed a 200 million pound loan from lenders, with an eye-watering 6% interest, rising 0.5 percentage points every quarter.
DEBT MOUNTAIN 
Harriet Green was hired in 2012 to lead a turnaround, after telling the chairman ""I think you need me"".
After cutting the cost base she left suddenly two years later, having increased the value of the group from 148 million pounds to just under 2 billion pounds. She earned nearly 4.9 million pounds.
Company insider Fankhauser took over. He apologized for the tragic deaths of two children while staying at a hotel booked through Thomas Cook in 2006, and initiated an independent review of its customer service.
He also reduced the company's portfolio of hotels and jettisoned Club 18-30, a ""sun, sea and sex"" brand that reached a zenith in the 1990s but felt increasingly dated.
However, he was forever boxed-in by the company's $2.1 billion debt, which required the group to sell 3 million holidays to service.
He agreed the main terms of a rescue deal from its largest shareholder, China's Fosun Tourism, last month, but was unable to secure 200 million to keep operating through the winter.
In May of this year the company wrote off the value of the MyTravel deal, some 12 years after the tie-up.
Alarmed by the rate at which the business was burning through cash and with the tough winter period ahead, its stakeholders pulled their support. In desperate meetings held over the weekend, it even asked credit card companies to release 50 million pounds held as collateral against its bookings.
Fankhauser has earned 8.3 million pounds, including 4.3 million pounds in 2015. 
""There was no way to prevent this collapse,"" a second source familiar with the situation said. ""What else was left to do?""
The last passengers on a Thomas Cook flight landed in Manchester, England, on Monday morning, as customers and staff tried to come to terms with the loss of a company that, founded in 1841, had brought much joy to millions.
Holidaymaker Ricky Houston said on Monday he'd had a fantastic week in Corfu, Greece, with Thomas Cook. 

""I feel sorry for the reps"", he said. ""For us it's an inconvenience, for them, it's their livelihoods.""

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 11:17AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing bid for Embraer unit faces EU antitrust probe - sources,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) is set to face an EU antitrust investigation of up to five months into its bid for a controlling stake in the commercial aircraft arm of Brazil's Embraer, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The deal, marking the biggest shift in commercial aerospace in decades, would reshape a global passenger jet duopoly and reinforce Western planemakers against newcomers from China, Russia and Japan.
It would give Boeing a foothold in the lower end of the market, enabling it to better compete with the CSeries jets designed by Canada's Bombardier Inc and backed by European rival Airbus SE.
The deal values the Embraer unit at $4.75 billion.
Embraer shares opened lower after Reuters' report on the impending investigation and were trading 2.1% weaker at 1455 GMT. 
The European Commission, which has set an Oct. 4 deadline for its preliminary review of the deal, did not respond to a request for immediate comment. 
The EU competition enforcer will launch a full-scale investigation following the end of its review, which could take up to five months and raises pressure on Boeing to offer concessions to address competition concerns.
The Commission recently quizzed suppliers and rivals on the deal, indicating concerns about the concentration in the market.
They were asked about the impact of the reduced number of players, from seven to six and from three to two in various segments, a person with direct knowledge of the deal said.
Boeing said it was engaged with regulatory authorities in relevant jurisdictions and was continuing to work through the regulatory approvals process.
Embraer was not immediately available for comment. 
Aviation analysts say there is limited overlap in the number of seats between Boeing’s 737 family and Embraer‘s smaller E2 jets. 

There is slightly more overlap between Airbus’s portfolio and Bombardier’s CSeries program which the European planemaker bought last year, they add.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 11:01AM ET</span>",Strains that sank Thomas Cook weigh on European airlines,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - The collapse of travel group Thomas Cook (L:TCG) and a trio of subsidiary airlines, leaving 600,000 holidaymakers stranded, is unlikely to be the last failure among Europe's struggling second-tier carriers.
As Britain was activating plans for its biggest peacetime repatriation, two smaller operators, Aigle Azur and XL Airways, were before the French bankruptcy courts on Monday.
Shares in larger airlines rose on expectations that Thomas Cook's demise would bring them more passengers, higher fares and new airport slots. But many are wrestling with similar problems.
""We expect all the airlines we cover to rally today but we caution investors not to get over-exuberant, given other challenges,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst David Perry - citing higher fuel prices, a strong dollar and cut-throat competition.
The list of sector bankruptcies is growing: Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia failed in 2017, followed by Primera and Cobalt last year and Germania, Flybmi and Iceland's WOW so far in 2019. Regional operator Flybe's sale to a Virgin Atlantic-led consortium has narrowly averted its collapse.
Larger European carriers are not immune from the threat.
Third-ranked low-cost operator Norwegian Air (OL:NWC), which has bled cash while making inroads in the transatlantic market, won a reprieve from creditors last week, postponing repayment on $380 million in debt for up to two years.
Last week's oil price spike that followed attacks on Saudi infrastructure will have a knock-on effect for kerosene prices that were already running high.
BREXIT 'LAST STRAW'
The strong dollar has further inflated prices for fuel and plane leases - two of the sector's biggest costs that are usually billed in the U.S. currency.
For British operators the problem is exacerbated by the pound's slide, amid worries over the country's impending European Union exit. At Thomas Cook, currency effects likely increased some leasing costs averaging $250,000 per jet by about a quarter once converted into sterling, industry sources said.
The venerable travel brand also suffered from deliberate price-slashing by rivals TUI (DE:TUIGn) and Jet2 (L:DTG), Bernstein analyst Richard Clarke said, and a ""flood of cheap flights"" from online-only operators.
But he added: ""Brexit was likely the straw that broke the camel's back.""
European airline traffic has grown 1.6% so far this year, according to air traffic control body Eurocontrol, about half the rate assumed in industry capacity plans. That has made it harder to fill planes or raise fares, adding earnings pressure that can be eased by bankruptcies or mergers.
The liquidation of Thomas Cook's 1% share of the market for European flights is unlikely to bring much relief on its own.
Shares in easyJet (L:EZJ), seen as one of the more likely airline beneficiaries, were nonetheless 3.2% higher at 1345 GMT, with Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) up by 1.5%, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) by 0.6% and Ryanair (I:RYA) 0.4%.
FRAGMENTED
Smaller airlines are more vulnerable in part because they struggle to cover fixed costs accounting for a sizeable share of their budgets for maintenance, training and other essentials.
XL Airways, which was in court to be placed under bankruptcy protection on Monday, last year transported 730,000 passengers, mainly to the West Indies and Reunion Island.
In another courtroom on the other side of Paris, bidders including IAG's (L:ICAG) Vueling and a former Air France executive were presenting offers for Aigle Azur. Between them, the two carriers employ 1,700 staff and operate 15 Airbus jets.
Europe's fragmented market of small carriers reflects impediments to consolidation that prevent them merging to gain critical mass - including third-country flying rights deals that remain national - and can thwart rescues when they fail.
Air France withdrew an offer for Aigle Azur last week after it became clear absorbing the carrier would require a complex deal with its own unions. EasyJet also dropped out.
Phil Seymour, chief executive at UK aviation consulting firm IBA, believes the biggest single threat remains the strong dollar, ""against the euro and particularly against the pound.""
Multiple strains on the sector will continue to push airlines toward bankruptcy, he said. ""We expect to see more."""
1474,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 10:45AM ET</span>","At shuttered Ohio plant, workers still hope for new GM vehicle","By Nick Carey
LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - When asked about reports General Motors Co (N:GM) may turn its shuttered Lordstown, Ohio, plant into a battery factory, ""Buffalo"" Joe Nero snorts and points at the vast complex that until six months ago made the Chevrolet Cruze.
""You can't support a plant like this making batteries. We need a new vehicle allocated to us,"" said Nero, 62, who has worked at five plants over 42 years with the No. 1 U.S. automaker. 
""It wouldn't even cover 10% of the facility or hire 10% of the people, and they wouldn't pay enough to support yourself, let alone a family,"" he said.
The United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which went on strike last week, agrees. 
The sprawling Lordstown plant at one time employed more than 4,500 workers. GM's decision to close it and three other U.S. facilities due to sagging U.S. passenger car sales has drawn widespread criticism, including from President Donald Trump. Ohio is a crucial swing state in the 2020 presidential election.
The closure is part of the reason for the UAW strike, to demand that GM build another vehicle there. The union also wants GM to reduce the use of temporary workers and share more of its profits, a decade after the union helped the company through a government-led bankruptcy. 
Visiting nearby Youngstown soon after becoming president in 2017, Trump told workers that factory jobs would not leave, advising them: ""Don't move, don't sell your house."" Since GM's announcement, Trump has urged the Detroit company to move vehicle production back to the United States from Mexico. 
As part of contract talks with the UAW, GM has suggested the Lordstown facility could be converted to an electric vehicle (EV) battery plant. Separately, it says it is also negotiating to sell the plant to a group affiliated with EV start-up Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS). 
A source familiar with GM's plans said if the sale goes ahead, the automaker would then build a new battery plant near the Lordstown facility.
Workhorse declined to comment.
In Washington in June, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra defended the Workhorse plan. She also told Reuters that GM had no intention of building a new vehicle in Lordstown.
Lordstown workers say that's the only way there will be enough well-paid manufacturing jobs for the community. They - and the UAW - place the blame squarely on GM.
""You did everything GM ever asked of you and it still wasn't enough,"" UAW Local 1112 president Tim O'Hara told 100 cheering workers during a rally outside the plant on Friday. ""We're going to hold the line as long as it takes.""
The reality is that GM needs to cut back underutilized U.S. manufacturing capacity even at current levels, said Sam Fiorani, a vice president with Auto Forecast Solutions.
""There's no chance that GM is going to put a product back into that plant,"" he said. ""They have too much capacity as it is.""
GM's capacity utilization rate in its North American plants is about 75 percent, excluding idled assembly plants in Lordstown and Detroit, research firm LMC Automotive said.
THE LAST CRUZE 
The 6.2-million-sq foot (576,000 sq meters) Lordstown complex has manufactured more than 16 million vehicles since it opened in 1966. The last Cruze rolled off the line in March.
Most workers here have taken transfers to other GM plants. But around 450 workers have not, many because they did not want to uproot their families.
Even if the Workhorse deal goes through, workers wonder how many people the plant would employ, whether they would still be working for GM and what kind of pay cut that would entail.
UAW workers at the top of the wage scale earn about $31 an hour, compared with the $15-$17 an hour workers are paid at a GM battery plant near Detroit that operates under a side agreement.
Analysts said neither a Workhorse nor a GM plant would be likely to employ even half the plant's previous workforce.
""Nothing other than vehicle production has even a hope of replacing the jobs and income and economic impact of what was previously there as an automotive assembly plant,"" said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The UAW said in a 2018 research paper that the disruptive effect of electric vehicles and their less complex batteries compared with gasoline-powered engines meant that fewer workers were going to be needed in the future.
Teresa Oakes, 44, has done the math.
""If they made batteries here it would allow them to lower wages to the bare minimum,"" said Oakes, who worked at the plant for 10 years. ""GM should bring back vehicles they make in Mexico and have them made by U.S. workers instead."" 
Most other jobs in the Lordstown area pay less, including at warehouses like the one discount retailer TJX Companies Inc (N:TJX) is building nearby.
Rick Michaels, 49, took a transfer to a plant in Lansing, Michigan, and travels 4-1/2 hours home every weekend to see his family. He was on the picket line at Lordstown all week.
""If GM opened a battery factory here, that would barely employ all the people here,"" Michaels said on Friday, pointing at the rally crowd. ""There would be no way for me to get back home.""
Doug Grant, 59, was picketing in a homemade T-shirt that read ""DID YOU MAKE $21,905,256 IN 2017"" on the front and ""MARY BARRA DID!"" on the back.
Grant, who said he declined to take a transfer to another GM facility, said it could take years to get a battery plant up and running.

""That's way too long,"" he said. ""That puts me right out of the game.""

1475,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 10:41AM ET</span>","Swiss probe incident involving ex-Credit Suisse banker Khan, private detectives","ZURICH (Reuters) - Prosecutors have opened a criminal probe into an incident in which  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) allegedly hired private detectives to shadow the Swiss bank's ex-wealth management head, Iqbal Khan, the Zurich attorney's office said on Monday.
Khan, a rising star in Swiss finance, is moving to rival bank UBS (S:UBSG) to head its wealth management unit in October, just three months after leaving Credit Suisse. 
Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung, without citing its sources, reported on Sunday that Credit Suisse had hired three detectives to investigate whether Khan was seeking to lure its employees to UBS. 
The Zurich attorney's office said Khan filed a criminal complaint last week alleging threats and coercion in a Sept. 17 confrontation, but did not say who made the threats or what they were.
""As a result of a criminal complaint (by Khan)...the Zurich District Attorney has opened a criminal investigation into coercion/threat,"" a prosecutors office spokesman said in an email.
Khan, via a spokesman, denied trying to poach Credit Suisse workers for his new employer.
""Suspicions that he was trying to hire people away from Credit Suisse are absurd,"" the spokesman said.
SonntagsZeitung said one of the men allegedly following Khan sought to take Khan's phone after he tried to take a photograph of the detectives' car. 
Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam and Chairman Urs Rohner said a detailed inquiry was under way, but sought to play down the media reports.
""There are significant inaccuracies in the reporting that have sensationalized both facts and events,"" the two leaders wrote in the memo seen by Reuters. 
""Please rest assured that a detailed inquiry has been launched by the Board of Directors into these events and we are confident that the truth will emerge."" 
Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants who came to Switzerland when he was 12, is seen in Swiss banking circles as a potential future CEO of a big Swiss bank, such as UBS. 
Swiss media, including financial industry website Inside Paradeplatz, reported that the incident last month began when Khan, 43, and his wife were tailed by another vehicle carrying three men to near the Swiss National Bank building in the heart of Zurich's financial district.
Khan stepped from his car and attempted to photograph the other vehicle with his cell phone.
SonntagsZeitung reported that the occupants of the other vehicle fled after passers-by noticed the altercation, adding the three men were eventually detained for questioning.
Financial institutions including in Switzerland are covetous of client-employee relationships, and sometimes place employees or ex-employees under intense scrutiny to ensure they do not violate non-compete clauses or other contractual obligations.
""Mostly, such practices never meet the light of day,"" Swiss reputation consultant Bernhard Bauhofer told Swiss tabloid Blick. 
Khan announced his resignation from Credit Suisse in July ""to pursue other opportunities"".
UBS said last month that it had appointed Khan to co-head its flagship wealth management business starting on Oct. 1 as part of a broader shake-up of its executive board.

UBS and Swiss financial supervisor FINMA declined to comment.

CORFU, Greece (Reuters) - Holidaymakers hit by the collapse of Thomas Cook (L:TCG), the world's oldest tourist firm, desperately scrambled for information on Monday on how to get home, as Britain mounted its largest repatriation effort since World War Two.
From job losses to canceled honeymoons, the demise of the package tour pioneer has brought a heavy human cost and left an estimated 600,000 people stranded worldwide.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) scoured mobile phones or quizzed officials for travel updates as they waited in long queues beneath flight boards showing flights delayed or canceled.
""From Thomas Cook we didn’t get anything. I feel sorry for the reps because I don’t think they knew anything either. It was the hotel which kept us up to date,"" said Ricky Houston, who said his flight to the northern English city of Newcastle from the Greek island of Corfu had been delayed by nine hours.
""Everyone in the hotel here is shocked, and everyone in this hotel has come with Thomas Cook... (But) for us, it's an inconvenience, for them (the reps) it's their livelihoods,"" added Houston, who is from Dunfermline in Scotland.
David Midson, from Kent in southeast England, was trying to find information at the front desk of his hotel in Roda, Corfu.
""There’s a sign saying that Thomas Cook customers should get in touch with their agency, but you don’t get through to anybody because it doesn’t exist,” he said.
""I wish I had brought a driving license, because I can't get a taxi (to the airport).""
The British government has pledged to get an estimated 150,000 stranded British holidaymakers home in the biggest such repatriation operation since World War Two, but that is no consolation for many others whose holiday plans lie in ruins.
""We're absolutely gutted, we've looked forward to this for a long time, had the wedding in July so it's been another couple of months waiting for this,"" said Simon, who had been due to go on honeymoon with his wife Polly from London's Gatwick Airport.
He said he felt very sorry for the staff at his local Thomas Cook travel agency who he said had been helpful.
""Must be awful for them as well, coming up to Christmas as well... I wish the government had maybe stepped in... It could have been done I think, but there's nothing we can do now. Just have to go home and make the most of it.""
""NIGHTMARE, NIGHTMARE""
Steve Tarrant, who had planned to fly to the Mexican resort of Cancun from Manchester, said he had given up trying to get information about rescheduled flights.
""So we just took it upon ourselves to book another flight,"" he said, at an extra cost of 1,200 pounds ($1,490).
In Palma airport on the Spanish island of Mallorca, the mood was similarly grim.

1479,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 09:28AM ET</span>","Go on ‘High Guard’ Against U.S. Stock Volatility, LPL Warns","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock swings may be poised to increase into the end of September.
The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is pushing higher after ending Friday at 15.32 -- its greatest level in two weeks. That came on a day with quadruple witching, when options and futures on indexes and equities expire, so extra price swings amid heavier-than-normal volume weren’t that surprising. But a reading just above 15 isn’t terribly volatile when one considers that the markets have endured a spate of central-bank decisions, trade-conflict ups and downs, the attack on Saudi oil facilities, tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump and more.
“With all of those scary headlines, stocks are actually in the midst of one of the least volatile two-week stretches we’ve seen in years,” Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note on Friday. “September is historically known as one of the worst for stocks,” he added, though the S&P 500 was up 2.2% in the month.
In fact, that Friday close for the VIX is below the gauge’s 2019 average of about 15.9. And it comes as the S&P 500 sits at 2,992.07, just a bit more than 1% below its record high from July.
Can all this calm last?  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) is skeptical.
“Realized volatility in U.S. equities has fallen sharply over the last two weeks to its lowest levels in a year, near the lowest on record in this cycle, a far cry from the extremely elevated levels at the beginning of the month,” strategists including Parag Thatte and Binky Chadha wrote in a note Friday. “It is rare for volatility to stay at such low levels and we are likely to see a pick up in the coming weeks, especially if the trade conflict escalates with the S&P 500 near new highs.“
Nomura Securities International Inc.’s Charlie McElligott has been warning of the potential for stocks to trade lower between options expiration and month-end, a point he reiterated on Monday. “Demand flows” from overwriters and corporates disappear after expiration and as a blackout on stock buybacks comes, he said.
“With the S&P 500 up near our fair value target of 3,000, we would be on the lookout for this sea of tranquility to get rougher at any time,” Detrick said in his note. “In fact, according to historical calendars, we may need to be on high guard for the second half of September.”"

Online savings banks are starting to take market share away from traditional consumer banks, increasingly offering higher interest rates on deposits to a new generation of savvy, affluent consumers, who want higher payouts on their deposits. 
According to analysts at brokerage Evercore ISI, these online banks have now cornered about 10% of the overall deposit market in the U.S. - or roughly $1.26 trillion. 
""There are now a dozen plus online only savings banks (and some of the E-brokers) offering much higher yields as a way to entice deposit growth ... and it's working,"" Evercore said in research note. 
The 10 largest banks led by Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) currently dominate industry deposits, owning a 48% share, or roughly $6.13 trillion, according to the report. 
Limited overhead and regulatory-light models have helped large online banks pay five to 10 times more on deposits than traditional consumer banks, said the report.
The market share of these online banks have more than trebled in the last decade, buoyed by higher rates during a low-rate environment, among other things. 

The brokerage also expects growth in deposits to improve in the near future as new entrants are expected to grab market share from smaller players who have not upgraded their computer systems. Newer entrants have so far edged out smaller peers by being more tech-savvy and also by offering better rates to consumers.

The iPhone maker has been arguing its case at the European Union’s General Court to topple a record 13 billion-euro ($14.3 billion) EU tax order. This week the same panel of judges will deliver a ruling on two smaller but related challenges by  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). and a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV unit.
They’re the first in a series of cases to come to a decision as companies rail against EU Competition chief Margrethe Vestager’s five-year crackdown on allegedly unfair tax deals.
While the facts of the various appeals differ, Tuesday’s decisions “should have a far-reaching impact, both on the other pending cases and going forward,” said Howard Liebman, a tax partner at law firm Jones Day in Brussels, who isn’t involved in the disputes.
The judges’ stance will “presumably establish some precedent as to how far the court is willing to allow the commission to extend its approach of judging tax regimes -– and individual tax rulings –- in the context of a state-aids analysis,” he said.
Vestager’s Probes
Appeals have been piling up at the EU courts since state-aid investigators started work in 2013 to unearth what they deem to be the most problematic examples of otherwise legal individual tax agreements doled out to companies by countries. The judges’ verdicts could empower or halt Vestager’s probes, which are now centering on fiscal deals done by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Starbucks and Fiat were targeted on the same day in 2015 by a similar EU order to pay back about 30 million euros each over their tax arrangements in the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively.
The commission accused Luxembourg and the Netherlands of granting so-called tax rulings to the companies that backed “artificial and complex methods” to calculate their taxable profits that didn’t reflect “economic reality.”
The EU said at the time the companies did this by setting prices for products and services sold between units -- called transfer prices -- that didn’t reflect market conditions.
“As a result, most of the profits of Starbucks’ coffee roasting company are shifted abroad, where they are also not taxed, and Fiat’s financing company only paid taxes on underestimated profits,” said in a 2015 statement.
Back Taxes
Luxembourg has since also been ordered to recoup 250 million euros from Amazon.com and 120 million euros in back taxes from energy utility Engie SA, France’s former natural-gas monopoly, previously known as GDF Suez (PA:ENGIE).
In the Apple case, the EU said Ireland illegally slashed the iPhone maker’s tax bill between 2003-2014, a finding the company and Irish officials don’t accept.
The EU alleged that “Apple paid essentially no tax on earnings in Europe” and “sought headlines by quoting tiny numbers, but this public campaign ignores the taxes Apple pays all across the world,” Apple attorney Daniel Beard said at last week’s hearing.
The Dutch finance ministry said it had nothing to add to previous statements criticizing the EU’s approach. Fiat Chrysler, Starbucks, Apple and the commission declined to comment, as did the Luxembourg and Irish finance ministries.
EU nations ordered to claw back the allegedly illegal tax aid have accused the commission of overreaching itself by using state aid law to attack individual fiscal arrangements that dated back many years. A key question for the commission in the cases is whether its argument that these tax rulings were selective and unfair stands up in court.
“The commission did not identify a single instance where a taxpayer was treated less favorably than Apple,” Paul Gallagher, a lawyer for Ireland, told the judges in the court hearings last week.
Luxembourg, which has so far faced the brunt of the EU’s decisions, has attacked the “arbitrary nature” of the commission’s approach which creates “complete legal uncertainty,” their lawyer Denis Waelbroeck said in a court hearing about Fiat’s case last year. Ireland and Luxembourg have supported each other in their respective appeals.
The nation was among the first EU countries to be singled out in 2014 over its tax practices, when a group of investigative reporters published thousands of pages from secret arrangements between the tiny nation and companies including Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s Skype and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. The so-called LuxLeaks publications have been used by EU regulators in their deliberations and EU officials further expanded their probes by seeking new information to find more “outliers” among these tax deals.
Still, in a first in the EU’s continued crackdown on “outliers” among these otherwise legal tax rulings, the commission last year closed its probe into the fiscal deal between McDonald’s Corp. and Luxembourg, finding there was no violation of state aid laws.
The cases are T-636/16 - Starbucks and Starbucks Manufacturing Emea v. Commission, T-755/15 - Luxembourg v. Commission, T-759/15 - Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe v. Commission, T-760/15 - Netherlands v. Commission,

Neset Kockar, who holds an 8% stake in the UK-based travel firm, said Thomas Cook owes ""a few hundred million pounds"" to Turkish businesses that may not be paid after it is sold.

Tourism is a vital sector for Tunisia's economy and a key source of foreign currency, and the government had expected another 50,000 Thomas Cook customers to visit this year, he added. 
""I will have a meeting on Tuesday with the British Embassy in Tunisia and the hotel owners to see how debt could be redeemed,"" Trabelsi said.
The collapse of Thomas Cook, one of Britain's oldest companies, has stranded more than half a million tourists around the world. It ran hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year in 16 countries.
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the government had a fleet of planes ready to bring home British customers over the next two weeks and they should not go to the airport until they had been informed they were due on a return flight. 
The British regulator is also contacting hotels hosting Thomas Cook customers to tell them that they will be paid by the government, through an insurance scheme. 
Some British tourists said a hotel in Tunisia briefly stopped them leaving on Saturday night, demanding they settle bills that Thomas Cook owed for their stay. The Tunisian government said it was a misunderstanding. 
Major European tour operators only started to return to Tunisia last year after militants killed 39 tourists, mostly British, in an attack on a beach in Sousse and 21 people in the Bardo National Museum in the capital Tunis.
Tourism accounts for around 8% of Tunisia's economy and employs 400,000 people. It had expected to receive a record 9 million tourists by the end of 2019 after recovering from the impact of the 2015 attacks.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) is aiming for a big slice of the multibillion-dollar diabetes market with a new pill, approved by U.S. authorities on Friday, that caters for patients with an aversion to needles.
The company built its position as the world's biggest insulin maker on the back of injectable drugs, but now aims to transform the market with a first-of-its-kind tablet version of its semaglutide drug.
While more than 70% of diabetes prescriptions in the United States are already for oral treatments, none of these are from the GLP-1 class that Novo specializes in, and which are viewed as highly effective medicines that stimulate insulin production.
""We have only worked with around 25% of the patients so far and we see it as a breakthrough because we can now also address the tablet-based market,"" chief scientific officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen told Reuters on Monday.
Investors have been concerned the once-daily pill, known as Rybelsus, would be sold more cheaply than comparable injectable treatments as Novo tries to secure a foothold in the tablet market, where drugs tend to be cheaper.
However, chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen told analysts the monthly price would be similar to the company's once-weekly injectable version of semaglutide, Ozempic, which has a list price of nearly $800 per month.
""Overall this removes a concern that the company would have been forced much lower on price,"" said Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia, who has an 'outperform' rating on Novo shares.
Competitors include Eli Lilly's (N:LLY) injectable Trulicity and Merck's (N:MRK) Januvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin. A study last year showed Novo's tablet was superior to Januvia in demonstrating reductions in both long-term blood sugar level and weight.
""We have a very strong position if you look at the leading tablet treatments in the market,"" Thomsen said.
Novo hopes to convince doctors that Rybelsus, which brokerage Pareto estimates will have sales of at least 36.6 billion Danish crowns ($5.4 billion) in 2026, provides a new weapon to tackle diabetes earlier, and highly effectively.
Thomsen said the U.S. approval was a triumph of perseverance. ""We were laughed at when we told our peers about it. They thought we had eaten or smoked something weird,"" he said of the early plans for the drug.
The name Rybelsus was picked because of its similarity to the word rebellious. ""There is a revolt against why biological drugs should always be treated through injections,"" said Thomsen."
1487,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 07:39AM ET</span>","British travel firm Thomas Cook collapses, leaving hundreds of thousands stranded","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's oldest travel firm Thomas Cook (L:TCG) collapsed on Monday, stranding more than half a million holidaymakers around the globe and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.
The liquidation marks the end of a British company that started in 1841 running local rail excursions before pioneering the package holiday and growing into one of the world's largest tour operators.
It ran hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year in 16 countries. Employing 21,000, it currently has 600,000 people abroad, forcing governments and insurance companies to coordinate a huge rescue operation. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to get stranded British travelers home, increasing pressure on the government just as it tries to negotiate an incredibly complicated withdrawal from the European Union.
He said the government had rejected a bailout request of about 150 million pounds ($187 million) from Thomas Cook because doing so would have set up a ""moral hazard"".
""It is a very difficult situation and obviously our thoughts are very much with the customers of Thomas Cook,"" Johnson told reporters on a plane as he headed to the U.N. General Assembly in New York. ""We will do our level best to get them home.""
Thomas Cook has been brought low by a $2.1 billion debt pile that prevented it from responding to more nimble online competition. With debts built up around 10 years ago due to several ill-timed deals, it had to sell three million holidays a year just to cover its interest payments. 
As it struggled to pitch itself to a new generation of tourists, the company was hit by the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, one of its top destinations, and the 2018 Europe-wide heatwave which deterred customers from going abroad.
Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said it was a matter of profound regret that the company had gone out of business after it failed to secure a rescue package from its lenders in frantic, knife-edge talks over the weekend.
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said Thomas Cook had ceased trading and the regulator and government had a fleet of planes ready to bring home the more than 150,000 British customers over the next two weeks.
The impact could already be felt further afield, with Australian travel group  Webjet  Ltd (AX:WEB) saying it was 27 million euros out of pocket and British online travel group On The Beach (L:OTB) saying it would suffer from helping its customers in resorts who had flown with Thomas Cook. 
The collapse could provide a boost, however, to major rival TUI (DE:TUIGn), whose shares surged more than 8% in early Monday trading, and to Europe's overcrowded airline sector, which could benefit from the closure of Thomas Cook's airline business. 
PROFOUND REGRET
""I would like to apologize to our millions of customers, and thousands of employees, suppliers and partners who have supported us for many years,"" Fankhauser said in a statement. 
Pictures posted on social media showed Thomas Cook planes being diverted away from the normal airport stands. 
""Love my job so much, don't want it to end,"" Kia Dawn Hayward, a member of the company's cabin crew, said on Twitter.
Customers were told not to travel to airports until they have been informed via a special website - thomascook.caa.co.uk - that they were due on a return flight being organized by the government. 
The website showed some flights were returning to different British airports, but many were only running a few hours behind the original Thomas Cook scheduled flight and the system appeared to be working well in the early hours. 
The British regulator is also contacting hotels hosting Thomas Cook customers to tell them that they will be paid by the government, through an insurance scheme. That was after some customers were briefly held in a hotel in Tunisia when staff asked for additional payments to be made. 
Gary Seale, a guest at the Orangers Hotel in Hammamet, Tunisia, posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Saturday that ""security have refused to let us out of the hotel and barricaded us in"". He later posted that he had reached the airport and flew home on Sunday.
In Germany, a major customer market for Thomas Cook, insurance companies will coordinate the response. 
The company's German holiday airline Condor said it had asked its government for a bridging loan, and said it would continue flying. 
MAJOR CONSEQUENCES
The collapse has the potential to spark chaotic scenes around the world, with holidaymakers stuck in hotels that have not been paid as far afield as Goa, Gambia and Greece.
In the longer term, it could also hit the tourism sectors in the company's biggest destinations, such as Spain and Turkey, leave fuel suppliers out of pocket and further damage British shopping streets with the closure of hundreds of travel agents. 
The group had seemed set for a rescue when it agreed the key terms of a 900 million pound recapitalization plan with its biggest shareholder, China's Fosun (HK:1992), and the travel firm's banks in August. 
But in finalizing the terms of the deal, the company was hit with a demand for another facility of 200 million pounds in underwritten funds by its banks. Fosun said it was disappointed by the company's failure to strike a deal with its banks and bondholders, and noted it had remained supportive throughout. 
Prime Minister Johnson said Thomas Cook's collapse raised questions about whether directors of travel companies were ""properly incentivised"" to avoid bankruptcy.
""We need to look at ways in which tour operators one way or another can protect themselves from such bankruptcies in future and clearly the systems that we have in place to make sure (they) don't in the end come to the taxpayer for help,"" he said.

Shares of rival TUI AG surged as much as 11% in London, while online peer On The Beach Group Plc gained as much as 6.3%, boosted by the prospect of reduced industry capacity. Budget airlines also rose, though one decliner was Webjet, the Australian travel group which has a hotel sourcing deal with Thomas Cook.
“The effects will be felt across the sector, not all bad,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said in emailed commentary. “Airlines are firmer today as they should feel the benefit from the abrupt loss of short-haul capacity.”
Bernstein analyst Richard Clarke sees the potential for several other tour operators collapsing, though predicts TUI will be among those that benefit from the shake-out.
Here’s a round-up of stocks affected by Thomas Cook’s collapse:
Tour operators

DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Germany's Ceconomy (DE:CECG), Europe’s biggest consumer electronics group, is in talks to resolve a long-running dispute with a major shareholder of subsidiary Media Saturn, people close to the matter said on Monday.
Under the transaction being discussed, the holding of the Kellerhals family, Convergenta, would swap its stake in the jointly held Media Saturn for a 25% stake in Ceconomy and get a cash payment on top, the sources said.
The Ceconomy shares would come from a capital increase in kind, with the total share and cash deal worth roughly 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion), the sources said.
Ceconomy’s shares briefly reversed earlier losses, rising as much 4.9% after the Reuters story was published before settling back to trade almost flat at 1040GMT.
Analysts have speculated that settling the dispute could allow Ceconomy to pursue a more aggressive acquisition strategy, with the European consumer electronics market seen as ripe for a shake-out due to competition from online players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Ceconomy, which split off from retail conglomerate Metro (DE:B4B) in part to allow it to become more active in acquisitions, took a 24 percent stake in French rival Fnac Darty (PA:FNAC) in 2017.
Ceconomy management had battled for years over strategy with German billionaire Erich Kellerhals, the co-founder of Media Markt, who for years used his remaining stake in Media Markt to block Ceconomy management's plans.
Kellerhals died in 2017, prompting his heirs to attempt to resolve the dispute.
Sources close to the talks said the two sides were discussing the possibility of merging Ceconomy and the Media-Saturn holding group, in which Kellerhals' investment firm Convergenta holds a 21% stake.
Convergenta declined to comment.

A Ceconomy spokeswoman declined to comment beyond pointing to an earlier comment by Chief Executive Joern Werner, who said he was holding very constructive talks with the Kellerhals family and trying to put their past problems behind them.

TUROFED chairman Osman Ayik said the estimate was based on the number of tourists that had come to Turkey with Thomas Cook in recent years. He said those tourists may now decide against returning with other travel agencies.
The world's oldest travel firm collapsed on Monday, stranding more than half a million holidaymakers around the globe and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.
Ayik said there were currently 45,000 tourists in Turkey from the United Kingdom and other European countries who had traveled with Thomas Cook.
Dalaman Airport's website showed at least seven flights to several UK destinations scheduled to depart on Monday had been canceled.
Tourism is a major source of income for Turkey, helping to shore up its current account deficit, especially in the summer months. About 40 million tourists visited in 2018, bringing in a revenue of $29.5 billion, according to official data.
""There are a large number of small businesses whose fates depend on Thomas Cook, especially in Mugla, Dalaman and Fethiye,"" Ayik told Reuters, referring to popular destinations on Turkey's western coast.
He said Thomas Cook owed 100,000-200,000 pounds each to some small hotels, which could suffer as a result of the travel agency's collapse.
Turkey's Tourism Ministry said earlier that it was working with the Finance Ministry to extend a loan support package to businesses that were affected."

The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell to its lowest in five days on Monday after another bleak round of business surveys from the euro zone’s biggest economies suggested no end to the current slowdown. Germany's DAX led losses with a 1.5% drop, while the Italian FTSE MIB was down 1.2% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.7%.
According to IHS Markit’s purchasing manager surveys, the German economy contracted for the first time since 2012 in September, defying hopes of a turnaround while the French economy also slowed further.
“The economy is limping towards the final quarter of the year and, on its current trajectory, might not see any growth before the end of 2019,” said IHS’s principal economist Phil Smith.
Germany’s manufacturing sector, for so long the engine room of the region’s economy, contracted at its sharpest rate since the depths of the Great Recession in 2009. The service sector, which had initially held up well as manufacturing had cooled, also registered its first decline in new business since 2014, IHS said.
“The European Central Bank might see its course as vindicated and further loosenings (of monetary policy) – especially after Christine Lagarde takes over – are to be expected,” said analysts at Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in a research note.
However, it seems clear that any further measures will be resisted by a good part of the council. Dutch central bank governor Klaas Knot, who dissented from last week’s decision to restart quantitative easing, told De Telegraaf newspaper that he still felt the ECB’s actions were “disproportionate” and refused to rule out the risk of Dutch pension payouts being cut as a result of “quasi-permanent” low interest rates.
The negative tone was reinforced by a fresh surge in oil prices as Yemen’s Houthi rebels reportedly warned that Iran is planning another strike on Saudi Arabia before long. Higher oil prices are traditionally bad for the economy of Europe, which is a big net importer of oil and gas. Energy stocks still managed to fall, even so, after hopes for at least an interim trade deal between China and the U.S. faded at the weekend.
The stand-out gainers were airline stocks, which surged as U.K. travel group Thomas Cook went into liquidation. EasyJet rose 4.5% and Ryanair rose 1.8%, while rival travel groups Tui rose 5.9% and On the Beach rose 5.1%."

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 0.9% in premarket trade after a Delaware judge ruled that the electric carmaker's board of directors will have to stand trial and defend CEO Elon Musk’s multibillion dollar pay package. The company was sued in June 2018 by shareholders over allegations of corporate waste. 
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was down 0.7% after the success of HBO at the annual Emmys underscored the intensifying competition in the streaming sector. HBO's parent company AT&T (NYSE:T), which inched down 0.2%, plans to offer an expanded streaming service that will compete directly with Netflix and Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video. Other upcoming offerings from Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also likely to add to competition as viewers gain more streaming options.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",U.S. FAA head set to explain Boeing 737 MAX progress to divided world regulators,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - The chief of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is set to detail on Monday progress on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft to international air regulators who are divided about returning the grounded jet to flight after two fatal crashes. 
The closed-door briefing, on the eve of a United Nations aviation assembly in Montreal, will put representatives from about 50 nations in the same room, to swap concerns about Boeing Co's proposed software fixes and new pilot training. 
New FAA administrator Steve Dickson downplayed the chances of a consensus breakthrough, telling Reuters last week that the meeting was more ""to provide regulators with the latest information.""
The representatives are drawn from countries with airlines that fly that MAX and those that will have flights of the aircraft landing, he said.
Boeing's best-selling jet was grounded globally in March, days after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that followed a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. A total of 346 people died in the two crashes.
The U.S. manufacturer has spent months working to update critical flight control software at the center of both crashes, in hopes of winning FAA approval for the planes to fly again in the United States between October and December.
Airlines have urged regulators to coordinate on the software changes in a bid to avoid damaging splits over safety, but some countries have already vowed to run their own independent validation studies before restoring flights.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is doing its own examination of the 737 MAX design, said recently there was still no appropriate response to issues with the integrity of the aircraft's angle of attack system.
In both crashes, erroneous data to one of the angle of attack sensors led to the activation of an automated system that repeatedly pushed down the plane's nose.
Paul Njoroge, who lost his wife, three children and mother-in-law in the Ethiopian crash, and Chris Moore, who lost his daughter, plan to hold pictures of victims outside the meeting.
The FAA turned down their request to attend the briefing but Dickson agreed to meet the two men beforehand, said Nadia Milleron, whose daughter, Samya Stumo, also died in the Ethiopian crash. 
The FAA is still reviewing the software update and awaiting a document longer than 500 pages from Boeing detailing the flight control system's architecture and changes, Dickson said last week. 
The agency also wants input from international regulators EASA, Canada and Brazil before it conducts the certification test flight, a key step before final approval. 

The 737 MAX grounding is not on the agenda of the assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization, to run from Sept. 24 to Oct. 4, but regulators will be anxious to avoid divisions over actions needed to restore the jet to service.

In a ruling announced on Monday, the Federal Tribunal rejected Nigerian defendant Emeka Obi's appeal to prevent photocopies of items and computer files from his confiscated suitcase from being sent to Italian crimefighters.
The Swiss court said the case did not fall within the narrow scope of permissible appeals to the Lausanne-based tribunal.
Geneva prosecutors have been reviewing material in the suitcase to decide what can be shared with Italian authorities.
The Federal Tribunal had already rejected last year an appeal by Obi to prevent his suitcase from being unsealed.
In that ruling, the court said the confiscated material - including documents, an external hard drive, British and African passports, and USB keys - could have ""potential pertinence"" in the criminal investigation and the sealing could be lifted without violating Swiss law.
Obi, through his lawyers, has denied any wrongdoing.
""Our client has maintained his innocence in regards to the various allegations made by the Milan prosecutors and is confident that the final evaluation of the contents of his bag will confirm this,"" they had said last year.
An Italian judge said last year that Eni and Shell were aware their 2011 purchase of a Nigerian oilfield would result in corrupt payments to Nigerian politicians and officials.
Eni and Shell have denied any wrongdoing.
The two companies bought the OPL 245 offshore field for about $1.3 billion in a deal that spawned one of the industry's largest corruption scandals. It is alleged that about $1.1 billion of the total was siphoned to agents and middlemen.
The Milan judge made the comment in her written reasons for the September conviction of Obi and Italian Gianluca Di Nardo, both middlemen in the OPL 245 deal, for corruption. The pair were jailed for four years.
Obi and Di Nardo have been tried separately from Eni and Shell, which also face corruption allegations over the same deal in a hearing that is expected to drag on for months.
Obi brought the Swiss case to keep the contents of the suitcase - seized in Geneva in April 2016 in an inquiry unrelated to the corruption case - from being shared with foreign authorities.
Its confiscation led Geneva prosecutors to open a criminal case for suspected corruption of foreign officials and money-laundering. Days later Italian authorities requested judicial assistance, arguing that the suitcase and its contents had been deliberately stashed in Geneva."
1496,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2019 05:52AM ET</span>",Thomas Cook collapses: Why and what happens now?,"By Kate Holton and Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - Thomas Cook (L:TCG), the world's oldest travel firm, collapsed on Monday, stranding hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers around the globe and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.
What happens now and why did it collapse?
WHO IS AFFECTED?
The firm ran hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million travelers a year in 16 countries, generating revenue in 2018 of 9.6 billion pounds ($12 billion). It currently has 600,000 people abroad, including more than 150,000 British citizens.
Thomas Cook employs 21,000 people and is the world's oldest travel company, founded in 1841. The company has 1.7 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) of debt.
WHAT HAPPENS TO TOURISTS?
The British government has asked the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to launch a repatriation program over the next two weeks, from Monday to Oct. 6, to bring Thomas Cook customers back to the UK.
""Due to the significant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable, but the Civil Aviation Authority will endeavor to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates,"" it said.
A fleet of aircraft will be used to repatriate British citizens. In a small number of destinations, alternative commercial flights will be used.
About 50,000 tourists are stranded in Greece, mainly on islands, a Greek tourism ministry official told Reuters on Monday.
The CAA has launched a special website, thomascook.caa.co.uk, where affected customers can find details and information on repatriation flights.
For those customers not flying from Britain, alternative arrangements will have to be found. In Germany, a popular customer market for Thomas Cook, insurance companies will coordinate the response.
WHAT IS THE ADVICE TO PASSENGERS?
""Customers currently overseas should not travel to the airport until their flight back to the UK has been confirmed on the dedicated website,"" the CAA said.
""Thomas Cook customers in the UK yet to travel should not go to the airport as all flights leaving the UK have been canceled.""
WHO WILL PAY FOR THE COST OF HOTELS?
The CAA said it was contacting hotels and other companies likely to be impacted by Thomas Cook's collapse to reassure them they will be paid.
The regulator said that if holidaymakers are being asked to settle bills they should contact the CAA.
Thomas Cook package holiday customers are covered by ATOL – Air Travel Organizer's License – which protects accommodation and return flights. However, the CAA said some customers may be asked to relocate to other accommodation.
WHAT HAPPENS IF A HOLIDAY IS BOOKED FOR THE FUTURE?
The CAA says that if customers have not yet started their trips most holidays and flights booked with Thomas Cook are now canceled and customers should not go to the airport.
THE LIQUIDATION
Thomas Cook said it had entered compulsory liquidation and an order had been granted to appoint an official receiver to liquidate the company.
AlixPartners UK LLP or KPMG will be appointed as special manager for the different parts of the business.
THE INDUSTRY
The impact is already being felt further afield, with Australian travel group  Webjet  Ltd (AX:WEB) saying it was 27 million euros ($30 million) out of pocket and British online travel group On The Beach (L:OTB) saying it would suffer from helping its customers in resorts who had flown with Thomas Cook.
The collapse could provide a boost, however, to major rival TUI (DE:TUIGn), whose shares surged more than 10% in early Monday trading, and to Europe's overcrowded airline sector, which could benefit from the closure of Thomas Cook's airline.
WHY DID IT COLLAPSE?
Thomas Cook was brought low by a $2.1 billion debt pile that prevented it from responding to more nimble online competition. With debts built up around 10 years ago due to several ill-timed deals, it had to sell three million holidays a year just to cover its interest payments.
As it struggled to pitch itself to a new generation of tourists, the company was hit by the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, one of its top destinations, and the 2018 Europe-wide heatwave which deterred customers from going abroad.
Thomas Cook needed another 200 million pounds on top of a 900 million pound package it had already agreed, to see it through the winter months when it receives less cash and must pay hotels for summer services.
The request for an additional 200 million pounds torpedoed the rescue deal that had been months in the making.
Thomas Cook bosses met lenders and creditors in London on Sunday to try to thrash out a last-ditch deal to keep the company afloat. They failed.
Under the original terms of the plan, top shareholder Fosun - whose Chinese parent owns all-inclusive holiday firm Club Med - would have given 450 million pounds ($552 million) of money in return for at least 75% of the tour operator business and 25% of its airline.
Thomas Cook's lending banks and bondholders were to stump up a further 450 million pounds and convert their existing debt to equity, giving them in total about 75% of the airline and up to 25% of the tour operator business.

(Reuters) - Germany's main share index fell over 1% on Monday, leading European markets lower after business activity readings from across the euro zone suggested growth had ground to a halt. 
Surveys showed growth in services and manufacturing in the euro zone, Germany and France had all stalled in September, fanning concerns of a slide towards recession and suggesting further support for the economy is required. 
Euro zone stocks (STOXXE) slipped 1.1%, while Germany's DAX index (GDAXI) tumbled 1.4% as the latest survey of purchasing managers showed its manufacturing sector sinking deeper into recession. 
Banks were among the worst hit, with the eurozone banking index (SX7E) slumping 2.6%, including a more than 5% fall for Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). [GVD/EUR] 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell nearly 1%.
""A sense of caution is spreading across the board here and is putting pressure on European markets and this may well continue,"" said IG Markets analyst Chris Beauchamp 
Investors also remained worried by mixed signals from U.S.-China trade talks. 
Over the weekend, the U.S. Trade Representative's office issued a brief statement describing the two days of talks with China as ""productive."" Wall Street had fallen, however, on Friday after a Chinese agriculture delegation canceled a planned visit to U.S. farm states.
Market participants are still unconvinced that a trade deal between the two countries is likely anytime soon. 
""What we'd like to see is concrete progress and that is the thing we're lacking,"" Beauchamp said. 
Early market action showed investors again turning to defensive sectors such as utilities (SX6P) and food and beverage (SX3P), which were among the few gainers across the main European sub-sectors.
The travel and leisure sector (SXTP) gained 0.3% with a number of tour operators and airlines gaining from expectations their businesses will benefit from the collapse of British rival Thomas Cook (L:TCG).

Shares of TUI (L:TUIT) jumped 6.6%, the most on the STOXX 600, while EasyJet (L:EZJ) and Ryanair Holdings (I:RYA) were close behind.

The Board of Airline Representatives (BAR) of Hong Kong, which represents more than 70 airlines that fly to and from the Asian financial center, wrote to the government asking for temporary relief from landing and parking fees as well as rent and other operational costs, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
""Already we have seen a double-digit drop in passengers in August compared to last year and we expect this to worsen in the remaining months of the year,"" BAR Chairman Ronald Lam, a senior executive at Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293), said in the letter dated Sept. 16, which was first reported by the South China Morning Post on Monday.
""Many airlines have already reduced or cut their services to and from Hong Kong as many routes have become unprofitable due to declining passenger numbers,"" Lam said in the letter, addressed to the government's secretary for transport and housing.
Airport Authority Hong Kong and Hong Kong's Transport and Housing Bureau did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Cathay, the biggest corporate casualty of the sometimes violent protests, this month said it would cut capacity for the upcoming winter season after reporting a 11.3% fall in passenger numbers in August due to falling demand.
The airline said in a statement that it supported BAR's request for short-term relief measures to help airlines remain commercially viable.
Landing, parking and route expenses, which would include fees paid to airports outside Hong Kong and air traffic control charges, accounted for 16% of Cathay's operating costs in 2018, according to its financial accounts.
Foreign carriers like Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) have also been hit by a demand drop, with the Australian carrier switching to smaller planes on the Hong Kong route.

Representatives for Wahaha and Geely didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Hangzhou government said the initiative was aimed at smoothing work flow between officials and China’s high-tech companies and manufacturers. But the move could be perceived also as an effort to keep tabs on a non state-owned sector that’s gaining clout as a prime driver of the world’s No. 2 economy.

“They might be checking whether the Communist party units are working effectively within the companies,” said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management. “While China legitimized capitalism, the level of government influence was never intended to disappear. Occasionally private entrepreneurs forget about this and are reminded of it.”
Zhejiang is considered the cradle of modern Chinese private enterprise, home to a generation of self-made billionaires from Alibaba’s Jack Ma and Geely founder Li Shufu to Wahaha’s Zong Qinghou. The Communist Party accepted so-called “red capitalists” or private entrepreneurs into the Party in 2001, allowing them to become part of the country’s legislature a year later.
Still, the relationship between Beijing and well-known business people remains sensitive. The government has been seen to try and step up an official presence within non-state firms, by among other things mandating that private companies of scale set up and maintain a Party branch. It wasn’t clear whether the 100 Zhejiang-based companies included foreign enterprises.

He said several stakeholders, but not all, had already provided feedback on a draft of the final report that has not been released publicly.

The NTSB declined to comment on the WSJ report but said it planned to release recommendations on the FAA's certification program sometime in September.
The FAA welcomed the scrutiny from safety experts and looked forward to their findings, it said in a statement.

""We continue to work with other international aviation safety regulators and will carefully consider all recommendations,"" it added. ""The FAA will incorporate any changes that would improve our certification activities.""

(Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), the biggest investor in WeWork owner The We Company, is exploring ways to replace Adam Neumann as chief executive of the U.S. office-sharing start-up, four people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The rare showdown between SoftBank and one of its biggest investments comes after We Company postponed its initial public offering (IPO) last week, following pushback from perspective investors, not just over its widening losses, but also over Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.
This was a blow for SoftBank, which was hoping for We Company's IPO to bolster its profits as it seeks to woo investors for its second $108 billion Vision Fund. It invested in We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January, yet stock market investor skepticism led to the start-up considering a potential valuation in the IPO earlier this month of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.
What was the venture capital world's biggest upset is now morphing into one of corporate America's most high-profile boardroom dramas.
Some We Company board directors are deliberating how to replace Neumann as CEO, the sources said. The exact number of directors opposed to Neumann is not clear. Venture capital firm Benchmark Capital, another big investor in We Company, would also like Neumann to step aside, one of the sources said.
Benchmark, SoftBank and Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital each have one representative on We Company's seven-member board, that includes Neumann. Hony Capital's position on whether Neumann should remain CEO could not immediately be learned.
A formally unaffiliated We Company board director, retired  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) investment banker Mark Schwartz, previously sat on SoftBank's board.
No challenge to Neumann has yet been tabled, the sources said. A We Company board meeting will be held this week, and the issue of his leadership could be raised then, the sources added.
One option that SoftBank is considering is asking Neumann to become interim CEO while a headhunting firm is hired to find an external replacement, the first source said.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. We Company and SoftBank declined to comment, while Neumann, Schwartz, Benchmark Capital and Hony Capital could not be immediately reached for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on SoftBank exploring ways to replace Neumann as CEO.
As co-founder of the We Company, Neumann holds special voting shares that enable him to dismiss dissident board directors and shoot down any challenge to his authority. However, SoftBank could choose not to back We Company's IPO or provide it with more funding. It has already funded the cash-burning start-up to the tune of $10 billion, and was discussing committing another $1 billion to the IPO. 
We Company said last week it is aiming to become a publicly traded company by the end of the year.
In a sign of souring relations between SoftBank and WeWork, Neumann did not participate in a gathering of executives of companies backed by SoftBank that took place in Pasadena, California, last week and was organized by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Were a board challenge against Neumann to prove successful, it could follow the template of  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER).
Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing start-up in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture. Uber replaced Kalanick with an outsider, former  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc  CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and completed its IPO last May.
PUSHING THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ENVELOPE
It is not uncommon for founders of fast-growing start-ups to be eccentric and control their companies tightly, even as they seek to attract stock market investors. Neumann, however, was criticized by investors and corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.
These included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.
Neumann also entered into several transactions with We Company over the years, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.
Following criticism by potential investors, Neumann agreed to some concessions without relinquishing majority control. He agreed to give We Company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has entered in to with the New York-based start-up. 
No member of Neumann's family will be on the company’s board and any successor will be selected by the board, scrapping a plan for his wife and co-founder, Rebekah Neumann, to help pick the successor.

These changes did little to address concerns about We Company's business model, which rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent for them itself under long-term leases. This mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue raised questions among investors about how the company would weather an economic downturn.

Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson discussed with Trump the broader implications of the U.S.-China trade war rather than the impact on Adelson's business interests, one of the people familiar with the call said, according to the newspaper report.
Adelson, a major donor for Republican election campaigns, is the founder and chief executive officer of  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (N:LVS), a casino company that does business in the Chinese territory of Macao.
The White House did not have an immediate comment on the report. A representative of Las Vegas Sands Corp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S.-China trade tensions have led to tariffs on much of the commerce between the world's two biggest economies, hitting U.S. factories and farms.
While the U.S. economy has looked otherwise strong in recent months, a downturn might weigh on Trump's hopes of winning the November 2020 election.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2019 03:12PM ET</span>",Travel group Thomas Cook battles for survival ahead of Monday deadline,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - The British government has plans in place to bring home stranded holidaymakers if Thomas Cook (L:TCG) goes out of business, an event that would likely spark chaotic scenes at resorts and airports around the world.
The bosses of the world's oldest travel company were still meeting lenders and creditors in London on Sunday to try to thrash out a last-ditch deal to keep the company afloat.
The company's board will then meet in the early evening to decide the company's fate, with the business potentially going into administration in the early hours of Monday. 
Running hotels, resorts and airlines, Thomas Cook has 600,000 customers on holiday, meaning governments and insurance companies could be forced to step in and bring them home if the company goes out of business. 
Unions and the opposition Labour party have urged the government to stump up the cash, but the foreign secretary appeared to dismiss that idea on Sunday. 
""We don't systematically step in with the taxpayers' money when businesses are going under unless there's a good strategic national interest,"" Dominic Raab told the BBC, adding that plans were in place to prevent anyone from being stranded.
The company, founded in 1841, has been fighting for its survival after its lenders threatened to pull the plug on a rescue deal that has been months in the making. 
Hurt by high levels of debt, online competition and geopolitical uncertainty, Thomas Cook needs to find another 200 million pounds on top of a 900 million pound package it had already agreed, to see it through the winter months when it has less cash coming in and needs to pay hotels for summer services.
That has sparked fears among customers on social media that some hotels, yet to be reimbursed by Thomas Cook, could ask holidaymakers to leave if the company collapses.
Some British tourists were briefly detained in a hotel in Tunisia by staff who wanted to know if they had been paid. The Thomas cook customers have since left and flown home, according to their social media postings [L5N26D0FR]. 
At the meeting on Sunday the company was asking its lenders to restructure or lower their demands. It has also asked credit card companies to release 50 million pounds that they hold as collateral against the company's bookings. 
The company's largest shareholder, China's Fosun (HK:1992), was due to take a central role in the restructuring. 
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters there was still a possibility they could strike a deal. The person declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. 
FINAL HOURS
Were Thomas Cook to fail, it would spark the biggest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.
The government and the aviation regulator have drawn up a plan to step in and use other airlines to bring Britons home if needed. The person familiar with the situation put the cost of that move at around 600 million pounds. 
On top of the British holidaymakers, some 460,000 other customers are also abroad, with many coming from Germany or Scandinavia. 
An official from Germany said under that country's rules, it would fall to insurance companies to help get customers home. 
Condor, a German airline owned by Thomas Cook, said in a statement that its parent company was doing everything it could to secure fresh funds. ""Negotiations with all key stakeholders are complex and ongoing. The Condor flights are currently being operated on a regular basis.""
News of Thomas Cook's potential demise has sparked alarm not just across the holiday resorts and poolside bars where customers are using social media to obtain updates, but among suppliers and future customers who are losing faith.
That is draining the company of the liquidity it needs to keep operating and ramping up the pressure on one of Britain's oldest and much-loved companies.
According to figures from the UK-based aviation consultancy IBA Group, all but a handful of its 116 aircraft are leased rather than owned directly. So far there are no visible signs that leasing companies are demanding their planes back, preferring to sit out the refinancing talks.
""Hi Annie, I understand your father might be unsettled by all the news surrounding Thomas Cook and our business recently but our flight operations continue to operate as normal,"" the company said in response to one worried customer. 
British foreign minister Raab also sought to reassure holidaymakers that they would not end up stuck overseas.
""We ... hope that it (Thomas Cook) can continue but in any event, as you would expect, we've got the contingency planning in place to make sure that in any worst-case scenario we can support all those who might otherwise be stranded,"" he said. 
At the board meeting, the company will have to decide whether in the short term it has enough cash to pay its debts, and whether it has a reasonable prospect of paying its liabilities in six to 12 months' time, which is predicated on its securing a deal.
At the earlier meeting the lenders will have to decide whether they want to continue supporting a company that has 19 million customers a year, spread across 16 countries. 
While it once pioneered package holidays and mass tourism, in recent years it has struggled to pay the interest on its 1.7 billion pound debt, while navigating events such as a coup in Turkey, a heatwave in Europe, fluctuating oil prices and the aggressive summer pricing of low-cost airlines like Ryanair and easyJet (LON:EZJ).

Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported on Saturday in its online version that Huawei was joining forces with China Mobile (HK:0941) to potentially enter a dispute to buy Oi SA (SA:OIBR3).
""Huawei has no plan or interest in acquiring Oi or any other Brazilian carrier. In Brazil for more than 20 years, the company is working with all major Brazilian carriers supplying the best products and solutions to support digital transformation in Brazil,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
According to O Globo, the two Chinese companies expect the Brazil business to grow significantly once the country starts deploying its fifth-generation wireless technology (5G), and Oi's 360,000 km (224,000 miles) of fiber infrastructure is seen as an attractive asset.
China Mobile did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment, and Oi declined to comment.
Brazil's largest fixed-line carrier has been struggling to turn around its business since it filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2016 to restructure approximately 65 billion reais of debt.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that, while negotiating its mobile network with Spain's  Telefonica  SA (MC:TEF) and  Telecom Italia  SpA (MI:TLIT), Oi is also involved in preliminary talks with AT&T Inc (N:T) and another Chinese company."
1514,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2019 01:02PM ET</span>",Vivendi set to widen legal battle against Mediaset beyond Italy: sources,"MILAN (Reuters) -  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) is taking steps to widen its legal battle against  Mediaset  (MI:MS) beyond Italy, in a move that indicates the French media group has not liquidated its stake in the Italian broadcaster, two sources close to the matter said.
A deadline expired at midnight on Saturday for Vivendi to exercise the right to liquidate its stake in Mediaset in light of a corporate overhaul that will see the Italian broadcaster merge its domestic and Spanish businesses under a Dutch holding company.
Vivendi on Sunday declined to comment on whether or not it had exercised its withdrawal right as a shareholder.
However, the plan to broaden the legal front by filing suits against Mediaset also in Spain and the Netherlands indicates Vivendi has chosen not to sell the stake and instead opted for sticking with a court battle, the sources said. 
Mediaset and Vivendi have been locked in a legal battle since falling out over a failed pay-TV deal back in 2016.
After the aborted sale, the French conglomerate owned by billionaire Vincent Bollore built a 29% stake in Mediaset - a holding considered illegitimate by the group controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Despite Vivendi's opposition, Mediaset this month won shareholder approval to create a pan-European media group in a bid to pursue continental alliances with rivals and fend off growing competition from streaming services such as Netflix (O:NFLX) or Amazon Prime Video (O:AMZN).
Vivendi, which has plans of its owns to become a European media powerhouse, at the time vowed to challenge the overhaul in court. 
Shares in Mediaset on Friday closed at 2.761 euros each, slightly below the price of 2.77 euros at which Vivendi was entitled to sell its stake back to Mediaset had it decided to head for the door.
However, selling the stake would have translated into a loss of around 320 million euros for the French group.

Some sources have said in the past Bollore might prefer to stay on as an investor in the hope that court rulings in his favor could eventually allow him to increase his sway over Mediaset.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lending standards in the rapidly growing loan market are deteriorating and complex financial products that mask risks to banks have parallels with the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, the Bank for International Settlements warned on Sunday.
The number of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), a form of securitization which pools bank loans to companies, has ballooned in recent years as investors hunt for higher returns by buying into loans to lower-rated and riskier companies.
Like the collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that bundled U.S. sub-prime mortgages into complex products and were blamed for triggering the global financial crisis, CLOs also have complex structures that can mask underlying risks.
The BIS said there were important differences between CLOs and CDOs that made the former less risky, but it warned that the scramble by investors for higher yields was leading to worsening standards that could trigger bigger losses in the future.
""Weak underwriting standards can reduce the likelihood of defaults in the short run but increase the potential credit losses when a default eventually occurs,"" Sirio Aramonte and Fernando Avalos, researchers at the umbrella group for central banks said in a quarterly report.
The global outstanding CLO market is now estimated to stand at about $750 billion, while the CDO market in 2007 before the crisis came to $640 billion, the BIS said.
CLOs tend to be far less complex than CDOs and avoid the use of complicated credit derivatives but the loosening of credit standards and the lack of visibility about indirect ownership are common factors.
CLOs usually invest in loans to highly-indebted firms given a ""junk"" credit rating, or those that have high debt service costs relative to earnings.
Leveraged loans without maintenance covenants - which help protect investors in the loans - increased to 80% of all outstanding loans in 2018 from 20% in 2012 while the share of low-rated leveraged loans in CLOs has nearly doubled to 18%, BIS data showed.
That has been accompanied by a steady rise in debt-to-earnings ratio of borrowers.
The leveraged loan market has mushroomed in recent years to roughly $1.4 trillion outstanding, of which about $200 billion is denominated in euros and the rest in U.S. dollars.
That rapid expansion has been accompanied by a securitization of such loans into CLOs, with more than 50% of outstanding leveraged loans in U.S. dollars and about 60% of those in euros now securitized via these products.
U.S. and Japanese banks have been among the largest investors in CLOs.
The exposure of banks to these products is concentrated in the top-rated tranches, but ownership patterns among non-bank investors such as hedge funds and insurance companies are more difficult to trace.
Banks could therefore be indirectly exposed should defaults escalate, the BIS said.
""Like banks' off-balance sheet exposure to CDOs, which was a source of instability in 2007, banks' prime brokerage exposure to CLO holders could result in larger losses than implied by direct exposures, creating heightened financial stress,"" the BIS said.

Altico, backed by Clearwater Capital Partners and Abu Dhabi Investment Council, said it defaulted on the interest payment after a rating downgrade prompted several of its lenders to recall a substantial amount of debt causing it to face a liquidity squeeze.
""This lack of capacity led Altico to pause further debt repayments in order to maintain itself as a going concern and to protect the interests of all stakeholders,"" the company said in a statement on Sunday.
Altico said it needed time from stakeholders to craft a plan that might ""maximize asset value"" and called on all stakeholders to ""refrain from actions that exacerbate the liquidity problem.""

Non-banking financial companies and housing finance companies have been stung by liquidity crisis after the collapse of behemoth Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd late last year.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2019 09:17AM ET</span>",Big companies commit to slash emissions ahead of U.N. climate summit,"By Matthew Green
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Almost 90 big companies in sectors from food to cement to telecommunications are pledging to slash their greenhouse gas emissions in a new campaign to steer multi-nationals towards a low-carbon future, organizers said on Sunday.
We Mean Business, a coalition of advocacy groups, said dozens of companies had joined the initiative in the two months leading up to a United Nations summit taking place on Monday, which aims to spur faster action on climate change. 
“Now we need many more companies to join the movement, sending a clear signal that markets are shifting,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.
The coalition was launched in June with a call to action by the United Nations, business and civil society leaders. The first 28 companies to join announced the following month. We Mean Business said 87 companies are now involved, with total market capitalization of more than $2.3 trillion.
Some companies in the coalition have agreed to slash their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, including Swiss food company Nestle (S:NESN), French building materials company Saint-Gobain (PA:SGOB), and French cosmetics maker L'Oreal (PA:OREP).
Others have stopped short of committing to go carbon neutral but say they will align their operations with a goal of limiting the increase in average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement.
This group includes Finnish telecoms company Nokia (HE:NOKIA), French food group  Danone  (PA:DANO) and British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN), We Mean Business said.
As accelerating climate impacts from melting ice caps to sea-level rise and extreme weather outpace climate models, scientists say the world needs to halve its greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade to avoid catastrophic warming. 
With fossil fuel companies still developing new oil and gas fields and many developing countries expanding coal-fired power, the coalition's pledges are minuscule relative to rising global emissions. 
Some experts have questioned whether publicly traded companies committed to maximizing shareholder returns will be able to make the sweeping investments required to fight climate change. Yet many investors have been pressuring companies to act on climate risks, and chief executives also face pressure from an upsurge in youth-led activism, which mobilized millions around the world to protest on Friday.
We Mean Business believes pledges by a core of mostly European, and some North American and Asian companies, to commit to independently-verified emissions targets will prompt others to follow suit.
“These bold companies are leading the way towards a positive tipping point where 1.5°C-aligned corporate strategies are the new normal for businesses and their supply chains around the world,"" said Lise Kingo, chief executive of the U.N. Global Compact, which promotes responsible business practices.
U.N. chief Guterres sees the private sector as crucial to securing more ambitious pledges at Monday's Climate Action Summit in New York, which aims to boost the Paris deal before it enters a crucial implementation phase next year.

Companies such as Danish power group Orsted (CO:ORSTED), Spanish energy company  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) and German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) are due to speak alongside governments at the one-day gathering, according to a draft agenda.

A spokesman for Saban declined to comment.
Saban bought his 30% stake in Partner, Israel's second-largest mobile operator, from Scailex in 2013 mostly in the form of a $300 million loan from Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa (HK:0215).
The Globes newspaper said repayment is due in January 2020 and since there is no economic reason to repay the loan, Saban prefers to return the shares. Saban's holdings have slid in value to 753 million shekels ($214 million).
The Calcalist daily said Saban had lost $175 million on his investment in Partner and would return the shares by the end of the year. It noted that Saban had used his holdings in Partner, whose market value stands at 2.5 billion shekels, as collateral for the loan.
Hutchison founded Partner in the late 1990s and sold its stake to Scailex in 2009 before Scailex sold it to Saban.
Like its peers, Partner's (O:PTNR) revenue and profit have plunged in the wake of a 2012 reform that opened the mobile market to new players, sharply reducing prices. It is seeking new revenue streams and pushing to become an integrated multi-service telecoms group."

LONDON (Reuters) - Confident it can crack the $300 billion U.S. clothing and shoes market where many other foreign retailers have failed, Britain's Primark is ready to raise its bet on the country by securing new sources of fast fashion in central America.
Primark, whose trendy clothes at rock-bottom prices have taken UK shoppers by storm, opened in Boston in 2015 and now has nine stores in the northeast, all served by a warehouse in Pennsylvania that could still serve three times as many stores.
It has invested 250 million pounds ($313 million) in the United States, achieved a critical mass of sales and has a four-year education under its belt on a crowded market that is battling to stay afloat in the face of rapid e-commerce growth.
Now its owner, London-listed conglomerate Associated British Foods (L:ABF), is convinced Primark's disciplined store-by-store approach can succeed in a country that has been a graveyard for some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Marks & Spencer,  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) and most recently Philip Green's Topshop.
""I believe that the U.S. will be a winner for Primark,"" John Bason, AB Foods' finance director, told Reuters.
That confidence is underlined by a move to create a supply chain closer to the U.S. market.
Primark currently sources all its clothes for the United States from its traditional supplier countries of China, India, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam and Turkey - a costly exercise as stock is freighted across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal and up the U.S eastern seaboard.
The plan now is to tap suppliers from countries in central America, such as Guatemala, Costa Rica and Mexico.
""We're getting to that point now, with the sales level that we've got in the U.S. already,"" said Bason, a 20-year veteran of AB Foods.
""Certainly countries in central America I think would really start to come through.""
Founded by the late Arthur Ryan in Dublin in 1969, Primark trades from 373 stores in 12 countries, turning over 7.5 billion pounds and making 843 million pounds of profit in its 2017-18 financial year, a near fourfold increase in ten years - all achieved without venturing into online shopping.
Primark, Britain's biggest fashion retailer by number of items sold, has made its mark on price, selling T-shirts and swimsuits for as a little as five pounds - its customers often laden with its trademark brown paper bags. Those economics make an online offer untenable.
'VIRTUOUS CIRCLE'
Primark contributes more than half of the total profit of its parent, which also owns major sugar and grocery arms and has a stock market value of 18 billion pounds.
Some analysts believe Primark's combination of value, fashionability and breadth of range, means it could build a U.S. business over the next decade as big as its one in Europe.
That would threaten value fashion retailers like Old Navy, American Eagle and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) on their own turf, and pitch it against Sweden's H&M, which trades from 578 stores in the United States, and Spain's  Inditex  (MC:ITX), which has 102.
Primark's tenth U.S. store will open at American Dream, New Jersey, this autumn, followed by one in Florida in 2020, its first outside the northeast corridor. Contracts have also been exchanged on a store in Chicago.
Stores in highly populated cities on the eastern seaboard at locations with high footfall will follow.
Bason said a decision to downsize three Primark stores - Freehold Raceway in New Jersey, Danbury Fair in Connecticut and King of Prussia in Pennsylvania - was critical to fine tuning its U.S. model.
Sales levels were maintained from smaller footprints - sales densities went up, while operating costs went down, which meant profitability improved. Conversely the profitability of the Boston store was raised by increasing its size.
""If you talk about learnings, that really was the key, it's the big one,"" said Bason.
""You add more stores and each one a profitable store, then the overall profitability will increase ... now you are in a virtuous circle.""
AB Foods said this month that Primark was delivering strong sales growth in the United States and forecast a significantly reduced operating loss for 2018-19, which reflects the deliberate under utilisation of its warehouse.
""At some point ... you would then put a second warehouse somewhere else, strategically placed, and start to add stores from that location,"" said Bason, noting any move into California would necessitate a warehouse west of the Rocky Mountains.

""The thing that goes to the heart of Primark is learn about the individual market - it was always Arthur's mantra.""

XL Airways, which has said it needs 35 million euros ($38.6 million) in fresh financing, requested in a statement on Sunday a meeting with Air France and the French authorities in the coming hours before a court is expected to put it into receivership on Monday.
In an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche, also published on Sunday, XL Airways' Chief Executive Laurent Mignan said his airline could become Air France's low-cost offer on long-haul routes.
An Air France spokeswoman declined to comment.
Air France, France's historic national carrier, is part of the Air France-KLM group.
XL Airways operated four Airbus A330 aircraft and provided mainly long-haul flights to the Caribbean, the United States and France's Reunion island.
XL Airways' woes follow similar issues at French airline Aigle Azur. Aigle Azur's unfolding bankruptcy is the latest among smaller European airlines struggling to contend with higher fuel costs and stiff low-cost competition.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Thomas Cook (L:TCG) is in talks with the government and potential investors about a last-minute rescue deal to fend off a corporate collapse that would send shockwaves well beyond the travel sector. 
The world's oldest travel company was fighting for its survival over the weekend after lenders threatened to pull the plug on a rescue deal that has been months in the making. 
Hurt by high levels of debt, online competition and geopolitical uncertainty, Thomas Cook needs to find 200 million pounds ($250 million) on top of a 900 million pound package it had already agreed to see it through the winter months when it needs to pay hotels for their summer services. 
More than 20,000 jobs would be at risk if it collapses, while tens of thousands of travelers would be left stranded.
A person familiar with the situation said the company was in talks with the government and a number of potential investors about bridging the funding gap. It is holding a board meeting over the weekend to evaluate its position. 
""We have not given up,"" the person said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. 
The Transport Salaried Staffs Association, which represents Thomas Cook staff, appealed to the government to step in with ""real financial support"". 
Manuel Cortes, the group's general secretary, wrote to the government calling on it to ""act if required and save this iconic cornerstone of the British high street and the thousands of jobs that go with it.""
He wrote: ""Thomas Cook can be a highly successful business and must be given every opportunity to flourish. I urge you to stand ready to assist Thomas Cook with real financial support.
""The company must be rescued no matter what. No British government in its right mind would countenance the loss of so many jobs and the prospect of just one major travel operator – TUI – controlling the mass market.""
Rebecca Long-Bailey, the main opposition Labour Party's business policy adviser, said the situation was ""yet more evidence of this government's indifference to British jobs and businesses going under.""
""All viable options must be explored by Thomas Cook and the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis."" 
Were Thomas Cook to fail to find the funds it requires, it could be put into administration, a form of creditor protection that often precedes bankruptcy. 
That would spark the largest peacetime repatriation in British history with some 160,000 Britons currently enjoying Thomas Cook holidays in destinations including California, the Caribbean and Corfu. 
In total, some 600,000 holidaymakers from markets including Germany and Scandinavia could be stranded. The company's social media channels are full of customers asking if they will be able to get home. 
The British government and the airline regulator have already drawn up plans in case they need to step in to bring customers home. But the fallout from any collapse would go far beyond the interrupted holidays of its customers. 
Founded in 1841 with a local rail excursion in Britain, the company now runs hotels and resorts, airlines, cruises and hundreds of high street travel agent stores. With 21,000 staff, it operates in 16 countries and serves 19 million customers a year. 
Its demise could affect the economies of its big holiday markets in Spain, Greece and Turkey, its shareholders and lending banks, and the landlords of its many high street stores. 
Its largest shareholder is China's Fosun (HK:1992), which was due to take a central role in the rescue package. 
The Department for Transport and the company declined to comment on Saturday.

(Reuters) - U.S. trade regulators on Friday approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions filed by Apple Inc (O:AAPL) amid a broader reprieve on levies on computer parts, according to a public docket published by the U.S. Trade Representative and a Federal Register notice.
The move by U.S. officials could make it easier for both Apple and small makers of gaming computers to assemble devices in the United States by lowering the costs of importing parts.
Apple did not say why it requested the exemptions, but the requests were for components such as partially completed circuit boards. Apple manufactures its Mac Pro computers in Texas, making the machine immune from tariffs, but such intermediate parts were subject to the levies.
Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.
The Mac Pro computer starts at $6,000 and is intended for users such as music and motion picture studios. Due to its specialized design, the device has never sold in large numbers. But it became a political flashpoint earlier this year when The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was moving production to China.
Apple never publicly commented on its exact production plans, but U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods complicated the assembly of PCs in the United States. The third list of U.S. tariffs that went into effect last year placed levies on both some fully assembled PCs as well as the major components to make them, meaning manufacturers faced cost increases even if they made machines in the United States. 
The tariffs also hit the PC gaming industry, where enthusiasts often assemble their own custom machines from parts, many from China.
Apple applied for the exemptions for some components but President Donald Trump said U.S. regulators would not grant them. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook later said during the company's July 30 earnings call that Apple wanted to keep making Mac Pros in the United States.
""We want to continue to be here,"" he told analysts on the call, adding that Apple was investing in capacity to do so.

On Friday, trade officials lifted tariffs on a range of computer components for Apple and all other manufacturers, including partially assembled main circuit boards and graphics cards. Those are critical to computer assemblers because they contain chips from  Intel Corp  (O:INTC),  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD). Those chips are typically some of the most expensive parts in the machines.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two major Democratic presidential candidates plan to visit striking General Motors (N:GM) workers in Detroit in the coming days as a five-day-old labor dispute threatens to enter its second week.
Senator Elizabeth Warren will join workers on the picket line outside GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant on Sunday, while Senator Bernie Sanders will do the same on Wednesday. GM has received harsh criticism from Democrats for shifting health insurance costs for its striking workers union as its members walked the picket line for the second day on Tuesday.
The United Auto Workers union called on Friday for people of faith and others to join the picket lines on Sunday, a sign the strike will not end immediately.
The union told members Thursday that some progress has been made in lengthy talks to end the strike of about 48,000 GM workers, but that many issues remain unresolved.
The Detroit-Hamtramck plant is among the plants that GM announced in November it planned to shutter, but officials have said privately that GM has offered to build an electric vehicle pickup at the plant as part of its contract offer -- as well as to add battery operations at a shuttered pant in Ohio.
""Auto workers deserve good wages, comprehensive benefits, and economic security,"" Warren said this week. Sanders has urged GM to ""end the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve.""
Senator Amy Klobuchar, another Democratic presidential candidate, handed out donuts to GM workers on the picket line on Thursday at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant.
A growing number of workers at suppliers are being impacted by the stoppage, while about 500 workers at an Ohio joint venture plant that makes engines for pickups will be idled next week if the strike continues. A total of about 2,000 GM workers in Canada have been idled, GM said. Other suppliers have also laid off workers as a result of the work stoppage.

A GM spokesman said Friday talks were continuing but declined to elaborate. UAW vice president Terry Dittes told members in a letter released to media outlets Thursday that meetings will continue this weekend and beyond if a tentative agreement is not reached.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 07:56PM ET</span>",Delaware judge says Tesla board must face trial over Musk's mega-pay package,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) board of directors must defend at a trial Chief Executive Elon Musk's multibillion dollar pay package, which a shareholder lawsuit said unjustly enriched the head of the electric vehicle company.
Tesla estimated the 2018 compensation package was worth $2.6 billion when it received stockholder approval in March 2018, although stock analysts at the time said it could be worth up to $70 billion if the company - which has yet to post an annual profit - grew quickly.
The compensation award includes no salary or cash bonus for the Silicon Valley billionaire Musk, but sets rewards based on Tesla's market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the next decade.
On Friday, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled against Tesla's request to dismiss the lawsuit by shareholder Richard Tornetta at an initial phase in the litigation because of the way the board approved the package.
As a result, the board must now defend against allegations that it breached its fiduciary duty in approving the package, and that the package unfairly enriches Tesla's CEO. The ruling opens the way for additional discovery into the decision-making process.
Tornetta had asked that the pay package be rescinded and the board of Tesla be overhauled to better protect investors.
The ruling turned on Tesla's compensation committee, which the company conceded was not independent of Musk, according to Slight's opinion. Had the package been negotiated by truly independent directors and approved by a majority of shareholders who were unaffiliated with Musk, Slights said he would have dismissed the lawsuit. 
""Plaintiff has well pled, however, that the board level review was not divorced from Musk's influence,"" Slights wrote.
Musk's compensation package passed shareholder approval with about 73 percent of votes cast, excluding votes by Musk and his brother Kimbal. The vote result indicated some, but not all, big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company, which has struggled to produce its electric vehicles efficiently and profitably. 
At the time, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against the compensation, noting that if achieved Musk's award would surpass anything previously granted to top U.S. executives.
Under the award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla's market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder. The package does not require Tesla to hit profitability metrics. 
Musk does not hold a majority of the Tesla's stock, but in a separate case, Slights determined that Musk's sway over Tesla made him in effect a controller from a legal standpoint. As a controller, the board is subject to a higher standard of legal oversight for decisions it makes regarding its relationship with Musk.
The judge did dismiss Tornetta's claim that the package amounted to a waste of corporate assets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators boosted their net long bets on the U.S. dollar in the latest week to a five-week high, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $15.29 billion in the week ended Sept. 17. The net long dollar position had stood at $13.33 billion last week.
To be long a currency means traders believe it will rise in value, while being short points to a bearish bias. U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning  that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the greenback posted a net long position of $15.40 billion in the week ended Sept. 17, compared with $12.58 billion the previous week.
On Friday, the U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies and it posted its first weekly increase in three, helped by hopes that the Federal Reserve would not lower rates aggressively.
Against a favorable economic backdrop, the Fed lowered key lending rates by a quarter point on Wednesday, but signaled a higher bar to further reductions in borrowing costs.
Interest rates futures implied traders saw a 63% chance of another rate cut by year-end, compared with 69% late on Thursday, CME Group's FedWatch program showed.
While interest rate cuts typically weaken the U.S. dollar, because investors often swap dollars for foreign currencies to take advantage of better interest rates in other countries, the recent Fed rate cuts have done little to hurt the greenback.
The strength of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the world and low interest rates around the globe have led investors to favor the U.S. dollar.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) told staff on Friday it will stop selling e-cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery products at its U.S. stores, amid a growing crackdown on surging teenage use of such products, reports of vaping-related lung disease and some deaths. 
In an internal memo seen by Reuters, the retailer said growing federal, state and local regulatory complexity and uncertainty were behind its decision.
Walmart's move comes on the heels of bans on sales of flavored vaping products in New York and Michigan and after the Trump administration announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.
President Donald Trump and other top U.S. officials also expressed concern about the growing use of such products as health officials investigate the matter.
One possible culprit identified so far is a line of illicit marijuana vape products sold under the brand names ""Dank Vapes"" and ""Chronic Carts."" 
The New York State Department of Health identified ""Dank Vapes"" and ""Chronic Carts"" as products containing Vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent in THC oil that has been a focus in its investigation of the illnesses. 
Leading makers of nicotine e-cigarettes, including Juul Labs Inc,  British American Tobacco  Plc (L:BATS) and Imperial Brands Plc (L:IMB), said last week their products did not contain Vitamin E compounds.
Last week Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) said it took down vape paraphernalia in line with its policies, although the company did not specify the exact products it removed.  
In May, Walmart raised the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21 in all its stores and said it would stop selling fruit-flavored e-cigarettes. The move came after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration called out the company for illegally selling tobacco products to minors.
The regulator also called out other retailers like Kroger (N:KR), Family Dollar, which is owned by Dollar Tree (O:DLTR), 7-Eleven, Casey's General Stores and Sunoco (N:SUN), which were among more than half a dozen convenience store and gas station chains cited for illegally selling tobacco products to minors.
The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they plan to follow Walmart's decision and stop selling the products.
Walmart shares were little changed in late trading, while shares of  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) were up nearly 2%.

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 02:53PM ET</span>","California, other states take Trump to court over auto emissions rules","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 23 states on Friday sued to block the Trump administration from undoing California's authority to set strict car pollution rules, one of the biggest U.S. battles over climate change.
On the day that young people around the world staged protests demanding action on climate, the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington was the first round in a legal battle that many expect will outlast Trump's presidency.
""Mr. President, we’ll see you in court,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.
The legal fight pits a Democratic majority state that has become the U.S. environmental champion against a Republican president who wants to boost the economy by cutting regulation. The debate already is playing out ahead of the presidential election next year.
""Trump's latest move is bad for our air. Bad for our health. Bad for our economy,"" said California Governor Gavin Newsom.
For decades, California has played a national role in influencing what Americans drive. The state's vehicle emissions rules, more stringent than the Trump EPA's rules, are followed by a dozen other states that account for more than 40% of U.S. vehicle sales.
Trump has said looser tailpipe emissions rules would make vehicles cheaper. Environmentalists argue Trump's rules will hasten climate change, and that emissions rules improve fuel economy, lowering consumer costs.
Friday's lawsuit takes aim at a determination unveiled Thursday by the U.S. Transportation Department and its agency the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency concluded that federal law preempts state and local regulation of vehicle fuel economy, including California's rules.
The states, led by California and joined by the District of Columbia, Los Angeles and New York City, sued the Transportation Department seeking a court order blocking the determination.
The states suing include New York, Michigan, Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Washington State and Massachusetts.
The Transportation Department declined to comment. 
The legal challenge does not address a parallel decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to revoke a 2013 waiver California received under the Clean Air Act to set emissions standards. That does not take effect until late November. 
Becerra said the Transportation Department's determination was unlawful, and that the administration misread federal law and ignored the intent of Congress. 
""The administration insists on attacking the authority of California and other states to tackle air pollution and protect public health,"" Becerra said.
The Trump administration has been waging a multi-pronged battle to counter the state's efforts to fight climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses from vehicles. 
In August, the Justice Department launched an antitrust probe of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267) that struck a voluntary agreement with California to vehicle reduce emissions. 
The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration's preferred option to freeze requirements.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said Thursday the administration will finalize revisions in the coming weeks. ""No state has the authority to opt out of the nation's rules and no state has the right to impose its policies on everybody else in our whole country,"" she said.

The administration contends that its proposed rule would have a minimal effect on climate, boosting global temperatures by just 3/1000th of a degree Celsius by 2100.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's second-highest court will rule on Sept. 24 whether  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) has to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) in Dutch back taxes and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) a similar amount to Luxembourg.
Both cases are part of European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's crackdown on unlawful tax breaks offered by EU countries to multinationals that have drawn criticism for using the bloc's state aid rules to assess tax strategies commonly used by many companies.
The judgments from the Luxembourg-based General Court could determine the scope of Vestager's drive in the coming years and whether she will open more cases. Many of the countries have already tweaked their tax systems since then.
Vestager suffered a setback in February when the same court dismissed her decision against a Belgian tax scheme for  BP  (LON:BP), BASF and more than 30 other multinationals. Vestager did not give up and opened separate investigations of the companies this week.
The European Commission is investigating Ikea AB [IKEA.UL] and  Nike  Inc's (N:NKE) Dutch deals and  Huhtamaki  Oyi's (HE:HUH1V) Luxembourg tax ruling.
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland are among countries where much of their economies have been built on attracting multinationals. Ireland is fighting against an order to claw back a record 13 billion euros in back taxes from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Vestager in her 2015 decisions said U.S. coffee chain Starbucks had benefited from an illegal tax deal with the Dutch and the Italian-U.S. carmaker Fiat Chrysler with Luxembourg.
She said Fiat's Luxembourg unit paid ""not even"" 0.4 million euros in corporate tax in 2014 and Starbucks' Dutch subsidiary less than 0.6 million euros.
The Commission said the companies set prices for goods and services sold between subsidiaries, known as transfer prices, that were below market rates and which artificially lowered their taxes.
Starbucks criticized errors in the European Commission's assessment while Fiat denied receiving state aid. Companies can appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union on points of law.
The cases are T-755/15 Luxembourg v Commission & T-759/15 Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe v Commission.

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 02:15PM ET</span>","U.S. sanctions Iran's central bank, fund after Saudi oil attack","By Steve Holland and Susan Heavey
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed another round of sanctions on Tehran, including on Iran's central bank and a development fund, following last week's attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia that Riyadh and U.S. officials have blamed on Iran.
President Donald Trump outlined the action to reporters at the White House on Friday after first announcing his plan for further sanctions earlier this week on Twitter. 
Iran denies involvement in the attacks, which initially halved oil output from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest petroleum exporter. Responsibility was claimed by Yemen's Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen's civil war. 
Analysts cast doubt on how hard the new measures would hit Tehran given that earlier sanctions have already dried up Iranian oil revenues and cut Iranian banks' ties to the financial world.
And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called on the Pentagon to present Trump with a wide range of options that would punish Iran and warned that the United States has ""lost deterrence"" with Tehran. 
The fresh sanctions target the Central Bank of Iran, the National Development Fund of Iran and Etemad Tejarate Pars Co, an Iranian company that U.S. officials said is used to conceal financial transfers for Iranian military purchases, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.
""These are the highest sanctions ever imposed on a country,"" Trump said. ""It's too bad what's happening with Iran. It's going to hell, doing poorly, practically broke, they are broke,"" he said. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Washington had now cut off ""all source of funds to Iran.""
Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year and ramped up sanctions to strangle oil exports, a mainstay of the economy. The move dismantled part of former President Barack Obama's legacy and upset U.S. allies who were party to the agreement, which was designed to restrict Tehran's pathway to a nuclear bomb in exchange for sanctions relief.
Amir Paivar, a London-based market analyst, said that while targeting a central bank seems important the latest move was mostly cosmetic.
""Iran’s oil export proceeds are usually deposited in Central Bank accounts around the world, therefore the bank has central importance,” Amir Paivar, a London-based market analyst said. 
""But with Iran’s oil exports at a minimum, and with global banks not working with Iranian counterparts, designating the Central Bank again is little more than cosmetic.""
Trump's wide range of sanctions are part of a U.S. campaign to increase economic pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program and regional ambitions and was championed by former national security adviser John Bolton, who was ousted this month.
Previous U.S. sanctions have also targeted Iran's foreign minister, its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, space agencies, and various networks Washington has said helped boost Iran's nuclear program, among others.
""Regardless of transparent attempts to shift blame, the evidence points to Iran—and only Iran,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement following the announcement. 
LIMITED IMPACT
Trump, who spoke to reporters at the White House alongside visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, has said he wants a peaceful solution following the weekend oil attacks. Pompeo had called the attacks an ""act of war.""
Asked about the possibility of a military response on Iran, Trump said the United States was always prepared and that a military strike was always a possibility. He is expected to meet with his national security team on Friday.
""This was an understandable action to take but is unlikely to have much impact,"" Samantha Sultoon, visiting senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""Most transactions were already prohibited because the Iranian central bank was already designated under the other sanctions authorities,” she said.
""Redesignating the Central Bank under counterterrorism authorities will have limited, though perhaps some, impact,"" she added.
Senator Graham, who is close to Trump, wrote on Twitter he hoped ""that Pentagon planners are giving President Trump a wide range of options that would punish Iran and restore deterrence. 
There are steps between being weak and total war.""

In recent weeks, Trump had weighed the possibility of easing sanctions on Iran as he sought to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is scheduled to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week.

1536,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 02:04PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Roku Shares Clobbered as Analyst Says Sell,"Investing.com -  Roku  shares were hit hard Friday after a Wall Street analyst rated the stock a sell and slapped it with a $60 price target.
The stock sunk about 20% in afternoon trading.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), which lets users stream content via a set-top box, has been slumping since peaking at $176.55 on Sept. 9. Shares are off 25% this week alone.
It faces competition from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with Apple +, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) and others. A big blow came Wednesday when Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) said it would give its Internet subscribers a free set-top box for its Infiniti Flex streaming service.
Friday, Pivotal Research came out with its sell rating and $60 target price, arguing the competition is going to overwhelm Roku. Analyst Jeff Wlodarczak said the stock is overvalued at current levels. His note to clients was titled “Is Roku Broku?,”
Roku was founded in 2002 and became a Wall Street darling when it went public at $14 in September 2017. It has three huge problems.
The stock shot up too far and too fast. The shares were up 476% for this year when they peaked at $176.55 on Sept. 9.
It's showing losses. Operating cash flow, however, is positive, at least through the second quarter.
It's relatively small.  While revenue is trending north of $1 billion a year, that's a small number compared with the money Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Disney and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) can pour into the streaming space.
In theory, Roku has fans. The consensus target on the stock is $123.20, and 10 of 17 analysts rate the stock a buy. One of the fans, Oppenheimer's Jason Hefstein, boosted his price target to $155 on Friday.
Some 61% of shares are held by big institutions, including Fidelity, Vanguard and   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS). But the problem with big institutions is they can sell quickly."
1537,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 01:56PM ET</span>",Factbox: California's gig worker law could sting 'last mile' delivery,"By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - A new California law designed to limit the use of ""gig"" workers threatens to drive up labor costs for companies that rely on inexpensive freelance drivers to make fast deliveries of everything from restaurant meals to household goods.
California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill, known as AB5, on Wednesday. It goes into effect on Jan. 1 and could roil the gig economy if companies are forced to replace independent contractors with employees who earn at least the state minimum wage of $12 per hour and are eligible for expense reimbursement and benefits such as health insurance and paid time off.
Here are some facts about the issues involved:
Research firm Second Measure says Postmates, DoorDash and UberEats reap the greatest percentage of U.S. sales from California - estimated at 41.3%, 24.3% and 23.9%, respectively.
Second Measure, which analyzes anonymized credit and debit card spending, does not track Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) gig delivery service called Flex. Flex workers deliver millions of parcels and handle same-day deliveries for Whole Foods and Amazon's Prime Now service.
Gig delivery companies have been crucial to tackling one of the biggest challenges facing traditional and online food and product sellers: expensive ""last mile"" deliveries to customer doorsteps.
And, critics say, the law could affect a swath of industries employing about 450,000 independent contractors and saddle employers with labor cost increases of 30% or more. Employers are tracking the legislation closely since California has a track record of setting policies that are adopted in other states.
 Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) has already said it does not believe the law requires it to change its practices, a position that could be tested in court.
Gig delivery companies say their workers make anywhere from $15 to $27 per hour.
UberEats, Postmates, DoorDash, Amazon Flex, GrubHub, Instacart and  Target  Corp's (N:TGT) Shipt delivery drivers in California put their pay at $8 to $19 per hour, according to a Reuters analysis of nearly 700 entries on recruitment site Glassdoor, which invites workers to report their pay.
HOW 'GIG' JOBS PAY
Drivers who work for gig delivery companies choose ""jobs"" from company-supplied mobile apps. Pay is based on a variety of factors including travel distance, time and customer tips. Drivers are not reimbursed for the use of their cars, gasoline or other expenses.
DoorDash and Amazon shed some light on how delivery pay is calculated.
The current ""guaranteed minimum"" pay formula at DoorDash, which delivers for companies such as McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) to Walmart Inc (N:WMT), takes into account the size of the order or package, expected wait times and mileage.
Some or all of a tip may go toward meeting the minimum. For example: A guaranteed minimum of $10 would include base pay of $1, a $3 customer tip and $6 in additional pay from DoorDash. DoorDash's new model, expected to roll out at the end of September, will have a guaranteed minimum of $2 to $10 based on distance and time, plus any promotions. Drivers will receive 100% of customer tips on top of the guaranteed minimum. Amazon's Flex service offers drivers hourly ""blocks"" at a set rate of pay, allowing the company to pay independent contractors what amounts to a set hourly wage. Amazon says it pays at least $15 to $19 per hour for that work. For example, a three-hour block that pays $15 per hour would be offered at $45. Package delivery drivers, who supplement the work done by Amazon's delivery van partners, do not receive tips. Flex drivers who take groceries and other items to Whole Foods and Prime Now customers can receive tips on top of what Amazon pays.
COMPANY RESPONSES
Uber, which reaps most of its revenue from drivers who ferry passengers from place to place, said its independent drivers are already properly classified because their ""work is outside the usual course of Uber's business, which is serving as a technology platform for several different types of digital marketplaces.""
Uber,  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) and DoorDash have earmarked a combined $90 million to spend on a ballot initiative aimed at protecting themselves from AB5."

In a letter to Ned Sharpless, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Senators Dick Durbin, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Merkley and Richard Blumenthal cited recent reports of 530 cases of vaping-related lung disease, as well as eight deaths, in asking for the ban.
The letter said cartridge or pod-based systems account for more than 70% of the overall e-cigarette market, and are favored by youth. 
""Unfortunately, many cartridge-based systems are easily able to be opened and modified, exposing adolescents to the additional dangers associated with refillable, and modifiable, e-liquids,"" the letter said.
Separately, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi urged the FDA not to make an exemption for mint and menthol flavors in their pending guidelines that are expected to ban e-cigarette flavors.
""I say very strongly we are hearing that the vaping industry, the e-cigarette industry, is lobbying heavily for an exemption for mint- and menthol-flavored,"" Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat, said in a conference call with journalists.
""Any such exception or exemption would be a tremendous mistake ... we respectfully request the FDA to resist,"" he said.
Krishnamoorthi chairs the House of Representatives Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. He and Durbin this week formed a bipartisan caucus to combat the ""epidemic"" of youth vaping, along with Republican Representative Peter King and others. 
The lawmakers have cited health experts who say flavors like mint from popular e-cigarette companies like Juul Labs
Inc have caused the surge in youth vaping. 

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last week that with President Donald Trump's blessing, his department would move to ban all e-cigarette flavors other than tobacco in an effort to curb the use of e-cigarettes by youth.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) still aims to launch its Libra digital currency next year, its executive overseeing the project told Swiss newspaper NZZ, as the company presses ahead despite authorities around the world pouring cold water on the plans.
Since the U.S. tech company unveiled its plans in June, its proposed cryptocurrency has met with regulatory and political scepticism, with France and Germany pledging to block Libra from operating in Europe.
""The goal is still to launch Libra next year,"" Facebook's David Marcus told NZZ in an interview published on Friday. ""Until then, we'll need to address all questions adequately, create a suitable regulatory environment.""
The social media giant's project, announced as it expands into e-commerce, is a high-profile attempt to drag cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.
Libra will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and overseen by a 28-member organization.
The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.
Marcus said it was unlikely Libra coins would become a means of payment for regular real-world transactions in countries like Switzerland, Germany or France, but would rather be used for cross-border payments or for settling very small sums.
""It's unlikely in any case the people will pay for an espresso in Switzerland, Germany or France with Libra in the future,"" he said. Initially, he added, he expected user acceptance to be a bigger problem than regulatory issues.
Authorities' concerns have centered on the project's potential to destabilize the global financial system, interfere with sovereign monetary policy and harm privacy as well as its potential for use in money laundering.
Marcus said he did not believe the project would interfere with monetary policy, since it would not be creating any new money and would not influence interest rates or yields.
Facebook's Calibra digital wallet, which will allow consumers and vendors to hold and transact the digital currency, would be made available everywhere that it is able to meet regulatory requirements, Marcus said.
Facebook would not be able to access data from its newly created subsidiary Calibra, he added."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said on Friday it wanted to shed thousands of staff and close a fifth of its branches in a strategy overhaul, after the German lender's attempt to merge with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) failed.
The bank, partly owned by the German government after a bailout and struggling to generate profits, also aims to sell a stake in its Polish subsidiary mBank and absorb its Comdirect online brokerage unit.
Commerzbank said the strategy plan would involve investment of 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion), with 750 million euros going into new technology and the rest earmarked for restructuring.
The bank said the draft measures would be discussed at a meeting of the supervisory board on Sept. 25 and 26. It said no final decision had yet been taken.
Shares in Commerzbank, which has been reviewing strategy in recent weeks, were 0.8% higher in late afternoon trade, with some investors saying the measures were not enough.
Klaus Nieding, vice president of shareholder lobby group DSW, said the bank needed to do more than cut costs. ""The big question remains how the bank wants to make money in the future,"" he said.
The bank was ejected from the blue-chip DAX index last year, highlighting the challenge facing banks in Europe's biggest economy since the global financial crisis. 
The bank said it would cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in ""strategic areas"", so the group headcount would fall in total by about 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce. It now employs about 40,700 people.
The sale of mBank would reduce its staff by a further 6,600.
It also aims to trim the number of branches by 200 to about 800.
The sale of its 69.3% stake in mBank has a market value of more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion). Commerzbank said the proceeds would enable ""a faster implementation of its strategy and the associated investments"". 
The bank, which owns 82% of Comdirect, foresees offering a 25% premium for shares it doesn't hold. Comdirect shares jumped 26%.

Germany's banks have been battling a legacy of bad debts, bloated headcounts and fines a decade after the global financial crash. Commerzbank has already been reducing staff and is trying to cut back-office work to restore profitability.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Taiwan is pitching India as a potential business destination to its tech, auto, renewable energy and farm sector firms as the United States' trade war with China has pushed its companies to look for newer markets, two officials said on Friday.
More than 10,000 Taiwanese companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers Foxconn (TW:2317) and Wistron (TW:3231) have massive operations in China, thanks to its tax incentives, organized supply chain and logistics, efficient business parks as well its cultural ties to the island.
But a trade war between Washington and Beijing has led to higher tariffs on goods worth tens of billions of dollars and disrupted global supply chains, prompting companies to look at other countries to escape higher tariffs.
""This trade war has encouraged more Taiwanese companies to figure out other options. So India and also other ASEAN countries are the alternative markets,"" Shih-Chung Liu, vice chairman of Taiwan External Trade Development Council, told reporters.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional block comprising ten nations in Southeast Asia, which promotes economic, political and military ties between members.
Beijing maintains that Taiwan, an island 110 miles (177 km) off the Chinese mainland, does not qualify for formal diplomatic ties with any country. And though India has no formal relation with Taiwan, Taipei runs an Economic and Cultural Center in capital New Delhi, which operates as a de facto embassy.
Taiwanese firms are looking to invest in India's technology, renewable energy, electric vehicle and farm sectors, Liu said.
""India is among the most important markets, among those 18 new southbound policy countries."".
Taiwan's southbound policy focuses on strengthening ties in the areas of culture, tourism, education and trade with 18 southeast and south Asian countries.
It has opened four trade offices in India in the last few years and bilateral trade with Asia's third-biggest economy stood at $7 billion in 2018.
Trade between India and Taiwan will likely touch $10 billion over the next few years, said Chung-Kwang Tien, the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center.
Helping that trade are about 120 Taiwanese information and communications technology firms, which are setting up operations in India's southern technology hub Bengaluru, Tien said.
""These companies have already put in $100 million,"" he added."

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said there was still “a wide gap” between the U.K. and EU reaching any type of Brexit deal. 
The pound stumbled 0.4% to 1.2476 as of 10:27 AM ET (14:27 GMT), while EUR/USD slipped 0.3% to 1.1009. Sterling had neared its longest run of weekly increases since January on earlier reports from Sky News that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker thinks a deal can be reached by the Oct. 31 deadline.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose after Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida told CNBC that all voting members of the central bank believe the U.S. economy is in a good place. He also noted the issues in the repo market were not a reason for concern, as it was due to larger-than-expected quarterly tax payments and Treasury bond sales.

LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese companies and investors would be forced to reassess their four-decade bet on the United Kingdom if there is a disorderly exit from the European Union that shattered supply chains and cut off access to the bloc, Japan's ambassador said.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, made the United Kingdom its favored European destination for investment. The likes of Nissan (T:7201), Toyota (T:7203) and Honda (T:7267) were encouraged by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to use the country as a launchpad into Europe.
Brexit, though, worries Japanese investors. Many have expressed concern in private that a disorderly exit could turn upside down the entire business case for investing in British manufacturing.
Japan is one of the biggest sources of foreign direct investment in Britain, which its companies have long seen as a pro-business, liberal gateway into the rest of the EU.
""If those conditions drastically change and make it impossible for companies to adapt, they will have to consider very carefully how they will go about continuing business here in the UK,"" Japan's ambassador to London, Koji Tsuruoka, told Reuters.
""They like it here and they are happy being here,"" Tsuruoka said. ""The only hope that they are now wishing is that they will be allowed to continue to do good business here in the UK.""
Japanese companies have invested over 81 billion pounds ($101 billion) in Britain, making its FDI the fifth-largest after the United States, Germany, France and the Netherlands, according to UK statistics.
More than three years of political squabbling over Brexit have left allies and investors puzzled by a country that for decades seemed a confident pillar of Western economic and political stability.
It is still unclear on what terms the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. Options range from a last-minute exit deal or delay to an acrimonious split that would knot up the networks of trade.
""NOT TOO MANY ANSWERS""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he wants to strike a deal at an Oct. 17-18 EU summit, but if the EU turns down British demands he will lead the United Kingdom out without a deal on Oct. 31.
Without a deal, Britain would quit the EU's 500 million-strong single market and customs union overnight, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean many import and export tariffs. There would be no transition.
Tsuruoka said he was hoping for an orderly exit. Nearly 1,000 Japanese companies based in Britain employ more than 150,000 people.
""The UK has provided Japanese companies and investors with very important business opportunities, which they have profited from now for three or four decades,"" Tsuruoka said.
""The question really is whether this will drastically changed or will there be a continuity of the sound business environments they have enjoyed,"" he said. ""There are not too many answers that are available today and therefore they are watching very carefully.""
Car makers, the country's biggest exporter of goods, has been one of the most vocal opponents of a no-deal Brexit, warning that production would be hit with tariffs, border delays and new bureaucracy, ruining the viability of many plants.
Of the just over 1.5 million cars produced in Britain last year, Japanese auto makers Nissan, Toyota and Honda built about half.
""The Japanese companies that are investing are global operators and they are watching it very carefully,"" Tsuruoka said. ""If none of the predictability is there, then you cannot plan, so you will have to stop and then consider when things are clear.""
British trade minister Liz Truss is currently on a visit to Tokyo and has called for a new post-Brexit trade agreement with Japan as soon as possible.
""I am in Tokyo today to deliver one very clear message: the UK is ready to trade,"" Truss said. ""The UK is an open, welcoming country and we are the perfect place to do business."""

When finalized, the rule would also help to ensure that e-cigarette applications by manufacturers contain information on the product's potential public health benefits and harms, the FDA said.
The agency's proposal follows a rise in popularity of the e-cigarettes among the youth and a widening outbreak of severe lung-related illnesses tied to vaping that has affected possibly 530 people.
A U.S. District Court judge in Maryland in July issued an order that would require makers of tobacco products, including e-cigarette makers, to file the applications by May 12, 2020.
Juul Labs Inc, the market leader in the U.S. e-cigarette market, was warned by the FDA over marketing its vapes as safer than traditional cigarettes. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the marketing practices of e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc.
The proposed rule also establishes procedures which the FDA would follow when reviewing the premarket tobacco product applications."
1552,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 10:26AM ET</span>",Latvia criticized for choosing banker to police banks,"By Gederts Gelzis
RIGA (Reuters) - Latvia's appointment of a banker to supervise the sector
is threatening a conflict of interest, Transparency International said on Friday, following a series of financial scandals in the Baltic state.
Government officials this week announced that they had chosen Santa Purgaile, a board member with Citadele Bank , Latvia's fourth-largest lender, to lead the country's financial supervisor.
The decision came more than a year after the United States acted to shut down ABLV, a Latvian bank it said was linked to North Korea's nuclear weapons program, money laundering and Russian corruption.
Latvia has since sought to reform by changing officials in key roles, with Purgaile's appointment being among the most important.
But Transparency International, a global anti-corruption organization, said her career in banking could hamper her in the position.
""Her long background in the banking sector poses a risk that her priority could be the interests of the banks and not the interests of the general public,"" Liene Gatere of Transparency International told Reuters.
""There shouldn't be any doubt about her independence,"" said Gatere.
Purgaile has said she will be careful to avoid any such conflict earlier this week when her appointment was announced.
""I can assure you here that I will refrain from making any decisions that relate to my former employer,"" she told journalists.
Her appointment must now be approved by parliament, although Latvia is ruled by a wide political coalition and lawmakers are unlikely to object.
After Latvia secured independence in 1991 from the then-Soviet Union, more than a dozen of its banks promoted themselves as a gateway to Western markets for clients in former Soviet states, promising Swiss-style secrecy.
That policy has now been abandoned under U.S. pressure but despite forecasts by Latvian officials more than a year ago after the shuttering of ABLV that many other banks would also close, they are still open.
Latvia faces a review by international money-laundering standards watchdog Moneyval in the coming months, which some officials fear could label the country as risky, alongside the likes of Pakistan.
Latvia's central bank governor is also accused by prosecutors of corruption, including alleged bribery linked to ABLV, after being detained briefly more than a year ago.
He has returned to his job, denies the allegations and will go on trial on November 4."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Thomas Cook (L:TCG) needs to find an extra 200 million pounds ($251 million) to satisfy its lenders or one of the world's oldest holiday company risks collapse, potentially stranding thousands of holidaymakers across Europe.
Demand for an extra funding facility puts that deal at risk, as well as the jobs of Thomas Cook's 21,000 employees and the holidays of 600,000 customers, mostly from Germany, Britain and Scandinavia.
Thomas Cook said the recapitalization posed ""a significant risk of no recovery"" for the diluted shareholders. Shares in the company hit a record low of 3.22 pence following its statement. The stock was down 15% at 0733 GMT.
Lenders are demanding another 200 million pounds in underwritten funds to support Thomas Cook in its winter trading period, when its cash is usually at a low ebb.
""Discussions to agree final terms on the recapitalization and reorganization of the company are continuing between the company and a range of stakeholders,"" Thomas Cook said.
""These discussions include a recent request for a seasonal standby facility of 200 million pounds, on top of the previously announced 900 million pounds injection of new capital.""
Thomas Cook has struggled with competition in popular destinations, high debt levels and an unusually hot summer in 2018 which reduced last-minute bookings. The firm has 1.7 billion pounds of debt.
A source close to the discussions said on Thursday that Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) (L:RBS) had hit Thomas Cook with a last minute demand for the extra funding, adding that the situation ""was becoming more critical"".
A spokesman for RBS said the bank did not ""recognize this characterization of events"" and was working with all parties to ""try and find a resolution to the funding and liquidity shortfall at Thomas Cook"".
Under original terms of the plan, Fosun - whose Chinese parent owns all-inclusive holiday firm Club Med - would contribute 450 million pounds ($552 million) of new money in return for at least 75% of the tour operator business and 25% of the group's airline.
Thomas Cook's lending banks and bondholders were to stump up a further 450 million pounds and convert their existing debt to equity, giving them in total about 75% of the airline and up to 25% in the tour operator business, the group said.

GET A GRIP
If that deal is not finalised before a creditor vote on Sept. 27, then holidaymakers could be facing the second major collapse of a tour operator in as many years, after the failure of Monarch in 2017.
When Monarch collapsed, the British government repatriated all customers abroad, both those with package holiday protection from Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) and flight-only passengers who were not protected. 
If Britain does the same for Thomas Cook's customers, then the 160,000 Britons abroad that would need repatriation would eclipse the number brought home after Monarch's collapse.
A spokesman for the Department for Transport declined to say if there were plans for a similar repatriation effort. Asked about Thomas Cook, he said: ""We do not speculate on the financial situation of individual businesses.""
British pilot union BALPA, whose members have previously gone on strike in a disagreement over pay with Thomas Cook's management, have supported the restructuring and urged the banks and government to support the travel group.
""The government sat on the sidelines wringing its hands when Monarch Airlines was let down by its financiers, this time government needs to get a grip and do its bit to save Thomas Cook,"" General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement.

1556,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Climate Protests Highlight Winds of Change in Markets,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Across the world, protesters are taking to the streets Friday to urge their governments to do more to tackle climate change.
You wouldn’t expect the stock markets to show any direct response to that, although it's possible that Germany's mooted ""climate package"" - due to be unveiled at a press conference later Friday in Berlin - may give a pep to some local companies.
But look a little closer, and you can see the thought processes behind the protests are already at work in various pockets of the market. The rise of the sustainable investing phenomenon around the world will only accentuate this in future, as the sheer weight of money allocated to sustainable investing takes its toll. 
Most obviously, of course, there’s the auto sector, which has been the market’s chronic underperformer ever since the Dieselgate scandal exposed the shattering failure of the first European attempts to reduce transport CO2 emission by relying instead on a fuel that massively increased pollution, with more immediate effects on public health than on climate change.
As a result of that, Europe’s automakers find themselves in the middle of a hugely expensive, multi-year transformation to electric technology. In the meantime, they have surrendered much of the gaping technological advantage they had over Chinese producers who are now far better placed to leverage the technologies they have developed for the local market in the world at large. None of the major European OEMs trades at a price/earnings multiple of over 10, for good reason.
Then there’s the airline sector, which is coming under increasing scrutiny for its contribution to the global emissions problem (witness France’s new carbon-related tax on flights and noises from Germany indicating that it may follow suit).
Deutsche Bank strategist Ulrich Stephan notes that European CO2 prices have risen over 200% since the start of the year and could rise further – one of the reasons he advises against buying them (rising fuel and wage costs and competition-driven price pressure being other, equally persuasive reasons).
But there are winners too. The most inspiring example is surely Danish wind farm operator Oersted A/S (CSE:ORSTED), whose share price has more than doubled in the last two years as it has taken its home-grown expertise into more and more new markets, notably the U.S. That said, it has fallen 7% this month on concerns about its valuation. 
A look at the rest of the European utility sector also suggests that greenness is being more consistently rewarded these days: the best performers besides Oersted are   Iberdrola   (MC:IBE) and Austria’s   Verbund   AG Kat. A (VIE:VERB), both of which are overwhelmingly hydropower and renewable plays. The worst performers are gas-dominated   Centrica   (LON:CNA) and nuclear-heavy Electricite de France (PA:EDF), struggling with fearsome regulatory and, in EdF's case, technological challenges.
And, for investors willing to accept the notion that “hardware is hard”, there are also Denmark’s   Vestas Wind   Systems A/S (CSE:VWS) and Spanish-based Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN), which have managed to defend their leadership of the turbine maker despite a rising threat from Asian competitors. "

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares climbed on Friday as stimulus measures by major central banks eased worries about growth, especially in Asian markets, while oil headed for its best week since January.
China cut a key lending rate for the second straight month on Friday, becoming the third major central bank to cut interest rates in recent days, after the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Equity markets have welcomed the central bank moves, although most of the cuts was already priced in and worries about a possible global slowdown still linger.
Renewed tensions in the Middle East, after an air attack knocked out a Saudi Arabian oil supply hub last weekend, have also unnerved investors. Oil prices were on track for a weekly gain of over 7%, their biggest weekly rise since the first week of 2019.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.1%, on course for a fourth day of slim gains but still heading for a weekly loss.
The index was bolstered by Europe's STOXX 600, which climbed 0.3% as investors bought ""defensive"" healthcare, utilities and real estate stocks seen as offering stable dividends. A 0.6% gain for Asian equities outside Japan also helped.
Wall Street futures gauges suggested gains of around 0.3%.
U.S. economic data had eased worries about slowdown in the world's largest economy. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits rose less than expected and home resales increased to a 17-month high in August.
Some analysts were still cautious. Markets are waiting with bated breath for signs of where the economy is heading, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
""We are in a bit a sweet spot, with data starting to improve a little, and central banks on the other side remaining just about at the limit of what they can do,"" he said.
""But there are significant tail risks – for me, quite simply, firms won't commit to large-scale investment decisions when there's no clarity over business conditions,"" Hewson said.
Geopolitical risks range from the U.S.-China trade war to Britain's efforts to leave the European Union next month.
An attack on Friday by a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen highlighted tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude was rose 34 cents, or 0.5%, last at $64.71.
GOOD MONTH FOR STERLING
Investors were also braced for volatility on ""quadruple witching day"" - the quarterly expiration of equity options and futures. A spike in U.S. overnight ""repo"" lending rates also sparked concerns of evaporating liquidity.

In later morning trading, though the dollar reversed losses and was last up 0.1% against an index of other currencies at 98.340.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A profit warning and muted outlook from package delivery company FedEx Corp (N:FDX) is prompting some high-profile fund managers to prepare for the trade war between the United States and China to last longer than many had originally anticipated.
Shares of the shipping company, whose business is often seen as a proxy for growth in the global economy, tumbled 13% Wednesday, a day after it said it planned to ground some planes and cut costs due to the effects of the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
""We were hopeful of a trade deal and some sort of return to normalcy and that has not taken place,"" FedEx's chief executive, Frederick Smith, said on its earnings call.
Companies ranging from parts supplier O'Reilly Automotive (O:ORLY) to network gear maker Juniper Networks (N:JNPR) have said the trade war is weighing on their earnings. Yet investors have focused more on FedEx because the nature of its business touches several industries across the globe, including consumer spending.
An extended trade war could take the wind out of the sails of the rally in the S&P 500 benchmark index, which has advanced in line with expectations for an imminent breakthrough in the trade war. High-level talks between the two countries are expected to resume again in October. The conflict between the two countries could take a decade to resolve, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned on Sept. 6.
As a result, fund managers are moving away from U.S. industrials and technology companies that may be most affected by higher tariffs and instead are looking to pick up some out-of-favor companies and assets that offer long-term opportunities despite the trade war.
""It's obvious that China will try to drag this out as long as it can and hope it disappears after the (2020 presidential) election,"" said Brian Yacktman, whose YCG Enhanced Fund is up nearly 31% for the year to date.
Yacktman is moving more into the shares of European luxury goods makers such as  Kering  SA (PA:PRTP), whose brands include Gucci and Botegga Veneta, that have pricing power but have fallen on concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy. Shares of Kering are up 12.4% for the year to date, including a 10% drop over the last three months.
""These are companies that can just pass tariffs on because people want to buy the status symbol,"" he said.
Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said her firm has been increasing its ""measures of protection"" against an economic downturn caused in part by an escalating trade war. Despite a 20.1% gain in the sector this year, she said she still sees opportunities in utilities companies due in part to their above-average dividend yields and growth potential.
""Rather than reacting and getting whipsawed by the sudden shifts in sentiment, we believe that investors can create diversified portfolios that seek to minimize downside risks from the trade war, however long it may last,"" she said.
Not all fund managers are convinced the trade war is here to stay. ""We still think one way or another Trump will end it before the election,"" said Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at New Orleans-based Villere & Co.
As a result, he has been moving more assets into sectors such as semiconductors, an industry which will be included in $50 billion worth of goods that will be subject to 30% tariffs starting Oct. 1.
""The market is giving you opportunities because we think that this is more of a blip than anything else,"" he said.
Emmanuel Roman, chief executive officer at bond giant Pimco, said Thursday at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference that he is seeing opportunities in emerging market bonds due to the pessimism from the trade war.
""Obviously the big elephant in the room is the trade war with China and how it will resolve itself,"" he said."

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 06:47AM ET</span>",No crowds as Apple's iPhone 11 hits stores in China,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple's latest iPhone 11 range hit stores in China on Friday, with short queues of die-hard fans contrasting with the hundreds who camped out ahead of some previous launches. 
The sales performance of the U.S. tech giant's latest line-up is being closely watched in the world's largest smartphone market, where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been losing ground to competitors with cheaper and feature-packed handsets in recent years. 
The queues at the Shanghai and Beijing stores, which combined added up to few dozen customers, were in sharp contrast to previous years, when hundreds used to wait for hours outside Apple's shops to be the first to grab its latest offerings. 
But much of the fanfare in China has moved online where the pre-sales for iPhone 11, priced between $699 and $1,099, started last week. 
Analysts said they had gotten off to a better start than the last cycle a year ago. Chinese e-commerce site JD.com said day one pre-sales for the iPhone 11 series were up 480% versus comparable sales for the iPhone XR last year.
Among customers that took to a store in Beijing on Friday to make a purchase in person was a programer who only gave his surname as Liu, who said he had a model from every Apple series since the 3G range. 
He said he was particularly attracted to the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro, which has three cameras on the back. ""When it comes to taking photos, it's better for night shots and the image is clearer,"" he told Reuters. 
Other customers, however, said that they were concerned that the range was not enabled for fifth-generation networks, putting them behind 5G models already released by China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and smaller rival Vivo, and expressed hopes that Apple could make it happen for its next line-up. 
""I think by the end of next year, especially in big cities like Beijing, 5G will be commonplace,"" said civil servant Liu Liu. ""If they don't research this then they'll lag way behind."" 
The in-store launch of the iPhone 11 in China came a day after Chinese smartphone maker Huawei unveiled new smartphones which it said were more compact, with more sensitive cameras and wraparound screens more vivid than those of the latest iPhone, though it played down concerns about the lack of access to Google's popular apps.

Huawei has experienced a surge in support from Chinese consumers after the brand was caught up in a trade war between the United States and China, which has in turn eaten into Apple's market share in the country.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 06:14AM ET</span>",Belgian police search property of KPN's new CEO over Proximus share sale,"By Toby Sterling and Philip Blenkinsop
AMSTERDAM/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian police searched the home and office of Dominique Leroy, the incoming chief executive of Dutch telecom firm KPN (AS:KPN), to investigate her sale of shares in Proximus (BR:PROX), the company she is leaving.
Brussels prosecutors said they conducted raids on Thursday evening, without giving details. Leroy told Belga news agency police searched her home and office over the August share sale, completed about a month before her new job was announced.
The Sept. 5 announcement that KPN had hired her from Proximus, which she led since 2014, was cheered by investors and pushed up the Dutch firm's share price. But the shares slipped a day later when the probe was announced.
Belgium's stock market watchdog FSMA said on Sept. 6 it was looking into Leroy's share transaction as part of a ""standard procedure."" The watchdog's investigation, which could lead to a fine, is separate to the police probe.
Leroy, who leaves Proximus on Friday and is due to start work at KPN on Dec. 1, denies any wrongdoing.
KPN spokeswoman Victorina de Boer said KPN was aware of the Belgian investigation but had no further comment. Reuters could not immediately reach Leroy.
Proximus, Belgium's largest telecoms company in which the state has a 53.3% stake, had no immediate comment.
Leroy sold shares in Proximus, where she has been CEO, worth 285,000 euros ($315,000) at 26.26 euros on Aug. 1, her first transaction in three years. When Leroy's departure was announced on Sept. 5, Proximus shares fell by 2.5%.
Leroy said it was a routine sale after Proximus reported second quarter earnings on July 31 for the quarter ended June 30. She said she had not decided at the time to leave Proximus, although she said she was in confidential talks with KPN and other potential employers.
Paul Koster, director and spokesman for Dutch shareholders' rights association VEB, said the VEB believed Leroy should not begin her new appointment until the situation has been resolved, though it was impossible to say whether she did anything wrong.
He described the incident as ""unnecessary"" and said it reflected poorly on Leroy's judgment and KPN's vetting process.
""She should have taken into account (selling shares) might have been too sensitive"" given that the talks were not publicly known, he said. For KPN ""it brings home the point that you need to do due diligence,"" even if they were eager to hire Leroy quickly. KPN’s supervisory chairman had been unaware of the share sale until it emerged in the Belgian media.
KPN had trumpeted Leroy's appointment, as she had been seen as a leading candidate for top jobs at bigger firms. Leroy, 54, rose through the ranks at  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) for two decades before moving to Proximus in 2011 and becoming CEO there in 2014. 
When her new appointment was announced, KPN Chairman Duco Sickinghe said Leroy was ""dynamic, client-focused, and with a wealth of experience in the telecom sector"".
KPN has been striving to recover from years of weak sales and profit growth. In July, it said its core earnings would grow ""slightly"" for the first time in more than five years.
KPN's previous CEO, Maximo Ibarra, announced his departure in June to lead Sky Italia, after just over a year on the job.
Belgian labor unions had complained about Leroy's abrupt departure, saying she could take company secrets to a competitor. They also questioned the legitimacy of her August share transaction.
Leroy had initially been scheduled to leave Proximus on Nov. 30. Her departure was moved to Friday after the union complaints.

SHENZHEN, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) plans to leverage its strengths in video games and social media to grab market share in China's burgeoning cloud computing sector from incumbent  Alibaba , the head of its cloud unit told Reuters.
Tencent is best-known for its WeChat messaging app and a suite of popular games but is aiming to expand into business services as consumer internet growth slows and companies shift number-crunching from their own computers to the cloud. 
""I think we can start from where we have advantages,"" said Senior Executive Vice President Dowson Tong in his first interview with international media since he took charge of Tencent's Cloud and Smart Industries Group.
Restructuring last year included the creation of the stand-alone unit from Tencent's small, six-year-old cloud operation.
""Our focus will be to capitalize on the advantages that Tencent has with the global video games eco-system, and help more customers - some of whom are Chinese businesses going overseas, some of whom are local game developers in foreign markets,"" Tong said at Tencent's headquarters in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.
Tong listed gaming strengths such as audio and video communication as well as server management capabilities.
Giving increased focus on serving businesses - locally dubbed 2B - from its mainstay consumer-oriented, or 2C, operations could be lucrative, but the transition is often difficult to get right due to existing competition and the need to adjust to unfamiliar customer requirements, analysts said.
""This segment will drag down the margin of Tencent,"" said Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam. Still, she said, ""compared to 2C, 2B has a very low penetration in China and strong growth potential.""
Tencent said it has chalked up some recent wins with contracts from the Bank of Communications Co Ltd (SS:601328) (HK:3328) as well as local governments.
However, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) continues to dominate with 43% of China's cloud market, according to data from market researcher Canalys. That is more than the combined share of Tencent, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Baidu Inc (O:BIDU), the next three largest players. 
Tong said industries Tencent is targeting include mobility, fitness and finance. He said the firm is also expanding its cloud business internationally. Tencent previously said that it was seeking partners in South Korea and Southeast Asia to offer cloud-based games.
Tencent has also started helping customers of Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google Cloud, which is not available in China, with services that offer ""seamless connections"" between clouds, though Tong said there was no formal or exclusive arrangement. 
Tencent Chairman Pony Ma ""has stressed that industrial internet is a major direction for Tencent in the next 10 years,"" said Tong, using a term in China that refers to a drive to upgrade of traditional businesses using technology.
Tong declined to comment on growth targets for his business unit, whose financial results form part of Tencent's FinTech and Business Services category. That segment generated 22.9 billion yuan ($3.23 billion) in revenue in the second quarter of 2019, up 37% from the same period a year earlier and accounting for just over 25% of the firm's quarterly total, showed Tencent's latest earnings report. 
Tong said mistakes would be made and patience needed as Tencent increases its attention on serving businesses, given that many of its internal procedures were designed for the consumer business. Consumer-oriented companies have traditionally struggled to compete in corporate computing.

""Many of the things we are doing will take a relatively longer time,"" Tong said. ""It's not like we're selling a small product that needs quick decisions. This business needs a longer runway.""

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras has in the last five years battled an epic corruption probe, a crippling recession and unsteady crude prices.
Now, Brazil's most important company is facing yet another challenge: thieves are robbing millions of dollars worth of its fuel to sell on a thriving black market.
Theft from Petrobras pipelines soared to a record high 261 incidents in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo last year, up from just one case in 2014, according to an August securities filing and statements made to Reuters by representatives of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known.
Most of those heists, police say, are the work of sophisticated criminal groups, some with their own trucks, distribution firms and even retail gas stations.
""They're creative creatures,"" said Julio da Silva Filho, the head of a Rio police unit that investigates oil theft.
Crime costs Petrobras' distribution subsidiary, Petrobras Transporte SA, or Transpetro, over 150 million reais ($37 million) per year, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said at an event in June.
The alleged losses are tiny compared to those of another Latin American energy powerhouse - Mexico - where crime gangs have infiltrated the petroleum business in a big way. Fuel theft costs state-run Pemex over $3 billion annually, according to company figures.
But stamping out Brazil's problems early, da Silva said, will be crucial to keeping gangsters from becoming entrenched in its oil industry.
""We're working exactly to prevent Brazil from turning into Mexico,"" he said.
Transpetro has set up a program to gather intelligence on criminal groups and is spending 100 million reais ($24 million) a year to fund it, according a high-ranking company source, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from organized crime groups.
Around 50 staffers are now studying the issue, including tracking the patterns and methods of oil thieves and sharing those findings with law enforcement, the person said. The company, which did not respond to a request for comment, has also set up a hotline for the public to report fuel robbery.
Some foreign investors, too, are beefing up security. They include TAG, a pipeline unit that France's Engie SA bought from Petrobras for $8.6 billion in April.
The firm told Reuters in a statement that it is working with Transpetro, whose pipelines often run beside TAG's pipes, to increase foot patrols and reinforce physical barriers, among other measures.
""This phenomenon is becoming very organized,"" said Emmanuel Delfosse, TAG's chief operational officer. ""It's hard to go after these people.""
CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY
Fuel is an expensive commodity in Brazil, where the pump price of gasoline works out to more than $4 a gallon.
Crime gangs traditionally focused on narcotics trafficking have branched out into fuel theft in recent years, according to authorities. So have so-called militias, police say, which sprang up to battle drug gangs but have morphed into fearsome crime outfits in their own right.
These groups are highly organized, with separate divisions dedicated to tapping illegally into pipelines, transporting the stolen fuel and keeping a lookout for cops, said Simone Sibilio, the head prosecutor for Rio state's organized crime unit.
She said gangsters fence the product through firms such as asphalt companies whose operations require large amounts of petroleum products. They also sell to unscrupulous gas station owners, undercutting legal competitors on price, authorities said.
Crooks have also muscled into retail sales. Police say criminals entered the gas station business years ago as a means of laundering cash from other illicit operations. Now, stocking those pumps with stolen fuel has become a lucrative new profit center, authorities said.
First Capital Command, one of Brazil's most notorious crime gangs, controls around 300 gas stations in Sao Paulo state, according to Paulo Miranda, head of the gas station industry group Fecombustiveis. That comes to around 3% of the state's approximately 9,000 gas stations.
""It's a fuel mafia,"" Miranda said.
FIGHTING BACK
Petrobras CEO Castello Branco has called for harsher sentences for pipeline attackers to reduce fuel theft.
The firm is also close to signing formal agreements with Mexico's Pemex and Colombia's Ecopetrol to facilitate the sharing of anti-theft strategies, the Transpetro source said.
None of those companies responded to requests for comment.
In the meantime, heightened vigilance appears to be paying off. Through the end of July, fuel heists in Brazil were down 33% compared to the same period in 2018, Petrobras securities filings show, though they remain high by historical standards.
Lucas Tristão, secretary of development for Rio state, said authorities have shut down 10 gas stations in Rio for various crimes in 2019.
In July, police blew the lid off an extortion racket at a Petrobras refinery northeast of Rio, where Tristão alleges a local militia was demanding kickbacks from contractors at the complex.
Gabriel Poiava, one of the detectives on that case, said it's an example of gangsters looking up and down Brazil's oil supply chain to see where they could grab a piece of the riches.
""If they believed some activity could be extorted there, they would try,"" he said."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking watchdog lost a landmark case on Friday after a court ruled it had not proved its case alleging wealth manager IOOF Holdings had breached pension laws.
The dismissal of the case, which sent IOOF's shares soaring by 8%, was the second setback in as many months for regulators looking to clamp down on misconduct in the financial sector. 
Federal Court judge Jayne Jagot said the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) had failed to demonstrate its allegation that top IOOF Holdings officials breached pension laws by using reserve funds to make up for investment losses. 
""I have found APRA's approach unpersuasive,"" Jagot said. ""The underlying facts have not been proved.""
APRA said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision. IOOF said it welcomed the ruling, adding it would review the 307-page judgment in detail before commenting further.
The ruling is the first in a case that originated directly from last year's powerful Royal Commission inquiry into the financial sector, which uncovered widespread misconduct at the expense of consumers.
It also underscores a disconnect between intense political pressure for regulators to ramp up their financial sector enforcement and a legal system still bound by rules of evidence.
""This case examined a range of legal questions relating to superannuation law and regulation that had not previously been tested in court,"" APRA Deputy Chair Helen Rowell said. 
""Litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, however, APRA remains prepared to launch court action – where appropriate – when entities breach the law or fail to act in an open and cooperative manner.""
Just last month, the Federal Court rejected a case by the securities regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), against Westpac Banking Corp alleging the No. 2 bank approved mortgages without adequate credit checks.
Since the retired judge presiding over the Royal Commission lashed regulators earlier this year for being too soft on the sector, both watchdogs have given public statements promising to take a more hardline approach to enforcement.
UNPRECEDENTED CASE
APRA had sought to use the Federal Court action to disqualify five IOOF executives for failing to act in their customers' interests, an unprecedented move in Australia.
The regulator accused IOOF of using money belonging to pension fund customers to compensate them for losses caused by the company and said it had been working with the company to resolve concerns about unaddressed conflicts of interest since 2015.
Both IOOF's managing director Christopher Kelaher and chairman George Venardos stepped aside to fight the court case.
Although Jagot dismissed the regulator's claims of wrongdoing, she put off making a formal decision about whether to disqualify the IOOF directors to a later date. She ordered APRA pay the wealth manager's legal costs.
""The inescapable fact is that APRA's case fails at each step on the question of proof. It is not possible to conclude that in acting as he did Mr Kelaher contravened any of his director's covenants,"" Jagot said.
IOOF's shares jumped as much as 8.1% to A$6 ($4.07) following the news, their highest since early May.
""It's been a costly exercise for APRA,"" said Andrew Grant, a senior lecturer at The University of Sydney Business School. ""(Regulators) are taking a few shots and the punches aren't really landing.""

Rolls-Royce, whose engines power large civil and military planes, said on Friday it had sped up turbine blade replacement for some models, leading to additional removals and delaying a reduction in the number of grounded aircraft to single figures until the second quarter of 2020.
The company faces 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in extra costs and disruption as a result of the engine problem, which is due to the poor durability of components, and the latest delay spells further frustration for its customers and investors.
Its shares were down 3.5% at 780.8 pence at 0851 GMT, the largest percentage losers on London's blue-chip index (FTSE).
Rolls-Royce, whose customers include more than 400 airlines, 160 armed forces and 70 navies, said in August that it would spend another 100 million pounds to fix the issue.
""We perceived a risk that further action would be required, potentially leading to higher costs being incurred ... today's announcement that guidance for the Trent 1000 cash costs in 2019 and 2020 remains unchanged comes as a relief,"" Jefferies analysts, who rate the stock as ""buy"", said. 
Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East said in August that a target of fewer than 10 aircraft on the ground at the end of the year might take a bit longer to achieve as a result of an additional repair load resulting from faster deterioration of a blade on the Trent 1000 TEN.
DEEP REGRET 
The Trent 1000 TEN is the latest version of an engine that has had a problematic entry into service. As of late February, Rolls said 35 787s were grounded globally due to engine blades corroding or cracking prematurely. 
""We deeply regret the additional disruption that this will cause our customers and we continue to work closely with them to minimize the impact on their operations,"" Rolls-Royce said. 
Airlines have faced disruptions because of the groundings, with Norwegian Air's (OL:NWC) strategy switch to prioritize profits over growth hampered by the global grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft and long-running problems with Rolls-Royce's engines on Boeing Dreamliners.
Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL) has also grounded two 787-10 jets fitted with the Trent 1000 TEN engines.

Rolls-Royce is keen to avoid further problems with the engine and in March dropped out of the race to power Boeing's planned mid-market aircraft.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 03:26AM ET</span>","Explainer: Abe, Trump head for trade deal; auto tariffs a sticking point","By Linda Sieg and Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are expected to clinch a deal on farm tariffs and digital trade when they meet in New York next week.
Full details of the agreement have not been disclosed. Below are some key elements about the pending agreement.
U.S. AUTO TARIFFS
Trump's announcement of an initial deal earlier this week left unanswered questions over whether the agreement would deliver Japan one of the main prizes it seeks: a U.S. pledge not to impose national security tariffs of up to 25% on Japanese vehicles and auto parts under Section 232 of U.S. trade law.
Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, who is in charge of talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has said he wanted to reconfirm in writing that the tariffs would not be imposed.
Japanese officials have said that under a September 2018 agreement, the United States would not impose added auto tariffs while trade talks were under way. Fresh assurances could echo the vague wording then, that both sides would ""refrain from taking measures against the spirit of this joint statement during the process of these consultations"".
Japanese auto exports account for about two-thirds of its trade deficit with the United States and the added tariffs would deal a blow to Japan's trade-reliant economy.
A preliminary deal announced on Aug. 25 included reduced U.S. tariffs on unspecified industrial products but Lighthizer said these did not include autos. Tokyo has sought removal of a U.S. 2.5% tariff on autos and auto parts.
BEEF AND PORK
Japan is expected to agree to cut tariffs on imports of U.S. beef and pork to around levels granted to signatories of the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) pact, officials have said.
Japan will permit low import tariffs on about 240,000 tons of U.S. beef, with the quota covering about 90% of the amount Japan imports from America, the Nikkei business daily said, adding it would eventually rise to 290,000 tons.
Lower tariffs would allow Trump to please U.S. farmers ahead of next year's presidential election. The farmers had been disadvantaged in Japan's market after the United States withdrew from TPP after Trump took office in 2017. It would also let Abe keep a pledge to domestic producers.
Lighthizer said last month that wheat, dairy products, wine and ethanol would also benefit from the deal.
Washington, meanwhile, will make it easier for Japan to increase U.S.-bound beef exports by scrapping a 200-ton annual low-tariff quota, affording Japan the same beef trade status as Australia, New Zealand and Canada, Japanese media reported.
JAPAN-BOUND CORN PURCHASES
In announcing the initial agreement last month, Trump made reference to Japan's decision to front-load planned purchases of U.S. feed corn imports to cope with damage to its crop from an armyworm infestation. However, Japanese officials said the country's total feed corn imports wouldn't increase.
WINE, RICE
Japan has agreed to phase out tariffs on U.S. wine imports over five to seven years, about the same as the eight-year TPP time-frame, media said, potentially cutting the cost of U.S. wine by about 13% for wine distributors.
However, the amount of U.S. rice that will be allowed to enter Japan tariff-free would be much less than the 70,000 metric tons accepted under the TPP, a Japanese source familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. 
CURRENCY DEVALUATION 
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso has said that a currency provision aimed at preventing competitive devaluation would not be included in the final deal. [L3N2680R7]
That demand by U.S. lawmakers would tie Japan's ability to intervene in currency markets should the yen spike and threaten the country's export-reliant economy.
DIGITAL TRADE
U.S. technology industry officials say they expect a digital trade agreement with Japan to be closely aligned with provisions in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which follow the U.S. model for internet development.

Those provisions aim to ensure the free flow of data across borders without taxation, prohibit data server localization requirements and limit governments' ability to demand companies disclose their source code.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 03:18AM ET</span>","Alison Rose gets top job at RBS, first woman to lead major UK lender","By Huw Jones and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) named Alison Rose as its new chief executive on Friday, becoming the first major British lender to appoint a woman to its top job.
Rose, who was widely tipped to get the role at the state-backed lender, will succeed outgoing CEO Ross McEwan on November 1. He is due to join National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) as their next chief executive. 
Rose has worked at the bank for 27 years and takes on the role at a pivotal time for the lender, as British banks prepare for the economic fallout if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal next month.
She will also be tasked with further patching up RBS's damaged reputation and trying to return the bank to private hands, more than a decade after its 45 billion pound state rescue in the financial crisis.
""Following a rigorous internal and external process, I am confident that we have appointed the best person for the job,"" RBS Chairman Howard Davies said in a statement.
Rose will receive a fixed base salary of 1.1 million pounds ($1.38 million) a year plus a fixed share allowance set at 100% of her salary. That's up slightly from McEwan who has a base pay of 1 million pounds a year, plus a 100% fixed share allowance.
RBS said Rose's pay package ""continues to represent a restrained pay position in terms of comparable roles"".
However Rose's pension will be set at 10% of her salary in line with other RBS employees, compared to McEwan who is receiving 350,000 pounds a year in pension funding.
British banks have been criticized by investors this year for giving their executives more favorable pension arrangements than the rest of their workforce.
TRAINEE TO CEO
Rose has risen through the RBS ranks from a trainee to deputy CEO of the lender's biggest business NatWest, as well as head of its commercial and private lending.
She also won plaudits for leading a government-commissioned review into the barriers holding back female entrepreneurs.
The appointment means RBS will be led by two women in its top executive roles, after Katie Murray was promoted to the chief financial officer role in January.
McEwan, who has led the bank since 2013, announced his decision to retire in April.

The British government has committed to fully privatizing RBS by 2024, but political and economic turmoil triggered by the Brexit vote has delayed further sales of the state's remaining 62% holding and thrown the timetable into doubt.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2019 02:00AM ET</span>",FAA waiting for more software details before 737 MAX can return to service,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) still has a series of steps to complete before the 737 MAX can return to service, including submitting a pre-production version of a software update, Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson said.
Dickson met with Boeing executives in Renton, Washington on Thursday and tested revised software in a simulator. Next week, he will meet with around 50 aviation safety regulators in Montreal to discuss the status of the plane, which has been grounded worldwide since March in the aftermath of two fatal crashes.
The FAA has been reviewing proposed software and training changes from Boeing Co (N:BA) for months and it remains uncertain when Boeing will conduct a certification test flight, a step needed before its best-selling plane can fly again.
In a telephone interview with Reuters, Dickson laid out a series of steps that must happen before the certification test flight, adding it should then take about another month before the FAA could allow flights to resume absent unforeseen circumstances.
""I am not going to sign off on the plane until I am personally satisfied,"" he said. 
Some government officials have told Reuters they do not believe Boeing will conduct the certification flight until at least mid-October. Asked if there are at least several weeks of work to be done before that flight can occur, Dickson said he thought that was a ""fair statement,"" but did not want to set a specific date. 
Asked about reports that the FAA has at times been frustrated with a lack of information from Boeing, Dickson said he is satisfied that Boeing has been responsive to him and added the FAA had made clear what it expected. 
""We've had conversations about the importance of making sure that we are looking at complete documentation and not piecemeal documentation,"" Dickson said.
""It's really better to be very methodical and very detailed rather than try to rush a partially completed product and then say, 'We'll get back to you with the rest of it.'""
Boeing has repeatedly said it hopes to resume flights early in the fourth quarter. The company reiterated Thursday it remains ""committed to working collaboratively"" with the FAA and other regulators.
FAA still needs to see Boeing's ""final system description"" - a ""500-ish page document that has the architecture of the flight control system and the changes that they have made,"" Dickson said, adding that the software changes must be in a ""pre-production"" code and not a ""beta version"".
""We need to see that level of refinement and there has been a good bit of back and forth and some constructive discussions,"" he said. 
""Until it is locked down, we've got to go make sure that there aren't any new fault trees that have developed that need to be mitigated.""
Once the system description is completed, the FAA will work with Boeing to develop the ""integrated system safety analysis"" - a step that will take a few days.
Then the FAA will move to the next phase - the pilot workload management scenarios. Once that is done, the agency will be ""much closer to a predictable timeline for when the actual certification test flight will occur.""
The FAA plans to get input from international regulators EASA, Canada and Brazil. ""We've got U.S. and international pilots that have to be scheduled to come out and actually go through the scenarios,"" Dickson said, adding it must also finalize training requirements.

Boeing plans to revise the 737 MAX software to take input from both angle-of-attack sensors in the anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes.

While the Hang Seng Index tiptoed into a slim gain Friday, the gauge was heading for a weekly decline of 3.3% as of 11:33 a.m. It dipped back below its 50-day moving average earlier this week, just days after rising above it.
Local unrest and the trade war have conspired to drag shares lower, while the Federal Reserve’s rate cut this week was seen unlikely to feed into the cost of credit for businesses and households in a city whose dollar peg means that it imports U.S. monetary policy.
Months of protests have unnerved investors and consumers and raised the prospect of capital flight. A range of indicators weakened sharply in July and August, signaling that the city could tip into recession. Fitch Ratings Inc. this month downgraded Hong Kong as an issuer of long-term foreign currency debt for the first time since 1995.
“The protests are the biggest drag on sentiment and unless that issue is resolved the market will remain weak,” said Alvin Cheung, associate director of  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Brokerage Ltd. “The government expects a big hit to the city’s economy in the second half, and that could filter through to corporate earnings and weigh on the Hang Seng Index.“
MTR Corp. was heading for a 5-day decline of 2.5%, ending a week during which one of its trains derailed in Hong Kong, dealing a fresh blow for the developer and subway operator that has become a target and battleground in the anti-Beijing demonstrations rocking the city. A stock gauge of property developers was heading for a 2.5% drop.

1579,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 11:03PM ET</span>",UBS Bets on China’s Nasdaq-Style Exchange to Offset a Ban in Hong Kong,"(Bloomberg) -- UBS Group AG, which runs the biggest foreign-controlled investment bank in China, is counting on the nation’s new Nasdaq-style exchange to mitigate the impact of an underwriting ban in Hong Kong, according to people familiar with the matter.
Beijing-based UBS Securities Co. aims to boost fees from arranging share sales on the technology board, known as STAR Market, to 20% of its stock underwriting income from the mainland by December, said the people, asking not to be identified since the projections are confidential. The contribution may reach 50% as soon as next year, with the bank working on two first-time offerings that may raise up to 3 billion yuan ($423 million), they said.
UBS, one of two foreign ventures approved to sponsor initial public offerings on Shanghai’s STAR Market, is betting that the high commissions from these issuances will partly offset a revenue decline in Hong Kong, where it has been banned from sponsoring IPOs till April. The Swiss bank is among those expanding in China after taking majority control of its local securities unit as the nation loosens restrictions on foreign participants in its $43 trillion financial industry.
“The fees are lucrative,” said Liu Wencheng, co-head of investment banking at UBS Securities. “We are actively mobilizing resources to dig and cultivate high quality tech-innovation companies to tap the opportunity.”
Liu wouldn’t comment directly on the bank’s plans for STAR Market.
UBS is also focusing to the new bourse after mainland investment banking revenues, including fees from arranging debt sales, dropped 48% last year as the number of large deals shrank, according to the people familiar. In March, it was fined HK$375 million ($48 million) to settle cases brought by Hong Kong authorities and became the only foreign bank banned from sponsoring IPOs for 12 months.
The Swiss bank underwrote IPOs totaling $317 million in Hong Kong this year, compared with $1.6 billion in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its tally on the mainland is about $98 million for 2019.
A Hong Kong-based spokesman declined to comment on the details of UBS’s China plans.
The STAR Market, launched in July, has been hailed as a testing ground for relaxed rules on listing and trading as policy makers seek to stem an exodus of new economy IPOs to Hong Kong and the U.S.
For investment banks, there’s the carrot of higher fees. Underwriters typically charge issuers 1.5% to 2% fees for Hong Kong listings, compared with an average 7% on the tech board, according to the people. Also, unlike in Hong Kong, Chinese regulators have capped the number of banks involved to one if the issuer’s IPO size is less than 10 billion yuan.
Sponsors on the tech board are required to co-invest in between 2% and 5% of the shares issued by their clients, an unusual arrangement that may limit foreign players’ interest in leading deals due to their limited capital base onshore.
To shore up available capital, UBS is seeking special approval to use the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors program to co-invest in tech board IPOs, the people said."

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 08:58PM ET</span>","Facebook CEO Zuckerberg meets Trump, seeks to mend fences in Washington","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg met with President Donald Trump on Thursday during a fence-mending visit to Washington where the chief executive faced aggressive questioning from lawmakers about the social network's failures to protect consumer privacy.
Trump posted a photo with Zuckerberg on Twitter and called their session a ""nice meeting"" in the Oval Office. Facebook (O:FB) said the tech executive ""had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today."" Neither side disclosed specifics of their discussion.
Trump has castigated Facebook repeatedly, accusing it of being biased in favor of Democrats. The company has faced a barrage of other criticism over privacy lapses, election-related activity and its dominance in online advertising, giving rise to calls for more regulation and anti-trust investigations. 
Wearing a suit and tie rather than his usual hoodie, Zuckerberg met on Thursday, the second day of the three-day visit, with Senators Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton and Mike Lee. He also had dinner with lawmakers, including Senator Richard Blumenthal, on Wednesday evening.
Zuckerberg took no questions from reporters as he moved from office to office on Capitol Hill. He will meet with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, on Friday and will meet with several high-ranking House Democrats. 
After his meeting with the Facebook founder, Hawley, a tough critic, said that discussions had been ""frank,"" often a euphemism for contentious. He urged Zuckerberg to sell Facebook's Instagram and WhatsApp units, which would limit how much information it could compile about an individual from different sources. 
""I said to him, 'Prove that you're serious about data. Sell WhatsApp. And sell Instagram,'"" Hawley told reporters. ""Safe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions.""
Hawley has accused Facebook of suppressing conservative speech including when it found this month that statements on the anti-abortion group Live Action's Facebook page were false and temporarily restricted access to it.
Hawley expressed exasperation with the CEO's acknowledgement that restricting access to the page had been an error. Urging Facebook to submit its content moderation process to an independent third-party audit, he said, ""The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action.""
BUILDING BRIDGES
Despite the harsh words, Zuckerberg's trip appeared aimed at building bridges with Congress. While some lawmakers like Hawley were quick to upbraid the CEO, several senators praised Zuckerberg for taking extensive time to meet. 
Democratic Senator Mark Warner told Fox Business Network, ""Facebook leadership realizes that failure to have federal legislation (on internet issues) is actually going to hurt them and the whole platform industry in the long run."" 
Facebook has spent the last several years under fire for a string of lapses including inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with a now-defunct British political consultancy, triggering a $5 billion fine.
The company, which is an advertising powerhouse, faces antitrust investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and a number of state attorneys general, as well as numerous legislative proposals that seek to restrict how it operates.

It may also face an antitrust probe by the U.S. Justice Department. Senator Lee was critical of what he saw as duplication in federal investigations in a hearing on Tuesday.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. health officials said on Thursday there are now 530 confirmed and probable cases and seven deaths from severe lung-related illnesses tied to vaping, and there are no signs that the outbreak is easing.
That is up from 380 cases reported a week ago as health officials link more illnesses and deaths to vaping. Three-fourths of the cases are male, and two-thirds are between the ages of 18 and 34.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now investigating more than 150 products and substances and said it has activated its criminal investigations arm to explore the supply chain of vaping products and identify the cause of the outbreak. No individual vapers will be targeted, said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.
Zeller said no single substance or compound, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the high-inducing component of marijuana, or Vitamin E acetate, has been linked to all of the cases so far. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed seven people have died from vaping-related illness. The confirmed deaths were reported in California (2), Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota and Oregon.
""We do expect others,"" Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, told reporters, referring to the number of deaths. 

A Missouri man in his 40s died of a lung illness associated with the use of e-cigarettes earlier this week, the eighth vaping death in the United States and the first death in Missouri, state health officials announced on Thursday afternoon.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - At least three new U.S. stock exchanges are expected in 2020, executives from the companies said on Thursday, potentially lowering trading costs as the upstarts try to take business from the incumbents, while also adding complexity to the marketplace.
There are currently 13 U.S. stock exchanges, 12 of which are run by Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) NYSE, Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), and Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE). IEX Group runs the only independent exchange.
""I could see us getting to 20-plus,"" Bryan Harkins, co-head of markets at Cboe, said of the potential for new exchanges, at a Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association conference. 
Next year, launches are planned for the Members Exchange, a new bourse backed by a group of large financial firms; a stock exchange run by options exchange operator Miami International Holdings that says it will eventually list companies from Latin America; and the Long Term Stock Exchange, a Silicon Valley-based startup aimed at promoting long-term growth ahead of short-term profits for the companies it lists.
The increased competition comes as NYSE, Nasdaq and Cboe sue the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to prevent an experiment mandated by the regulator to test lowering exchange fees and curtailing payments to brokers for orders. 
It also comes amid an intense debate between the large exchange operators and their customers over fees for things like market data and connectivity. 
""We're going to start out 40 percent cheaper than the lowest cost operator today,"" said Thomas Gallagher, chief executive officer of Miami International Holdings. He said his exchange will launch in the second or third quarter next year.
The Members Exchange, which aims to go live in mid-2020 and is backed by financial heavyweights including  Virtu Financial Inc  (O:VIRT),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD), will also have lower fees while also giving its members a bigger voice in the fee debate, said CEO Jonathan Kellner.
LTSE CEO Zoran Perkov said his exchange will launch ""soon.""
New exchanges can add value to the market, but also add complexity and may make illiquid stocks harder to trade, said Tal Cohen, head of Nasdaq's North American market services. 
MIAX's Gallagher pointed to his firm's success in the options market, where it has gained around 10% market share, opening three options exchanges in less than seven years.

""When you make a movie that does well, you do it again and you do it again and you do it again,"" he said.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 06:26PM ET</span>",Main IKEA retailer expects to exceed renewable energy goal by year's end,"By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores, will by year's end to exceed its 2020 target to produce as much renewable energy as the energy it consumes, Ingka Chief Executive Jesper Brodin said on Thursday.
Ingka Group has spent 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) over the past decade on wind farms, rooftop solar panels on its stores and warehouses and, most recently, on its first-ever off-site solar parks, the company said on Thursday.
It announced this week the acquisition of a 49% stake in two U.S. solar parks due to come into operation in coming months. Ikea is the world's biggest furniture group; Ingka Group owns most of its retail operations.
Brodin told Reuters that Ingka plans to go on investing in wind farms and solar parks. He said it was good business.
""Being climate smart is not an added cost. It's actually smart business and what the business model of the future will look like ... Everything around fossil fuels and daft use of resources will be expensive,"" he said.
Brodin urged companies and government leaders at Monday's United Nations-hosted Climate Action Summit in New York to commit to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), as called for by scientists.
More than 400 firms including IKEA, H&M, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Sony have committed to a U.N.-backed initiative to help limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius.
Ingka said its renewable energy power now equals more than 1.7 gigawatts (GW)of power - spread over 920,000 solar modules on its sites, 534 wind turbines in 14 countries and the 700,000 solar panels under construction in the United States.
Its two single-biggest investments to date are the 2014 acquisition of a U.S. wind farm for $300 million, and that in 2019 of a stake in a wind farm offshore Germany for more than 200 million euros, an Ingka spokeswoman said.
Ingka, formerly IKEA Group, owns 367 IKEA stores, 23 smaller-format showrooms and 44 shopping centers in 30 markets. It said on Thursday it would roll out its residential solar panel offering in stores to all its markets by 2025, from seven markets currently.
Franchisor Inter IKEA, which is also in charge of product development and supply, aims for IKEA as a whole to be climate positive - to reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than the IKEA value chain emits - by 2030."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity billionaire Joshua Harris thinks there are still plenty of undervalued companies to improve and profit from, especially away from the public markets.
""Certainly, this is not a value-oriented environment,"" said Harris, senior managing director of Apollo Global Management, ""but we’re able to find really interesting diamonds in the rough.""
Harris, speaking at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference, said Apollo saw opportunity in taking public companies private.
Harris cited Apollo's purchase of Aspen Insurance Holdings for $2.6 billion in August 2018 and Smart & Final Stores for $1.1 billion in April 2019 as examples.
There is likely more to come: The New York Post reported Apollo wants to buy publicly traded Hilton Grand Vacations Inc, the hotel chain’s time-share operator, for $2.4 billion.
Harris said at the New York event that sectors still under significant pressure, including banking, insurance and energy, still needed capital and provided opportunity for firms like Apollo.
Generally, Harris said that private equity profits ""have come down a bit,"" but that they ""still way better"" than returns in the public market, such as stocks.
Investors seem to agree: Earlier this year, the firm said it planned to raise around $9 billion. Apollo, founded in 1990, already has $319 billion in committed capital. Some $77 billion of that is in private equity funds, including $24.7 billion for its latest portfolio, Fund IX, which was closed in 2017."
1586,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 05:29PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Again?
With no major economic indicators scheduled tomorrow, investors will likely be looking at the Fed once again.
There are two Federal Reserve members scheduled to speak on Friday.
On one hand, there may be little to glean so soon after a rate decision and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. On the other, you never know what comment, intentional or not, might move the market.
At 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT), New York Fed President John Williams will be speaking at on monetary policy at the Swiss National Bank’s “New Normal Monetary Policy Frameworks” conference in Zurich. But that event is closed to the press. 
At 11:30 AM ET, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren speaks at a credit markets conference at New York University.
2. The Season of the Witch
The stock market will see a big dose of options and futures action tomorrow, with quadruple witching arriving.
Quadruple witching is the simultaneous expiration of stock index options, stock index futures, stock options and single stock futures.
The expiration of these contracts leads to higher-than-usual trading volume. It can also lead to increased volatility, especially near the end of the trading session.
3. Rig Count Coming
The oil market has been roiled by geopolitics all week and headlines out of the Middle East will likely continue to have an impact in Friday trading.
But traders will also have some solid U.S. data on which to trade.
Baker Hughes will issues its oil rig count for the week at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
The rig count came in at 733 for the previous week, down five from the week before that and 15.4% from a year ago, according to Baker Hughes data."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - France's CNP Assurances SA (PA:CNPP) has reached a deal worth 7 billion reais ($1.7 billion) with Caixa Economica Federal (CEF.UL) to sell insurance in the bank's more than 3,000 branches, the Brazilian state-owned lender said on Thursday.
Earlier on Thursday, Reuters reported that the companies would create a joint venture with Caixa insurance unit Caixa Seguridade holding a 60% stake and CNP owning the rest.
The deal involves life, pension plans and consumer credit life insurance to be sold through 2046, Caixa said in a filing.
One year ago, both financial institutions had agreed to create a similar joint-venture, in which CNP would have paid 4.65 billion reais for a contract to sell life insurance products through 2041. This deal has been revised under new terms.
The new joint venture will start to operate in 2021, when the current agreement will expire.
The deal is expected to be formalized by the end of 2020, Caixa said. CNP's 7 billion-real payment will be made up front.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is advising Caixa to forge partnerships for its insurance units, including this renegotiation with CNP.  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) is advising CNP Assurances.

1589,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 05:03PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Gives up Early Gains on Trade Fight Worries,"Investing.com - A strong opening stock rally Thursday faded in the afternoon in part because of worries about the upcoming U.S.-China trade talks.

The concern was prompted when Michael Pillsbury, a prominent adviser to President Donald Trump, told the South China Morning Post that Trump would raise tariffs substantially on Chinese imports unless a trade agreement can be quickly negotiated.
Formal talks between the United States and China are supposed to resume in October.

The S&P 500 finished flat on the day. It had been up as much as 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrials were down 0.2% after rising as many as 125 points. The Nasdaq Composite ended up 0.7%; the index had been up as much as 0.7%.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) all pulled the Dow lower. Apple and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) were among the big reasons for the swoon in the Nasdaq, as well as the Nasdaq 100.
Boeing's decline may have been prompted by Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary's projection the airline won't resume flying the 737 Max until late February or early March.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) hit a 52-week high before falling back. The software giant announced late Wednesday it was boosting its dividend by 11% and planning to buy back up to $40 billion of its shares. Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $1.085 trillion, ahead of Apple's $1 trillion market cap.

Also weighing on stocks was uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve will cut rates again in 2019. The Fed cut its key federal funds rate to 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday to protect the 10-year-old economic expansion from trade stresses and economic slowing in Europe, China and elsewhere.
Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool suggests a 55% chance the Fed will do nothing in October, but will likely cut rates again at its December meeting. 
Perhaps as a result, interest rates were little changed Thursday. The 10-Year Treasury yield moved to 1.789% from Wednesday's 1.784%.
And stocks that often benefit from low rates did well, including home builder PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), Hovnanian Enterprises (NYSE:HOV) and paint company Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW).

Oil prices moved higher. West Texas Intermediate Crude was up 15 cents to $58.19 a barrel. Brent crude was up 89 cents to $64.40. 
Gold futures dropped back slightly to $1,506.20 an ounce in New York. 
Healthcare, utilities and real estate were the strongest sectors of the market. The weakest were industrials, financials and consumer discretionaries. US Steel fell 11% after issuing a profit warning, especially over business in Europe. 
FedEx (NYSE:FDX), crushed Wednesday, rebounded to a 1% gain.
Insurance giant Cigna (NYSE:CI), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) and medical-device maker   Align Technology   (NASDAQ:ALGN) were among the top S&P 500 performers. 
Hard-drive maker Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Olive Garden-parent Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI),   Noble Energy   (NYSE:NBL) and department store giant Macy’s (NYSE:M) were among the weakest S&P performers. "
1590,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 04:51PM ET</span>","Amazon vows to be carbon neutral by 2040, buying 100,000 electric vans","By David Shepardson and Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos on Thursday pledged to make the largest U.S. e-commerce company net carbon neutral by 2040 and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from a start-up, as employees and consumers around the world plan protests to address climate change.
Cutting emissions is a challenging goal for Amazon, which delivers 10 billion items a year and has a massive transportation and data center footprint. ""We know we can do it and we know we have to do it,"" Bezos said.
Bezos announced a number of actions at a press conference in Washington ahead of the upcoming Climate Week in New York, a global gathering of world and company leaders seeking ways to fight climate change. Global marches to push for climate action are planned for Friday.
Amazon is the first major corporation to announce such a goal by 2040, according to U.S. non-profit group Ceres, which works with companies on sustainability commitments.
""What Amazon has announced today is groundbreaking and potentially game-changing,"" said Sue Reid, vice president of climate and energy at Ceres. ""This will certainly have ripple effects because Amazon is so intertwined with the entire economy.""
Bezos said Amazon will meet the goals of the Paris climate accord 10 years ahead of the accord's schedule, and it will use 100% renewable energy by 2030, up from 40% today. The Trump administration said in June 2017 it was withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.
Environmental advocacy group Greenpeace USA welcomed the commitment, but a spokesman said the company still lags peers Google (O:GOOGL), Apple (O:AAPL) and Facebook (O:FB) in transparency around its renewable projects.
Amazon also pledged to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from U.S. vehicle design and manufacturing startup Rivian Automotive LLC.
Amazon and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) are among the investors in Rivian. Bezos said the first electric delivery vans for Amazon will be on the road by 2021, and all 100,000 will be deployed by 2024. A Rivian spokeswoman said 10,000 of the vehicles for Amazon will be on the road by late 2022.
The company said Amazon currently has 30,000 vehicles delivering customer orders in the United States. That excludes vans from  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) and the U.S. Postal Service, which are also carrying non-Amazon parcels.
Amazon will invest $100 million to restore forests and wetlands, said Bezos, adding the company will take a ""careful look"" at political campaign contributions it makes that could be going to politicians that deny climate science.
Amazon previously said it would order 20,000 delivery vans from  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn). Bezos did not put a total dollar figure on the efforts to decarbonize but said many of the initiatives would save money.
IMPACT OF FASTER DELIVERY
Moreover, the company's move to accelerate delivery to same-day or next-day has the counterintuitive effect of decreasing carbon emissions, Bezos said. ""Once you get to one day and same day, because you are eliminating the possibility of air transportation, you have to get those products closer to the customer,"" he said.
He vowed to try to convince other company CEOs to sign on to Amazon's plan, called The Climate Pledge.
Amazon workers who have pushed the company to take action on climate change called the plan a ""huge win"" but not enough. Amazon should halt support of the fossil-fuel industry and politicians that deny climate change, the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice group said in a tweet. They plan to join climate awareness marches on Friday.
Bezos said Amazon would continue to work with energy companies. ""To ask oil and energy companies to do this transition with bad tools is not a good idea and we won't do that,"" Bezos said.
A proposal that the company report how it plans to deal with climate change received 29.8% of votes at Amazon's shareholder meeting in May after garnering signatures from nearly 7,700 employees."

Earlier this month Mediaset's shareholders backed a plan to create a pan-European media group, dubbed MediaforEurope (MFE), merging its Italian and Spanish businesses under a new Dutch holding, fending off opposition from its second biggest shareholder Vivendi (PA:VIV).
But Vivendi, locked in a legal battle with the Italian broadcaster, could still scupper the deal should it decide to exercise its right to withdraw.
The corporate overhaul is conditional on no more than 180 million euros being spent to mop up the shares of investors who head for the door - well below the value of Vivendi's 29% stake.
Mediaset said in a statement that investment firm Peninsula holding would, at the broadcaster's request, buy up to 355 million shares of the new MFE entity at a discount price to the withdrawal price.
Two sources with knowledge of the matter said that Peninsula intervention could entirely absorb Vivendi's decision to exercise the withdrawal.
The French conglomerate, which has not made clear its intentions, has until Sept.21 to make up its mind on the withdrawal.
Vivendi declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eighteen months after officially burying the hatchet in one of America's most bitter proxy contests, Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) CEO David Taylor and billionaire investor Nelson Peltz proclaimed their mutual respect on Thursday, underscoring how activists and corporations can end up working collaboratively.
Sitting next to each other on a hotel stage in New York at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference, the men brushed away the acrimony of two years ago when Peltz' Trian Partners was battling P&G over its strategy and asking for a board seat.
""That was the fog of war,"" Peltz said, dismissing the rough comments P&G had made about the veteran activist who works to present himself as a partner who can offer constructive advice rather than a corporate raider intent on breaking up companies.
After an incredibly close proxy contest, which could have dragged on for months, Taylor invited Peltz to join the board, which he did in early 2018.
Since then, the men say the have communicated a lot as the company took Trian's white paper to heart and hired consulting firm McKinsey for additional input on how the consumer products company, whose brands include Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, can move more quickly and nimbly.
""I found that the most important ingredient a CEO needs to have is to be a good listener,"" Peltz said, adding: ""Nobody has a monopoly on good ideas. We have an attitude at Trian, we steal any good idea. We’d rather be rich than right.""
The partnership is clearly paying off for all shareholders as P&G's share price has surged 50% since before Peltz joined the board and has gained 32% in 2019 alone.
""I don't have to be right. I have to get the right thing done,"" Taylor said.
Peltz joked that he had promised to shave his beard when P&G hit a price of $120 per share and he made good on that Wednesday when he cut it off, with P&G razors, of course.
As the men bantered, their once bitter fight brought home some parallels to a contest taking shape between AT&T (N:T) and Elliott Management.
Investors in the audience, including powerful pension funds from Massachusetts and Florida, got a glimpse at how activists and companies can work together, as AT&T undertakes a review of suggestions for a corporate overhaul from Elliott.
Elliott has urged AT&T to divest some units, save $5 billion in costs, stop acquiring more companies and review its leadership. While the hedge fund has a number of potential board candidates, it has not disclosed their names and said privately it has no specific number of directors in mind.
Recent academic research has pointed to a growing appetite for settlements between activists and companies."

(Reuters) - Microsoft and healthcare companies lifted Wall Street on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates as expected and left the door open for further monetary easing.
Microsoft (O:MSFT) rose 1.9% after unveiling a $40 billion stock buyback plan, and its increase contributed more than any other company to the S&P 500's gain.
The S&P 500 was less than 1% below its record high close from July as markets also became more optimistic about talks between U.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators aimed at laying the groundwork for high-level negotiations in early October.
A recent easing in trade tensions has helped the three main indexes recover from losses from August.
""There has been slightly more constructiveness lately, but if there is any sort of agreement, it will be a very light, mini-deal, because the U.S. and China are still very far apart on the main issues,"" warned Ben Phillips, Chief Investment Officer at EventShares.
The S&P 500 healthcare index (SPXHC) climbed 0.7% after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a proposal on drug pricing policy.
The plan is a ""big negative"" for drugmakers and the stock reaction has already been priced in to some degree, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments.
Of 11 sector indexes, healthcare is the worst performer in 2019, with a gain of 6%.
On Wednesday, the Fed announced a quarter percentage point cut in interest rates for the second time this year and said future reductions would be ""largely data-dependent.""
Traders see a nearly 50% chance for another 25 basis point rate cut in October, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
""The market just continues to believe the Fed is going to be accommodative,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
The Fed injected another $75 billion into the U.S. banking system on Wednesday, restoring a measure of order after the central bank's benchmark interest rate rose above its targeted range for the first time since the financial crisis.
At 2:56 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 0.04% at 27,137.17 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.14% to 3,010.94.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.19% to 8,193.29.
With the S&P 500 approaching a record high, the benchmark index is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, up from about 15 at the end of last year, according to Refinitiv's Datastream.
""Corporate earnings continue to expand, albeit at a slower pace, and we expect that to continue into 2020,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""We view valuations as high, but not extreme at this point. It's not something that's causing us to wring our hands.""
Shares of retailer  Target  Corp (N:TGT) rose 0.8% after it announced a $5 billion share buyback plan.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

(Reuters) - Drugmaker Insys Therapeutics Inc on Thursday won court approval to sell its flagship fentanyl spray to a buyer who agreed to only market the drug for use by cancer patients, in response to concerns about the product's role in fueling the opioid epidemic.
The decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross in Wilmington, Delaware, marked the first time a bankruptcy court approved the sale of an opioid amid an epidemic that has been blamed for nearly 400,000 overdose deaths between 1999 and 2017.
The ruling cleared the way for the drug, Subsys, to be sold to Wyoming-based BTcP Pharma LLC, which belongs to the MMB Healthcare network of pharmaceutical companies. In exchange, Insys will receive royalties it estimated could reach $20 million. That will raise money to satisfy creditors.
""Obviously all were concerned with the purchaser of the product,"" Gross said. ""There is a crisis in this country and we're all still trying to get a handle on it.""
The question of how to deal with a bankrupt drugmaker's opioid could ultimately emerge in the case of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, which filed for bankruptcy on Sunday in an effort to resolve more than more than 2,600 lawsuits alleging it helped fueled the opioid epidemic.
Six state attorneys general initially objected to the sale of Subsys, saying they were concerned it could perpetuate conduct Insys engaged in before filing for bankruptcy when the company was accused of paying doctors kickbacks to prescribe the drug.
Subsys contains fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved it to treat pain in cancer patients.
The states said Insys' conduct resulted in the addictive drug being prescribed to a wide array of patients who did not have cancer.
The states withdrew those objections after BTcP's owner, Michael Burke, committed to restrictions on the marketing and distribution of Subsys to ensure it is only prescribed for cancer patients.
Insys filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June shortly after striking a $225 million settlement with the U.S. Justice Department resolving claims it bribed doctors to prescribe Subsys to patient who often did not have cancer.
Several former executives and employees of Insys have faced criminal charges, including John Kapoor, Insys' wealthy founder and former chairman, who with four other former executives was convicted of racketeering conspiracy in May.

Kapoor has denied wrongdoing and is expected to appeal.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 01:41PM ET</span>",Tech investors: No broad lessons seen in WeWork valuation drama,"By Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two top technology investors cautioned against drawing broadconclusions about the valuation of private companies from questions swirling around U.S. office-sharing startup WeWork.
Scott Kupor, managing partner of $10 billion venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference that it would be “dangerous” to generalize from the WeWork situation as it stems from the confluence of multiple factors.
These include governance issues, being a ""late cycle, cash-consuming"" company, and the tension between traditional real estate valuation methods and the more forward-looking ones favored by some in Silicon Valley, he said.
""That's what the public market investor is struggling with in these hybrid companies,"" Kupor said. ""How much of the business looks like a hardware or other business and how much does it truly have margins and moats that look like a technology company?""
Andreessen Horowitz is not a WeWork investor.
WeWork owner The We Company postponed its initial public offering this month following a barrage of questions surrounding its valuation. Reuters reported last week that The We Company was considering seeking a valuation in its IPO of between $10 billion and $12 billion, a steep discount from the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January.
Glen Kacher, chief investment officer of $2 billion Light Street Capital Management LLC, said no one should be surprised by rapidly changing valuations for private companies such as WeWork, given how common large price swings are in public markets.
“That’s the market,” Kacher said, speaking alongside Kupor at the annual New York City event. “I don’t think it’s a big deal.”
Kacher contrasted WeWork with  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), one of Light Street’s investments.
He said Uber’s ""SaaS,"" or software as a service, creates significant value because its cars and drivers can be used by many customers every day, whereas a set of WeWork's rented desks can only be used by one client at a time.
“That’s where technology is marrying up with these fixed assets to create services ... that's a very unique economic solution (for Uber),” he said. “As opposed to WeWork, which is just carving a floor up into very tiny little spaces. That’s their technology.”
Kacher said he continues to find SoftBank Group (T:9984) an “interesting” investment opportunity, in part because Uber represents a bigger part of its portfolio than WeWork.
Earlier, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission head Jay Clayton, in an on-stage interview at the conference, would not comment on WeWork's IPO directly.
He did say, however, that it ""doesn't surprise"" him that there would be differing valuations in public and private markets for the same type of company.
""The price discovery mechanism is completely different,"" Clayton said. "
1600,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 01:25PM ET</span>","Huawei talks up own apps with Mate 30 challenge to Apple, Samsung","By Douglas Busvine
MUNICH (Reuters) - Huawei [HWT.UL] unveiled its new smartphones to challenge Apple's (O:AAPL) iPhone 11 on Thursday, talking up slick design and best-in-class features while playing down concerns about the lack of access to Google's (O:GOOGL) popular apps.
At a glitzy launch in the German city of Munich, the Chinese firm said its new Mate 30 Pro and Mate 30 devices were more compact, their cameras more sensitive, and wraparound screens more vivid than those of the latest Apple iPhone.
Connectivity was 50% faster than market leader Samsung's (KS:005930) fifth-generation (5G) phones, chief salesman Richard Yu said.
It was Huawei's first launch of an all-new smartphone since U.S. President Donald Trump hit the world's No. 2 player in the market with a U.S. export ban in May.
Washington has effectively barred U.S. firms from supplying Huawei, alleging it is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy - something the Shenzhen-based company has repeatedly denied.
The result is the Mate 30 lacks access to a licensed version of U.S. Google's (O:GOOGL) Android operating system, as well as mobile services that include its Play Store and popular apps like Gmail, Youtube or Maps - all victims of the ban. 
Huawei pressed ahead with the launch regardless, betting that the Mate 30's design and hardware would still win fans.
""This is the best-performing smartphone in the world,"" Yu told a news briefing.
""Yes, we have some limitations on Google Mobile Services. But we have a huge advantage with the phone itself.""
The Mate 30 Pro's three-camera array is able to bring images to life in low light. Its on-board video camera has a fine definition of 40 megapixels and, in super-slow motion, a speed of 7,680 frames per second that is several times that of its nearest rival.
The 6.53-inch flex OLED screen wraps further round the body than earlier models, making it possible to fit a display larger than the one on the iPhone 11 Pro Max, onto a smaller device.
The Mate 30 will ship to Europe next month, and will be available in China from next week, said Yu. It will be priced from 799 euros ($884), the top-end Mate 30 Pro from 1,099 euros and the Mate 30 Pro 5G from 1,199 euros. 
Huawei also has a luxury Porsche Design model for 2,095 euros.
Samsung's Galaxy S10 5G retails at $1,299, and the iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999, but lacks 5G connectivity. 
OWN-BRANDED APPS
The build-up to the Huawei launch was overshadowed by uncertainty over whether buyers of the flagship Android device will be able to use apps supported by Google, a unit of Silicon Valley giant Alphabet.
Instead, the new devices will carry Huawei's own app gallery, while the company will spend $1 billion to promote the system around it. In another incentive to boost its appeal, Huawei is charging app partners a commission of 15% - half the cut taken by Apple and Google.
Mate 30 users will be able to download Facebook (O:FB), WhatsApp and Instagram from other app stores. But it would only be possible to access Youtube, Google's mobile video app, via a web browser, said Yu.
The phones will run on an 'open-source', or generic, version of the Android operating system - like Huawei's phones in its Chinese home market. That option means that some apps may not work properly or run smoothly, say experts.
Holding the launch in Europe underlines the importance of the 500 million consumers in the region, where Huawei lost five percentage points in market share since the U.S. ban, even as buyers rallied to its brand at home.
Without Google on board, however, analysts say Huawei may struggle to win over consumers.
""Even though this phone is filled with lovely features we don't think it will sell like past generations,"" said Annette Zimmermann of consulting firm Gartner.
""The average user will not accept that they do not have easy access to their favorite apps,"" added Zimmermann, who attended the event.
Huawei says the phone's 'brain' - the Kirin 990 chipset unveiled at a recent tech fair in Berlin - outperforms the Qualcomm-powered (O:QCOM) 5G rivals already on the market from Samsung.
In particular, the 'big core-tiny core' configuration of the hardware means it can run power-hungry applications like artificial intelligence or support online gaming, while saving battery on routine tasks.

""Huawei has Apple soundly beaten when it comes to form factor design but even these beautiful-looking devices are going to struggle to see any volume without the Google ecosystem,"" analyst Richard Windsor said in a note ahead of the launch.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>","The wrong stuff? Chuck Yeager, pilot who broke sound barrier, sues Airbus","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Chuck Yeager, the retired U.S. Air Force pilot who broke the sound barrier, has sued Airbus SE, accusing the aerospace company of using his name and likeness without permission to promote a new high-speed helicopter.
In a complaint filed on Wednesday that refers to him as ""one of the most, if not the most, famous pilots of all time,"" the 96-year-old Yeager objected to a June 2017 piece on Airbus' website about making the Airbus Racer a fast and cost-effective way to fly.
The piece quoted Guillaume Faury, now Airbus' chief executive officer and at the time Airbus Helicopters' CEO, as saying: ""Seventy years ago, Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier,"" and Airbus was now ""trying to break the cost barrier. It cannot be 'speed at any cost.'""
Yeager accused Airbus of trademark infringement and taking away his right of publicity through ""fraudulent"" conduct, in which it deceived the public into believing he endorsed it.
""This is not a company that sells burritos,"" Yeager's lawyer, Lincoln Bandlow, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. ""It sells aircraft, and you can't find a man more valuable to associate with aircraft than Chuck Yeager.""
Airbus spokesmen said the company, which is headquartered in Toulouse, France, had no comment on pending litigation.
Yeager is seeking unspecified compensatory, punitive and reputational damages, as well as restitution, in a lawsuit filed in the federal court in Santa Ana, California.
He has filed similar lawsuits against other defendants in the past.
Yeager became the first person to break the speed of sound, known as Mach 1, piloting his rocket engine-powered Bell X-1 over southern California on Oct. 14, 1947.
He became familiar to a younger generation 36 years later when the actor Sam Shepard portrayed him in the movie, ""The Right Stuff,"" based on the Tom Wolfe book.
Yeager said the website piece was not Airbus's first use of his name and likeness without permission, saying it previously used an unauthorized video of his 2008 visit to the company.
He said Airbus Helicopters had asked for permission to use his name in press releases, but rejected his demand for more than $1 million and veto power over how it was used.
""There were some negotiations but they fell through, and litigation was unfortunately the next course,"" Bandlow said.

(Reuters) - Home rental giant Airbnb said it plans to list its shares in 2020, making it one of the most high-profile names to tap the stock market next year. (https:// 
In a short statement posted on its website on Thursday, Airbnb did not give any details on how it plans to list its shares, although it is widely expected to take a direct-listing route.
A direct listing to go public is a process in which no new shares are created and helps companies save millions of dollars in underwriting fees.
This year has marked the stock market debuts of several high-profile companies, including Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), but their shares have fared poorly after the launch, amid investor skepticism over their path to profitability.
WeWork owner The We Company has also delayed its initial public offering, walking away from preparations to launch it this month after a lackluster response from investors.
Market experts though have said Airbnb might receive a warmer reception from investors when it debuts, considering that its financials looked more stable than recent internet unicorns that have gone public.
""I think it'll be a whole different reception for Airbnb, assuming that they can show they're a profitable business without having to lose money on marketing,"" said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs. 
Airbnb has not given any details on whether it was profitable in the second quarter of 2019 but has previously said that its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization were positive for 2017 and 2018.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) and PSA Group (PA:PEUP) face a potential stand-off with French workers worried that an industry drive to meet EU emissions targets will fuel demands for concessions in upcoming labor negotiations. 
Renault and  Peugeot  maker PSA are seeking to renew three-year, nationwide pacts covering wages and other working conditions in the coming months, which in the past have allowed them to trim costs. 
Informal labor talks between Renault and workers began in early September, unions said, and are set to kick off at PSA next week. 
While negotiations have been fraught before, and involve balancing demands like pay freezes and pledges to produce or invest in France, unions are already bristling over fears for jobs in motor factories amid a shift toward electric cars. 
No clear outlines on potential job or wage demands have been put forward yet. PSA's summons for discussions referred to the ""energy transition"" as a high priority. 
Renault said it did not want to comment on discussions that were just starting. PSA said it was hoping for constructive talks that took into account ""the stakes for the group"", without giving further details. 
A majority of French auto unions backed previous accords in 2013 and 2016, in deals that came after the euro zone debt crisis and austerity measures had hit consumer demand. 
""And now? PSA is making a lot of money, and the new (CO2) regulations are coming in at just the right time so they can tell us that they need to keep improving the group's performance,"" said Franck Don of the PSA faction at the CFTC union. 
Carbon dioxide emissions must be cut to 95 grams per kilometer for 95% of cars by the end of 2020 under the new EU rules, from the current 120.5g average. 
The green overhaul is raising concerns over profits in a sector already facing faltering sales, with cleaner auto models still far pricier to build than traditional ones and the extent of consumer demand for these vehicles unclear.
European car registrations fell 8.6% in August, data this week showed, although an exceptional surge last year distorted comparisons.
At a PSA factory in Metz, northeastern France, employees are concerned plans to produce electrified gearboxes there may not make up for cutbacks to traditional ones. 
""It's the tip of the iceberg ... the labor map in France is being redrawn,"" said Maria Casoli of main PSA union, Force Ouvriere. 

France's hard-left CGT union was the only one to veto previous pacts, allowing the carmakers to pursue their planned competitiveness measures.

The action at its restaurants across Britain will save an estimated 320 tonnes of single use plastic every year, the fast food giant said.
Larger rival McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) announced on Wednesday that some of its restaurants in Britain and Ireland would allow customers to swap toys in happy meals for a fruit bag from next month and that it planned to introduce books as an option from early next year.
Burger King said it had been galvanized by Southampton sisters Ella and Caitlin McEwan's Change.org petition https://www.change.org/p/burger-king-mcd-s-save-the-environment-stop-giving-plastic-toys-with-fast-food-kids-meals calling on Burger King and McDonald's to stop giving plastic toys with their kids' meals for the sake of the environment.
The chief executive of Burger King UK, Alasdair Murdoch, said the plastic toy initiative was one strand of a wider strategy to reduce packaging.
""What we are really focused on is removing single-use plastics, and that's why we've done that with the toys,"" Murdoch said.
Burger King, a unit of Canada's Restaurant Brands International (TO:QSR), said on Thursday it was also installing amnesty bins at its UK stores that would accept donations of plastic toys that are given away free by either competitors, magazines or in cereal boxes.
These items would then be given a ""new purpose"" and transformed into play areas for selected stores and special trays encouraging play across restaurants.
McDonald's sells 3.2 million happy meals per day, data from research firm Sense360 showed, and comes as the world's largest restaurant chain rolls out paper straws, removes plastic lids on its McFlurry drinks and eliminates single-use plastic from its salads. (https://"

BONN (Reuters) - A British investment banker at the center of Germany's biggest fraud trial told judges on Thursday he earned millions of euros from deals involving ""astronomical"" trades that prosecutors say were a means to make bogus tax reclaims.
Martin Shields, a former investment banker, said the trading, known as cum ex, thrived between 2005 and 2012, as investors from around the globe made multi-billion-euro trades on German companies. That allowed them generate multiple tax reclaims.
The trial where Shields is giving detailed evidence is the first in a wider investigation aimed at recovering billions from banks which prosecutors believe profited from the trades.
Prosecutors allege that players in the cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit. Germany estimates such trades cost it more than 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in total.
""The number of trades going through the market was astronomical,"" Shields told the court, adding that he had earned 12 million euros from the trades that are now at the center of the criminal trial in Bonn.
""Trades regularly exceeded 100% of the (company's) market capitalization,"" said the 41-year-old engineering graduate, as he told the court of the circular trades, one version of which was known among traders by the synonym ""Guts Spread"".
German state prosecutor Anne Brorhilker this month outlined criminal charges against Shields and fellow British banker Nicholas Diable, who she said organized a network of traders and lenders to make double tax reclaims with sham share trades.
Brorhilker said the two men, who face a possible jail term and a state order to repay profits they made, had targeted companies including carmaker BMW and airline Lufthansa.
Brorhilker has outlined more than 30 instances of double-tax reclaims totaling 447 million euros. Shields' 12 million euros of earnings relate to those deals.
The alleged scheme involved trading shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to give the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.
Shields used the metaphor of receiving ""presents and cake"" in describing how the trade worked, although he said he refused to get involved in more ambitious such schemes that amounted to ""looping"" shares to create a ""(tax) voucher printing"" machine.
Shields said the trades involved were so vast that it caused financial market mishaps because it was often not possible to find and match buyers and sellers in time.
He said those manifested themselves in difficulties at Deutsche Boerse's share trade settlement arm Clearstream.
A spokesman for Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), which was raided in connection with the wider investigation, said it was cooperating with the authorities.
Shields' testimony is a critical building block in pursuing others potentially involved.
The case, Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation, is being closely followed in London and Frankfurt, where much of the trading was organized, according to bankers and court documents.
Diable is expected to address the court next week. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012 to prevent cum-ex trades but it been criticized for failing to shut it down faster."

1618,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 09:42AM ET</span>",Fed Injects Cash for Third Day as Calm Returns to Funding Market,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve added a third dose of liquidity to a vital corner of the funding markets Thursday, helping rates retreat further as investors warn that fresh bouts of stress remain possible in the weeks ahead.
The New York Fed injected another $75 billion Thursday through an overnight repo operation. That followed a dose of the same size on Wednesday and $53.2 billion on Tuesday. The operations, commonplace in pre-financial crisis times, temporarily add cash, with the Fed taking government securities as collateral.
The latest addition of liquidity -- with the Fed making clear it’s ready to do more as needed -- follows the Federal Open Market Committee’s move Wednesday to reduce the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER, by more than their main interest rate -- all attempts to quell money-market stresses.
The operations have calmed the funding market, with repo rates declining to more normal levels after jumping to 10% Tuesday, four times where it was last week. Overnight general collateral repurchase agreement rates continued to retreat Thursday, trading around 2%, according to ICAP (LON:NXGN). Still, most investors say more Fed action is needed for a permanent fix, with gauges of dollar funding costs measured through the current swaps market showing pressures building again given disappointment over the steps the central bank took.
The effective fed funds rate was set at 2.25% as of Wednesday. It was at 2.30% Tuesday, above the top of the Fed’s target range of 2% to 2.25% before policy makers lowered their benchmark rate on Wednesday.
“We expect these episodes of funding stresses to become more frequent with demand for funding and U.S. Treasury supply forecast to increase heading into year-end and the Fed’s reserve levels likely to drop further,” Jerome Schneider, head of short-term bond portfolios at Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote in a note Wednesday with his colleagues.
Given the added supply, banks’ holdings of Treasuries have risen and are increasingly being financed by money market funds investing in repo, which leaves “U.S. funding markets more fragile,” Schneider wrote. He said this adds to other reasons why the Fed needs to do more to engineer a long-term fix.
After policy makers wrapped up a two-day meeting Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will keep doing these repo operations if that’s what it takes to get markets back on track. He spoke hours after the effective fed funds rate busted through the central bank’s cap, evidence Powell and his colleagues were losing their grip on one of their most important levers for controlling the financial system.
Powell also said the Fed would provide a sufficient supply of bank reserves so that frequent operations like the ones they’ve done this week aren’t required.
The only way “to permanently alleviate the funding stress is to rebuild the buffer of reserves in the system,“ according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Matthew Hornbach.
Relying on repo operations doesn’t resolve the issue of reserves declining as the Treasury rebuilds balances, Hornbach wrote in a note. Having regular operations will also increase market uncertainty as the Fed could halt purchases at any time, while the size of its buying will have to expand over time as reserves drop, he said.
“It is certainly possible that we’ll need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet sooner than we thought,” Powell said, referring to the central bank potentially buying securities again to permanently increase reserves and ensure liquidity in the banking sector.
Many strategists had predicted the Fed would take even more aggressive measures to reduce the pressures. One idea that’s gotten a fair amount of attention is something called a standing fixed-rate repo facility -- a permanent way to ease funding pressures, as opposed to the ad-hoc operations the Fed has used this week. Many analysts even predicted a Wednesday announcement that the Fed would start expanding its balance sheet.
That didn’t happen. However, with the Fed apparently ready to keep injecting liquidity whenever it’s needed, “it’s enough for now,” said Jon Hill of BMO Capital Markets.
“This week’s dramatic moves in the short-term funding markets serve as a case in point for the need to carefully consider liquidity in the financial system,” Rick Rieder, global chief investment officer of fixed income at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., wrote in a note.
“All of this funding market gyration points to the increasingly obvious fact that the end of Fed reserve draining is insufficient to stabilize these markets,” he said."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair's (I:RYA) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary narrowly secured approval from shareholders on Thursday for a bonus scheme that could earn him 100 million euros over five years as he revealed up to 700 pilots could lose their jobs.
The Irish low-cost carrier, Europe's largest, has been battered by industrial disputes and the grounding of Boeing's flagship 737 MAX.
Having suffered from a shortage of pilots just a couple of years ago, O'Leary told investors there are now too many. He forecast the company would cut between 500 and 700 pilots as a sharp decrease in demand has seen the natural attrition rate collapse.
To earn his 100 million euro bonus, O'Leary would need to reverse a near-50% fall in the company's share price since 2017. The share price hit a peak of 19.39 euros in August 2017 but was down 1.8 percent at 9.76 euros at 1330 GMT on Thursday.
O'Leary secured the backing of 50.5% of shareholders for the scheme which will grant him 10 million share options if he doubles Ryanair's profitability to 2 billion euros per annum and/or increase the share price to 21 euros per share. 
The size of the award ""raises a red flag in terms of quantum and for our members,"" said Jocelyn Brown of the UK Railway pension scheme, which voted against the deal. 
O'Leary said he was disappointed by the level of support and said he would take on investor concerns. 
""I think most shareholders would take the view that if he doubles the share price, we don't care what you pay him for the next five years,"" he added. 
TURNAROUND
O'Leary pitched to investors his plans to turn around the airline, whose biggest challenges are industrial relations disputes and the grounding of the 737 MAX after Ryanair ordered 135 jets with options on 75 more. 
He said Ryanair will continue to challenge unions, whose strikes had been ""complete failures"" and the MAX delays would force capacity cutbacks for next summer.
Bases in the United Kingdom and Ireland are likely to suffer cuts, with 10-20 redundancies from 400 pilots at the airline's home base in Dublin. The firm has about 17,000 employees across Europe.
""We are looking at voluntary (redundancies), but ultimately we will move from voluntary to compulsory very quickly,"" he said, adding that pilots had already been offered 12-month unpaid leave. 
UNION ANGER
As O'Leary spoke the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) accused management of threatening pilots who take part in strike action ""with the removal of staff travel benefits and inflated and draconian deductions from salary."" 
The International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations said Ryanair pilot representatives were ""being singled out for threatening and intimidating behavior"" and that Irish company council representatives were being sued by Ryanair. 
Ryanair, which recognized trade unions for the first time two years ago, denied any union members were being targeted in any way for their union activities. 
""It is illegal to blacklist someone for being involved"" in trade unions, he said. ""It has never happened, but we have been accused of it for around 30 years now.""

The rate on overnight general collateral repurchase agreements, or repos, first traded at 2.25% early Thursday before dropping to 1.98%, according to ICAP (LON:NXGN). On Tuesday, it jumped to 10%, about four times greater than last week’s levels, as cash reserves in the banking system remained out of balance with the volume of securities on dealer balance sheets.
The New York Fed will offer up to $75 billion in a so-called overnight repurchase agreement operation, adding temporary liquidity to restore order in the banking system. It made the same offer Tuesday and Wednesday, deploying a tool it hadn’t used in a decade. This latest action follows the Fed’s reduction in the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER, another attempt to quell money-market stresses.
“The fact that the Fed once again pre-announced a $75 billion overnight RP for this morning should help market conditions continue to normalize today,” Wrightson ICAP economist Lou Crandall says in a note. “Though we are no more sure than anyone else what the new ‘normal’ will look like on the far side of this week’s turmoil.”
The Secured Overnight Financing Rate fell to 2.55% as of Sept. 18, according to NY Fed data, dropping from a record 5.25%.
The effective fed funds rate was set at 2.30% as of Tuesday, above the top of the Federal Reserve’s target range of 2% to 2.25%. The New York Fed will release Wednesday’s rate at 9 a.m. The overnight rates should reflect the central bank’s latest interest rate decision on Friday."

Last week, the LSE rebuffed a proposed $39 billion takeover bid from rival Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, which vowed to press on with its proposal by speaking directly to the London bourse's shareholders.
Thomson Reuters, a professional information company that is the parent of Reuters News, holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv.
Schwimmer said two big drivers of change going forward are the increasing importance of data and multi-asset class investment strategies.
""We think that the Refinitiv transaction is a very strong fit strategically from that perspective, and really positions the London Stock Exchange Group very well to take advantage of growth in these areas,"" Schwimmer told a conference held by derivatives industry body ISDA.
""I don't think there is a lot of controversy around the increasing importance and focus on data.""
Refinitiv brings content and distribution on a global basis that would be transformational for the LSE, raising recurring revenues and lowering exposure to volatile market transaction volumes, Schwimmer said.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Ryanair expects to be flying Boeing 737 MAX by February-March 2020,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair thinks February or the start of March is the most realistic timetable for it to start flying the grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, CEO Michael O'Leary said on Thursday. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs to approve proposed software and training changes by Boeing (N:BA) for the best-selling plane that has been grounded since March in the aftermath of two fatal crashes in five months.
Major U.S. airlines have canceled flights of the MAX into December, while Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has canceled flights into early January.
Ryanair, which is one of the biggest customers for the MAX with 135 firm aircraft orders and 75 options, thinks January is a best-case but unlikely scenario.
After the FAA has finished its review, the plane will need approval by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the MAX200 model flown by Ryanair will require additional approvals.
""The best outlook is the first aircraft would come in January. The more realistic outcome: the end of February/March,"" O'Leary told journalists after the airline's annual general meeting. 
""If it flies in North America this side of Christmas, I think we are pretty secure we will be back flying some time (around) end-February/March,"" he said.
O'Leary said the current delivery timetable depends on Boeing getting approval for service in the United States toward the end of November ""we believe we are about two months behind that,"" he said. 
O'Leary said he ""would hope"" to see the FAA and EASA certify the aircraft together, but that was not certain. 
""I think they (the FAA and EASA) are largely on the same page but they don't agree on everything,"" O'Leary said. ""It is clear that at the moment most of Boeing's time and effort is focused on addressing the FAA first, because until the FAA certifies it, it is not an issue for EASA."" 
Ryanair has already cut the number of MAX planes it will fly in the summer of 2020 to 30 from 60 and further delays could lead to further cuts, he said. 
But he added that Ryanair was in a good position to retrain pilots on any systems updates as it has two MAX simulators. 
If the MAX was never certified, it would be ""devastating"" for the industry due to order backlogs at the major aircraft manufacturers, he said. 

""What's our Plan B? We don't have a Plan B,"" O'Leary said.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 06:22AM ET</span>",Biotech is going to the dogs - and big profits await,"By Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) - For Jessica Lescault there is no question that her 6-year old English bulldog ""Moose"" deserves cutting-edge biotechnology cancer treatment as much as any human patient.
""Pets are your loved ones, pets should be your family, pets are not something you keep on a chain in the backyard,"" the intensive-care nurse from Somers, Connecticut, said.
Lescault, 43, who enrolled Moose in a clinical trial of an experimental drug designed to help his immune system fight his cancer, represents the type of pet lover that has spurred animal health companies around the globe to invest in developing complex new treatments previously reserved for humans.
Biotechnology, which produces medicines from living cells, revolutionized the drug industry more than a quarter century ago with breakthrough medicines at prices that now run as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
In recent years, the cost of genetic testing and biotech drug production has fallen sharply, making biotechnology for pets financially viable at much lower prices, industry experts said. For a FACTBOX, click
Sector leader Zoetis (N:ZTS) and others say animal drug development is faster, less expensive and more predictable than drugs for people.
""It's not nearly as common for pivotal studies to fail in animal health as it is in human medicine. Most of them are successful,"" said Cheryl London, professor in comparative oncology at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in Massachusetts.
Biotech drugs for pets, if proven safe and effective, would be a boon to a $44 billion veterinary medicines market currently dominated by vaccines, flea and tick repellents and anti-infectives.
A recent product launch has galvanized the industry.
Cytopoint for canine itch relief sold by Zoetis reached blockbuster status by animal health standards in its second year on the market. Launched in late 2016, Cytopoint generated 2018 sales of $129 million, and first-quarter 2019 sales jumped 65% from a year earlier.
Produced from cloned genetically engineered hamster cells over at least eight bio-processing steps, the monoclonal antibody is no less complex than comparable therapeutic proteins used in human medicine. But the cost to consumers is far less.
Like many biotech drugs, dose and cost is determined by weight. Zoetis declined to disclose its prices. But an animal hospital in Stamford, Connecticut, for example, charges $104 for a 40-pound (18 kg) dog. For much smaller dogs, a Cytopoint injection, which lasts about four to eight weeks, costs about $35 to $50. To keep a large dog from scratching itself raw could run $140 per shot.
The cost of a highly effective new anti-itch biotech drug to treat severe atopic dermatitis in humans can run about $30,000 a year.
'TURNING POINT'
""Cytopoint was a turning point that has made it clear that (biotech drugs) can be successful in this space,"" London said. ""Now there are an estimated five to ten companies developing antibodies for the veterinary market.""
That has created increased business for related services.
""It's a big challenge for us to keep up with the pace of demand growth,"" said Klaus Hellmann, managing director at Munich-based Klifovet AG, Europe's largest contractor for late-stage clinical trials of veterinary drugs.
While Cytopoint sparked investment interest in biotech treatments for animals, drug development still comes with inherent risks and uncertainty.
Aratana Therapeutics Inc's canine lymphoma drug, Blontress, was launched in 2015, but later withdrawn after scientific data led the company to determine it was unlikely to be a financial success.
Declining costs has mitigated some of the risk.
""Over the past several years, human health has been able to advance the technology to improve efficiency of their cell production systems,"" said Rob Polzer, head of global therapeutics research for Zoetis.
Zoetis can repurpose and optimize existing procedures, mechanisms of action and technologies, it said.
The company is seeking approval for a biotech medicine to treat osteoarthritic pain in cats, with plans for a 2021 market launch and a similar product for dogs thereafter.
Others have jumped on the bandwagon.
German start-up Adivo was spun out of biotech firm  Morphosys  (DE:MORG) in March 2018 out of frustration by its founders that scientific advances for humans were not translating into better treatment options for their dogs.
It has since struck a global collaboration deal with Bayer's (DE:BAYGn) animal health unit for its early-stage research platform for animal-specific monoclonal antibodies - the backbone of biotechnology.
""Over the last few years, the veterinary market has seen an incredibly dynamic development,"" said Adivo co-founder Kathrin Ladetzki-Baehs.
This could prove a lifesaver for Moose, the bulldog in the oncology drug trial.
In early August, Lescault discovered a mass on Moose's throat, soon followed by deteriorating health and a diagnosis of canine B-cell lymphoma. Moose was given one to two months to live without treatment or about a year with 25 weeks of punishing chemotherapy.
Lescault's local vet suggested the Tufts trial testing an experimental protein that could help advance the current immuno-oncology craze into the animal health arena.
Tufts declined to disclose the compound or the study's sponsor. But more than three weeks into the trial, Moose's cough and labored breathing has disappeared and he is back to his playful and boisterous self, Lescault said.
While treatment in a clinical trial is free, Lescault said she would not hesitate to pay thousands of dollars for a safe and effective drug to save Moose. ""I wouldn't blink an eye,"" she said.
That is exactly what drug companies are banking on."
1629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 05:37AM ET</span>",Apple’s Brand in China Takes a Hit From Backlash Against Trump,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade war is taking its toll on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., a new survey of Chinese consumer attitudes shows.
The company tumbled to No. 24 in an annual report on China’s top brands, falling from No. 11 a year ago. In 2017, before the trade war started, Apple was fifth in this ranking. Meanwhile, Apple’s biggest local rival, Huawei Technologies Co., climbed two spots and came in second, behind only Chinese payment service Alipay.
The shuffle in the rankings is a sign of the growing challenge American brands face in the second year of Donald Trump’s tariff showdown with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The survey findings show Chinese consumers growing cooler towards some American brands, especially after smartphone giant Huawei saw its Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, arrested in Canada last year at the behest of the U.S. government.
Trump followed with a ban on Huawei products, which helped fuel a surge of local support for the Shenzhen-based brand, according to Jay Milliken, senior partner in Hong Kong with Prophet, the San Francisco-based consultancy that conducted the survey of 13,500 Chinese consumers.
Prophet’s survey, conducted annually, this year asked Chinese consumers in large cities for their views on more than 250 brands across 27 categories. Respondents evaluated brands they used or were considering using, rating rated their relevance to the lives of consumers based on qualities such as innovation, usefulness and dependability.
‘Nationalistic Buying’
“There’s a lot of nationalistic buying in that category, because Chinese consumers interpreted what happened to Huawei as an attack,” he said.
Patriotism helped fuel the rise of other Chinese brands, too. Sportswear maker Li Ning Co. cracked the top 40 for the first time, ranked No. 34, just two spots behind market leader  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE).
Named after its founder, the famous gymnast, Li Ning capitalized on the nationalistic sentiments of many Chinese consumers with the launch last year of a China Li-Ning collection at New York Fashion Week that heavily used red and yellow, China’s national colors.
There were only two American names in the top ten this year -- Android at No. 3 and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at No. 9 -- compared to five in the 2017 survey.
Switching Allegiances
Unlike Apple, Android and Intel don’t have to worry about consumers switching allegiances to local competitors, Milliken said, and that explains why they manage to remain highly ranked.
“Some Western brands are so integral in the lives of Chinese consumers, they’re almost predisposed to not losing relevance,” he said. “There are no Chinese alternatives so those remain super relevant.”
Geopolitical tensions aren’t the only problem Apple faces in China, its biggest market after the U.S.
While Beijing is pushing to make the country a leader in the introduction of high-speed 5G networks, Apple’s phones -- even the newly announced iPhone 11 -- don’t support that latest wireless standard."
1630,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",Fire and hail push insurers to rethink climate change risks,"By Lena Masri
LONDON (Reuters) - By the time David Kaisel got back from selling his flour at a farmers' market, a wildfire in California's Capay Valley had burned both his tractor and the shipping container where he kept some tools. His insurer is set to pay out a sixth of his losses.
He is now considering widening his coverage in the future to include fire insurance for his business.
Kaisel is the kind of customer making insurers rethink their approach to climate change so they can sell policies without incurring too much risk.
""I’m already accustomed to drought, but in the past year I learned first-hand the consequences of both record rainfall and wildfire,"" Kaisel said. ""I’ll certainly consider insuring against environmental risks when my cash flow permits."" 
How much that should cost him is something insurers are getting to grips with after years in which their main natural catastrophe focus was hurricanes and earthquakes -- and global warming was mainly a concern for the future rather than the present.
Other natural disasters such as wildfires, flash floods and hail have become increasingly costly for the industry, even though they were traditionally seen as lesser risks and classed by some insurers as ""secondary perils"".
From 2010 to 2018, average insured losses from secondary perils were almost double those from primary perils such as earthquakes and hurricanes, a Reuters analysis of  Swiss Re  data showed.
While scientists are wary of attributing particular disasters to climate change, most agree it is making extreme weather more frequent or intense. Insurers, along with Kaisel and other farmers around the world, are at the sharp end.
""A lot of the secondary perils are very localized, very short-term,"" said Thierry Corti, who heads climate change strategy for Swiss Re (S:SRENH), which insures insurers. ""So we really need to understand them on a case-by-case basis and it's often very hard to generalize.""
In interviews, more than a dozen companies -- including insurers, insurance associations, brokers and risk management firms -- said these smaller disasters could be very costly.
Some did not share specifics about how they were dealing with them but many did: several described details that had not been publicized before.
HAZARD MAPS
In response to needs of insurers and other customers, U.S. tech company ClimaCell said it began offering a wildfire prediction product this year, which analyses temperature, humidity and wind in real time.
Allianz Re, the reinsurance arm of the German Allianz Group (DE:ALVG), started work on adding wildfires to an interactive hazard map at the end of last year after major wildfires in Portugal and California, Markus Stowasser, head of catastrophe research and development, said.
The new version of the map, which already includes floods, tornadoes, hail, earthquakes, tropical and extra-tropical storms, is due to be launched this year. It will let Allianz underwriters assess the risk of wildfire anywhere in the world, based on previous wildfires, climate conditions and vegetation.
Wildfires became a bigger focus for insurance companies after the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire in Canada, said Dave Fox, chief executive of Geospatial Insight, a company that helps insurance companies assess damage from a catastrophe by collecting images and data. The Fort McMurray fire forced the evacuation of around 90,000 residents in northern Alberta and cut Canadian oil output by roughly 1 million barrels a day.
This year,  Hiscox  (L:HSX) , an underwriter at Lloyd's of London, paid to license a risk model for wildfires in the United States and applied its own research, after suffering losses from California wildfires in 2018.
It will help Hiscox set premiums more accurately, said Shree Khare, head of catastrophe research, adding that it might have stopped insuring some clients in high-risk areas otherwise.
""Prior to this year we didn't really have a good modeling solution for U.S. wildfire,"" he said, adding that the industry wasn't paying much attention to wildfires before. ""I think it’s just the nature of insurance. We tend to worry about things after they happen.""
While wildfires could become a bigger issue in Europe, he was not completely convinced and said losses would have to be larger before Hiscox would do similar modeling work there.
RECORD LEVELS OF DESTRUCTION
The California Department of Insurance regulator said in August coverage was getting harder to find for communities prone to wildfire, with a 10 % increase in insurers refusing to renew policies last year in areas that were affected by fires in 2015 and 2017.
In May, the department said wildfire insurance losses from what it described as ""the most destructive wildfire month in California's history"" in November 2018 topped $12 billion.
Kaisel, who lost more than $15,000 in the Capay Valley fires, expects to get $2,500 from his insurer and managed to raise the rest via an online fundraiser.
He would like to insure future risks once his five-year-old business growing specialized grains and milling them into flour starts making a profit -- but the unpredictable impact of global warming means he is not sure exactly what the risks will be.
""For folks like me it's not some far off possibility, it's here and now,"" he said of climate change. ""It's happening.""
Swiss Re's research arm has published data going back to 1970 it said showed natural catastrophe losses from primary perils were being overtaken by those traditionally considered secondary. In August, it said the latter accounted for $13 billion of $15 billion in natural catastrophe insured losses in the first half of this year.
Graphic: Graphic on insured losses - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/INSURANCE-CLIMATECHANGE/0H001QX768FL/eikon.png
It included standalone events -- similar to the wildfire that forced the evacuation of 10,000 people in the Canary Islands last month and the tennis-ball-sized hail that caused damage in Munich in June. It also defined secondary perils as spinoffs from well-monitored primary perils, for example extra-heavy rainfall in Texas during Hurricane Harvey in 2017.
The data show total insured losses from natural catastrophes are up from less than $7 billion a year in the 1970s to between $29.3 billion and $143.4 billion a year from 2010 to 2018. In 2018, 62% of all natural catastrophe insurance claims came from secondary perils.
Swiss Re's German rival Munich Re, said perils tended to evolve over time, citing flash-flooding as one that had moved up insurers' agenda, but agreed a change of emphasis was needed.
In the past year, the reinsurer has focused more on drought as a driver of wildfire and has added a wildfire layer to one of its digital risk assessment tools, said Ernst Rauch, Munich Re's global head of climate and public sector business development. The new tool is available for California, Colorado, Arizona, British Columbia and Alberta and other regions will be added gradually over time.
Zurich (S:ZURN) Insurance said it plans to refine the way it models the risk of floods to distinguish between a house at high risk of flooding and another 10 meters away that is less at risk. Its current model works with distances of around 100 meters.
It is also hiring two people to work specifically on climate risks as part of the catastrophe research and development team.
London insurance platform Lloyd's, whose member firms recorded a loss of 1 billion pounds ($1.25 billion) last year driven by hurricanes, typhoons and wildfires, invited ClimaCell to join a ten-week innovation lab program, which started this month.
London-based insurer Beazley (L:BEZG), said it was involved in another innovation program run by Lloyd's and that it had already helped create new, specialized cover. But the process was not easy, Beazley said.
""These random events are very difficult to model and no one has done it before,"" said Beazley Chief Executive Andrew Horton. ""You only have to look at the Californian wildfires as an example.""
Robert Muir-Wood, chief research officer at catastrophe risk modeling company Risk Management Solutions, said insurers tend to do the risk modeling after suffering big losses.

""It can be hard to convince the insurance sector that they need to do some modeling of something which they haven’t yet seen the impact of,"" he said. ""Modeling is expensive, it's going to take up time.""

1631,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 05:18AM ET</span>","StockBeat: European Stocks Rise in Wake of Fed's ""Hawkish Cut""","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were mostly higher on Thursday, digesting a Federal Reserve policy meeting that suggested the U.S. central bank still isn’t too concerned about the outlook for the global economy.
By 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.4%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 and the German DAX each rose 0.3%.
Bank stocks were among the prominent gainers, reassured by the Fed’s action that the world is not yet headed for negative interest rates across the globe and “QE Infinity”.
“It’s not at all certain that there will be any more interest rate cuts this year at least,” said Carsten Mumm, a strategist with German private bank Donner & Reuschel.
Three of the top five winners in the sector were Spanish –   Bankia   (MC:BKIA), Banco Sabadell (MC:SABE) and Caixabank (MC:CABK), while Germany’s Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) also rose over 3%.
At the other end of the scale, mining and basic material stocks stumbled as iron ore futures fell below $90 a ton, reflecting fears that the Fed’s action still leaves key questions about the health of the Chinese economy unanswered in the light of the ongoing trade war.   Rio Tinto   (LON:RIO) was down 0.7% while   Anglo American   (LON:AAL) was down 0.4% - albeit the latter has outperformed over the last month with a gain of over 10%.
International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) was the best performer among the airlines as oil prices gave up over half of their gains since last weekend’s attack on Saudi Arabian oil installations. British Airways pilots said late Wednesday they had cancelled their next one-day strike in an attempt to restart talks with management over pay and conditions. The company has yet to respond publicly. The two-day strike earlier this month had caused thousands of flights to be cancelled, BA’s worst-ever day in terms of industrial relations.
U.K. retailer  Next  (LON:NXT), by contrast, fell over 4% after reporting a “disappointing” start to trading in the third quarter. It said it expected the fourth quarter to be stronger, helped by basis effects from a weak fourth quarter last year.
Elsewhere, German Internet incubator   Rocket Internet   (DE:RKET) rebounded from Wednesday’s three-month low on the back of solid second-quarter results that showed it sitting on a 3 billion euro cash pile after a string of IPOs by its portfolio companies."
1632,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 05:14AM ET</span>","Shares inch higher after Fed cut, BOJ keeps powder dry","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A positive start in Europe nudged the main world share indexes and bond yields higher on Thursday, after the U.S. Federal Reserve's second interest rate cut of the year while Japan and others kept their limited remaining powder dry.
The effects of the trade war has seen central banks around the world swing back into support mode this year, but the Fed's central message on Wednesday was that it wasn't expecting a major capitulation of the economy.
The Bank of Japan and Switzerland's central bank then both kept their deeply negative interest rates on hold. Brexit-bound Britain was expected to do the same later, while an outlier hike in Norway also came with a hint it would be the last. 
It was enough to push London's FTSE, Frankfurt's Dax and Paris, Milan and Madrid up between 0.2% and 0.8% in early moves after a broadly subdued Asian session.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares had ended down 0.5% as a 1% fall in Hong Kong and 1.1% drop in India offset 0.4% gains on Japan's Nikkei and from China's bluechip stocks.
In line with the view of no economic Armageddon, the benchmark government bond yields which act as a proxy for global borrowing costs, also rose.
The more sensitive two-year U.S. yields inched up to 1.75% and Europe's key 10-year German Bund yield was up around 2 basis points albeit still below highs hit last week and at a mind-boggling -0.49%.
""This is not ‘QE4ever’ as we’ve heard it called,"" analysts at RBC said of the Fed's decision and signals. ""We shouldn't go too far in putting on QE-like trades”. 
In the currency market, Bank of Japan's inaction saw the yen rise off a seven-week low versus an already lower dollar and stage something of a jump against the Australian dollar. [/FRX]
The BOJ had maintained its pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield around 0%. It also signalled it could add stimulus as early as next month but some traders had expected a move on Thursday after the Fed's rate cut. 
Yen bulls took the currency as far as 107.79 to the U.S. dollar before it settled at 108.06 for a gain of 0.4% on the day. The move against the Aussie dollar had been as large as 1%.. 
""There were large yen-buying orders before the BOJ, and that just carried through,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at J.P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo.
BACK TO THE FUTURES
In contrast to Europe's upward shuffle, U.S. stock futures were pointing to modest 0.1%-0.2% falls for Wall Street later. 
The S&P 500 had reversed losses and ended broadly flat on Wednesday after Fed chief Jerome Powell said he did not see an imminent recession or think the Fed will adopt negative rates.
The Fed had cut interest rates to 1.75%-2.00% in a 7-3 vote but made a point of saying U.S. labour market remains strong.
So-called dot-plot forecasts from all 17 policymakers also showed disagreement, with seven expecting a third rate cut this year, five seeing the current rate cut as the last for 2019, and five who appeared to have been against even Wednesday's move.
""This is a small positive for share prices as long as there is no recession,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney.
""The only problem is a 25 basis-point cut was already expected, and the comments and dot-plot forecasts were not as dovish as the market hoped."" 
Elsewhere in the currency market, the Aussie fell 0.6% to $0.6790 after data showed the nation's jobless rate rose slightly to 5.3% in August, bolstering expectations for the central bank to cut rates.
Sterling traded at 88.53 pence per euro, near its strongest level since May 30 ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting later where uncertainty about how, when or maybe even if the UK leaves the European Union remains the key issue.
Among commodities, U.S. crude futures rose 0.31% to $58.29 per barrel having largely stabilised after attacks in Saudi Arabia over the weekend sent prices soaring on Monday. 

Washington has blamed Iran for the attacks, a charge which Tehran denies. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the strike was ""an act of war.""

(Reuters) - A rally in bank stocks for the first time in four sessions lifted European shares on Thursday, after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates but set a higher bar for further reductions.
European banks (SX7P) rose 1.4%, the most among the major sectors, also benefiting from investors rotating into underperforming stocks. Banks are the only major sector in the red so far this year.
Central banks around the world have been loosening monetary policy to stem a slowdown in economic growth. Last week, the European Central Bank cut interest rates deeper into negative territory and asked governments to do more to prop up the euro zone economy.
However, upbeat economic data last week has resulted in central banks taking a more guarded approach to rate cuts. Following mixed signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, all eyes are now on the Bank of England's policy move, due at 1100 GMT, where it is expected to stand pat on rates.
""Powell could be waiting to see if the (U.S.) President will deliver an interim trade deal and if fiscal and monetary stimulus from the other major central banks will help provide some stability to the global economy,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 02:22AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Deutsche Bank has discussed adding assets to bad bank if sales go well - sources,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some senior  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) officials have discussed the possibility of putting additional problematic assets worth billions of euros into a unit it created earlier this year, if the bank is able to sell assets already held within that ""bad bank,"" according to three bank sources.
The discussions in recent weeks, which have not been previously reported, are preliminary, the sources said, adding that there is nothing imminent. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said the bank has no plans to add additional assets into the so-called capital release unit, or bad bank.
Nevertheless, it is one of the options that has come up for discussion at the highest levels at the bank, as executives grapple with the problem of having to turn around the bank on a tight budget, according to the three people familiar with the talks.
Deutsche Bank needs more capital to be able to absorb the losses that will likely come from shedding problematic assets, such as long-dated derivatives, that are still on its books, the people said. 
But, after raising 29.3 billion euros ($32.3 billion) in capital over the past nine years, it does not have room to ask investors for more, the sources added. 
For investors, still nursing a 75% fall in the bank's share price over the past four-and-a-half years, it means that the road to recovery for the bank will most likely be long. 
Christian Sewing, who took over from John Cryan in April last year, is looking to reshape Deutsche Bank after a multi-year bet on building a global investment banking business unraveled.
In July, he set up the bad bank, called a capital release unit (CRU), to house 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets the bank had identified for wind-down or sale, part of a broader restructuring that will see 18,000 jobs go as it exits unprofitable businesses. Deutsche Bank set aside a 7.4 billion euro budget to fund the restructuring.
Some analysts have been skeptical whether the plan fully recognizes the extent of the problem assets still sitting on Deutsche Bank's balance sheet. They remain particularly concerned about its exposure to Level 3 assets, which are the most illiquid and hard-to-value. 
""It's a partial clean-up,"" said David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors. Hendler added that Deutsche Bank has 18 billion euros in hard-to-value assets on its balance sheet, which he estimated will take years to offload. 
""They're trying to paint a picture of progress but there's still a lot of sludge in there,"" he said. 
Level 3 assets, which can include distressed debt and derivatives, are not necessarily loss making.
Deutsche Bank has said that the CRU's focus is on releasing capital rather than ring-fencing toxic assets. In a memo to staff on July 8, Sewing described the assets within it as ""high quality"" and said most were of a short duration.
Only 30% of Deutsche Bank's 25 billion euros worth of Level 3 assets have so far been placed within the capital release unit, according to a presentation the bank gave alongside its quarterly results in July.
The bank has tried to shed some of those assets, which include longer-dated derivatives, over the past three years. But it had little success because it was not prepared to take the writedowns the sales would have required, the sources said. 
A sale of a financial asset can lead to a capital hit if the price is below what the bank values it at on its books, leading to a loss.
Deutsche Bank must stay within the budget it has set for its restructuring to avoid having to raise funds from investors, the sources said. 
It set up the capital release unit with a view to shedding assets it could realistically find buyers for or wind-down in the next two to three years, the sources said. That, in turn, would free up capital to fund the sale of longer-term assets that will require bigger writedowns, the sources said.

Of the assets currently in the unit, Deutsche Bank plans to run a formal auction of its equity derivatives book as soon as this month, several sources familiar with the sale process have told Reuters. If those sales are successful, the bank could move more assets into the restructuring unit, the three sources close to the bank said.

1637,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 01:03AM ET</span>",Japan Stocks Pare Gains After BOJ; Aussie Slides: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks pared gains and the yen climbed after the Bank of Japan left its policy settings unchanged while noting rising risks from overseas.
Australia’s dollar slumped after the unemployment rate rose. U.S. stock futures retreated, Hong Kong shares slumped and China’s yuan dropped as investors took stock of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cut and the odds for the People’s Bank of China to lower borrowing costs. Equities were little changed in Shanghai.
Failing to follow the Fed and European Central Bank in easing policy interest rates, the BOJ nonetheless flagged that it needs to pay more attention to the risk of lost momentum toward its inflation target. Officials aim to “reexamine” growth and price developments next month.
In a mixed session, though, Japan’s stocks were still higher midday. A late-session rebound in American stocks -- following comments from Chairman Jerome Powell that the Fed is “prepared to be aggressive” if growth faltered -- failed to follow through to S&P 500 futures Thursday.
“There’s no cohesive narrative” at the moment, said Hannah Anderson, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. The Fed rate cut and Powell briefing “doesn’t really change the narrative that investors are going to need more than that from some governing body to give a central thesis that they feel comfortable sticking with for a while,” she said.
U.S.-China trade talks still loom, while the geopolitical situation in the Middle East remains unclear after Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for last Saturday’s attack on its oil installations.
Still to come Thursday are monetary policy decisions in Indonesia, Taiwan and the U.K. And BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda briefs on the policy decision.
These are some key events to keep an eye on this week:
Bank Indonesia and Bank of England decide policy Thursday.Australia jobs figures are out Thursday.Friday is quadruple witching day for U.S. markets. When the quarterly expiration of futures and options on indexes and stocks occurs on the same day, surging volatility and trading can follow.Here are the main moves in markets:

1638,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 01:02AM ET</span>",SoftBank Founder’s Empire Is Vulnerable to WeWork Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son, who built a $15.2 billion fortune investing in tech startups like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., is betting on himself more than ever, even as his empire shows signs of vulnerability.
The SoftBank Group Corp. founder has pledged 38% of his stake in the Japanese firm as collateral for personal loans from 19 banks, including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and Julius Baer Group Ltd., according to a June regulatory filing. That’s up from 36% at the start of the year and triple the level in June 2013.
“It lets him monetize a large share of his wealth without foregoing influence over the firm,” said Michael Puleo, assistant professor of finance at Fairfield University’s Dolan School of Business in Connecticut. “But there’s an elevation of crash risk. If the share price falls low enough, he could get a margin call and that could be pretty costly.”
The structure highlights the extent of Son’s exposure to SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund. Shares in the Japanese conglomerate have been rocked recently by the postponement of WeWork’s initial public offering. The delay came after the office-rental unicorn was being marketed at a steep discount to the $47 billion figure that the Tokyo-based conglomerate invested at earlier this year. That’s spooked investors, who sent SoftBank’s shares down 5% at one point this week as the listing unraveled, knocking $770 million off Son’s net worth. The stock has still advanced roughly 27% this year.
Son, 62, also has leveraged his stake in the Vision Fund, which invests in tech startups. That boosts his returns if things go well, with outsized losses if they don’t. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.’s falling market capitalization and WeWork’s travails are set to dent the 62% return on the fund that SoftBank reported through March.
“There is a danger in companies where the founder calls all the shots regardless of whether there are loans,” said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer with the MIT Sloan School of Management in Boston. “And when founders borrow a lot against their shares, they might be more tempted to make riskier decisions,” he said, adding that borrowing against 5% of one’s stake is usually considered reasonable.
Pay Out
SoftBank’s compensation plan also involves a lot of debt. Son loaned himself around $3 billion to invest in the first Vision Fund, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Using loans for a private investment compounds Son’s risk because he would be less able to bail himself out if things go south, Pozen said.
The loan was swapped for equity in the fund and will generate profits when deals make money -- and losses when they don’t. Vision Fund employees, including high-profile bankers and investors, receive base salaries and bonuses, but only get payouts when profits are booked.
It’s unclear how much of this compensation will be reported in SoftBank’s next annual report. Son’s pledged shares, which currently have a market value of $9 billion, are excluded from his net worth calculation by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. SoftBank spokeswoman Hiroe Kotera declined to comment.
SoftBank is planning to lend as much as $20 billion to its employees to buy stakes in a second venture capital fund, the people said. Son may account for over half of the employee investment pool, they said.
Ellison, Musk
Pledged shares have become an increasingly common way for founders to unlock the value of a stake without selling shares. Larry Ellison has a history of pledging  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). stock to fund a lavish lifestyle, which includes trophy properties, America’s Cup teams and the Indian Wells tennis tournament. About 27% of his Oracle shares -- worth more than $16 billion -- are currently pledged. Elon Musk has pledged about 40% of his stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., according to a May 2019 filing.
Still, the move comes with risks. “If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further,” Tesla warns in a filing.
The risk-loving Son, who saw $70 billion wiped from his fortune in the dot-com crash, is unlikely to be fazed. He told shareholders at the company’s June meeting that SoftBank’s investment portfolio could grow 33-fold to 200 trillion yen ($1.8 trillion) in 20 years."

Toyota said the funding would allow the Sorocaba plant, which builds the Etios and Yaris sedan models, to produce a new vehicle model. It did not provide details on the new model.
Sao Paulo state has long been the heart of Brazil's auto industry, which is in turn the largest in South America, but it had recently been losing steam against aggressive incentives offered by other states to lure manufacturers.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) announced plans in February to shut down and sell one its oldest Sao Paulo plants.
Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria has fought back to keep manufacturing jobs in the state, devising a tax incentive program to give automakers a 25% reduction in value added taxes as long as they invested at least 1 billion reais and created 400 new jobs.
Toyota, however, said the Sorocaba expansion will create only 300 jobs. The company, which has two other plants in Brazil, did not immediately respond to a question about whether this would still allow it to benefit from the tax incentives.
""During the last decade, which involved challenging times for the economy and the auto industry, Toyota remained faithful in its commitment ... growing in a sustainable way,"" Rafael Chang, who heads Toyota in Brazil, said in a statement."

The IIHS has given the Model 3 its highest rating, top safety pick+. It said the Model 3 earned good ratings across the board for crashworthiness.
The car's structure held up well in the driver-side small overlap front test, IIHS said.
Last month, Tesla said it was launching an insurance service designed to give drivers in California, its biggest market, lower rates because of safety features on its electric vehicles.
Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has been one of the strongest proponents of the idea that car insurance rates should plummet as driver-assist and self-driving technology become standard.
The company's cars generally rank among the most expensive vehicles to insure due to their high repair costs for components and sensor equipment, according to safety researchers and insurance providers."
1641,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 11:39PM ET</span>",Apple Is Suffering an Identity Crisis With Consumers in China,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade war is taking its toll on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., a new survey of Chinese consumer attitudes shows.
The company tumbled to No. 24 in an annual report on China’s top brands, falling from No. 11 a year ago. In 2017, before the trade war started, Apple was fifth in this ranking. Meanwhile, Apple’s biggest local rival, Huawei Technologies Co., climbed two spots and came in second, behind only Chinese payment service Alipay.
The shuffle in the rankings is a sign of the growing challenge American brands face in the second year of Donald Trump’s tariff showdown with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The survey findings show Chinese consumers growing cooler towards some American brands, especially after Huawei saw its Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, arrested in Canada last year at the behest of the U.S. government.
Trump followed with a ban on Huawei products, which helped fuel a surge of local support for the Shenzhen-based brand, according to Jay Milliken, senior partner in Hong Kong with Prophet, the San Francisco-based consultancy that conducted the survey of 13,500 Chinese consumers.
‘Nationalistic Buying’
“There’s a lot of nationalistic buying in that category, because Chinese consumers interpreted what happened to Huawei as an attack,” he said.
Patriotism helped fuel the rise of other Chinese brands, too. Sportswear maker Li Ning Co. cracked the top 40 for the first time, ranked No. 34, just two spots behind market leader  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE).
Named after its founder, the famous gymnast, Li Ning capitalized on nationalistic sentiments of many Chinese consumers with the launch last year of a China Li-Ning collection at New York Fashion Week that heavily used red and yellow, China’s national colors.
There were only two American names in the top ten this year -- Android at No. 3 and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at No. 9 -- compared to five in the 2017 survey.
Switching Allegiances
Unlike Apple, Android and Intel don’t have to worry about consumers switching allegiances to local competitors, Milliken said, and that explains why they manage to remain highly ranked.
“Some Western brands are so integral in the lives of Chinese consumers, they’re almost predisposed to not losing relevance,” he said. “There are no Chinese alternatives so those remain super relevant.”
Geopolitical tensions aren’t the only problem Apple faces in China, its biggest market after the U.S.
While Beijing is pushing to make the country a leader in the introduction of high-speed 5G networks, Apple’s phones, even the newly announced iPhone 11, don’t support that latest wireless standard.
Prophet’s survey, conducted annually, asks Chinese consumers in large cities to rank 258 brands across 27 categories."

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) accused the European Commission of misunderstanding its business on day two of the iPhone maker's appeal against a $14 billion tax order, in a dispute that is key to the EU's drive to collect more taxes but which could also run for years.
The case centers on tax rulings granted by Ireland to two Apple businesses in the country, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. The rulings reduced Apple's tax burden for more than two decades - to as low as 0.005% in 2014, according to the Commission, although Apple disputes this. 
The Commission ordered the U.S. company in 2016 to pay 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) of taxes it said were owed to Ireland. But Apple and Ireland, whose economy benefits from hosting a number of multinational firms, are appealing against the decision at Europe's General Court, its second highest. 
Central to the dispute is the importance of the Irish businesses, with Apple lawyer Daniel Beard arguing on Wednesday they were not as significant as the Commission has asserted.
""Yes, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there were decisions taken in Ireland, but not strategic decisions,"" he said, referring to Cook's testimony at a U.S. Senate hearing in 2013 which formed a key element of the Commission's case.
Apple did not do a special Irish tax deal in return for creating jobs, Beard added.
""The Commission went out of its way to tell a fairy story about supposed benefits to employment. It has no evidence, it is wrong. There was no sense of any special deal. Ireland properly and correctly taxed the Irish branches. There was no derogation from the normal rules,"" he said in his closing argument.
Ireland's lawyer, Paul Gallagher, said the EU executive had failed to prove its case and tarnished the country's reputation.
""They haven't shown one company which has been treated less favorably than Apple. This is Ireland's reputation which has been so severely criticized,"" he said. 
Commission lawyer Paul-John Loewenthal rejected criticism that the EU executive had not taken up Apple's offer to visit its operations in Cork, Ireland, saying this was not necessary.
""What would a site visit accomplish?"" he asked.
The case is about Apple's Irish tax deal and has nothing to with the mismatch between tax regimes in different countries or U.S. deferred tax rules, Commission lawyer Richard Lyal said in closing remarks.
Ireland ended the tax rulings when Apple's two Irish units changed their structures in 2015.
The stakes are high for European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has spearheaded the European Union's drive against tax avoidance by multinationals, issued similar tax recovery orders to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) among others, and has other companies in her sight.
Vestager will get a sense of how the General Court views her crackdown on Sept. 24 when it rules on her tax recovery orders to Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
The court will rule on the Apple case in the coming months, but the losing party is likely to appeal to the EU Court of Justice and a final judgment could take several years.

The joint Apple cases are T-778/16 Ireland v Commission and T-892/16 Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe v Commission.

1644,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 09:53PM ET</span>","Purdue Pharma seeks to halt opioid suits against company, Sacklers","By Tom Hals and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP on Wednesday asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to halt for roughly nine months more than 2,600 lawsuits alleging the company and its controlling Sackler family helped fuel the U.S. opioid crisis, according to court documents.
In addition to seeking a pause in widespread litigation against it, Purdue also asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain to shield the wealthy Sacklers from related opioid lawsuits they face. 
Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday after reaching an outline of a deal it estimated to be valued at more than $10 billion with states and local governments that brought the bulk of the cases. They allege the company deceptively marketed opioids by overstating benefits and downplaying risks. 
Purdue has been accused of contributing to a public health crisis that has been marked by nearly 400,000 overdose deaths between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest U.S. data. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied they are liable for the opioid epidemic.
Purdue said in Wednesday's court filing that an injunction halting litigation would preserve money that would otherwise be drained through prolonged legal battles. Purdue is spending more than $5 million a week in legal and professional fees, and other related expenses, the company said in court papers. 
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who has sued both the company and family members, said she would oppose Purdue's request.
""This filing isn’t a surprise. It’s yet another effort by Purdue to avoid accountability and shield the Sackler family fortune,"" Healey said in a statement.
The New York attorney general also said in a statement she would oppose Purdue's request.
A bankruptcy filing usually halts lawsuits immediately. But Purdue is preparing for some states to argue their lawsuits cannot be halted by a Chapter 11 filing because their legal actions were brought to enforce public health and safety laws - exempting them from the usual bankruptcy rules that would stop their complaints.
As a result, Purdue is asking the judge for a separate ruling to stop the litigation with the aim of allowing the company to continue negotiating with plaintiffs to resolve lawsuits. 
Purdue has reached a tentative deal to settle lawsuits with 24 states and five U.S. territories, as well as lead lawyers for more than 2,000 cities, counties and other plaintiffs, the company said. 
Two dozen states remain opposed or uncommitted to Purdue's proposed settlement and some have said they want more information about the Sacklers' finances and want a larger contribution from the family. Several filed new cases against the Sacklers before Purdue's bankruptcy filing.
In Wednesday's court filing, Purdue said allowing litigation against the Sacklers to continue would threaten billions of dollars they have pledged toward settling lawsuits and increase expenses for the company as it is drawn into the cases. 

The family, which would cede control of Purdue to a trust controlled by plaintiffs under terms of the proposed settlement, has proposed paying $3 billion over seven years and an additional $1.5 billion or more through an eventual sale of another company they own called Mundipharma, according to court records and people familiar with the matter.

AT&T has also considered a spinoff of DirecTV into a separate public company, the report said.
Last week, at a conference AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens cited regulatory hurdles for any deal. 
""So there's been some stories out there about the industrial logic about putting 2 satellite providers. It hasn't been successful and I don't know that there's any change in that regulatory perspective,"" he said.
DirecTV has been bleeding satellite TV subscribers with users shifting to cheaper online streaming services like Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime service.
AT&T lost 778,000 premium TV subscribers, which includes DirecTV users in the second quarter, more than the 544,000 it lost in the prior quarter, and expects the video losses to continue in the current quarter.
Shares of the wireless carrier rose 1% in after-market trading and those of Dish were up 1.8%. AT&T and Dish declined to comment.
Earlier this month, activist investor Elliott Management Corp disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company and listed businesses, including DirecTV, as possible sale candidates.
The hedge fund urged the company to end its acquisition spree to focus on improving its business, while criticizing the $85 billion purchase of media company TimeWarner Inc last year and the $49 billion deal for DirecTV in 2015.

The plant, which makes the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, ran out of parts on Tuesday.
The lay-off announcement came three days after about 48,000 hourly workers went on strike across GM facilities in the United States. Contract talks began early on Wednesday and were continuing into the evening aimed at reaching a deal, but no agreement was expected immediately.
""We anticipated there would be an impact because of the strike,"" David Paterson, a spokesman for General Motors in Canada, told Reuters.
The Oshawa plant will continue to make sedans.
Separately, Democrats in the U.S. Congress ramped up criticism of GM over its decision to shift health insurance costs for its striking workers to the union and urged the company reach a deal. 
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, said on Twitter that the decision was ""straight barbarism."" She added: ""GM workers are asking for a raise during a time of record profits. In response, GM execs cut off their health insurance.""
Many Democratic presidential candidates have issued similar comments.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter of the dispute: ""Enough of the stonewalling. It’s time for @GM to do the right thing.""

1. Fed Still High on the Agenda
It looks like the Fed-obsessing isn’t over with, as the markets try to figure out what’s next for the central bank and rates.
The stock market looked pretty unsure about what to make of a quarter-point cut with two dissenting hawks and one dissenting dove.
The FOMC’s dot-plot forecast indicated no expectation of further rate cuts, but the committee isn’t really speaking with one voice.
As far as the futures markets are concerned, the Fed will cut another 25 basis points in December, remaining steady in October, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. As far as President Donald Trump is concerned, the Fed has no ""guts.""
Central banks now look to be in a no-win position after “a protracted period of over-reliance on monetary policy,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG), tweeted.
2. Philly Fed, Existing Home Sales Arrive

Economic indicators will give insights into manufacturing, employment and housing (again) tomorrow.
The Philadelphia Fed will release its September manufacturing index at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
The Philly Fed index is expected to have fallen to 11 this month from 16.8 in August, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At the same time, the Labor Department will issue the weekly jobless claims figures. Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are forecast to have risen to 213,000 in the latest week from 204,000.
At 10:00 AM ET, the National Association of Realtors will report the August existing home sales data.
Sales of existing homes are expected to have fallen 0.4% to an annual rate of 5.37 million.
Today, the market saw housing starts and building permits that rose to a 12-year high.
3. Darden Set to Report Results
Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI) will report earnings before the bell tomorrow.
The operator of Olive Garden and LongHorn SteakHouse, among other chains, is expected to report a profit of $1.35 per share on sales of $2.14 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The company will also update full-year guidance. Darden forecast a comparable restaurant sales rise of 1% to 2% for the year.

1652,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 05:21PM ET</span>",French power output down 6% as workers strike over restructuring,"PARIS (Reuters) - A nationwide strike by workers of French utility EDF (PA:EDF) in protest against a plan to restructure the state-controlled company reduced power generation at several nuclear and gas fired power plant on Wednesday evening, company data showed.
The strike had reduced French power generation by around 6% of total available generation capacity by 2100 GMT, according to data from EDF and grid operator RTE.
Power station outages will not knock out the grid or hit households, though cuts in power output are costly for EDF, as it has to import any shortfall from overseas.
EDF workers are protesting against plans steered by the French government to restructure and potentially split the heavily-indebted, state-controlled group, with its nuclear power generation business set to one side.
The strike, expected to run until the evening of Sept. 19, could be more disruptive than previous stoppages, with four unions representing a majority of France's energy workers joining forces behind the walkout this time.
It is not yet clear whether job cuts would be involved under the restructuring plan, which is known as ""Project Hercule"" and was requested by President Emmanuel Macron.
But unions hope to pile pressure on EDF's management and the government to delay the project - the company is due to present a final proposal by the end of the year - and they argue the mooted split would only weaken the group.
EDF's data showed that output at its 1,330-megawatt (MW) Paluel 3 nuclear reactor was down by around 65 percent due to the strike.
Electricity generation was down by around 60 percent at the 900 MW Gravelines 2 nuclear rector, while at the 1,310 MW Nogent 2 reactor, output was reduced to 800 MW. The Blayais 1 and St. Laurent 1 nuclear reactors were also hit by the strike.
Electricity production was also curbed at the Martigues Ponteau 5 and 6 gas-fired power plants, EDF data showed."

The S&P 500 ended the day basically flat, holding above 3,000 for a second day in a row and for the fifth day in the last six trading sessions. The index had been off as many as 28 points after the Fed rate announcement. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, once down 211 points, closed with a small gain, up 0.13%. The Nasdaq Composite finished down 0.11%, a big improvement from a decline of nearly 100 points after the Fed decision. The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by big tech stocks, was flat. 
The Fed cut its key federal funds rate to a band of 1.75% to 2% from 2% to 2.25%. It was the Fed's second rate cut this year. Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted against any cut; another wanted to go further. Futures market trading suggests another rate cut is coming this year, but at least five members of the committee aren't sure another cut is needed.
President Donald Trump tweeted that the Fed had failed and not gone far enough in cutting interest rates as a combination of trade disputes and slowing international growth are weighing on the U.S. economy, especially U.S. businesses, which have been cautious in capital spending.
But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell defended the Fed's decision, saying the Fed will change rates if necessary, but not before. While there was some softening in the economy, he said in his news conference, ""We don't see a recession; we're not forecasting a recession.""
He received some major good news on Wednesday. U.S. building permits and housing starts hit a 12-year high. Reuters said the report was evidence that lower mortgage rates were boosting housing markets. 
Homebuilding shares were higher on the news. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (NYSE:ITB) was up 0.64%. The ETF's biggest holdings include DR Horton (NYSE:DHI),   Lennar   (NYSE:LEN), NVR (NYSE:NVR) and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM).
Energy, materials, real estate and technology stocks struggled. Financial and utilities shares were higher.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fell more than 13%, the biggest loser among the Dow Jones Transportation stocks. The Transportation average fell 1.2%.
Late Tuesday, FedEx cut earnings guidance for the current fiscal year, citing the ongoing trade disputes with China and loss of revenue from Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) decision to dump FedEx as its primary package shipper.
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) were among the top overall market performers.
JPMorgan), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the Dow. 
After the close, Microsoft boosted its quarterly dividend by 11% to 51 cents from 46 cents and announced a new $40 billion share-buyback plan.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - With widespread fires wreaking havoc on the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), over 200 investors representing some $16.2 trillion under management on Wednesday called on companies to do their part in halting the destruction of the world's largest tropical rainforest.
Nongovernment organization Ceres said in a statement that 230 funds have signed a declaration calling on firms to keep a close tab on supply chains, among other measures to curtail forest destruction.
Signatories range from major private managers like HSBC Global Asset Management and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management to public pension funds like California's CalPERS, according to a list provided by Ceres, a Boston-based NGO encouraging sustainability among investors.
""Deforestation and loss of biodiversity are not only environmental problems. There are significant negative economic effects associated with these issues and they represent a risk that we as investors cannot ignore,"" said Jan Erik Saugestad, CEO of Storebrand Asset Management, Norway's largest private asset management firm and one of the signatories.
The resolution did not explicitly say signatories were threatening to withdraw investments from any companies. Still, it added to the pressure that international corporations and investors have put on partners operating in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rainforest that lies in Brazil, Bolivia and seven other countries.
In Brazil alone, more 2,400 square miles of the Amazon have been deforested this year, an area larger than the U.S. state of Delaware.
Meanwhile, 60,472 fires have been recorded year-to-date in the Amazon, up 47% from last year, according to government data. Many fires have been set intentionally by farmers and ranchers, and the response of the government of Brazil's right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been criticized as indifferent.
In neighboring Bolivia, President Evo Morales has come under scrutiny for his ambitions to make the country a global food supplier, calling agricultural commodities the ""new gold"" that will help diversify the economy.
The resolution called on companies to implement a ""no deforestation policy"" with ""quantifiable, time-bound commitments,"" assess and disclose the risks their supply chains pose to forests, establish a monitoring system for supply chain partners and report annually on ""deforestation risk exposure and management.""
""There is an urgent need to focus more on effective management of agricultural supply chains,"" Jan Erik Saugestad, CEO of Storebrand Asset Management, was quoted as saying in a statement released by Ceres.
In August, VF Corp (N:VFC) - owner of apparel brands such as The North Face and Vans - said it would stop purchasing leather from the Amazon in response to the fires.
Norway, home to the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, has urged several of its companies to ensure they do not contribute to Amazon deforestation, including oil firm Equinor ASA (OL:EQNR), fertilizer-maker Yara International ASA (OL:YAR) and aluminum producer Norsk Hydro ASA (OL:NHY).

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 02:33PM ET</span>",Siemens's Busch favorite to be next CEO after promotion to deputy job,"By John Revill and Alexander Hübner
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) promoted Chief Operating Officer Roland Busch to become deputy chief executive, it said on Wednesday, putting the 54-year-old in pole position to eventually replace Joe Kaeser as head of the German engineering group.
Siemens said its supervisory board would decide in the summer of next year on a successor to Kaeser, whose contract is due to run until early 2021.
In his new role, Busch will be responsible for implementing Siemens's 2020+ strategy which will see the trains-to-turbines maker focusing on factory automation and smart buildings as the core of its business.
""By appointing Roland Busch Deputy CEO, we're emphasizing the importance of the industrial digitalization of the company for the next generation,"" supervisory board Chairman Jim Hagemann Snabe said in a statement.
Siemens declined to say whether Busch's promotion meant he would automatically be named chief executive to replace Kaeser, who has led Siemens since 2013.
But the new role meant Busch, who is also Siemens chief technology officer, would now have time to prove he was capable of being CEO and if he was successful he would most likely get the top job, a source close to the board told Reuters.
He will take up his new role on Oct. 1.
Another source told Reuters that Busch, with his technical background, was the right man to lead Siemens, while it was possible that Kaeser could step down as early as the middle of next year.
It was highly unlikely that Kaeser's contract would be extended beyond January 2021, unless Busch proved to be a disaster, the source said.
""The new Siemens needs a technician again as boss,"" a board source told Reuters. ""Busch would be the right solution.
""Kaeser has been Siemens' top salesman, negotiating large power plant and train contracts with politicians,"" the source added. ""The future Siemens with smart infrastructure and digital industries no longer needs another type of CEO. You need a technician again.""
Siemens on Wednesday also named managing board member Michael Sen as the head of its standalone gas and power business which it plans to list in September 2020.
The 50-year-old executive was the favorite for the job, Reuters wrote last week, and his appointment could remove him as a candidate to eventually replace Kaeser.
Siemens is spinning off the 30 billion euro ($33.18 billion) business after years of falling sales and profit as the rise of renewable power triggered a collapse in demand. 
Sen will work as co-chief executive alongside Lisa Davis, the current head of gas and power business from Oct. 1. Davis will stay with the unit until January 2020, and stay with Siemens until her contract expires at the end of October 2020.
Snabe said Sen's experience in the power industry put him in a good position to lead the new company. Before returning to Siemens in 2017, Sen spent two years as chief financial officer at German utility  E.On  (DE:EONGn).
Union leaders said Sen was a suitable candidate for the energy company job, while Busch had the background to succeed as deputy chief executive of Siemens.
Busch, with his many years of experience as chief technology officer and strategist, has the best qualifications to develop Siemens in future, said Birgit Steinborn, chairwoman of the Siemens works council and first deputy chairwoman of Siemens's supervisory board.

India was following the lead of Michigan and New York, which have both banned sales of flavored e-cigarettes. The bans came after reports of lung diseases and deaths of e-cigarette users.
In addition, the Trump administration is cracking down hard on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. Health concerns and teen addiction have given regulators pause.
Altria (NYSE:MO), maker of Marlboro cigarettes, doesn't make e-cigarettes. But it invested nearly $13 billion last year in Juul, one of the biggest e-cigarette makers. The move was made to offset declining cigarette sales due to high taxes and bans on smoking in public spaces. "

BONN (Reuters) - A banker at the center of a trading scheme German prosecutors say resulted in hundreds of millions of euros of illegitimate tax rebates told a court the scheme had taken on an ""industrial scale"" involving a network of banks and other institutions.
Martin Shields, a former investment banker, said that a web of banks, investors and brokers had organized the circular trades, making multiple tax reclaims and sharing the profit.
""I am not before you to deny my involvement, but to explain it,"" Shields told the court in Bonn on Wednesday.
The trial is the first in a wider investigation aimed at recovering billions from banks which prosecutors say profited from such schemes. Germany estimates the schemes cost it more than 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in total.
Prosecutors allege that players in the so-called cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit.
Shields' testimony is a critical building block in pursuing others potentially involved. The case, Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation, is being closely followed in London and Frankfurt, where much of the trading was organized, according to bankers and court documents.
German state prosecutor Anne Brorhilker this month outlined criminal charges against Shields and fellow British banker Nicholas Diable, who she said organized a network of traders and lenders to make double tax reclaims with sham share trades.
Brorhilker said the two men, who face a possible jail term and a state order to repay any profits they made, had been involved in organizing bogus share trades in companies including carmaker BMW and airline Lufthansa.
The alleged scheme involved trading shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to give the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.
Shields, a 41-year-old engineering graduate, said he regretted his involvement in the trading scheme but that the practice was common knowledge in the industry and that he had no reason to believe at the time that it was legally questionable.
""This was not the clandestine approach of a few,"" he said, describing it as the ""clear and openly communicated expectation of most banks and their customers"".
Diable is expected to address the court on Thursday. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
Brorhilker has estimated that the alleged scheme she is prosecuting cost Germany some 450 million euros in lost taxes.
She said the two men had started it when working at German bank HVB, before moving to a small investment firm, tapping a wide network of contacts to arrange the trades, sometimes splitting the profit made with banks.
Shields named banks and financial institutions he said were involved in the scheme, including Warburg,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Deutsche Boerse's trade settlements arm Clearstream.
Last month, prosecutors raided the offices of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) as part of the wider probe.
Warburg has been included in the German trial and may have to repay any profit made from the schemes. A spokesman for Warburg has said that it had not received such multiple tax rebates and had never set out to do so.
HVB, which has blamed its involvement on wrongdoing by individuals, declined further comment. A spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said it was fully cooperating with the authorities.
A Deutsche Bank spokesman said it had been involved with clients' cum-ex deals but that it now takes a critical view of these transactions and is cooperating with the authorities.
Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012 to prevent cum-ex trades, but the case has fueled mistrust of banks among ordinary Germans.
The discovery of the trades in Germany and Denmark, where tax authorities say they lost $2 billion in rebates, prompted investigations by other countries including Austria and Belgium, which have found they were also affected, albeit on a far smaller scale."

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 11:36AM ET</span>",India bans e-cigarettes as global backlash at vaping gathers pace,"By Aditya Kalra and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India banned the sale of electronic cigarettes on Wednesday and warned of an ""epidemic"" among young people, in the latest and potentially biggest move globally against vaping over growing health concerns.
The ban cuts off a huge future market from e-cigarette makers at a time when the number of people smoking worldwide is declining. It could dash the expansion plans of companies such as Juul Labs and Philip Morris International (N:PM) in the country.
""These novel products come with attractive appearances and multiple flavours and their use has increased exponentially and acquired epidemic proportions in developed countries, especially among youth and children,"" India's health ministry said.
The ban also covers the production, import and advertising of e-cigarettes - but not the use of them. It comes at a time when vaping is facing increased scrutiny in other countries.
The United States last week announced plans to remove flavoured e-cigarettes from stores, warning that sweet flavours had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.
The Indian prohibition will be imposed through an executive order and will include jail terms of up to three years for offenders.
India has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China in the world, making it a lucrative market for companies making vaping products such as U.S.-based Juul and Philip Morris, which manufactures a heat-not-burn tobacco device.
The ban was announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at a news conference, where she showed various types of products to the media, including a Juul vaping device, which resembles a USB flash drive.
Juul had plans to launch its e-cigarette in India and has hired several senior executives in recent months. Philip Morris also has plans to launch its heat-not-burn smoking device in India, Reuters has reported.
A spokeswoman for Juul in India declined to comment. Philip Morris did not respond to a request for comment.
Juul, in which tobacco giant Altria group (N:MO) owns a 35% stake, is already facing government scrutiny in its home market and elsewhere. In China, Juul said on Tuesday its products were not currently available on e-commerce websites, days after it entered the market.
HEALTH DISPUTE
India's vapour-products market was valued at $57 million in 2018, according to data from Euromonitor International. Before the ban, the research group estimated the market in India would grow by nearly 60 percent a year up to 2022.
Shane MacGuill, head of tobacco research at Euromonitor in London, said the India ban could push other countries to follow suit, hurting the global vapour industry.
""India is obviously a market of huge potential for vapour products,"" he told Reuters. ""This ban would decisively cut off access to that potential growth cohort for companies like Juul Labs and PMI (Philip Morris International).""
The global market for e-cigarettes is still small compared to cigarettes, but is growing rapidly. Last year global cigarette sales totalled more than $713 billion, compared to $15.7 billion for vapour products, according to Euromonitor. By 2023, the vapour category is projected to more than double to $40 billion, while cigarettes are expected to decline slightly.
Advocates for e-cigarettes say vaping, which usually involves inhaling a vapour formed from heating up a liquid containing nicotine, is far less harmful than smoking tobacco.
But many tobacco-control activists are opposed to the devices, saying they could lead to nicotine addiction and push people towards consuming tobacco.
More than 900,000 people die each year due to tobacco-related illnesses in India, home to about 1.3 billion people.
The Association of Vapers India, an organisation that represents e-cigarette users across the country, attacked the government's decision, saying it would deprive millions of smokers of a safer solution to cut back on smoking.
COURT CHALLENGE?
The ban order will impose a jail term of up to one year and a fine of 100,000 rupees ($1,404) for first-time offenders. A repeat violation would attract a jail term of up to three years and a penalty of up to 500,000 rupees, the government said.
The ban would cover the manufacture, import, sale, advertisement and distribution of e-cigarettes. But it would not apply to the end users of such devices, Vikas Sheel, a senior official at India's health ministry, told Reuters.
""Over a period of time, people will not get their (vape) refills, so they will become responsible,"" he said.
The government expects the ban order to be challenged in court, but was prepared to defend its decision, Sheel added.
Shares in  ITC  (NS:ITC), India's top cigarette maker, ended up nearly 1%, while its rival Godfrey Phillips (NS:GDFR) surged 5.2%. E-cigarettes form just a tiny part of their product range.
The ban order needs to be approved by the president before it takes effect, but this is typically a formality.
Such executive orders are typically issued as an emergency measure when Indian parliament is not in session. The ban order could lapse if it is not approved when lawmakers convene against in the next session of parliament, which will most likely be held in November."

MADRID/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lisa Batitto, 54, says she has virtually stopped buying clothes ever since she started renting them.
The New Jersey-based museum publicist spends $277 a month on three subscriptions, including one from New York & Company, a women's mid-price clothing chain with hundreds of U.S. stores.  
This is less than what she previously spent, she said. ""I still have clothes in my closet from when I was buying, but I can't tell you the last time I bought anything,"" she said. 
From New York & Company, owned by RTW Retailwinds Inc. (N:RTW), to Bloomingdale's (N:M) and Banana Republic of Gap Inc. (N:GPS), more retailers are offering to lend out their clothing for a monthly rental rate. 
Even fast-fashion stalwart H&M (ST:HMb), with nearly 5,000 stores globally, said in August it would include a limited rental service featuring its premium-priced collection made from recycled fibers in a revamped central Stockholm store.
The services cater to a growing number of people like Batitto who want to purchase just a few items and rent the rest.
But the strategy comes with risks. It costs a lot to ship items back and forth, and it remains to be seen if rental clothes will cannibalize retail sales over the longer term. 
Fees roughly range from $50 to $160 per month to rent several items, with an option to buy at a discount. While most services are online, some stores are creating space for people to drop off, browse or collect clothing available for lease. 
(For a graphic on ""Rental"" apparel services model, click https://graphics.reuters.com/RETAIL-RENTING/0100B2B71DH/rent-the-runway.jpg)
San Francisco-based fashion rental service Le Tote bought the operations of Lord + Taylor stores from struggling Canadian department store operator Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC) last month. Inside the next nine months, it plans to build drop-off lockers and large display areas in 38 Lord + Taylor department stores.
Competitor Rent the Runway has expanded its physical drop-off network over the past year with 25 points for customers to return garments in its own stores plus some WeWork locations and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stores in the Los Angeles area. 
Rent the Runway can turn around an item in as little as a day, a company spokeswoman said. The company opened a 300,000 square foot fulfillment center in Texas in July in addition to its New Jersey facility to deal with increased demand.  
The risk is rental services could take spend away from traditional sales in a sector where changing shopping habits and falling prices have nearly halved the percentage spend on apparel by the average U.S. consumer over the past 30 years.
In addition, physical stores are struggling with online competition from players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Year-to-date announced store closures have already exceeded the total recorded for 2018, said Coresight Research in a recent note.
The U.S. garment rental market, excluding costumes, was worth $1 billion in 2018, less than 1% of the total apparel market, according to GlobalData. But it grew 24% in that year compared to 5% for the wider clothing market, data shows.
That growth can come with a hefty price tag. 
At Le Tote, once subscribers drop off boxes containing up to 15 items of clothing, a chain of activity will start to ready items for their next assignment. Le Tote currently ships boxes to its online subscribers using USPS Priority. 
""Shipping is our biggest cost, so having these stores as touch points for customers to come in, pick up and drop off significantly reduces our shipping costs,"" Chief Executive Rakesh Tondon said in an interview. 
CaaStle, a New York-based company that provides technology and logistics for the New York & Company, Bloomingdale's and Banana Republic rental services amongst others, branched out from its own Gwynnie Bee women's apparel business in 2018 to set up rental services for others.  
Contrary to analysts' concerns that rental could cannibalize sales, offering rental captures more revenue as consumers buy clothes in addition to their subscription, said CaaStle Chief Executive Officer Christine Hunsicker in an interview. 
Rental platforms buy clothing wholesale from brands, but many are introducing revenue-sharing models whereby platforms allow brands to upload items for lease and then take care of cleaning and delivery in return for a share in the revenue. 
This model is better for cash-flow but not as profitable, said Le Tote CEO Tondon. Le Tote raised around $75 million over the past five years from investors including Azure Capital, Sway Ventures and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Ventures, and has been profitable at the operating level for over three years, he said.
Jeans maker Levi Strauss & Co (N:LEVI), which operates under a revenue-sharing model with Rent the Runway, has increased offerings on the platform from 12 items when it launched in November to 29 currently, including skinny jeans and embroidered denim jackets.
""When the product comes back, they put it back to like-new,"" Levi's Chief Executive Chip Bergh said in an interview. 
Brands from Levi's to upmarket U.S. label Rebecca Taylor - whose silk dresses retail at hundreds of dollars - are putting more stock to rent to open new revenue streams, capture new customers and harvest valuable feedback, they say.  
Tiarra Phillips, an 18-year-old college student from a small town in Georgia in the southern United States pays $69.95 a month for her subscription to Express, a fashion mall brand whose rental service is also powered by CaaStle.
Phillips said she has never been to one of Express's network of over 600 physical stores, but has rented items ranging from leggings to dresses. 

""They tell you not even to wash it, to just wear it and send it back and then you get a new box, so I don't really have to do anything; I can just sit at home,"" she said.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 10:56AM ET</span>",Lone 737 MAX criss-crossed Canada for pilot checks during grounding,"By Allison Lampert and Tim Hepher
MONTREAL/PARIS (Reuters) - While the world's Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX fleet remains grounded after two fatal crashes, a solitary  Air Canada  (TO:AC) plane has been spotted in the skies, shuttling between Quebec and Ontario.
In a rare exemption, approved by Canadian aviation regulator Transport Canada, the 11 flights in August and September were partly to maintain the qualifications of senior training pilots, Air Canada told Reuters in response to a query about flight tracking data.
A spokesman for Air Canada said the airline was not able to use similar 737s within its fleet ""to maintain check pilot authority in alignment with (Canadian aviation regulations)"". 
""So we are utilizing the 737 Max during planned maintenance movements to maintain qualification."" 
Between Aug 28 and Sept 8 the Air Canada MAX plane criss-crossed between Montreal, Val d'Or, Quebec and North Bay, Ontario, data from Tracking website FlightRadar24 shows. 
Then last week, it was flown to Pinal Airpark in Arizona to be parked in a desert storage site. https://tmsnrt.rs/31tFuMJ
Although unusual after the grounding imposed worldwide in March amid concerns over an anti-stall system, the flights highlight growing pressures facing some airlines as they prepare for the return to service of the 400-plane Boeing fleet.
The planes have been sitting idle since March following two crashes in the space of five months.
For airlines like Air Canada, which did not have earlier versions of Boeing 737s in their fleets, this has made it difficult to make sure pilots can demonstrate the skills required to retain their licenses.
As North America's sole MAX operator which had not flown the earlier 737NG, Air Canada cannot use that model to maintain the qualifications of its check or trainer pilots, the company said.
So regulator Transport Canada authorized a select group of Air Canada's check pilots to fly the grounded jet, which was also conducting maintenance flights, the airline said. 
All the jets have the same control software suspected of contributing to the accidents, which Boeing is now in the process of revising to smooth its impact. However, some pilots have said existing procedures can prevent similar accidents.
Boeing declined to comment.
MARKET BATTLE
Transport Canada said in an email that it authorized the flights ""because the carrier does not operate the Boeing 737 NG aircraft, but the pilots still need to maintain currency.""
However, one U.S. carrier questioned by Reuters said such flights would not be possible in the United States where pilot training was not included in a list of exemptions to the ban issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.
""Pilot currency isn’t a listed exemption in the U.S. order,"" an FAA spokeswoman confirmed.
North American MAX operators, including Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and Canada's WestJet Airlines (TO:WJA), said they would only move their MAX jets for maintenance and storage purposes. 
Air Canada's position as a newly-converted 737 operator follows a seven-year battle between Boeing and Airbus over the introduction of airplanes offering bold new fuel savings.
The introduction of the MAX, an upgrade of earlier 737 models with advanced new engines, coincided with a bitter contest for market share between Boeing and Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), which was offering its similar A320neo.
The feud saw both planemakers use the transition to a new generation of jets to try to poach each other's customers, and traders said Air Canada's 2013 decision to switch from Airbus's A320 family to Boeing's 737 MAX stood out as a major defection.
Now, the decision to switch suppliers potentially weighs on some of those same airlines as they cope without a 737 fleet.
Boeing has predicted that the 737 MAX will be cleared to take passengers early next quarter.
The FAA, facing growing international scrutiny over its certification processes, has said it cannot give a precise date for the approval of software and training changes carried out in the wake of the two accidents, which killed 346 people.

FAA chief Stephen Dickson plans to fly to Seattle this week to test modified 737 MAX software in a simulator..

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday a weekend attack on Saudi Aramco had no impact on government revenues and authorities were gearing up to list the state oil giant, signaling the kingdom's resilience following the crippling strike on its oil industry. 
""In terms of revenues there's zero impact,"" Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of an investor conference in Riyadh. 
""Aramco continued to supply the markets without interruption and therefore revenues should continue as they are."" 
He spoke a day after Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the kingdom will restore lost oil output by the end of September and has managed to restore supplies to customers to the levels they were at prior to the attacks.
Oil prices fell after the Saudi reassurances, having surged more than 20% at one point on Monday - the biggest intra-day jump since the 1990-91 Gulf War. 
The Saudi stock market (TASI) was also up 0.4% in afternoon trade on Wednesday and Saudi dollar-denominated bonds also recovered on the international market after falling on Monday.
Jadaan said Aramco ""showed clearly how resilient Saudi Arabia and the company is and how capable the company is to deal with an incident like this.""
But the attacks have escalated tensions in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia linking main regional adversary Iran to the unprecedented assault, which Washington also blames on Tehran.
They have also exposed how ill-prepared the Gulf state is to defend itself despite repeated attacks on vital assets during its 4-1/2 year foray into the war in neighboring Yemen.
""In order to not show too much weakness in front of their domestic audience, the Saudi leadership has little choice but to minimize the impact of the attack,"" said Westbeck Capital Management, an investment manager, in a note.
""The planned Aramco IPO is also playing a role in putting up a brave face.""
TIMING
Bankers at the event in Riyadh, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the planned IPO of the state oil giant - the world's largest crude producer - would go ahead despite the attacks.
""There will be a patriotic buy into the company from both the wealthy and the less wealthy Saudis,"" John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Gulf Research Center, told Reuters this week.
But there is no clarity on the exact timeline of the deal.
Sources previously told Reuters Aramco was targeting a domestic listing as early as November, but Aramco's chairman, Yassir al-Rumayyan, said on Tuesday the IPO would be ready within the coming 12 months.
The Aramco IPO is a pillar of an ambitious economic diversification drive by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has put the firm's valuation at $2 trillion. The domestic flotation is the first step of a targeted 5% sale.
Jadaan reiterated the Aramco IPO is moving ahead as planned and will most likely happen over the next 12 months.
Aramco's primary listing will be on Tadawul, the local stock market, in Riyadh, but the government is still considering a secondary listing overseas, he said.

Doubts had emerged earlier this week about the timeline of the IPO in the wake of the attack, but despite the concerns, Aramco has pressed ahead with banker meetings this week.

In its announcement, S&P cited continued drags from poor cost efficiency, risks from technology disruption and low interest rates. A slowing German economy may also hurt banks, S&P said.
Deutsche Apotheker und Aerztebank and DZ HYP, both German cooperative banks, also saw their outlooks downgraded.
The affected banks either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Germany's banking sector has struggled to generate profits in recent years because costs are high and competition is fierce, with more than 1,500 lenders serving the nation's 80 million people. Other nations such as France and the U.S. have more concentrated banking sectors.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Germany's largest lender, was unaffected by Wednesday's ratings action. The bank is in the midst of a broad restructuring, involving job cuts and the exit of certain business lines in an effort to become profitable."

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's new iPhones will use recycled rare earth elements in a key component, the company said on Wednesday.
Apple said it will use recycled rare earths in its ""Taptic Engine,"" a part that lets iPhones mimic a physical button click despite being a flat pane of glass. The part is about one-quarter of the rare earth elements inside the iPhone models.
Rare earths, a group of 17 specialized minerals, have become a flash point in trade tensions between the United States and China. The elements are used in weapons, consumer electronics and other goods. 
China dominates the processing of the raw minerals, and has implied through its state-controlled media that it could restrict rare earths sales to the United States, just as it did to Japan after a diplomatic dispute in 2010.
Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said Apple's use of recycled rare earths was ""not related"" to trade tensions but could help it maintain a steady supply.
""This is one of those happy coincidences where what is good for the planet is really good for business at the same time,"" Jackson told Reuters. ""One of the things we talk about a lot internally, just in general, is how much more resilient this makes our supply chain.""
In consumer electronics, rare earths reside in tiny speakers and actuators. The parts are so small that collecting them for recycling is difficult and expensive.
For now, Apple will use recycled rare earths from an outside supplier, not from previously used iPhones. Apple declined to name the supplier or say what products the rare earths were recovered from, though the company did say the source was post-industrial, meaning material generated during manufacturing processes rather than from discarded consumer products. 
Jackson said that Apple's scale - new iPhone models are typically sell tens of millions of units per year - helped make the project economically viable.
""We have essentially made a market for this entrepreneur, this innovator, who found a way to recycle rare earths,"" Jackson said.
Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company focused on repairing and reusing electronics, said Apple's move was a first for the industry.
""Rare earth elements aren't being recycled from electronics right now, and that's a huge problem — China has a stranglehold on the virgin material supply,"" Wiens said. ""This is a great idea — Apple could single-handedly create a hugely needed market for recycled rare earths.""
Apple often aims to reuse parts from its old devices. 
Apple said on Wednesday that aluminum from enclosures recovered through its trade-in programs will be melted down and made into new MacBook Air laptop computers. The company previously disclosed that cobalt recovered from iPhone batteries disassembled by robots at its recycling labs in Texas is put into new iPhone batteries. 
Apple is experimenting with ways to recover rare earths from its phones using its robots, which can remove tiny parts and separate them into collection bins to aggregate enough material to make recycling viable. 
The company is also researching ways that conventional recyclers, who shred devices and separate out the various materials, could tweak their lines to recover the elements, information that Jackson said Apple is open to sharing.

""There are some innovations of ours that we actually want people to copy. So as much as possible - as long as it doesn't give away some of our other design and engineering innovation - we are happy to bring along the recycling industry,"" Jackson said. ""We have started to be much more transparent around this technology development than we usually are.""

Saudi-based Sidra Capital has pulled out of a 90 million-pound ($112 million) deal to buy 70 Wilson Street near London’s financial district as the flexible-office giant’s planned initial public offering got an increasingly rocky reception from investors, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations.
Separately, talks have stalled on the sale of WeWork Waterloo, which the company describes as the largest co-working facility in the world, according to other people with knowledge of the negotiations. Singapore-based Bright Ruby Resources Pte Ltd. had agreed last month to buy it and an adjoining property leased to Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc for about 850 million pounds. It’s not clear what impact WeWork’s roller-coaster IPO has had on Bright Ruby’s appetite for the deal, the people said.
We Co., which owns WeWork, pushed back its IPO this week to buy time to overcome concerns about its governance, slashed valuation and business prospects. The decision sent the company’s bonds plunging and added a sour note to a medley of high-profile, but frequently disappointing, IPOs this year.

The delay also comes at a critical time for major backer SoftBank Group Corp., which is trying to raise money for a successor to its Vision Fund. SoftBank’s biggest investors, including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, are reconsidering how much to commit to the new vehicle as the Japanese conglomerate’s bet on WeWork sours.
WeWork has lease obligations of $47 billion and continues to burn cash to fund its rapid expansion, putting pressure on the company to raise new capital. But the company’s model of signing long leases, then renting out short-term space to members, as well as its complex relationship with co-founder Adam Neumann, have polarized investors assessing the planned offering.
WeWork Waterloo, originally known as Two Southbank Place, is fully leased to WeWork and boasts a skate ramp, retro arcade games and a library in its cavernous lobby. Negotiations on a sale, which were first reported by React News in August, are ongoing and there’s no certainty about their outcome, one of the people said.
Representatives of Almacantar SA, the developer selling the buildings in London’s Waterloo district, and WeWork declined to comment. A representative for Bright Ruby wasn’t immediately able to comment.
Sidra Capital was in talks to buy 70 Wilson Street in London’s Shoreditch district from a venture led by Columbia Threadneedle Investments, the people said.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 08:36AM ET</span>",Britain to investigate $5 billion U.S. takeover of defense firm Cobham,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will investigate the national security impact of the purchase of defense company Cobham by U.S. private equity firm Advent International, potentially delaying or even blocking the $5 billion deal.
Business minister Andrea Leadsom's move on Wednesday is not unusual where there are potential security concerns, and follows British government intervention in the pending acquisition of satellite group Inmarsat by an international private equity consortium that includes U.S. firm Warburg Pincus.
Leadsom has issued a European intervention notice, calling for a report from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) by Oct. 29 to determine whether Cobham, the maker of air-to-air refueling equipment, should be sold.
The government could decide the deal then needs a full inquiry due to Cobham's role in supporting aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Eurofighter Typhoon as well as advanced naval vessels, satellites and military vehicles.
Other deals investigated on national security grounds have often been cleared after undertakings from the buyer.
""The CMA will now prepare a report on the national security aspects of the proposed transaction,"" the business department said. ""This is a statutory process to ensure national security implications of a proposed sale are fully assessed.""
One of the most open economies in the world, Britain has sold some highly innovative firms to foreign buyers in recent years, including the semiconductor designer Arm to Japan's Softbank and pay-TV group Sky to Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). 
The London Stock Exchange is trying to fend off a $39 billion takeover approach launched this month by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.
SPECIAL STATUS
Cobham, launched in the 1930s by a British adventurer and explorer, employs 10,000 people. It has struggled in recent years, issuing a string of profit warnings in 2016 and 2017.
Russ Mould, investment director at platform AJ Bell, said investors could be disappointed in the timing of the intervention, coming two days after Cobham shareholders approved the deal. 
""Now investors are in limbo,"" he said. ""Although a muted share price reaction – with the shares trading not too far from Advent's offer level – suggests, rightly or wrongly, that the market expects the deal to go through."" 
Advent has a track record in buying British technology, having snapped up electronics company Laird for $1.65 billion last year, and Cobham investors approved the takeover on Monday. 
Some Cobham operations, such as its Advanced Electronic Solutions unit, have special security agreement status that allows them to bid for U.S. defense contracts. 
Cobham Chief Executive David Lockwood said on Monday that requirement would disappear under Advent ownership, enabling the group to combine infrastructure and share knowledge more quickly and easily within the company.
Lockwood said he had already held some discussions with government about the takeover, but would not go into details.
""Advent is committed to being a responsible steward of Cobham, encouraging its future growth and success,"" a spokesman for the U.S. group said. ""We will continue to engage constructively and cooperatively with the UK Government in this part of their review."" 

Cobham shares slipped 0.5%, with the stock at 160 pence per share, just below the offer price of 165 pence.

1682,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 08:28AM ET</span>","Overnight U.S. Funding Rate at 2.8%, Retracing From Tuesday Peak","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. money-market interest rate remained elevated for a third straight day, after rising to a record Tuesday.
The rate on overnight general collateral repurchase agreements, or repos, was at 2.8% early Wednesday, based on ICAP (LON:NXGN) pricing. On Tuesday, it jumped to 10%, about four times greater than last week’s levels, as cash reserves in the banking system remained out of balance with the volume of securities on dealer balance sheets.
The effective fed funds rate was set at 2.25% as of Monday, in line with the top of the Federal Reserve’s target range of 2% to 2.25%. The New York Fed will release Tuesday’s rate at 9 a.m.
The Fed will buy up to $75 billion of securities later Wednesday morning. It would follow a $53.2 billion liquidity injection Tuesday, the first in a decade, on attempt to calm market nerves as the jump in short-term rates could boost borrowing costs for companies and consumers. Surges are commonplace only around quarter- and month-end, so market participants had expected things might return to normal.
Securities eligible for collateral in the Fed operation include Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. In an overnight system repo, the Fed lends cash to primary dealers against Treasury securities or other collateral.
On Monday, the rate on overnight GC repo touched 8%, according to ICAP, amid the settlement of Treasury coupon auctions and the influx of corporate quarterly tax payments, possibly aggravated by last week’s bond-market selloff, in which investors sold securities back to dealers.
Later Wednesday, the central bank is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point at its policy meeting in Washington.
Separately, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, which is backed by overnight GC repo transactions, jumped to 5.25% as of Tuesday from 2.43% the prior session, New York Fed data show."
1683,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 08:26AM ET</span>","Facebook unveils new Portal video chat, TV streaming devices","By Katie Paul
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) unveiled new models of its Portal video chatting devices on Wednesday, making the company's first foray into TV streaming hardware but offering a limited selection of subscription services.
The launch comes as Facebook is trying to pivot toward more private forms of communication, after years of slowing user growth, data-sharing scandals and calls for change to its hands-off approach to content moderation.
The company is already one of the biggest global players in private messaging, with its WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram apps used by 2.4 billion people each month.
It is keeping the focus of its new Portal line on video calling, adding the capability for WhatsApp calls along with improvements to a wide-angle camera that keeps users in focus as they move about a room.
Facebook is also expanding Portal sales into countries including the UK, France and Australia, while lowering prices to more closely compete with industry-leading smart speakers from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that sell for under $100.
Standard models of the Portal, which ship on Oct. 15, will come in $129 and $179 versions. Portal TV will cost $149 and hit the shelves on Nov. 5.
Facebook is hoping the social nature of its products will be their selling point, allowing users to watch shows together while interacting via video call on the same screen.
""I think that in a couple years' time, if you have a smart streaming device that doesn't have a camera allowing you to video call people, you're not going to have a competitive product,"" said vice president of AR/VR Andrew Bosworth. ""I think this is the killer feature for a device like this.""
Bosworth also touted privacy protections like local processing of smart features on the devices, which means most user data will not be sent back to Facebook servers.
But Portal TV offers only a few music apps and has limited options for TV programing, meaning it could face a stiff challenge in attracting consumers used to content-rich rivals like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Roku.
At a demonstration in San Francisco on Tuesday, the only way to stream shows appeared to be via Facebook's Watch app. Executives said Portal TV would have Amazon's Prime Video app loaded by the time it is available.
The company declined to say whether it had approached other content providers like HBO, Hulu or Disney.
Facebook does not disclose how many Portals it has sold since the device's launch late last year, but hardware accounts for a tiny slice of the company's total sales.
The social media giant makes less than 2 percent of its revenue from non-advertising sources."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices cooled on Wednesday as Saudi Arabia's pledge to quickly restore production eased supply worries, while caution ahead of an expected U.S. interest rate cut kept wider financial markets in tight ranges.
European stocks were largely subdued, with luxury stocks one of the few sectors seeing activity. Swiss luxury goods group Richemont fell more than 5%, weighing on the pan-European STOXX 600 index, while Swatch declined 3.3% after a bearish note by UBS.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged 0.5% higher.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, edged down 0.02%.
Wall Street futures pointed to a softer opening.
Brent crude futures dipped 0.5% to $64.23 a barrel, having conceded a chunk of their gains made after the weekend attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) lost 0.8% to $58.86 per barrel.
Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Tuesday sought to reassure markets, saying the kingdom would restore its lost oil production by month-end having recovered supplies to customers to the levels they were prior to the weekend's attacks. The comments prompted oil prices to tumble 6% on Tuesday.
""I would think a spike in oil prices will likely prove to be short-term given that the global economy isn't doing too well,"" said Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One.
Still, heightened geopolitical tensions underpinned oil as well as some safe-haven assets such as U.S. bonds.
A U.S. official said on Tuesday the United States believes the attacks originated in southwestern Iran, an assessment that could heighten the rivalry between Tehran and Riyadh. Iran has denied involvement in the strikes.
Adding to uncertainties in the Middle East were exit polls from Israel's election, which showed the race too close to call suggesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fight for political survival could drag on.
Spot gold was steady at $1,501.34 per ounce. 
In a subdued session ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting later on Wednesday, Euro zone benchmark 10-year bond yields fell 2-3 basis points. Germany's 10-year bond yield dipped to -0.49%, holding below last week's six-week high of -0.43%.
Spain's bond market shrugged off news that the country will hold its fourth election in four years on Nov. 10, after rival parties failed to break a months-long impasse in a deeply fragmented parliament.
While a 25-basis point rate cut by the Fed is seen as near-certain, investors look to the statement and economic projections from Fed policymakers, given signs of deep disagreements among them.
""People are very cautious right now,"" said Christophe Barraud, at Market Securities in Paris. ""They're waiting for the Fed meeting and potential new development in Saudi Arabia.""
""For the Fed meeting, people are not betting on a big positive surprise.""
The ongoing U.S.-China trade war has raised policymakers' concerns about slowing factory output although resilient domestic consumption has given hawks some reasons to worry about cutting rates too hastily.
Possibly further complicating their discussions, short-term U.S. interest rates shot up this week, with overnight repo rates rising to 7%, due largely to seasonal factors such as huge payments for taxes and bond supply.
That prompted the New York Fed to conduct its first repo operation in more than a decade to inject funds to stressed money markets.
The New York Federal Reserve said late Tuesday it would conduct a repurchase agreement operation early on Wednesday ""in order to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target range of"" 2.00% to 2.25%.
Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said on Tuesday that the repo market squeeze makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will resume expansion of its balance sheet ""pretty soon.""
Also in focus is the Bank of Japan's policy meeting due Thursday. While the latest Reuters poll suggests the BOJ will keep its policy on hold, 28 of 41 economists expect it will ease its policy this year and 13 believe it may surprise by taking action at the Thursday meeting.
In currencies, sterling fell after British consumer prices in August grew at a their slowest pace since late 2016, while concerns about whether a last-minute Brexit deal was achievable acted as an added drag on the currency.
The pound fell 0.3% to $1.2457, but that followed a decent gain on Tuesday to $1.2528 on the back of optimism that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was trying to secure a Brexit deal with the European Union before the Oct. 31 deadline.
The lower-than-forecast rate comes ahead of the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting on Thursday. The BoE targets a 2% inflation rate.
Against the euro sterling was unchanged at 88.585 pence.

Against the yen, the dollar edged up 0.1% to 108.23 yen, below a seven-week high of 108.37 yen tested overnight.

The alleged offense, which could result in a fine if the bank is found to have broken rules, comes as Germany's biggest lender tries to improve its reputation with investors and relationship with regulators after years of misdeeds.
Deutsche Bank and the ECB declined to comment. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung first reported the news.
The securities at issue are known as AT1 and AT2 bonds.
The bonds, which emerged after the financial crisis, are designed to protect taxpayers from potential bailout costs if a bank runs into hardship by putting the risk in the hands of the holders of the bonds.
But it may defeat the purpose if the bank holds the bonds, which is why the ECB requires a bank to seek its authorization to do so.
Deutsche Bank sought authorization in 2014 for the purchase of the bonds, but it was denied, the people said. The lender continued to buy them anyway, in an attempt to create a liquid market, one of the people said.
The ECB eventually authorized Deutsche Bank to buy the bonds in 2017, but the ruling wasn't retroactive.
The ECB is now in a fact-finding phase to determine whether it should open a formal investigation, the people said.
Deutsche Bank is in the midst of a broad restructuring, involving job cuts and the exit of certain business lines in an effort to become profitable.

1686,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 07:33AM ET</span>","Bonds Rise Around World as Fed, Brexit Risk Set Scene for Easing","(Bloomberg) -- Global bonds rallied ahead of an expected interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve and as traders raised bets on a disruptive no-deal Brexit for the U.K.
Gilt yields fell, dragging rates on German bunds and Treasuries lower, as markets raised bets on the Bank of England following the Fed and other global peers in cutting interest rates by next year. The move gained momentum as European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker said the risk of the U.K. leaving the bloc without a deal on Oct. 31 was “palpable.”
While the pound has suffered from the prospect of the U.K. crashing out of the EU, gilts have acted as a haven for investors, rallying along with other debt this year. The BOE’s policy outlook is being held hostage by Brexit uncertainty, just as the European Central Bank and Fed move to ward off a global slowdown.
“The extent of the hawkish re-pricing going into tonight’s Federal Open Market Committee means there is little advantage of still being short now,” said Antoine Bouvet, a senior rates strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV.
The yield on benchmark 10-year gilts fell four basis points to 0.65%, while their German and U.S. counterparts dropped three basis points each. Bonds held the gains after bidding at a German 30-year auction came in stronger than last month’s sale, which sparked a sell-off on fears that negative yields were hurting demand from funds.
The move was also bolstered by U.K. data showing inflation slowed to take it further below the BOE’s target, a day ahead of its policy announcement. While the BOE is expected to hold rates Thursday, money markets are now factoring in 17 basis points of rate cuts by the end of next year.
“Low inflation and hard Brexit are not a good combo,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank AS. “Gilts are not that expensive.”"

The ECB is looking at Deutsche Bank’s buying of the notes over several years up until 2017, when it got approval for future deals, according to people familiar with the matter. Because the securities are designed to help banks absorb losses when they run into trouble, the regulator needs to sign off on any repurchases.
Deutsche Bank could be subject to a fine if formal proceedings are opened, according to the people, who asked for anonymity because the matter hasn’t been disclosed. Sueddeutsche Zeitung, which first reported the ECB’s deliberations late Tuesday, said a fine could reach twice the profits or savings a bank makes from unauthorized dealings, though it was unclear whether Deutsche Bank would be fined at all.
The ECB and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
The German lender has already paid more in fines and legal settlements than almost any other European bank since the start of 2008. While failing to get permission for bond purchases pales in comparison with other misconduct, another probe would be an unwelcome distraction for Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing after he said the bulk of the firm’s legal woes were behind it.
The transactions were conducted to ensure sufficient liquidity for investors in additional Tier 1 bonds, debt that can be written off if the lender’s capital ratio falls to a certain level, said one of the people. The securities have proven volatile over the past years because markets worried about the bank’s costly restructurings and large fines.
There are other reasons why banks may want to buy back their own debt. They include retiring bonds that no longer qualify as regulatory capital, or replacing them with notes that pay lower interest."

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 06:11AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why Asia's biggest economies are backing hydrogen fuel cell cars,"By Kevin Buckland
TOKYO (Reuters) - China, Japan and South Korea have set ambitious targets to put millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads by the end of the next decade at a cost of billions of dollars.
But to date, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have been upstaged by electric vehicles, which are increasingly becoming a mainstream option due to the success of Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) luxury cars as well as sales and production quotas set by China.
Critics argue FCVs may never amount to more than a niche technology. But proponents counter hydrogen is the cleanest energy source for autos available and that with time and more refueling infrastructure, it will gain acceptance.
AMBITIOUS TARGETS
China, far and away the world's biggest auto market with some 28 million vehicles sold annually, is aiming for more than 1 million FCVs in service by 2030. That compares with just 1,500 or so now, most of which are buses.
Japan, a market of more than 5 million vehicles annually, wants to have 800,000 FCVs sold by that time from around 3,400 currently. 
South Korea, which has a car market just one third the size of Japan, has set a target of 850,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. But as of end-2018, fewer than 900 have been sold.
WHY HYDROGEN?
Hydrogen's proponents point to how clean it is as an energy source as water and heat are the only byproducts and how it can be made from a number of sources, including methane, coal, water, even garbage. Resource-poor Japan sees hydrogen as a way to greater energy security.
They also argue that driving ranges and refueling times for FCVs are comparable to gasoline cars, whereas EVs require hours to recharge and provide only a few hundred kilometers of range.
Many backers in China and Japan see FCVs as complementing EVs rather than replacing them. In general, hydrogen is seen as the more efficient choice for heavier vehicles that drive longer distances, hence the current emphasis on city buses.
THE MAIN PLAYERS
Only a handful of automakers have made fuel cell passenger cars commercially available.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) launched the Mirai sedan at the end of 2014, but has sold fewer than 10,000 globally.  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) has offered the Nexo crossover since March last year and has sold just under 2,900 worldwide. It had sales of around 900 for its previous FCV model, the Tucson.
Honda Motor Co Ltd's (T:7267) Clarity Fuel Cell is available for lease, while Daimler AG's GLC F-CELL has been delivered to a handful of corporate and public sector clients.
Buses are seeing more demand. Both Toyota and Hyundai have offerings and have begun selling fuel cell components to bus makers, particularly in China.
Several Chinese manufacturers have developed their own buses, notably state-owned SAIC Motor (SS:600104), the nation's biggest automaker, and Geely Auto Group, which also owns the Volvo Cars and Lotus brands.
WHY HAVEN'T FUEL CELL CARS CAUGHT ON YET?
A lack of refueling stations, which are costly to build, is usually cited as the biggest obstacle to widespread adoption of FCVs. At the same time, the main reason cited for the lack of refueling infrastructure is that there are not enough FCVs to make them profitable.
Consumer worries about the risk of explosions are also a big hurdle and residents in Japan and South Korea have protested against the construction of hydrogen stations. This year, a hydrogen tank explosion in South Korea killed two people, which was followed by a blast at a Norway hydrogen station.
Then there's the cost. Heavy subsidies are needed to bring prices down to levels of gasoline-powered cars. Toyota's Mirai costs consumers just over 5 million yen ($46,200) after subsidies of 2.25 million yen. That's still about 50% more than a Camry.
Automakers contend that once sales volumes increase, economies of scale will make subsidies unnecessary.

1692,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 05:38AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Oil Majors' Dividends Stand out as Brent Settles Above $60,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were modestly higher after early trading on Wednesday, content to mark time ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision, which won’t come until after the European close.
Sentiment was helped by the partial pull-back in crude prices after Saudi Arabia said it would be pumping oil at full capacity again by the end of the month. That removes a key source of risk from Europe’s equity markets, given the negative impact on demand on a region that is a big net importer of oil and gas.
Even so, oil and gas stocks continued to attract bids.
Brent crude is still trading comfortably above the $60 level that most European majors need to cover their investment needs and dividend obligations. As such, that adds an extra level of certainty to the relatively high dividend yields that most of them offer.
According to data compiled by Investing.com, European oil and gas majors currently trade at the following dividend yields:
Repsol (MC:REP) - 6.41%
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Class A - 6.29%
  BP   (LON:BP) - 6.13%
  ENI   (MI:ENI) - 5.87%
  Total   SA (PA:TOTF) - 5.48%
Equinor ASA - 4.82%

Healthy cash flows for oil companies of course are generally bad news for their customers. As such,   Deutsche Post   (DE:DPWGn), the owner of DHL, was the biggest loser on the German DAX Wednesday, falling 2.0% after rival FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) profit warning late in New York on Tuesday. Swiss-based logistics group Kuehne & Nagel (SIX:KNIN) was also down 2.4%, although U.K.-based   Royal Mail   (LON:RMG) escaped collateral damage, rising 0.6% by 5 AM ET.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up less than 0.1% at 389.54, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.2% and the Italian FTSE MIB led the way with a 0.5% gain, recovering after Tuesday’s dip. Italian assets were hit by the decision of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to split from the Democratic Party along with a number of senior allies. However, the group will still support the new governing coalition. In similar vein, Spain’s IBEX 35 rose 0.1%, shrugging off the prospect of yet another election after King Felipe called time on Pedro Sanchez’ minority left-wing government.
“Markets agree that this is no big deal,” said Capital Economics analyst Angel Talavera via Twitter. “(The) economy continues to be much more dependent on external factors as well as its position in the cycle than to who is in power in Madrid.”"
1693,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 05:16AM ET</span>",EDF says no need to close nuclear reactors over welding problems,"By Geert De Clercq
PARIS (Reuters) - French utility EDF (PA:EDF) said on Wednesday there was no need to halt any of its nuclear reactors for now following the discovery of problems with weldings in their steam generators last week.
State-controlled EDF said in a statement it had identified problems with 16 generators installed in six operating reactors in plants in France. It also discovered issues with components not yet in service, notably at the nuclear plant it is building in Flamanville, northern France.
EDF, whose shares rose nearly 4% in early trade, said that at the current stage of investigations the issues that had been identified do not adversely affect the components' fitness for service and do not require immediate action.
A spokeswoman for French nuclear regulator ASN said it had no comment on EDF's statement and said it was still investigating the weldings problem. She did not say when ASN might rule on the matter.
""There is still the risk that the French nuclear safety authority will decide that unplanned outages will be required for repairs, but today's announcement implies that this would only be the case for just over 10% of EDF's operating reactors,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note.
Regis Clement, deputy head of EDF's nuclear fleet, told reporters on a call that not a single component in EDF's nuclear reactors was at risk due to the welding problems.
""The availability of our reactors in the weeks and months ahead is not at risk. We are confident for the winter ahead,"" he said.
He added that EDF was investigating the issue, but not planning repairs. He declined to comment on any further impact on the already long-delayed Flamanville construction schedule.
France is a major power exporter and EDF's stable nuclear output plays a key role in balancing electricity flows in Europe, providing backup for intermittent solar and wind power.
In the autumn of 2016, the regulator, ASN, ordered EDF to close up to a third of its reactors for weeks for safety checks and repairs following problems with Framatome-made components, which caused power prices to spike 60 percent in two months.
FRAMATOME INSPECTION
On Wednesday, the ASN spokeswoman also said the regulator had asked EDF for additional information and was set to carry out an inspection at the Saint-Marcel plant in western France of EDF's reactor manufacturing unit Framatome.
A London-based trader said the market remained cautious while it waited for a final ASN decision.
The problems were identified in reactors no. 3 and 4 at Blayais, reactor no. 3 at Bugey, reactor no. 2 at Fessenheim, reactor no. 4 at Dampierre-en-Burly and reactor no. 2 at Paluel, EDF said.
The defects in components not yet in service were found in the four steam generators and the pressurizer at the Flamanville 3 EPR, as well as three new steam generators destined for those in reactor units no. 5 and 6 at Gravelines, it added.
EDF's share price have recovered most of the losses incurred since EDF first announced the weldings problems on Sept. 10, when its shares dropped about 7 percent.
French forward power prices were broadly lower in early trade as worries about potential reactor closures eased. The front-month contract lost 5% to 47 euros a megawatt hour (MWh). The year-ahead baseload contract was down 1.8% at 52.50 euros/MWh.
British and Dutch gas prices for October delivery fell around 5% after EDF's comments. Prices jumped last week when the problems first emerged as demand for gas, which can be used in power generation, rose on concern about nuclear shutdowns.
The British month-ahead gas price < TRGBNBPMc1>, which spiked 20% last week, fell 5.7% to 33.15 pence per therm. The Dutch month-ahead gas price < TRNLTTFMc1>, which jumped 18% last week, fell 5.5% to 12.95 euros per megawatt hour."
1694,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 05:08AM ET</span>",More Investors Are Seeing Global Yield Lows in Rear View Mirror,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond bulls had a great August, as a ferocious rally drove yields in the world’s biggest markets to record lows. Now some investors say that’s as low as they’ll go.
The Federal Reserve will announce its next policy decision Wednesday, and the Bank of Japan on Thursday. Those events might normally stir up bond prices, even without this week’s upheaval in global money markets. But expectations for the extent of easing have dimmed, leading some to conclude that benchmark yields troughed a few weeks ago.
An aggressive sell-off this month has reversed much of the yield drop. For instance, 30-year Treasury yields sank to an all-time low of 1.90% in late August, from above 2.5% at the end of July. The yield is back up to about 2.25%. Investors are yanking money from Treasury exchange-traded funds, including the largest drain in five years from BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s iShares ETF focused on the belly of the curve. While some investors have simply taken to the sidelines, others are talking about a sea-change that could remove the froth from major bond markets.
“The move lower in yields -- the deflation trade -- looks overdone,” said Mark Nash, London-based head of fixed income at asset manager Merian Global Investors. “Now it’s the time to go the other way.”
He’s more confident than most in positioning for higher yields, because he sees improvements on several fronts: global growth, Brexit, Italy’s political problems and the trade war. Even the news of a drone attack on a Saudi oil facility this past weekend, which drove some defensive buying of U.S. government debt, hasn’t shaken his outlook.
Plenty of investors would disagree. Last month’s stampede left contrarians’ portfolios in tatters. Kathryn Kaminski, chief research strategist and portfolio manager at AlphaSimplex Group, warns against viewing this month’s jump in yields as a clear signal that the bull run is over.
Home on the Range
That said, she’s not calling for new lows. The investment firm’s managed-futures strategy, which she helps guide, trimmed its bullish Treasury wagers in recent months as rising volatility dimmed their risk-weighted appeal.
Her view that yields will stay within a relatively narrow range is a popular one for investors struggling to read a signal from the clamor of a possible oil supply shock, trade-policy brinksmanship and tweet storms from President Donald Trump.
Many Wall Street analysts this week highlighted their preference for a neutral stance on global rates, pending further information from the Fed on Wednesday, when it’s widely expected to cut rates by a quarter point for the second meeting in a row. But yields have been buoyed by expectations that Chairman Jerome Powell might push back on market positioning for at least one more cut this year, and potentially two in 2020.
Investors looking for a more-compelling bear case in government markets right now might be more drawn to the U.K. Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, is positioning for gilt yields to climb because he suspects markets are overestimating the extent of easing by the Bank of England. The 10-year U.K. bond’s yield got as low as 0.34% early this month before shooting up to 0.68%.
Monetary Exhaustion
From a bigger-picture standpoint, Dowding sees the U.K. market as an early mover in a broader theme. That is, the burden of supporting ailing economies will shift from central banks to governments, and the downward pressure on yields from monetary stimulus over the past decade will give way to upward pressure from increased government spending. That ought to break the gravitational pull on yields.
“We think we are seeing this globally: we’ve reached the limits of monetary policy and it’s time for fiscal policy to play a bigger role,” Dowding said. He sees the U.K. leading this shift, noting the spending pledged this month to cushion the economy from a potentially messy exit from the European Union.
“We could be close to completely ending the chapter on austerity,” he said. Lawmakers may be starting to recognize that with yields so low, “it’s creating a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deploy fiscal policy in a material way to invest in the economy’s long-term interests.”
In the U.S., where the government is already racking up deficits, PGIM Fixed Income’s Michael Collins says swelling debt sales are finally starting to weigh on Treasuries.
“We have a big underweight position in U.S. Treasuries even though the yields are attractive versus other government bonds,” the portfolio manager said. “There’s no reason to buy Treasuries which have an unending supply.”
But Mark Kiesel at Pacific Investment Management Co. says the push for more spending in the U.S. -- which he sees as bipartisan -- won’t necessarily spur sustainably higher yields. He says one of the more immediate reasons why the market won’t revisit the August lows any time soon is that Trump won’t want to push a hostile trade policy -- with all its attendant risks to growth -- all the way to the 2020 election.
“Trump wants to get re-elected, so you may see him do some things near-term that potentially keep the economy going,” Kiesel said. For this reason he says the 10-year yield can climb back to 2%, but at that rate, he said, “I’ll be buying.”

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 04:51AM ET</span>",Germany backs draft law to protect parcel delivery drivers,"By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German cabinet approved a draft law on Wednesday to force logistics and ecommerce companies that outsource deliveries to ensure that their subcontractors pay proper social security contributions for their drivers.
The legislation was proposed after police launched nationwide raids on subcontracting delivery firms in February and uncovered numerous cases of social security fraud and drivers working off the books.
""Sub-sub-sub contractors are working in many areas. Wages are being pushed down and social insurance contributions are not being made and we won't put up with this any longer,"" Labour Minister Hubertus Heil told journalists.
""Often black sheep in this sector are exploiting people from central and eastern Europe. That distorts competition.""
Labour lawyers say the new rules are likely to push up costs for those logistics and ecommerce companies which have turned a blind eye to the way subcontractors treated workers in the past.
Most logistics companies in Germany use subcontractors, including Amazon (O:AMZN), which is now also expanding its own delivery network.
Bernd Gschaider, Germany director for Amazon Logistics, told Reuters on Tuesday the proposed legislation would not have any impact on Amazon's business because it already demanded its subcontractors complied with German labour law.
Amazon's move into logistics poses a threat to players like former state monopoly  Deutsche Post  DHL (DE:DPWGn), which uses relatively well paid employees to do its deliveries rather than subcontractors.
While booming ecommerce has driven a surge in parcel volumes in recent years, fierce competition among logistics companies has meant that prices have not kept pace with costs, prompting Deutsche Post to issue a profit warning last year.
""We want fair competition. We don't want decent companies to be the dumb ones,"" Heil said.
The minister made his comments during a visit to a Deutsche Post distribution centre on the outskirts of Berlin, where employees were loading vans with parcels.
""This company shows that you can do it in a decent way. Workers here are permanently employed, with proper social insurance, decent working conditions and fair wages,"" Heil said.
The proposed legislation seeks to extend to the parcel sector rules that already cover the construction and meat processing sectors: these make companies liable if their subcontractors fail to pay social security contributions for their workers.
Heil said he hoped parliament, where the coalition government has a clear majority, would approve the law before Christmas, the busiest season for the parcel sector.
The government is also planning a law to fight illicit employment more broadly and has pledged to increase the number of customs police who are responsible for enforcing labour laws."
1696,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 04:26AM ET</span>","Airbus revises up jet demand, trims traffic growth","By Tim Hepher
LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus on Wednesday revised up forecasts for jetliner demand in the next 20 years led by growth in the new industrial hubs of Asia, while voicing alarm over rising protectionism.
The European planemaker, revising an annual 20-year forecast that sheds light on economic trends across the globe, predicted the world's fleet would more than double to 47,680 jets by 2038.
That is slightly smaller than the future fleet Airbus had anticipated in a comparable forecast one year ago, as airlines squeeze extra productivity out of their aircraft by adding more and slimmer seats or using them for longer periods of the day.
But the demand for new jets needed to reach that total has been revised upwards because Airbus believes airlines will replace a greater proportion of aircraft than previously anticipated, mainly to take advantage of extra fuel savings.
Airbus said it now expects airlines and leasing companies to take delivery of 39,210 new passenger jets and freighters over the next two decades compared to 37,389 previously forecast.
Airbus expects 36% of these new deliveries to replace existing aircraft with the rest slated to meet growth in demand, with traffic expected roughly to double over the next 15 years.
A year ago, Airbus had predicted that just 29% of future deliveries would be replacing existing jets.
Airbus however trimmed its forecast for average traffic growth to 4.3% a year from 4.4% in its previous report.
Recent airline industry statistics suggest traffic is growing but at a slower rate this year amid trade tensions.
ASIA LEADS
Growth continues to be dominated by Asia, where traffic is due to treble over the next 20 years. China's domestic market is expected to leapfrog the United States and Western Europe to become the largest aviation hub, while India and new manufacturing markets like Vietnam are growing the fastest.
But the industry also faces a squall of new pressures from trade tensions, the partial unwinding of globalization and an anti-flying campaign from climate activists, notably in Europe.
""Increased protectionism and other geopolitical risks remain a concern,"" Airbus said in its Global Market Forecast.
Adding to that worry is a weak freight market this year.
Addressing an increasingly vocal debate on emissions, in a week that Swedish teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg pressed the U.S. Congress for action on climate change, Airbus said the industry could still achieve carbon-neutral growth while connecting more people due to more efficient planes. 
Environmental groups backing a global ""climate strike"" say more radical steps are needed to meet such goals.
Airbus revised up its demand forecast for the industry's most-sold single-aisle jets by 4% to 29,720 planes but cut the medium segment including its A330neo by 2% to 5,370.
It followed U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) in scrapping separate forecasts for the world's largest four-engined aircraft such as the Airbus A380 or Boeing 747. Airbus decided in February halt production of the double-decker A380 due to weak demand.
It now includes these aircraft with the largest twin-engined jets, with the resulting combined category up 22% to 4,120 jets.
Airbus raised its 20-year forecast for after-sales services like maintenance, pilot training and cabin upgrades to $4.9 trillion from $4.6 trillion.

Once focused mainly on building and delivering their jets, Airbus, Boeing and other plane manufacturers are stepping up competition with their own suppliers and customers for a slice of this market, which is driven by the size of the global fleet.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India plans to invite bids from global firms for the first time for coal mining blocks before end-2019, sources familiar with the matter said, a move that would end  Coal India  Ltd's near-monopoly for the fuel as the nation tries to cut imports.
Coal is among the top five commodities imported by India, one of the world's largest consumers of the fuel. Coal imports are surging after the government failed to open the industry to competition, despite having passed a liberalization policy 19 months ago.
The coal block auctions are intended to attract global miners such as  Glencore  PLC (L:GLEN), BHP Group (AX:BHP),  Anglo American  PLC (L:AAL) and  Peabody Energy Corp  (N:BTU).
The government aims to allow companies with winning bids to begin development of the coal blocks - which hold proven reserves - by early 2020, the three sources said.
It is not clear when the government expects to see first output from the coal blocks. India's Ministry of Coal did not respond to a request for comment.
Total imports of thermal coal - used mainly for power generation - rose by about a third during the quarter ended June 30 to 56.23 million tonnes as compared with the same period last year, according to government data reviewed by Reuters.
Coal India (NS:COAL) and a small stated-owned company are the only firms currently allowed to mine and sell coal in India. India does allow some power, steel, cement and aluminum companies to mine coal for their own captive use."
