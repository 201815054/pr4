Petrobras said in a statement that a calculation made in December forecast a future deficit in its Petros Fundacao pension fund of 33.7 billion reais ($7.26 billion).
The company said it would make an immediate payment of 2 billion reais ($431 million) plus extraordinary contributions over the next 25 years. In total, it said it would inject 15.6 billion reais ($3.4 billion) into the pension fund.
The rest of the funds will be paid by other contributors, including the fuel distribution company  Petrobras Distribuidora  (SA:BRDT3), which was a unit of Petrobras before being sold, and employees."
1,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 06:36PM ET</span>","From Exxon to Royal Caribbean Cruises, U.S. companies rush to hoard cash","By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corporate America is gearing up for leaner times.
From  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) to  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL), companies rushed to borrow more money and boost their cash coffers on Tuesday, as the market turmoil fueled by a plunge in oil prices and the global coronavirus outbreak raised the prospect of an economic downturn.
""It's companies loading up on cash when you can get it. They are effectively building up that war chest,"" said Jeremy Swan, managing principal at accounting and tax advisory firm CohnReznick LLP.
Royal Caribbean said on Tuesday it increased its credit capacity by $550 million to boost liquidity. The company's stock plunged this month, amid concerns that the coronavirus outbreak would curtail travel. 
""These are extraordinary times and we are taking these steps to manage the company prudently and conservatively,"" Royal Caribbean Cruises Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Fain said in a statement.
Exxon, which has one of the corporate world's strongest balance sheets, filed paperwork on Tuesday for an unspecified board offering for what it called general corporate purposes, as the oil major grapples with the collapse in Brent crude (LCOc1) prices.
Oreo maker  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) on Monday announced a $2.5 billion credit facility, in addition to a similar agreement worth $1.5 billion agreed less than two weeks ago. 
United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) also said on Tuesday it had raised an extra $2 billion in financing while slashing its 2020 capital expenditures by more than a third. 
""We also believe we have good options to raise additional liquidity in the weeks to come, if needed,"" United President Scott Kirby said. 
Other companies which chose not to raise new funds yet touted their financial strength to calm investors. In an investor presentation on Tuesday,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) flagged more than $7.3 billion in cash and unused bank lending in reserve. 
""American Airlines has more liquidity than any other airline in the world, which is exactly where we want to be in an environment like this and exactly why indeed we've held so much for so long,"" American Airlines Chairman and CEO Doug Parker said at a conference on Tuesday. 
Debt-laden companies in service sectors hit by reduced tourism and discretionary spending, such as airlines, cruise lines, movie theaters, gaming companies and hotel chains, are particularly vulnerable, according to Fitch Ratings.

""What we've seen in this market is that stability today isn't necessarily stability tomorrow,"" Swan said.

3,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 06:13PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 11,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - The stock market bounced back today on anticipation that the White House could get a stimulus package out sooner rather than later.
But the wild cards still exist as to whether Congress will go along with President Donald Trump’s push for a payroll tax reduction and whether paid sick leave will also come about.
Looking to Wednesday the results of more Democratic primaries could affect the markets as they did last week, while there will be inflation data on which to trade if the market can calm down and oil inventories numbers as well.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Another Biden Bounce?
If anyone remembers last week’s market moves, the major indexes surged following former Vice President Joe Biden’s strong showing in the Super Tuesday Democratic Primaries.
Biden is seen as much more friendly to Wall Street than rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose main platform is Medicare for all, which would tank health insurance stocks.
Tonight, voters in six states go to the polls: Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington.
Of those states, Michigan will be the most closely watched. Trump won Michigan in 2016 by the narrowest margin in the state’s history, giving 16 electoral votes in an important swing state to the current president.
2. Oil Inventories Seen Rising With Crude in Turmoil
Oil prices managed to rebound today, following Wall Street’s rise.
But keeping the rise somewhat in check was the promise of more Saudi crude hitting the market.
Amin Nasser, CEO of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), said the oil giant would increase supply to 12.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in April for customers inside the kingdom and abroad. That's 300,000 bpd above its maximum production capacity.
Tomorrow the Energy Information Administration will issue its weekly report on oil inventories.
U.S. crude stockpiles are expected to have risen by 2.27 million barrels for the week ended March 6, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
3. Retail Inflation on Tap
On the economic calendar, the latest data on retail inflation will come before the bell.
The Labor Department issue the consumer price index (CPI) for February at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that the CPI rose 0.2% last month, compared with a 0.1% rise in January, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have risen 0.2% in February."
4,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>",College textbook merger raises 'serious concern' among U.S. lawmakers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers expressed serious concern on Tuesday about the effect of a planned merger of college textbook publishers Cengage Learning Holdings II and McGraw-Hill (NYSE:SPGI) Education Inc, saying the deal would create a new industry leader with nearly half the market.
Representatives David Cicilline, chair of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, and Jan Schakowsky, chair of an Energy and Commerce consumer protection panel, urged the Justice Department to scrutinize the merger to ensure it is legal under antitrust law.
In the letter, Cicilline and Schakowsky noted how few college textbook makers were left in the market and that prices had risen 184% since 1998.
""It has also been reported that the merging companies are working to convert the market to all-digital course materials through an 'inclusive access' model, in which students are automatically billed for subscription access to textbooks,"" the lawmakers wrote.
They said an all-digital model would prevent students from shopping around to get cheaper prices, and ""destroy"" the used book market.
A spokeswoman for Cengage said: ""We continue to have a constructive dialogue ongoing with Department of Justice and other regulators outside the U.S.""
In their letter, the lawmakers estimated that Cengage has 24% of the market while McGraw-Hill has 21%. This means the deal, which was announced in May 2019, would create a giant with about 45% of the market.
The current market leader, Pearson, has about 40 percent of the market, while Wiley has about 7 percent."

Boville joined the bank in 2012 and was responsible for designing, building and running the firm's Cloud Services."
6,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 04:58PM ET</span>",Reasons for optimism - and wariness - about the U.S. stock market,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A day after Wall Street suffered its worst one-day drop since the financial crisis, investors are faced with an unfamiliar dilemma: bet that stocks will bounce back from the cusp of a bear market, or avoid scooping them up for now over fears they are far from a bottom.
While investors have been rewarded for buying the dip during the 11-year bull market, the twin shocks of a global coronavirus epidemic and oil-price plunge have heightened uncertainty and shaken faith in strategies that have worked in recent years.
Here are four reasons to buy now, and four more that argue for a wait-and-see approach.
TIME TO BUY
The cavalry is coming: More stimulus could soon be coming from central banks and governments around the world. Japan on Tuesday announced about $4 billion in spending to cope with the coronavirus' economic impact, while U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he will be taking ""major"" steps to gird the economy, including a possible payroll tax cut.
U.S. stocks rose nearly 5% on Tuesday, fueled by hopes for stimulus measures.
Paying dividends: The cratering of U.S. Treasury yields to well below 1% may drive investors into dividend-paying stocks.
Three-fourths of S&P 500 companies had dividends yielding above the 10-year Treasury note as of Friday, according to commentary from U.S. Bank Wealth Management, ""providing investors with both income and longer-term price appreciation potential.""
""The dividend income profile of U.S. equities has improved,"" according to the U.S. Bank Wealth Management market update.
Playing the rebound: Even if the economy is in a recession, the average decline historically for the S&P 500 coinciding with a downturn is 28%, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services. But, Lerner said in a report, ""once stocks find their low during a recession, a year later markets have climbed an average of 32% and a median of 37%.""
""Even if we were to see further weakness near term, markets would still be up double-digits from (Monday's) level a year later, if past precedent holds,"" Lerner said.
A more fearful market: The sell-off, in particular Monday's big drop, indicates that ""fear is now in the market"" and showed behavior that is almost the opposite of the complacent behavior seen at the start of 2020, Lerner said in an interview. For example, the put-to-call ratio, a measure of investor protection against the downside for stocks, was at its highest since late December 2018, when the market bottomed during that slide.
""When expectations are low,"" Lerner said, ""a little bit of good news could go a long way.""
STAY WARY
No clear end to the uncertainty: Investors have had difficulty trying to model the coronavirus' ultimate impact on the economy, with Monday's oil price shock exacerbating the uncertainty.
""A durable bottom in stocks requires neutralizing the virus’ negative economic and earnings impact,"" Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, said in emailed commentary. ""The virus has injected huge uncertainty around consumer spending, the job market and business sentiment.""
Economy may endure recession: On the heels of Monday's steep sell-off, investors said stocks were increasingly pricing in a recession. Market slides have ranged widely during recessions, but in the last one, during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the S&P 500 tumbled more than 50%.
Running out of silver bullets: While investors are hoping stimulus will help soothe markets, there is some doubt on how much it will help, especially from central banks that have already gone through a cycle of easing monetary policy.
Central banks' ""limited firepower compared to 2008, coupled with their inability to solve a global pandemic (absent coordinated fiscal and public health leadership), is driving tail risks higher,"" BofA Global Research said in a report.
Falling from a peak: Even with the pullback, some investors say stocks are not cheap. The valuation of the S&P 500, on a forward price-to-earnings ratio, climbed in February to its highest level since 2002, according to Refinitiv Datastream, following Wall Street's roughly 30% gain last year.
""It is too early to start buying simply on the basis that equity indices have sold off from their all-time highs,"" said Clark Fenton, portfolio manager of diversified returns at RWC Partners, in an emailed commentary."
7,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 04:51PM ET</span>","Brazil stocks jump 7% in biggest gain since 2009, FX intervention boosts real","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks chalked up their biggest one-day rise in 11 years on Tuesday, on growing hopes for global economic stimulus measures and as investors bought stocks battered down the previous day in the biggest selloff since 1998.
Shares in oil giant Petrobras and miner Vale led the rebound, rising 8.7% and 18.1%, respectively, while the central bank's third intervention in the spot foreign exchange market in two days helped drive the real's biggest rally this year.
A day after the real had slumped to a record low against the dollar, the central bank sold $2 billion on the spot market in the morning, bringing its FX intervention this week to $5.465 billion.
Local markets got a lift from the global relief rally, which saw Wall Street soar more than 4.5% as bargain hunting and hopes of government stimulus calmed investors' fears surrounding the coronavirus and growing signs of imminent recession.
""For those with a long-term investment horizon who weren't already invested (in stocks), this is an excellent time to buy shares,"" Rico Investimentos, a brokerage in Sao Paulo, said in a client note on Tuesday.
""For those already invested and with cash to take advantage of opportunities, the is also a very opportune time (to buy),"" they added.
Preferred shares in state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras (SA:PETR4), surged as much as 16% before easing back to close up 8.7%, and miner Vale SA's (SA:VALE3) 18% rally was its biggest rise since January, 1999.
On Monday, Petrobras shares sank 30%, their biggest ever one-day loss, which wiped almost 100 billion reais off its market value.
Brazil's real rose 1.7% to close at 4.6457 per dollar (BRBY), a day after slumping to an all-time low close to 4.80 per dollar. Some analysts said selling pressure on the real is likely to return soon, which will force the central bank to take even bolder action.
""Until now, the central bank has maintained discretion regarding these interventions, announcing them on a daily basis at the expense of a medium-term intervention plan,"" Citi strategists wrote in a client note on Tuesday.
""With the escalation of the Covid-19 outbreak worldwide, the likelihood of the central bank announcing a FX intervention plan is increasing,"" they said."

Investing.com - Cloud company Cloudera jumped in after-hours trade Monday after delivering a surprise fourth-quarter profit.
Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) was up 13% in postmarket trade.
The company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $0.04 on revenue of $211.7 million, compared with estimates for a loss of $0.03 loss and revenue of $221.64.
The company guided first-quarter sales within a range of $202 million to $207 million, matching forecasts of $206.18 million and earnings per share in a range of -$0.01 to $0.01, better than estimates for a $0.04 loss.
Subscription revenue, which makes up the bulk of total revenue, rose 48% to $182 million.
""I am especially pleased that we're seeing strong interest in CDP, with many customers across our base building plans for CDP Public Cloud adoption,"" said CEO Rob Bearden.
Full-year sales were expected in a range of $860 million to $880 million, in line with expectations for $866.09 million."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exchange-traded funds that invest in cannabis stocks rebounded Tuesday, one day after a global equity rout dropped them to all-time lows.
The $509 million ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (P:MJ) gained 2.2% in afternoon trade, while the $318 million Horizon Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (TO:HMMJ) rose 1.8% during a market rally that pushed the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 up nearly 2.8%.
Both funds are down more than 30% for the year to date, extending a selloff that began in spring of 2019 when lackluster sales, high debt levels and concerns about the slow pace of U.S. regulation began to weigh heavily on the industry.
Concerns about supply chain issues and a slowdown in consumer spending as a result of the rapidly-spreading coronavirus are weighing heavily on the sector, which was already facing declining fundamentals, said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations.
""You're seeing a broad liquidation of any sectors that had weakness whatsoever,"" Underhill said.
At the same time, cannabis companies are more popular among retail investors than institutional investors, making them more prone to rapid changes in sentiment, Underhill added.
""This is the downside of having a sector without a lot of institutional shareholder ballast,"" Underhill said.
Shares of large cannabis companies such as Canopy Growth Corp (TO:WEED) and Cronos Group Inc (TO:CRON) are down more than 20% over the past month while shares of  Tilray Inc  (O:TLRY) have tumbled 54% over the same time.
Despite those share price declines, there are signs that exchange-traded fund investors are staying the course, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at New York based CFRA. Funds such as the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF have not seen the same sort of outflows that the stock declines would suggest, Rosenbluth said, suggesting that the fund investors remain bullish on the sector.
""Investors that have chosen this as a long-term theme have remained committed rather than fleeing as the stocks inside have sold off,"" Rosenbluth said."
10,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 04:06PM ET</span>","More cleaning, few visitors on Chicago, London trading pits amid coronavirus","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Exchange operators in Chicago and London are making contingency plans and stepping up cleaning for the world's last remaining open-outcry futures and options trading floors as the global spread of coronavirus spooks markets.
The exchanges are seeking to avoid disruptions linked to the virus, which has roiled equities and commodities prices worldwide.
CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME) has restricted large tour groups from its trading floor in Chicago and asked customers and staff to keep out ""non-essential"" visitors, according to a notice sent to clients on Monday. It said no one who has recently visited Asia or Italy, which have been hit hard by the virus, should be on the floor.
If the floor is closed, all markets will remain available for trading electronically, according to CME. The company, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, asked employees and clients to test their ability to connect to its systems remotely.
""Out of an abundance of caution, we disinfected the entire trading floor space over the weekend,"" CME said in the notice it shared with Reuters. ""We will continue our increased cleaning procedures on the floor and common areas as well."" 
Open-outcry trading was a once-raucous tradition in which traders jostled and screamed to execute orders in pits packed with people. The practice has declined sharply since the rise of computerized trading. CME closed most open-outcry futures pits in 2015, although products like Eurodollar and grain options are still traded in pits. 
The London Metal Exchange, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, has made contingency plans to relocate or ditch open-outcry trading if coronavirus worsens in Britain. In a circle of padded, red-leather seats, traders use arcane hand signals in five or 10-minute bursts of intense trading at the world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals.
""Contingency plans for the ring are dependent on exact circumstances but could include the relocation of the ring to our recovery site in Chelmsford or, if necessary, switching from ring-based to electronic price discovery,"" the LME said in an emailed statement.
The health risks of working on a trading floor have dropped as the number of open-outcry traders dwindles, traders said. Open-outcry traders have been known to come to work when they are sick because otherwise they do not make money. 

""Everyone has skin in the game to make sure we follow all the cleanliness protocols,"" said Virginia McGathey, president of McGathey Commodities who trades in grain options pits.

Investing.com - Wall Street closed sharply higher Tuesday in what was a turbulent session, with the broader market swinging between gains and losses as investors weighed up stimulus pledges from the White House against the ongoing spread of the novel coronavirus.
The S&P 500 rallied to end up 4.9%, Nasdaq Composite surged 4.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.9%, or 1,163 points.
Several stimulus pledges from the Trump administration helped the broader market recover from its worst day since 2008. But it wasn't a straight-line recovery as uncertainty about the timing of the stimulus, including payroll tax cuts, weighed on investor sentiment.
President Donald Trump reportedly cleared up some of the uncertainty as reports suggested the payroll tax relief may be permanent.
Trump reportedly told Republican senators on Tuesday that he wants a payroll tax holiday through the November election so that taxes won’t go back up before voters decide whether to return him to office, Bloomberg reported, citing three people familiar with the president’s remarks. He also floated the idea of a permant suspension, CNBC reported.
The president also suggested supporting cash-strapped oil and gas and travel companies hit by the impact from coronavirus outbreak, sending travel and energy sectors sharply higher.
The announcement arrived just after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said insurance companies would cover coronavirus treatment and also waive co-payment for testing.
""All the insurance companies here, either today or before today, have agreed to waive all co-pays on coronavirus testing and coronavirus treatment in their benefit plans,” Pence said. ""Medicare and Medicaid already made it clear to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries that coronavirus would be covered and treatment.""
Tech led the broader move higher, as investors took advantages of a slump in FANG stocks, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rising more than 4% and touted as good rebound opportunities.  
""Three FANG stocks (Facebook Amazon, Alphabet) seem like a good place to look for a rebound from one of the most significant market pullbacks in years,"" Baird said.
Oil, which had led the historic sell-off on Wall Street a day earlier, rebounded 8% on hopes that talks between OPEC and Russia remain possible to avert a potential price war. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said on Tuesday the bank is ""very open"" to acquisitions, especially those that would speed the growth of its existing businesses. 
""""We're ... very open to the proposition of acquisitions that fill gaps or accelerate elements of our growth plan,"" Scherr said at a conference convened via conference call and webcast, rather than in-person, due to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak.
There has been wide investor speculation about Goldman's appetite and ability to do mergers or acquisitions since rival Wall Street bank  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) announced plans last month to buy discount broker E*Trade (O:ETFC).
Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon has set ambitious targets for the bank to grow its fledgling online consumer bank, Marcus, its credit card business and cash management platform. But industry insiders are skeptical that it can grow quickly without doing a deal.
Scherr said the bank is not currently looking to do ""larger material transactions ... in the near term.""
""I think you'll find us to be much more acquisitive in the context of accelerating and facilitating the growth of business initiatives that are there, none of which would necessarily present themselves as... material to the firm overall,"" he added.
Scherr also touched on the coronavirus and its impact on the bank's day-to-day operations and markets. 
He said the bank currently has no known cases of coronavirus among its staff, but that it continues to roll out precautionary measures, including splitting teams up to work at separate locations and having some staff work from home on a rotating basis. 

Scherr said the bank is monitoring risk across all market sectors and has seen a ""reduction broadly in liquidity"" and some challenges in the ""cost of funding."" But he said there are no major signs that corporate clients are under stress.

The postponement of the March 20 jury trial was a precautionary measure due to the number of people traveling to attend, according to a spokesman for New York Attorney General Letitia James. 
A new trial was not set but a hearing will be held April 14 to decide next steps in the case, which is in state court in Suffolk County on New York's Long Island.
The case is the first against a wide range of companies -- drug makers, distributors and pharmacy chains -- and was brought by the state of New York and the suburban New York City counties of Suffolk and Nassau. 
Analysts have been watching to see if the companies would settle before the trial, which could provide a framework for a deal to resolve thousands of lawsuits against the companies.
The last opioid trial that was scheduled to start in October led to a last-minute $260 million settlement between two Ohio counties and three major drug distributors and Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA).
The October trial also helped push drug distributors McKesson,  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) and drugmakers Teva and J&J to propose settling all of the cases against them for $48 billion, although they have struggled to secure support for the deal.
More than 3,000 lawsuits, which have mostly been brought by state and local governments, are pending against drug companies over the opioid crisis. Many of them are consolidated before a federal judge in Cleveland.
In the only major opioid trial, J&J was ordered to pay $465 million to Oklahoma last year to help alleviate the epidemic.
More than 400,000 overdose deaths have been attributed to opioids in the United States since 1997, and the lawsuits generally accuse the companies of downplaying the risks of the drugs or failing to stop suspicious orders.
 Mallinckrodt  Plc (N:MNK) last month proposed a $1.6 billion global settlement, and Purdue Pharma LP has a proposed a deal to settle its cases for at least $10 billion. 

The companies have denied wrongdoing. Drugmakers argued their products carried government-approved warning labels while distributors had argued that their role was to make sure medicines prescribed by licensed doctors were available for patients.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO tells Congress bank has doubled down on regulatory issues,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - New  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) Chief Executive Charlie Scharf testified on Tuesday that substantial change was underway at the bank as lawmakers grilled him on the status of its remediation efforts and contingency plans related to coronavirus.
""We are putting a substantially different group of people in charge of these issues,"" he told members of the House Financial Services Committee.
Since taking over the scandal-plagued bank late last year, Scharf has shaken up its leadership and overhauled the bank's business lines, winning over some regulators in the process.
Last week the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the bank's top regulator, said it was encouraged by the new leadership. Many lawmakers were cautiously optimistic that Scharf was the right person for the job but said righting the bank would be a tall task.
""While I wish you luck, it is clear to this Committee that the bank you inherited is essentially a lawless organization that has caused widespread harm to millions of consumers throughout the nation,"" Democratic House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters said in her opening remarks.
Waters, a fiery bank-basher, on Thursday had told reporters that despite meeting with Scharf, she had no indication that he had a compelling plan for turning around the bank.
In a report released last week, the committee unearthed documents and emails that appeared to reveal complacency on the part of the bank's directors and management, including board Chair Betsy Duke, regarding its various regulatory issues. Duke resigned on Monday.
When pressed for details on the status of the bank's remediation efforts and a timeline for getting over the bank's regulatory hurdles, Scharf was light on specifics but was clear that his management team was committed to working through the banks issues with a fresh sense of urgency.
Waters and others on the committee, which is responsible for overseeing financial firms and their regulators, quizzed Scharf on the health of the banking system amid turmoil in global markets, and on social issues like gun financing and lending to minority groups.
Bank stocks have been hurt more than other sectors as the quickly spreading coronavirus has lead to a lower interest rate environment and raised concerns about future credit costs as businesses are squeezed, according to analysts.
""We understand the seriousness of concerns felt by customers and employees about the coronavirus,"" Scharf said in prepared remarks, but during the hearing he declined to provide specifics on how the bank planned to help consumers and clients who are facing hardships due to the pandemic.
When Scharf took the reins in October, he inherited a bank that was under federal investigation, subject to more than a dozen consent orders and hindered by an unprecedented Federal Reserve cap on its balance sheet growth. Sources inside the bank say that he has been laser-focused on efficiently tackling the bank's problems by cutting unnecessary meetings and focusing on accountability.
The bank has also recently announced a number of initiatives that would appeal to the Democratic majority committee, like increasing the minimum wage for its employees, rolling out new bank accounts that limit overdraft fees and credit products for DACA recipients.
Prior CEOs John Stumpf and Tim Sloan left the company shortly after similar appearances before Congress.
Waters kept up pressure on Sloan Tuesday, asking the Justice Department to determine if he broke the law in giving ""misleading"" sworn testimony to her panel one year ago when he told lawmakers the bank was complying with a settlement to remediate customers harmed by its sales practices. Bank regulators said afterwards the bank was still coming up short in its efforts.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the referral, and lawyers for Sloan did not respond to requests for comment."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Democratic senator on Tuesday raised concerns that a federal regulator probing allegations that Fifth Third Bancorp (O:FITB) employees created phony accounts may be conflicted because one of its staffers previously worked at the bank.
On Monday, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) charged Fifth Third with creating fake accounts between 2008 to 2016, in a case that echoes San Francisco-based lender Wells Fargo's own recent scandal.
Fifth Third has said fewer than 1,100 accounts were affected, resulting in less than $30,000 in improper customer charges and that the CFPB's suit was ""unnecessary and unwarranted.""
During a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday, Democratic lawmaker Sherrod Brown grilled CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger over her decision to appoint Leonard Chanin, who was deputy general counsel at Fifth Third from March 2017-March 2019, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) account, as her part-time acting deputy.
Chanin is currently deputy to the chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Jelena McWilliams, who was previously his colleague at Fifth Third when she was its chief legal officer from January 2017 until May 2018. Chanin is splitting his work week between the FDIC and CFPB.
Chanin could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for the FDIC declined to comment. Neither Chanin nor McWilliams has been accused of wrongdoing.
Brown raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest the CFPB may face and quizzed Kraninger on what she knew of Chanin and McWilliams' own knowledge of the misconduct.
""FDIC Chair Jelena McWilliams would have known about the fake accounts. She was legal officer at Fifth Third for a couple-year period. Leonard Chanin was also her deputy at Fifth Third before he became deputy at FDIC. He would have known about the bureau's fake-account investigation of Fifth Third,"" said Brown, who is the top Democrat on the committee.
""Did you know about his role in the fake account scandal at Fifth Third when you hired him?"" he asked Kraninger.
Kraninger said she knew Chanin had worked at Fifth Third, but declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation and privacy issues.
From ""at least"" 2008 to 2016, Fifth Third staff opened accounts without customers' consent, was aware of the misconduct for years and failed to stop it, the CFPB said in civil charges filed in a U.S. District Court in Illinois on Monday.
The CFPB is one of several agencies under the Trump administration that has been accused of being too cozy with the industry it oversees."

SEOUL/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Airlines around the world sank deeper into crisis on Tuesday as the worsening coronavirus epidemic and Italy's lockdown hammered passenger numbers, forced the cancellation of thousands of flights and led to the delaying of plane orders.
Some carriers face calamity, with Korean Air Lines warning the virus outbreak could threaten its survival after it scrapped more than 80% of its international capacity, grounding 100 of its 145 passenger aircraft.
""The situation can get worse at any time and we cannot even predict how long it will last,"" Woo Kee-hong, the president of South Korea's biggest airline, said in a memo to staff that summed up the turmoil facing the industry.
""But if the situation continues for a longer period, we may reach the threshold where we cannot guarantee the company's survival.""
Leading U.S. airlines Delta and American ditched 2020 forecasts and unveiled more sweeping capacity cuts and cost-saving measures, while United announced a $2 billion capital raising and warned of a deep hit to the sector. 
""Let me blunt. Speaking for United, hope is not a strategy,"" United President Scott Kirby said at an investor conference. He said it could take 18 months before demand recovers, with public concern about the virus potentially worsening before improving.
United also slashed its 2020 capital expenditure in a move that will defer aircraft deliveries, a potential issue for planemakers Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE.
Australia's Qantas Airways delayed an order for A350 planes, suspended forecasts and slashed capacity due to a plunge in demand that industry chiefs estimate could hit airlines' revenue by up to $113 billion this year.
Its CEO and chairman will take no salary, managers will receive no bonuses and all staff are being encouraged to take paid or unpaid leave. United has announced similar steps.
Delta, which is also freezing hiring and offering voluntary unpaid leaves, said it had seen net bookings fall by as much as 25% to 30% and expected the situation to deteriorate further. United said its dire scenario planning sees revenues falling 70% in April and May.
""This clearly is not an economic event,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on Tuesday. ""This is a fear event, probably more akin to what we saw at 9/11.""
ITALIAN LOCKDOWN
The unprecedented lockdown of the whole of Italy, which is convulsed by Europe's worst coronavirus outbreak, has heaped fresh disaster on global airlines.
 Easyjet , Norwegian Air, IAG-owned British Airways, easyJet (LON:EZJ), Wizz Air and El Al Israel Airlines were among carriers to axe flights to and from the country, where there have been more than 9,000 virus infections and over 460 deaths.
Ryanair said on Tuesday it was cutting its passenger forecast for the year ending March by three million as a direct result of suspending almost all flights to and from its most important market for the next month.
Aviation analyst Mark Simpson, at Goodbody, said another major concern for the travel industry was whether the coronavirus epidemic would worsen markedly in European holiday hub Spain, which has reported more than 1,200 cases.
""A similar outbreak in Spain would pull IAG (LON:ICAG) into the fold, the holiday groups like TUI and DART (Jet2),"" he said. ""IAG would be much more exposed due to its ownership of Vueling, Iberia and the soon to be completed Air Europa.""
Air France said it expected to make a total of 3,600 flight cancellations in March, including cutting 25% of its European capacity. 
GHOST FLIGHTS
The global airline industry has been among the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak. It has lost almost a third of its value - $70 billion - this year, according to Reuters calculations based on the 20 top listed global carriers.
The Italian cancellations added to an already difficult financial situation at Norwegian Air, which has lost 70% of its market value this year and scrapped its 2020 outlook. 
It said on Tuesday it would cut around 3,000 flights between mid-March and mid-June and temporarily lay off a ""significant share"" of its workforce.
In an effort to give the industry some breathing space, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would suspend a rule requiring airlines to run most of their scheduled services or else forfeit valuable airport landing slots. This will do away with ""ghost flights"" where airlines fly almost empty planes simply to keep slots, she added.
Should Korean Air fall, it would not be the first airline engulfed by the fallout of the outbreak; Britain's Flybe collapsed last week as bookings faltered, and a further sector shakeout is expected, industry experts have warned.
Conglomerate HNA Group, which owns or holds stakes in a number of Chinese carriers, including Hainan Airlines, said it was in a ""state of war"" in its efforts to tackle the financial fallout of the outbreak. 
Airlines in China, where the new coronavirus originated, have canceled tens of thousands of flights since the start of the outbreak, though they have started to resume them.

25,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 02:59PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Rallies Into Late Trading,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com - The Dow continued its advance after turning positive earlier in the session Tuesday as investors digested reports that Trump wants the payroll tax cuts to be delivered during the U.S. November election to boost his chances of reelection. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 684 points, or 2.9%, from a low of about 160 points, though had been up more than 1,000 points earlier. The S&P 500 added 2.6%, Nasdaq Composite gained 3%.
Donald Trump reportedly told Republican senators on Tuesday that he wants a payroll tax holiday through the November election so that taxes won’t go back up before voters decide whether to return him to office, Bloomberg reported, citing three people familiar with the president’s remarks.
The announced arrived in a day filled with stimulus pledges to support the economy and combat the coronavirus from the White House. 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said insurance companies would cover coronavirus treatment, but the broader market remained under pressure as the spread of the virus continued.
""All the insurance companies here, either today or before today, have agreed to waive all co-pays on coronavirus testing and coronavirus treatment in their benefit plans,” Pence said. ""Medicare and Medicaid already made it clear to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries that coronavirus would be covered and treatment.""
The announcement delivered a slight boost to markets, but with sentiment on stocks still likely to driven by the latest virus headlines, investor worries about it becoming a global pandemic lurked in the background.
The uptick in risk assets, however, was led by technology as investors piled into beaten up FANG stocks, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rising more than 3%.
A rebound in Treasury yields from a historic day on Monday, when the 10-year Treasury yield fell to its lowest level ever, spurred a rally in financial, mostly banking stocks, which are vulnerable to a lower interest rate environment.
The Trump administration reportedly is also mulling plans to launch federal assistance to struggling oil and gas producers, the Washington Post reported. The federal assistance is likely to include low-interest government loans to the shale companies, which have seen credit lines dry up, the report added.
Energy stocks, which hit a 52-week low earlier today, however, remained under pressure."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street reversed course on Tuesday, pulling back from the brink of bear market confirmation as bargain hunting and stimulus hopes calmed investors' fears of recession and uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus.
All three major indexes advanced the day after equities markets suffered their biggest one-day losses since the 2008 financial crisis.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are now about 18% below the closing record highs reached on Feb. 19. They would have to pass the 20% mark to confirm a bear market.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he will take ""major steps"" allay market fears by asking congress for a fiscal stimulus package to include a payroll tax cut among other measures.
""Fiscal policy is calling the shots today,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.
""Clearly some investors are bottom fishing, thinking equities have dropped too much too fast,"" added Carter. ""(But others are) still trying to understand the probability of real fiscal stimulus from Washington.""
""There's still a lack of clarity as far as what we're going to get,"" Carter added.
Additionally, market participants largely expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the second time this month at the conclusion of next week's two-day monetary policy meeting in an effort to shore up the U.S. economy against growing global uncertainties, including the coronavirus.
Global markets have been rattled in recent weeks by news of the rapidly-spreading coronavirus, which has caused widespread supply chain disruption, hobbled the travel industry and prompted drastic containment measures in Italy and elsewhere.
Market uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 were exacerbated over the weekend as Saudi Arabia and Russia scrapped their supply pact and pledged to increase crude oil production.
But oil prices rebounded from their largest percentage drop since the 1991 Gulf War, with front-month Brent crude (LCOc1) rising 7.5% after Russia indicated it was open to talks with OPEC.
Energy stocks (SPNY) began to recover from their worst decline on record, advancing 1.9%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 275.22 points, or 1.15%, to 24,126.24, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 34.01 points, or 1.24%, to 2,780.57 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 104.01 points, or 1.31%, to 8,054.69.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, nine were trading in the black, led by tech (SPLRCT) and rate-sensitive financial (SPSY) shares.
Financials jumped 2.7% after suffering their worst day in more than a decade as U.S. Treasury yields bounced off record lows.
 United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) gained 4.0% as Stifel upgraded its shares to ""buy,"" while Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) rose 2.0% on Cowen & Co's price target increase.
Shares of  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and  Marathon Oil  Corp (N:MRO) rose 3.8% and 13.2% after the oil companies and their peers announced cost reduction efforts to combat plunging crude prices.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.07-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leaving bags of food on doorsteps or texting your delivery driver a picture of where you want your meal dropped off - these are new methods for U.S. consumers to get their orders as the coronavirus spreads.
The virus led McDonald's Corp (N:MCD),  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and other companies in China, where the outbreak originated, to broaden their use of contactless delivery last month as consumers were stuck at home, often in locked-off apartment complexes.
Now, that concept is growing in other parts of the globe along with the illness. 
On Friday, San Francisco-based Postmates introduced no-contact delivery options in its app in all of the 4,200 U.S. cities in which it operates. 
""We think it is a way to make both customers and the fleet comfortable while making and receiving deliveries,"" the company said in a statement.
Postmates users got an email notifying them of the new service called Dropoff Options. Three choices pop up when a customer places an order - delivery to the door, leave it at the door, or meet the customer outside - for ""whether you're feeling under the weather or are working from home in your pjs,"" the email said. 
Customers have also long been able to leave similar digital notes for delivery people via delivery platforms  Grubhub Inc  (N:GRUB) and Uber Technologies Inc's (N:UBER) Uber Eats, which operates in 45 countries, when placing an order. 
DoorDash is also testing enhanced drop-off options for contactless delivery to be rolled out shortly and is reminding consumers that they can leave instructions for drivers in the app, which can include a photo of the spot where food should be placed. 
The COVID-19 virus has infected more than 111,600 and killed more than 4,000 people globally, largely in China, according to a Reuters tally. 
In the United States, more than 700 people have been infected and 27 people have died. Last week, new cases spread quickly from just a couple states to a majority of states.
As more people consider staying home to limit exposure, restaurant traffic could take a hit.
Technomic Inc, a consulting and research firm, found that more than 30% of U.S. consumers said they plan to not leave the house or go to restaurants as often, though only 13% of those people said they will order more delivery. The report surveyed 1,000 consumers from Feb. 28 to March 2.
""The reduced foodservice visit incidence could be a boon for the grocery business, as almost half of these consumers say they will stockpile grocery foods and beverages as a substitute for away-from-home meals,"" the firm said. 
In Europe, German supermarket chain REWE said that a significant increase in demand has led to longer online delivery times since it has limited delivery slots and drivers are already fully loaded.
British online supermarket Ocado (LON:OCDO) has advised customers to place orders further in advance because of ""exceptionally high demand,"" indicating a possible reaction from shoppers to the spreading coronavirus outbreak.
Dutch online grocer Picnic BV has been getting more and larger orders and is ""at about 20% beyond capacity,"" Chief Executive Michiel Muller told broadcaster RTL.
FACELESS DELIVERY
U.S. delivery companies contacted by Reuters will not say whether they are yet seeing any increase in demand.
But one driver for DoorDash Inc in the Washington, D.C. area said his shifts had gotten busier.
The driver, who did not want to be named, said his pay per delivery - which usually rises during busier times or bad weather - has also steadily gone up as coronavirus cases grew.
His average pay per order rose from about $3.20 in mid-February to $4.72 during the last week of the month, though it was $4.37 during the first week of March, according to screenshots of his driving stats.
People are scared to go to restaurants, he said.

""So they're paying $15 to $20 delivery fees for a small fry and an ice cream scoop,"" he said.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 02:31PM ET</span>","UK to issue most debt in almost a decade to fund higher spending, dealers predict: Reuters poll","By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is likely to issue the highest amount of public debt in almost a decade over the coming financial year to help pay for a big increase in government spending, according to a Reuters poll of dealers before Wednesday's budget.
The United Kingdom Debt Management Office (DMO) is likely to announce a gilt issuance remit for 2020/21 of about 166.6 billion pounds ($214 billion), up from its current 2019/20 remit of 136.8 billion pounds, according to the median forecast from the survey of 14 out of Britain's 15 wholesale primary dealers -- banks tasked by the government with creating a market for its bonds.
The last time Britain issued more gilts was in 2011/12.
New finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to deliver his first budget and an update on the outlook for Britain's economy and government finances shortly before 1300 GMT on Wednesday, after which the DMO will publish its 2020/21 gilt issuance remit.
The government's tax-and-spending plan was originally billed as a chance for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to channel investment to poorer regions where voters helped him to a resounding election victory in December.
But with Johnson and his government now focused on how to cope with an expected surge in coronavirus cases in Britain, Sunak now has new priorities.
The survey pointed to a hefty increase in the government's budget deficit in the next fiscal year, likely rising to around 67 billion pounds -- or 27 billion pounds more than the Office for Budget Responsibility had predicted for 2020/21 in forecasts published in December.
""The March 2020 Budget will bring a substantial increase in UK public sector borrowing – principally via an uplift in discretionary spending but also as a consequence of a cyclical deterioration in tax receipts,"" NatWest Markets economist Ross Walker and fixed income strategist Theo Chapsalis said.
The poll showed the DMO is likely to issue slightly more medium-dated gilts and fewer index-linked bonds as a proportion of total issuance. The DMO has said it is seeking to reduce how much inflation-linked debt it issues to lower the government's exposure to spikes in inflation.
The DMO also looks likely to increase net supply of Treasury bills by around 3.5 billion pounds, the poll showed."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank is set to receive much less from the sale of its stake in Sberbank (MM:SBER) than expected because of steep slides on the market and it may not take place this year if oil prices fall too far, senior Russian officials said on Tuesday.
The sale, which had been expected to begin in April, is in part meant to end years of debate about potential conflicts of interest arising from the central bank's control over the country's top lender.
Deputy Finance Ministry Vladimir Kolychev said on Tuesday that Russia's central bank was likely to receive 300 billion roubles ($4.18 billion) from the stake sale.
The deal originally foresaw that the finance ministry would draw 2.45 trillion roubles from the National Wealth Fund to buy the stake and the central bank would receive 700 billion roubles from the sale of its 50% plus one share.
The bulk of the proceeds - or 1.25 trillion roubles - was set to be returned to the state budget.
Under the original plan, Sberbank's minority shareholders, including large Western funds, would also have been given the option of a buyout.
But after markets crashed this week in reaction to coronavirus outbreaks worldwide and weak oil prices, the plan was revised.
""Given the difficult situation on the market, we have found a formula that should suit minority shareholders,"" said Sergei Shvetsov, a first deputy governor of the Russian central bank.
He added the deal would be carried out through a shareholder agreement, which meant no buyouts would be necessary.
Speaking later on Tuesday, Kolychev linked the sale to oil prices, which on Monday suffered their biggest fall in nearly three decades as Russia and Saudi Arabia began a price war that threatens to overwhelm the market with supply.
On Tuesday prices recouped some of their losses and Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rallied to around $37 a barrel.
Kolychev said the stake sale would go ahead this year provided prices remain at around $35 a barrel, but if they fall as low as $10, it may not.
The proceeds to be transferred to the state budget would help President Vladimir Putin to fulfill a string of social pledges made earlier this year as part of broad reforms of Russia's political system.
Sberbank shares were down 8.5% at 1549 GMT."

(Reuters) -  Barclays  PLC (L:BARC) told employees on Tuesday that a member of the trading staff in its Manhattan office has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a memo viewed by Reuters.

(Reuters) - Leading U.S. airlines on Tuesday ditched 2020 forecasts and unveiled more sweeping capacity cuts and cost-saving measures in response to the spreading coronavirus, while United Airlines (O:UAL) warned of a deep hit to the sector.
Speaking at an industry conference, United President Scott Kirby said he was preparing for a ""dire scenario"" under which revenue could fall as much as 70% in April and May and 20% in November and December. 
The sector has been hard-hit as tourists cancel trips and businesses across the globe clamp down on anything other than essential travel over the fast-spreading epidemic, sparking a string of steps by airlines to tackle the impact of the outbreak.
Chicago-based United has taken some of the most aggressive measures to date, saying on Tuesday it had raised $2 billion in new capital to bring liquidity to $8 billion and slashed its 2020 capital expenditure by more than a third to about $4.5 billion.
""Let me blunt. Hope is not a strategy,"" Kirby told investors, saying it could take the industry two to three years to fully recover. 
United will not take jet deliveries or add capacity back to the market until it sees demand returning, he said. The airline expects to post a first-quarter loss due to the crisis, and Kirby and CEO Oscar Munoz are forgoing their base salaries until June 30.
Delta (N:DAL) said it had seen net bookings fall by as much as 25% to 30% and expected the situation to worsen further.
""This clearly is not an economic event. This is a fear event, probably more akin to what we saw at 9/11 than necessarily what we saw in 2009,"" Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said. 
Delta is cutting domestic capacity by 10% to 15% and international by 20% to 25% and freezing hiring across the company, offering voluntary leave options to staff and looking at early retirement of older aircraft.
BETTER-POSITIONED
The U.S. airlines have all said that strong balance sheets, significantly lower debt levels and sizeable cash reserves versus prior crises make them better prepared to weather the crisis, but do not rule out additional capital raising or cost-cutting. 
Also speaking on Tuesday, American Chief Executive Doug Parker said his airline had $7.3 billion in available capital and was eyeing cost savings such as reduced pilot training classes.
The airline, which is cutting domestic capacity by 7.5% in April and international by 10% for the upcoming summer season, also expects a fall in fuel prices to save $3 billion in 2020 costs. Oil sank around a fifth in value on Monday.
American, Delta and United have also suspended share buybacks and said they were prepared to take additional measures as needed.
In a message to employees on Monday, Southwest (N:LUV) CEO Gary Kelly said he was taking a 10% pay cut in response to a ""severe recession"" for the airline industry.
In an effort to encourage bookings, the largest U.S. airlines are allowing passengers to re-book tickets through April 30 without paying fees to change flights and others are running significant fare sales or cutting prices on some routes.
Alaska Airlines (N:ALK) is advertising airfares as low as $25 one way, while  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) said it was cutting fares by up to 70%. 
Speaking on Tuesday, Spirit CEO Ted Christie highlighted the budget carrier's low-cost structure.

""Anyone can sell low fares, the issue is who can sell low fares at a profitable level?""

The burger chain has not trained or given any guidelines on the epidemic, McDonald's cooks and cashiers associated with labor group Fight for $15 and a Union said in an email statement https://fightfor15.org/fight-for-15-covid-19-mcdonalds-demands.
Maurilia Arellanes, a McDonald's worker in California, said on a media call organized by the labor group that she cannot afford to take a day off if she is sick.
""McDonald's needs to step up and do everything it can to make sure workers like me are safe and that if we do get sick, we can take time off to get better without falling behind on our bills,"" she said.
The labor group asked the company to pay workers for any missed shifts if a McDonald's restaurant shuts down due to the spread of COVID-19.
McDonald's hourly worker wage varies from $7.25 to $15 based on the state. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Restaurant workers have for long complained about poor pay and working conditions, drawing support from politicians and Fight for $15, which has regularly targeted McDonald's calling for higher pay and union rights for workers.
Their demands come close on the heels of Darden Restaurants (N:DRI), the owner of Olive Garden and Bahama Breeze chains, saying it would provide its hourly workers paid sick leaves starting Tuesday.
Over 600 cases and 26 deaths have been reported in the United States due to the coronavirus. However, McDonald's has not issued an update on the potential financial impact on its home.
When the outbreak was first reported in China late last year and the company said in January it does not see a big financial hit as it only collected royalty fees from China.
It last week decided to cancel its biennial in-person worldwide convention, attended by operators from around the world and set to take place in a few weeks. It will now hold a digital convention.
""The company canceled a meeting of executives and franchisees, but it's not making any plans for us frontline workers, who cannot afford to take a day off without pay if we get sick,"" said Fran Marion, a McDonald's worker in Kansas City, Missouri."

LONDON (Reuters) - The rapid spread of coronavirus has wiped almost a third - or $70 billion - off the world's top 20 listed airlines and reshuffled global rankings, elevating Air China into third place behind U.S. rivals, an analysis by Reuters shows.
The airline sector has been hit hardest by the outbreak of coronavirus, with falling ticket demand and Italy in lockdown forcing carriers to cancel routes and slash costs to survive the mounting crisis.
With the investor sell-off accelerating, United Airlines (O:UAL) has lost its number three position in the global line-up to Air China (SS:601111).
The U.S. carrier's market capitalization has halved to $11.6 billion, the lowest since 2003, since the start of the year, leaving it also lagging behind Europe's low-cost carrier Ryanair (I:RYA).
Air China has been relatively unscathed - its market cap was $15 billion on Tuesday, compared with $19 billion on Jan. 2.
The scale of the rout has been breathtaking.
Wizz Air, a budget carrier focused on central European routes, is now more highly valued than Air France-KLM, and the world's most valuable airline, Delta Air, has seen more than $10 billion knocked off its value this year, taking its market cap to about $28 billion, the lowest since September 2016.

(Reuters) - More U.S. companies are moving their annual shareholder meetings online to help contain the spread of coronavirus, raising concerns among corporate democracy advocates about investors losing access to top executives and board directors.
 Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) this month canceled its annual shareholder meeting in Seattle, known for attracting big crowds with free coffee, and said it would hold a ""virtual"" meeting for its shareholders instead on March 18.
Chip maker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) is restricting access to its shareholder meeting on Tuesday to exclude people who have traveled to areas stricken by coronavirus, such as China and Italy. It will provide a webcast in addition to the in-person event.
Software developer  F5 Networks Inc  (O:FFIV) will for the first time allow shareholders to vote electronically as part of its virtual meeting on Thursday. F5 will also hold an in-person meeting in Seattle, but cautioned its investors about health and safety issues.
""We are seeing more and more companies discuss and consider moving toward virtual meetings this year due to the coronavirus issue,"" said Courtney Adante, president of security risk advisory at global consulting firm Teneo.
The coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19, has killed more than 4,000 people globally and has been reported in 122 countries.
Developer meetings at  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), conferences such as music and technology festival South by Southwest and religious gatherings at churches and synagogues have been canceled outright to curb coronavirus.
'CHERRY-PICKING CONCERNS'
Companies are hoping the digital meetings will help prevent the spread of the virus, while also providing access to shareholders who would not have attended the meetings physically. Many U.S. shareholder meetings are held in April and May.
""Holding a virtual meeting eliminates the enhanced risk of infections and the related legal exposure,"" said Kai Liekefett, a partner at law firm Sidley Austin LLP, referring to the risk of investors filing lawsuits against companies if they become ill at the meetings.
Some investors see a worrying trend. They are concerned that these changes will become permanent, curtailing shareholders' ability to demonstrate at the meetings and grill corporate management and boards of directors in person.
""If it is a virtual-only meeting, they can cherry-pick questions, they can avoid protests. This is not something shareholders want, it's something boards and CEOs want so they can be unaccountable to shareholders,"" said James McRitchie, an investor and shareholder advocate.
Starbucks and F5 did not respond to requests for comment about the effect of virtual meetings on access to their executives and board members. A Qualcomm representative pointed to disclosures on its website, which state that shareholders who attend its annual meeting in person must fill out a questionnaire regarding their travels.
To be sure, only a small fraction of companies currently host their annual shareholder meetings on the internet. Yet even before the coronavirus outbreak that number was growing. Some 248 U.S. companies held virtual shareholder meetings in the 2019 corporate voting season, up 17% from the year before, according to accounting and consulting firm PwC.
CLIMATE ACTIVISTS WORRIED
Environmentalists are particularly concerned. Climate activists have become a fixture at the annual shareholder meetings of oil majors  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX). While Exxon and Chevron have yet to announce virtual shareholder meetings, activists say they risk losing an important forum that they use to pressure the companies.
""Managements and boards have disproportionate control over the flow of information and the ability of shareholders to ask questions,” said Jonas Kron, director of shareholder advocacy at investment management firm Trillium Asset Management LLC, which submits proposals on climate change and racial and gender equity. ""(An annual shareholder meeting) is one of the few places where unscripted organic engagement can happen between management and shareholders.""
Exxon said this week it is still planning to hold its annual meeting in Dallas this year and Chevron said it continues to ""monitor the situation very closely"" and that its primary concern is the health and safety of employees.
The world's largest annual shareholder meeting is still on, for now. Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) said last week that its shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 2, which typically draws 40,000 people or more and includes events such as a picnic and a 5k run, would go ahead. It added that the scope of the surrounding events may be ""modified.""
""Postponing meetings may be a more respectful approach,"" said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at socially responsible investment management firm Boston Trust Walden Company. ""We would argue this should not become a precedent."""

(Reuters) - Online video interviews increasingly being used by major recruiters seem to be the perfect answer to the disruption caused by coronavirus, but there is a catch: many senior-level positions still require a face-to-face meeting before the final handshake.
Recruiters PageGroup (L:PAGE) and Robert Walters (L:RWA) as well as global tech giants Google (O:GOOGL), Amazon (O:AMZN), Facebook (O:FB) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) owned LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) have said they were moving job interviews and other interactions online in response to the outbreak. The epidemic may have even made part of the recruiters' job simpler.
""It was actually easier to get hold of many clients because they were at home, bored and on the end of a mobile phone than it was when they were in meetings, walking factories or flying somewhere,"" PageGroup Chief Executive Steve Ingham told reporters last week while presenting its annual results.
However, without that final face-to-face interview to seal the deal and fill the advertised position, recruiters may not be able to cash in fees that can reach $100,000 or higher for senior banking jobs, and roughly half of that for senior accountants.
That, together with concerns the fallout of the epidemic that has spread to over 100 countries will hurt the global economy and dent hiring, has cast doubt over recruiters' 2020 outlook.
PageGroup reported a 3% drop in gross profit in the first two months of this year and voiced caution about its revenue while rival  Robert Walters Plc  (L:RWA) warned last week that the outbreak could hurt profit in 2020.
Adrien Bizouard, country manager at Robert Walters Vietnam told Reuters business continued as usual there, but in mainland China, Hong Kong and Japan interviews have moved to Skype.
Asia-focused recruitment firm Edge Partnership said it had seen some delays in final hiring, but not much financial impact on its Hong Kong business yet.
Managing Director Guy Erricker said clients there were happy to delay hiring both because of the restrictions imposed in response to the epidemic and because of uncertainty over how their staffing needs may look like in two to three months.
""We probably have to wait through the next two or three weeks to see if the deals are actually going to be closed in time,"" Erricker told Reuters.
Recruiters globally have had a tumultuous past few months as Brexit, the Sino-U.S. trade war and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong hit business confidence and crimped companies for hiring.
Businesses that promote remote work and video conferencing, however, stand to do better during the upheaval, Zoë Harte, head of human resources and talent innovation at Upwork, an U.S.-listed online marketplace for freelance work, told Reuters.
Web conferencing firm  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) last week said it had seen a jump in usage and had started to remove the 40-minute limit on free meetings for users in China to help more people to work remotely.
""Companies that develop the culture and tools to enable remote work and recruiting will be better positioned to support their employees and candidates in the midst of the health concerns,"" Upwork's Harte said."

The virus has yet to spread as quickly in Ireland as other European countries, but the government has canceled all St. Patrick's Day parades due to take place across the country next week to limit the impact. The government has also set aside 3 billion euros to tackle the infection.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is one of Ireland's largest multinational employers, said the employee who tested positive is now in self-isolation and that they feel the risk to others is low while they coordinate closely with local health authorities.
Apple employs 6,000 workers in Ireland's second largest city of Cork. The iPhone maker said in a statement that it had asked some workers to stay at home as a precaution and that it was continuing to regularly deep clean all its offices and stores.
In Dublin, Trinity College said lectures would be delivered online for the rest of the academic year to May 31, with tutorials, seminars and laboratory practicals continuing using social distancing protocol.
A floor in one of the 428-year old university's buildings was closed as a precautionary measure last week after it was informed of a positive case within the city-center campus.

Haven assets from the yen to Treasuries slumped.
The S&P 500 rose more than 2% in early trading, spurred by the American president’s promise for “major” moves later Tuesday. Gains that reached 5% overnight faded, though, on reports the White House might not be as far along as thought. European equities rallied, with Germany considering easing bank capital requirements. Brent crude futures rallied after Monday’s crash. The yen slid alongside the Swiss franc. Ten-year Treasury yields retraced about half of yesterday’s drop.
“A strong rebound today, if it in fact holds, does not mean the volatility, or even the worst, is behind us. Rather, investors should expect continued gyrations both up and down until there is greater certainty on coronavirus,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
The rebound in risk assets was sparked by signs governments around the world are awaking to need for stimulus measures to combat the virus that is threatening to plunge the global economy into recession. Donald Trump’s proposal will likely include a payroll tax cut and a short-term expansion of paid sick leave, according to people familiar with the plan.
At the same time, measures to contain the coronavirus continue to undermine prospects for corporate earnings, and raise the danger of a funding crisis, while the oil price crash threatens a swath of defaults among producers. Italy added nationwide travel restrictions to its effective lockdown of the northern region of the country.
“While things feel like the end-of-days I’d stay risk averse in the near-term, but expect bear market rallies,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets bounced smartly at the open on Tuesday after suffering their worst day since the 2008 financial crisis on Monday.
The bounce was in part a response to comments by the U.S. administration that it is preparing measures to help businesses cope with any short-term loss of revenue as a result of the coronavirus.
President Donald Trump's economic team is due to meet with Congressional leaders later, and Trump has scheduled a press briefing with the coronavirus task force for 5:30 PM ET. The briefing is expected to flesh out the measures sketched out on Monday.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 848 points, or 3.6% at 24,699 points. The S&P 500 was up 3.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.6%. All three indices had lost over 7% on Monday.
The Dow futures contract had been up nearly 1,000 points earlier, but trimmed its gains after CNBC cited unnamed White House officials as saying it was unlikely that the administration’s plans could come together by this afternoon.
“It’s not there right now,” CNBC quoted an official as saying. “A lot of details need to be worked out.”
Trump had hinted at a cut in payroll taxes in the comments he made on Monday. Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a morning note that this would be of limited benefit, given that it would offer no relief to gig economy workers, whose numbers have expanded massively in recent years. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said on Monday that the measures would be targeted at small businesses and those most exposed to the economic impact of the virus.
Two of the U.S.’s biggest airlines said they would slash capacity over the summer, reflecting a sharp drop in demand due to the virus. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock rose 5.6%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock rose 4.8%. In addition to suspending flights, Delta said it would also suspend its buyback program to conserve cash.
The oil and gas sector also enjoyed a sharp bounce, as crude oil prices recovered from their worst day in nearly 30 years on Monday. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), seen as particularly vulnerable to low prices after having borrowed heavily to finance its acquisition of Anadarko last year, rose by 15.6% after falling by 52% on Monday.
 Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) also rose by 25.6% after saying it would cut its 2020 capital spending by over 25% to less than $1.9 billion."

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a bounce at the open on Tuesday, rebounding from a 7% slump a day earlier, as hopes for stimulus measures eased investor fears over a global recession in the face of the coronavirus epidemic.
By 07:25 AM ET (1125 GMT), Dow futures added 992 points, or around 4.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 4.2% and S&P 500 futures were up a similar amount.
Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury debt more than doubled to 0.70% and those on German Bunds jumped around 20 basis points as investors pared some safe-haven holdings.
The gains came after the three major indices posted their biggest one-day percentage decline on Monday and the Dow tumbled as much as 2,000 points, as markets went into panic mode over the expected economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. Market sentiment was also hit by plunging oil prices following the breakdown of a crucial global oil pact.

Some of the biggest global investment banks, including JP Morgan, Citi and Barclays, now expect the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. interest rates to zero in the coming months as part of a mass global move to provide some ballast and liquidity to the financial system.
Elsewhere, U.S. crude futures rebounded 9.6% after falling by as much as 30% on Monday. That comes after reports saying that Saudi Arabia plans to sell some 12.3 million barrels of oil a day in April. Given that it is unlikely to be able to ramp up all its spare capacity so quickly, the reports suggest that the kingdom is planning to draw down stocks to maximize sales volumes - an extreme measure that is unlikely to be sustained.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) is likely to pull out from a venture capital fund it runs with alliance partners  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors, as part of the Japanese automaker's drive to cut costs and conserve cash, two sources said.
Nissan will formally take a decision on whether to leave the fund, Alliance Ventures, by the end of this month, the two Nissan insiders told Reuters, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.
The likely move comes after Nissan's junior partner, Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), told an alliance meeting last week that it would no longer continue to inject money into the fund, one of the sources said. 
The decision to leave the Amsterdam-based fund was all but a done deal, the other source said, adding: ""Of course we're out. The house is on fire."" 
A Nissan spokeswoman said it was speculation and declined to comment. A Mitsubishi spokesman said no decision had been made.
The move comes as Nissan - which has seen its earnings slump - is now facing a downturn in China, its biggest market, due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. China sales plunged 80% last month. 
It also highlights the extent of the automaker's cost-cutting under new CEO Makoto Uchida, who is under pressure for a quick turnaround.
Alliance Ventures is aimed at finding ""learning opportunities"" for the alliance through investing in startups, and is supposed get up to $200 million a year from the three alliance partners, although it never achieves that full amount, the first source said.
It was set up under former alliance head Carlos Ghosn, whose dramatic arrest in Japan culminated in an escape to his childhood home of Lebanon in December. Ghosn faces multiple charges in Japan, including of under-reporting earnings and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.
According to its website, the fund was set up with a $200 million initial investment and aims for up to $1 billion by 2023. Portfolio companies include WeRide, a Chinese robo-taxi startup and Tekion Corp, a cloud-based retail platform for cars.
""It wasn't established by Ghosn as a way to make money. It was for those learning opportunities we get from investing in smart startups,"" the first source said.

""But given the tough financial situation we are facing, we are looking at investment return.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Many Chinese farmers are shopping online for vital supplies as the spring planting season gets under way and the coronavirus outbreak disrupts traditional supply chains, providing a huge boost to business for e-commerce platforms.
Fertilizers, chemicals, seeds and machinery are traditionally distributed to China's hundreds of millions of farmers via a network of traders and local distributors.
But the virus, which originated in the central province of Hubei, jammed supply chains across the country through factory closures, residential quarantines and roadblocks.
Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo saw a near 1,000% jump in sales of farming products including seeds, fertilizer and sprinklers in February versus last year.
On Alibaba's Taobao marketplace, February sales of farming machinery including tillers, seed drills and cultivators rose 78% year-on-year, while purchases of seeds and fertilizers gained over 100%. Animal feed sales notched up 233%, a Taobao spokesperson said.
""We have observed a significant trend that farmers are now relying on their smartphones to buy their equipment online,"" said a Pinduoduo spokesperson, adding that more than 4.3 million agricultural producers bought farming essentials from its platform last month.
Yang Tiankai, a 30-year old farmer from Qiubei county in the southern province of Yunnan, first bought cucumber and radish seeds from Pinduoduo two years ago.
""Online purchases are cheaper than (buying from) physical stores. For us in remote areas, deliveries reach us within four to five days,"" said Yang, adding that many young farmers in his village bought materials online for the planting season.
China has been encouraging e-commerce penetration in rural areas as part of a poverty alleviation drive in recent years. As of mid-2019, agriculture, forestry, livestock and fishery workers comprised only 8% of China's internet users, according to a China Statistical Report on Internet Development.
""In every link along the food and agriculture supply chain, digital applications will likely be increasingly adopted and improved,"" said Michelle Huang, Rabobank consumer food analyst.
""The lessons learnt from this virus outbreak indicate that supply chain management ... will become more important."""
54,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Aon alleges fraud in arbitration over $300 million Brazilian deal: documents,"By Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - British insurance broker Aon Plc (N:AON) has accused the founder of Brazilian health and benefits insurance broker Admix of defrauding it when it acquired the company four years ago in a 1.35 billion reais ($300 million) deal, according to arbitration and court documents reviewed by Reuters.
The sale contract with Admix founder Cesar Antunes da Silva included a clause calling for Aon to pay him up to 150 million reais two years after the deal closure if certain revenue targets were met. Another 80 million reais were placed in an escrow account as guarantee for any problem in the deal, a common practice in M&A transactions.
Citing what it called ""fraud and omissions"" by da Silva in the sale process, Aon in 2018 did not pay the earn-out clauses or release the amount in the escrow account, according to the documents. Aon is seeking at least 200 million reais in damages via arbitration.
Lawyers for da Silva said Aon was trying to use the arbitration to compensate for losses stemming from its own ""mismanagement"" of Admix after the acquisition, according to the documents.
They said the insurer took two years to complain of omissions and are demanding that Aon pay the remaining value in the escrow account and the earn-out payments.
Aon and da Silva's lawyers declined to comment for this story, saying the arbitration was confidential.
The arbitration, which began in December 2018 in Sao Paulo, is registered by the International Chamber of Commerce under the number 24146/GSS and details of its contents have not been previously reported.
The dispute underlines how disappointing the deal has proven for Aon, which is aiming to become the world's largest insurance broker. When it was announced, the then head of Aon's health and benefits division, John Zern, said the acquisition doubled the brokerage giant's presence in Brazil, while its head for Risk Solutions in Latin America, Fernando Pereira, said the deal would enhance Aon's activities in Latin America. Both have left the company since the deal.
At the time, Admix had 1.4 million beneficiaries across 6,700 companies of all industries and sizes and placed 2 billion reais in health and benefits premiums a year.
Aon has also asked the arbitration judges to revalue Admix, alleging irregular underwriting policies, and to reimburse the price difference.
The alleged underwriting irregularities happened only after the company was sold, da Silva's lawyers say, according to the documents.
Aon also alleges Admix failed to inform it about contract cancellations, including the cancellation of a high number of contracts before the deal closed by health care operator Unimed. Da Silva argued in his response in the arbitration that most of those were transferred to other insurance brokers within the same group.
Aon also accused the Admix founder of failing to disclose significant labor lawsuits filed by its own employees.
Aon's arbitration lawyers also accused a former Admix insurance broker of intimidating witnesses because he sued certain of the British insurer's employees who had made depositions within the arbitration proceedings and accused him of fraud. The broker, Nadjair Diniz Barbosa, and his lawyer declined to comment.
Aon did not disclose the arbitration in its 2019 financial statements as it has done with other arbitration proceedings in New Zealand and the United States, and antitrust investigations in Europe. Aon declined to comment on why the arbitration was not disclosed in the financial statements.
Aon announced on Monday a $30 billion deal to acquire rival Willis Towers Watson (O:WLTW) and become the world's largest insurance broker."

(Reuters) - European shares on Tuesday recouped some of the brutal losses in the previous session, as oil prices gained and expectations of more stimulus measures eased anxiety around the global economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 2.7% , but was far from making up for the 7% slump on Monday that pushed the index into bear market territory - seen as a 20% drop from recent all-time highs.
Europe's oil index (SXEP) rose 3.6% as crude prices increased about 5% after the biggest one-day rout in nearly 30 years that sparked extreme volatility in global financial markets.
The recovery gained some steam as investors pinned their hopes on coordinated policy actions from governments and central banks around the world to ease the hit from the outbreak. U.S. President Donald Trump promised a ""major"" step on Monday and said he would discuss a payroll tax cut with congressional Republicans.
With all of Italy under lockdown, the government is set to approve measures worth around 10 billion euros ($11.35 billion), while officials estimate that Berlin could put together a stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros ($57.30 billion).
Germany's finance Minister Olaf Scholz told a local media group on Monday the government would do ""everything necessary"" to stabilize it.
""It's one of the triggers of the rebound we're seeing,"" OANDA analyst Craig Erlam said. ""But we're coming off severe downside, so I wouldn't be very optimistic even with today's price action so far.""
Monday's rout in oil markets following a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia added to fears of a further hit to global growth, already reeling under the impact of the outbreak. The STOXX 600 is still down 19.5% from all-time highs.
Focus turns to the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, with traders betting on another 10 basis point interest rate cut.
Italian banks (FTIT8300), which slumped 12% on Monday, were up 3%.
Corporate news also helped, with German chipmaker Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn) rising 5.4% after U.S. officials found no national security concerns with its proposed $10 billion takeover of U.S. firm Cypress Semiconductor Corp (O:CY).
German logistics firm  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) jumped 7% after saying it had started to see volumes in China recover from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, and announced a bigger than expected annual dividend.
Shares in DiaSorin (MI:DIAS) soared 12% to the top of STOXX 600 after the Italian diagnostics group said it had completed studies for the launch of a test for COVID-19."
56,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 05:26AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Russian Stocks May Not Be as Weak as They Look,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The old adage says that Russia is never as strong as she looks or as weak as she looks. It was meant originally as a warning to foreign politicians, but it applies equally to investors.
The Russian RTS index – always heavily influenced by movements in the price of the country’s biggest export, crude oil - fell 15% at opening on Tuesday. It would have done so already on Monday, had it not been for a public holiday.  It later pared losses to be down 'only' 11.9%
It’s a reflex move: most of the heaviest-weighted names in the index are in the oil and gas sector and those that aren’t are still highly, if indirectly, exposed to the business. It’s no surprise to see the three worst performers are all oil producers –  Rosneft (MCX:ROSN),  Lukoil  (LON:LKOHyq) and  Tatneft  (OTC:OAOFY), all down by between 13.5% and 16%: lower crude prices mean lower cash flows – albeit the impact is not as great as you might expect, since the government also takes less in tax when prices are low. Moreover, state ownership, usually a drag on valuations, acts as a support at such times, reducing the risk of extreme credit events (Lukoil is privately-owned but has a long tradition of cooperating loyally with the state).
A greater concern is possibly Gazprom (MCX:GAZP). The world’s largest gas producer depends on exports to Europe and, as of last year, China for its profits, but European demand has fallen due to the second-warmest winter on record, and Chinese demand for gas has collapsed in the first couple of months of the year due to the coronavirus. 
Gazprom hasn’t disclosed the pricing formula for the gas it sells through a new pipeline to north-east China, but it seems a reasonable assumption that if the country is turning away LNG cargoes, it’s also using whatever flexibility is in that contract to depress the price it’s paying the Russian giant. That will leave Gazprom little left over to service the debts it racked up while building it. Gazprom stock hit a 10-month low on Tuesday, but it had already been falling since October.
More worrying still for investors is the sight of domestic-focused stocks all slumping, pulled down by the sharp drop in the currency. The ruble hit its lowest since March 2016 on Tuesday, falling as far as 72.79 to the dollar. The three big supermarket chains Magnit  (LON:MGNTq), Lenta  (LON:LNTAq) and X5 Retail (LON:PJPq) are all down by between 8.4% and 11.5%.  
The last time the ruble fell this sharply was at the end of 2015 - coincidentally the last time that Saudi Arabia started an oil price war. Such bouts of weakness tend to last only until the big oil exporters return to the principle of managing crude prices. However, they often come with the side-effect of bad loans and a tightening of credit availability. The next few weeks will show how much the central bank’s clean-up of the banking system has improved the economy’s resilience.
In the meantime, the Russian market still offers pockets of strength: Norilsk Nickel  (LON:NKELyq), one of the world’s biggest producers of platinum group metals, will continue to enjoy sky-high prices for palladium and solid prices for nickel and platinum; gold and silver miners  Polyus  (LON:PLZLq) and  Polymetal  (LON:POLYP) can look forward to record-high prices for their output, and steelmakers such as  Novolipetsk  (LON:NLMKq) and Severstal (LON:SVSTq) may have the chance to exploit any short-term supply disruptions at Chinese competitors.
As always with Russia, the ride is likely to be bumpy - and never boring."

FRANKFURT/MADRID (Reuters) - European banks expanded their emergency measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and BBVA (MC:BBVA) reorganising operations after employees tested positive for the infection.
Deutsche Bank has split some of its trading operations across locations in Frankfurt, while BBVA has shut down one building at its headquarters in Madrid.
The spread of the coronavirus is increasingly disrupting financial companies' operations and adds to the effects of a weaker economy on their businesses.
Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) said late Monday that an employee at its London office had tested positive, causing it to temporarily close both its sites in the city.
 Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen said on Tuesday that it was planning to split its British and U.S. investment teams into groups and have them work separately as part of contingency planning.
Traders at the world's biggest banks began last week swapping their plush city center offices to work from suburban outposts in New York and London, facing lengthy commutes as their employers attempt to reduce the disruption caused by coronavirus.
Last week HSBC sent 100 employees home after a staff member in its research department in London tested positive for the coronavirus. S&P Global has asked all of its 1200-strong workforce in its Canary Wharf office to work from home after confirming the affected HSBC employee visited their office.   
The measures by Deutsche on Tuesday are expected to affect dozens of people and last until at least March 27. The bank also split some operations in London on Monday, following similar moves in places including Italy and China.
""We expect no impact on our ability to operate our full range of services for our clients and recognize that this setup will require extra effort and discipline from all,"" Deutsche said in a memo to staff."

Infineon shares opened up 6.1%, regaining some ground lost on a report last week that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had advised President Donald Trump to block the deal on national security grounds.
CFIUS, a body led by the U.S. Treasury, informed Cypress that it had determined ""there are no unresolved national security concerns"" with the merger, the San Jose, California-based company said in a statement.
Cypress shares surged 45% to $22.20 in after-hours U.S. trading on Monday.
Infineon said that, while the CFIUS review was now complete, the transaction remains subject to approval from China’s State Administration for Market Regulation and other customary closing conditions under the merger agreement.
Munich-based Infineon, announcing the deal last June, said it would create an automotive leader with a 13% market share by combining its prowess in managing electric drivetrains with Cypress's edge in in-car entertainment.
Infineon, a constituent of Germany's DAX blue-chip index, had hoped for a lift into the world's top-10 semiconductor makers through the deal."

The whole of Italy has been placed under lockdown until next month in an attempt to beat the spread of the virus, the government announced on Monday.
""Due to quarantine restrictions that were recently imposed across Italy, Norwegian has decided to temporarily halt its flights,"" the airline said.
A flight from New York to Rome was canceled on Monday, Norwegian said, while flights between Oslo and Rome will similarly be called off on Tuesday.
The cancellations add to an already difficult financial situation at Norwegian, which last week scrapped its 2020 outlook and has lost 70% of its market value this year.
In Norway, passenger air traffic abruptly fell by 5% in the final days of February, following the confirmation on Feb. 26 of the country's first coronavirus case, national airport operator Avinor said.
""We've seen a clear drop in traffic going into March, and we expect this to continue for as long as the coronavirus situation lasts,"" Avinor Chief Executive Dag Falk-Petersen said.
Britain's Flybe collapsed on March 5 as bookings faltered amid the virus outbreak, and a further shakeout in the industry is seen as likely, industry experts have warned.
A pioneer in low-cost transatlantic travel, Norwegian in recent years launched flights from the Italian capital to major U.S. cities such as Los Angeles and Boston, as well as New York.
On March 5, as the coronavirus outbreak escalated, the company said it would cancel 22 flights between Europe and the United States from March 28 to May 5.

Norwegian last week also canceled flights to and from the worst affected areas of northern Italy.

STOCKHOLM/BEIJING (Reuters) - IKEA on Tuesday started selling its products on Alibaba's (N:BABA) Chinese e-commerce platform Tmall, the first time the world's biggest furniture retailer has sold through a third party in its 77-year history.
The move is aimed at reaching more shoppers in a country where shoppers to a larger extent than elsewhere favour multi-brand online platforms - and also comes as China battles a coronavirus outbreak that prompted IKEA to shut all its 30 stores temporarily at the end of January.
IKEA said it saw its virtual store on Tmall - initially a six-month test across the east coast provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui, and the city of Shanghai - as a complement to its own stores, online store and shoppable app. 
""We see this as a good opportunity to become accessible for many more in China, especially in light of what the Chinese digital environment looks like,"" Tolga Oncu, head of retail at Ingka, which owns most IKEA stores worldwide, told Reuters.
""We are testing this to see 'how does this impact our brand, how does this impact our infrastructure, our own stores and e-commerce, do we reach new segments ... and of course also what will the result look like',"" he said in an interview.
The trial marks another attempt to adapt to rapidly changing shopping patterns for the group, which until a decade ago almost solely relied on its giant out-of-town warehouse stores.
To become more accessible, IKEA has in recent years invested heavily in expanding online and in new sales channels. It is now rolling out a new shoppable app as well as inner-city store formats.
If the test proves successful, IKEA aims to roll the Tmall store out to more parts of China. But there are no plans currently to sell through third parties in other markets, said Jon Abrahamsson Ring, incoming CEO at brand owner Inter IKEA. 
""In other markets there are other conditions. So we don’t see this as a starting point for a full roll-out, or a full commitment to this type of channel,"" Abrahamsson Ring said. 
IKEA sees China as a key growth market. The store on Tmall will offer around 3,800 of IKEA's around 9,500 products as well as services available in its own sales channels, such as delivery and assembly.
IKEA has 30 big-box stores plus three other outlets in China, all of which were closed by Jan. 30 due to the coronavirus outbreak that has locked down large parts of China, spurring a move to home delivery as people steer clear of shopping malls and as people in quarantine spend much more time at home.
  Oncu said the outbreak had not influenced the timing of the Tmall launch. 
The company said as of Monday it had reopened 16 of its locations, and planned to reopen another 12 on Wednesday, as China eases curbs on travel and public activity amid a tumble in new infection numbers.
""IKEA is the world's leading home furnishing retailer and loved by many Chinese consumers,"" said Jiang Fan, president of Tmall and Taobao at  Alibaba  Group. 

""It is truly exciting for us to help IKEA explore online channels and to enable more Chinese consumers to purchase IKEA products with greater convenience.""

65,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 02:04AM ET</span>",Cratering U.S. Yields Pose a Disaster for Asia’s Giant Savers,"(Bloomberg) -- The last great refuge for giant Asian pools of savings -- U.S. bond yields -- is dramatically collapsing, posing a major challenge to investment strategies among pension funds and insurance firms in Japan and Taiwan.
The cratering in benchmark Treasury yields since late January, sparked by fears over the coronavirus and now the bear market in oil, took 10-year rates as low as 0.31% Monday. That was less than a week after they fell below 1% for the first time. Yields on investment grade U.S. corporate debt have also hit record lows.
For the moment, the bond rally means big mark-to-market gains for holders of Treasuries, U.S. agency securities and other high-grade debt in the world’s largest fixed-income market. But as existing holdings mature, and as Northeast Asian economies look to deploy their continuing current-account surpluses, there will be a much less attractive income stream.
“In the very short term, it’s an earnings boost. The problems come in three months,” said Michael Makdad, a Morningstar Inc. equity analyst in Tokyo. “I’ll need to make many adjustments” to recommendations in coming weeks, he said. “The strains are most immediate for Japanese institutions like Japan Post Bank, Norinchukin and life insurers.”
Japan Post Bank Co., which has $1.8 trillion of deposits to invest, illustrates the problem of the big repositories of aging Northeast Asians’ savings. Domestic bond yields are too low to cover the firm’s costs, estimated last year at 0.57% of its funds. Even 40-year Japanese government bonds, with 0.26% yields, would leave it on a road to bankruptcy.
That’s why the bank poured into U.S. bonds, which offered much higher rates. Ten-year Treasuries averaged 2.27% yields over the five years through 2019, for example. Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, the world’s biggest pension fund, and Taiwanese insurers have been among those flocking to dollar bonds in recent years.
‘Virtually Disappear’
But now they face the potential of permanently lower yields. The history of Japanese bonds suggests they don’t return to previous highs after big declines. Through cycles of Federal Reserve easing, Treasuries, too, for the past two decades have failed to get back to yields seen before the U.S. central bank started cutting rates.
“Attractive assets have virtually disappeared,” said Tsuyoshi Ueno, a senior economist at NLI Research Institute in Tokyo. “If U.S. yields stay low structurally, banks, pensions and life insurers will all be in a difficult position with their overseas securities investments.”
Those investments are mammoth. Japanese funds, including the government, had some $1.67 trillion of long-term holdings of Treasuries and agency and corporate bonds as of the latest U.S. Treasury data. Taiwan had $580 billion.
The issue isn’t confined to Asia: institutional investors around the world that need to use long-dated assets to match their liabilities have sought the relatively healthy yields on offer in U.S. debt. European investors who have coped with negative yields on bonds for years now may need to account for risks of any similar move in the U.S.
Even with the rally, U.S. yields for now remain above those in Japan and Taiwan, suggesting that flows to the American market will be sustained.
“There seems to be little choice but to continue to buy Treasuries,” said Eiichiro Miura, general manager in Tokyo of the fixed-income department of Nissay Asset Management Corp. Long-term money pools may also seek more investments in higher rated corporate credit, he said.
But the lower yields are bound to bite, particularly if investments are hedged for currency risk. When that cost is high, as it has been at points over the past year, it materially reduces, or eliminates returns. For Japanese investors, hedged 10-year Treasuries had a negative 0.77% yield Tuesday in Tokyo.
It all increases the incentive for many funds to look at alternative assets, such as buying into real-estate developments or private-equity, though those involve much more analysis and lead time than placing an order for bonds.
And some funds may simply need to lower return targets, according to Jennifer Kusuma, senior Asia rates strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group in Singapore. For now, the bond rally may keep them going, she said.
“Further out, re-investment of coupons and investment of fresh funds would be a more challenging process,” she said."

Australia’s benchmark index rose 3.1% to close at 5,939.6, its largest gain since Nov. 2016, after having earlier declined as much as 3.9%. The market flirted with a bear run, briefly falling more than 20% from its Feb. 20 record amid growing concerns over the virus and a sharp plunge in oil prices.
The S&P/ASX 200 index followed U.S. stock futures higher after President Donald Trump promised “very substantial relief” for the economy as the coronavirus spreads. Contracts on the S&P 500 E-mini futures erased earlier losses as Trump said he’s considering payroll-tax cuts.
Australia’s government is also finalizing a fiscal package aimed at keeping companies in business and protecting jobs, as the outbreak hits an economy already reeling from a prolonged drought and a brutal summer of wildfires.
“Australia is on the front foot with an imminent announcement of sensible pre-budget stimulus,” said AMP Capital Investors Ltd. portfolio manager Dermot Ryan. “It’s always better to move early and keep economic momentum.”
Expect erratic swings in the market amid heightened volatility and lower liquidity, said Eleanor Creagh, a strategist at Saxo Capital Markets.
“Bear markets witness some of the fiercest upside rallies,” she said. “To have real confidence in buying into any relief rally, volatility needs to reset meaningfully lower -- that sentiment is flowing through to the Aussie market.”
A price war for oil sent energy stocks tumbling on Monday, pushing the S&P/ASX 200 to its biggest one-day retreat since 2008. Energy shares were among the biggest gainers Tuesday, helping to offset sharp declines on Monday. Viva Energy Group Ltd. was the top performer on the benchmark with a 14% jump, while Cooper Energy Ltd. closed 12% higher.
The nation’s big-four banks also soared on Tuesday. Westpac Banking Corp., National Australia Bank Ltd., Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and Commonwealth Bank of Australia all posted their biggest advances since Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s shock election win last year.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group Inc is in exclusive talks to take SOHO China Ltd private in a $4 billion deal, said two sources, in one of its biggest bets yet on the Chinese market and which sent the target's shares to a 21-month high.
The U.S. private equity firm entered exclusive discussions in early February with Hong Kong-listed SOHO China, a major prime office developer in China. The U.S. firm offered HK$6 ($0.77) per share to take the company private, said the people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The price represents an almost 100% premium to the HK$3.03 average price of SOHO China's shares in January. 
SOHO China's shares jumped as much as 39.9% to HK$4.17 following the Reuters report - their highest since June 2018 - before trading in them was halted at 11:12 local time on Tuesday.
The details of privatising SOHO China, founded in 1995 by Chairman Pan Shiyi and Chief Executive Zhang Xin, are expected to be finalised in the coming weeks, said the people, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media. 
Blackstone would also take over the debt of SOHO China, said one of the people, which stood at 32.68 billion yuan ($4.70 billion) as of the end of June 2019, according to its interim report.
The move demonstrates Blackstone's confidence in the world's second-largest economy in the face of a softening property market and economic slowdown. The New York-based alternative asset management giant is a long-time property specialist. In September, it raised $20.5 billion in the world's largest-ever real estate fund. In 2018, it raised $7.1 billion for its biggest-ever property fund in Asia.
China's office rental sector is expected to come under strain from the economic impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak, although surveys have shown most investors so far expect the sector to bounce back rapidly.
SOHO China's investment properties were valued at $8.78 billion as of the end of June last year, showed its 2019 interim report.
The developer started to sell prime commercial property assets last year as its founders looked to shift their focus to overseas markets. Among the sales were eight office projects in Beijing and Shanghai. Blackstone was one of the buyers, said the second source. 
Buying the company is simpler than acquiring its properties individually and would provide Blackstone with more certainty in completing a transaction, said both people.
Husband and wife Pan and Zhang own 63.93% of SOHO China and plan to retain a small stake after any deal with Blackstone, said the second source.
Blackstone declined to comment. SOHO China did not respond to requests for comment. 
SOHO China, known for its distinctive, modern developments and celebrity management team, went public in Hong Kong in 2007, as Chinese property firms tapped markets to fund expansion in what was then a booming sector. The IPO priced at HK$8.3 per share, but the stock plunged to a low of HK$1.006 during the global financial crisis in the following year.
Pan, known for his outspokenness about the real estate market, has often appeared in fashion magazines and other media alongside Zhang, who worked at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in the early 1990s.
SOHO China changed its business model in 2012 to build-and-hold from build-and-sell to maintain a more stable income stream from rents rather than property sales, but that has led to a slide in underlying profit. 
SOHO China posted a net profit of 565 million yuan in the first six months of 2019, down 48% from the same period a year earlier. 

Blackstone's China real estate investments include $1.25 billion paid for Mapletree Business City Shanghai and VivoCity Shanghai.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) plans to increase its production capacity for certain car parts at its $2 billion factory in China, according to a government document seen by Reuters, as it pushes to localize its supply chain in the world's biggest auto market.
The U.S. automaker, which started delivering Model 3 electric sedans from its Shanghai factory in December, plans to add lines to make more battery packs, electric motors, and motor controllers, according to the document submitted by Tesla to Shanghai government.
Tesla, which as of end-December used about 70% imported parts for the cars it made in China, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
But according to the document, Tesla wants to almost double its annual building capacity for cooling pipes, a key part in a car's heat management system, to 260,000 sets a year from 150,000. It did not provide capacity details for other parts.
The planned production line will not include battery cell manufacturing but will package out-sourced battery cells at the plant, the document said.
Tesla has previously said it wants to localize its entire supply chain in China by the end of this year.
The company is also building an additional stamping line to speed up car production in Shanghai, according to construction documents seen by Reuters.
The Shanghai factory is key to Tesla's growth strategy. There it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans and later hike output to 250,000 a year, including the Model Y, according to a Shanghai government filing in 2018.
The company aims to deliver more than 500,000 vehicles globally by end-2020.
Tesla's production and delivery plans in Shanghai, however, have been disrupted by a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 3,100 people in the world's No.2 economy. Passenger car retail sales in China plunged around 80% in February due to the epidemic, industry data shows."

Delta Airlines Inc (N:DAL) said Monday it would waive change fees for customers who had previously booked tickets and are scheduled to travel through April 30.
Delta and other major U.S. airlines previously announced they would waive the change fees for people buying new tickets through March 31. Customers will still be responsible for any change in ticket prices when they rebook.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said later on Monday it would also waive change fees for people who had previously bought tickets.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) also plans to announce it will also waive the change fees through the end of April for people who previously bought tickets, a person briefed on the matter said.
The expanded waivers come as major U.S. airlines have reported a sharp drop off in travel demand and have cutback on flights, especially to Asia and Italy where the virus has hit hardest.
United said it was making the change due to ""the high level of uncertainty regarding travel because of COVID-19.""
It said passengers must rebook travel by the end of the year or 12 months from the issue date, whichever is earlier, and the new date must be within 12 months from the original ticket issue date.
Some U.S. lawmakers have called on the Transportation Department to order the airlines to drop the change fees.

Trump Package to Leave Out Travel Industry for Now (11:36 a.m. HK)
The U.S. economic package to be unveiled by President Donald Trump will leave out for now any aid for the travel industry, which has been battered by the coronavirus outbreak, according to people familiar with the matter, raising the risk that the plan won’t go far enough to satisfy investors.
As outlined by Trump in remarks Monday, the proposal will likely include a payroll tax cut and a short-term expansion of paid sick leave, according to the people, who described the plan on condition of anonymity ahead of its planned release on Tuesday.
While the White House wants to find a way to help airlines and hospitality companies reeling from a plunge in demand from travelers, administration officials remain uncertain about the best way to do so.
China’s Xi Pays First Visit to Wuhan Since Outbreak (11:31 a.m HK)
Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the coronavirus epicenter of Wuhan for the first time since the disease emerged, state media said, a trip intended to project confidence that his government has managed to stem its spread domestically.
Xi arrived Tuesday morning in the capital of hard-hit Hubei province, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Wuhan, where the disease first emerged in December, has been quarantined since Jan. 23, in what some people see as a heavy-handed approach following earlier failures to act quickly enough to stem the spread.
U.S. Tests Fewer Than 5,000, Atlantic Reports (10:35 a.m. HK)
Only 4,384 people in the U.S. have been tested for the new coronavirus, nearly two weeks after the disease was found to be spreading across America, according to the Atlantic.
While more than 500 cases have been reported in the U.S., experts say the number is too small to reflect the full extent of the disease’s spread as not enough Americans have been tested, the Atlantic wrote.
“The lack of testing means that it is almost impossible to know how many Americans are infected with the coronavirus and suffering from Covid-19, the disease it causes,” the Atlantic wrote.
Trump Hasn’t Been Tested for Virus, White House Says (10:19 a.m. HK)
U.S. President Trump “has not received Covid-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed Covid-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.
She said Trump “remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.”
SEC Asks Employees to Work From Home (10:18 a.m. HK)
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is encouraging employees at its sprawling Washington headquarters to work remotely beginning Tuesday amid concern that one of the agency’s workers may have contracted the coronavirus.
In an email to staff on Monday evening that was obtained by Bloomberg News, the SEC said that “out of an abundance of caution” it was requiring all people on the floor where the person sat to “telework.” The regulator said it was also reaching out to people with whom the person had been in contact, and that the agency had asked its landlord to have the area “deep cleaned.”
In a statement, the SEC confirmed that an employee was treated for respiratory symptoms and was being tested for coronavirus. The SEC told staff in the email that the employee hadn’t been at work since March 5 and that officials believed the person was “asymptomatic” while in the building.
Japan to Introduce Penalties for Mask Resales (10:17 a.m. HK)
Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the government will introduce penalties on re-selling masks as it tries to head off price gouging and make sure there is an ample supply as the country battles the new coronavirus.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Worker Quarantined (10:07 a.m. HK)
 Boeing Co . said an employee from its Everett facility in Washington state has tested positive for the virus and is now in quarantine. The company has asked coworkers who were in close contact with the person to remain home in self quarantine and monitor their health. It also said it conducted thorough cleaning of work areas and common spaces.
Apple China IPhone Shipments Dive 60% (10 a.m. HK)
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhone shipments in China plunged more than 60% in February, when the coronavirus outbreak shut down scores of its stores and hampered key manufacturing partners across its largest international market.
Shipments of Apple’s marquee device dropped to about 494,600 units from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on monthly data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think-tank. Overall mobile phone shipments, including Android devices, slid 56% to 6.4 million units, the academy said. Those year-earlier comparisons were skewed by the fact that the Lunar New Year holidays fell in February of 2019, versus January this year.
Since erupting in China in January, the Covid-19 epidemic has hit Apple’s supply and demand. While factories are gradually restarting after enforced quarantine, lingering production bottlenecks risk hurting global iPhone revenue in coming months.
South Korea Reports 131 New Coronavirus Cases (9:48 a.m. HK)
South Korea’s health ministry confirmed 131 more coronavirus cases in the nation, raising the total to 7,513, according to a statement. The number continues a declining trend since March 6. Total deaths in the country rose to 54 from 51 previously.
New White House Chief of Staff Quarantined (9:13 a.m. HK)
Mark Meadows, Donald Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff, has quarantined himself after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Meadows, a veteran Republican congressman from North Carolina, joins five other lawmakers who are putting themselves in quarantine or restricting their work after contact with people who tested positive for the virus.
Earlier Monday, Republican Representatives Doug Collins of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida announced that they had gone into self-imposed quarantine after learning they’d come in contact at a conservative group’s conference with an individual who subsequently tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Meadows was also in contact with that individual, the person familiar with the matter said on Monday night. He was tested for the coronavirus, and although that test came back negative and he has no symptoms, he’s staying at home until Wednesday, when the 14-day risk period expires, the person added.
Japan Cabinet Approves Bill for Emergency: Kyodo (9:09 a.m. HK)
Japan’s cabinet approved a bill that would enable the declaration of an emergency over the new coronavirus if needed, Kyodo News reported.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would be able to declare an emergency in the case of a rapid nationwide spread of the infection, Kyodo said. Doing so would empower regional governors to call on local people to avoid going out, and for limits on the use of facilities where large numbers of people gather.
While his expert panel said Monday that there was, as yet, no explosive spread of the disease in the country, Abe told parliament he wanted to prepare for the worst-case scenario. Japan has confirmed more than 500 cases of the virus, with nine dead.
KKR Shuts London Offices After Virus Case (9:04 a.m. HK)
A KKR & Co. employee in London has the coronavirus, leading the private equity firm to close both of its offices in the city while it has them sanitized. KKR has asked employees at the London offices to work from home until further notice and is requiring all staff who had close contact with the person infected with the virus to quarantine themselves for 14 days.
Firms around the world have been preparing for more employees to work from home and separating parts of their work forces to limit the potential of an outbreak to disrupt operations key to financial markets. Firms including  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. have confronted cases of the virus among staff in recent days.
China Reports 19 New Cases, 17 New Deaths (8:26 a.m. HK)
China reported 19 additional coronavirus cases as of March 9, according to a statement from the National Health Commission, bringing the total number of infections to 80,754. The new cases are the lowest since Jan. 18.
The death toll in China rose by 17 to 3,136, with all of the latest fatalities occurring in Hubei. Discharged patients rose by 1,297 to a total of 59,897.
U.S. Sports Leagues Limit Locker Room Access (7:53 a.m. HK)
Major U.S. pro sports leagues are banning media and anyone other than necessary personnel from team locker rooms.
Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League will limit locker room and clubhouse access to players and “essential employees” of teams, the leagues said in a joint statement. Media access will be maintained in designated areas outside locker rooms and clubhouses, the statement said.
The move is the latest response by sports organizations to the coronavirus outbreak. But it stops short of some of the more extreme measures that some leagues have imposed around the world, such as canceling games or holding competitions with no spectators.
U.S. to Produce 4 Million Tests a Week: Azar (7:44 a.m. HK)
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that by the end of the week, the U.S. expects to produce 4 million coronavirus tests each week. He said 2.1 million tests have shipped or are ready to be shipped, and that so far no individual that a public health official has said has needed a test has gone without one.
Italy to Extend Travel Ban Nationwide (4:52 p.m. NY)
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he’ll move to extend restrictive measures on travel -- currently in force in the north -- throughout the rest of the country in a bid to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
WHO Says Outbreak Close to Being a Pandemic (12:53 p.m. NY)
The spread of the new coronavirus is very close to being a pandemic after the disease has reached more than 100 countries, Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Program, said at a daily briefing.
“The threat of a pandemic has become very real,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “But it would be the first pandemic in history that could be controlled.”
Ryan said countries that shift solely to mitigation are conceding defeat and that they shouldn’t give up on containment efforts. The WHO said China and South Korea’s efforts have borne fruit, and that it hopes to see results from Italy’s recent measures in coming days.
The mortality rate for people 80 and over exceeds 20%, said Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, citing figures from the WHO’s mission to China.

Investing.com - Asian markets were mixed on Tuesday in Asia as oil prices recovered from Monday’s more than 20% plunge. 
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.6% by 10:43 PM ET (02:43 GMT), while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.4% after data showed producer prices in the country fell 0.4% from a year earlier, compared with the expectations of a 0.3% drop. 
Consumer prices rose 5.2% as compared to a year earlier, in line with forecasts.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.5%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.1%, while South Korea’s KOSPI stayed little changed. 
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 traded 1.3% higher. 
Investor sentiment recovered somewhat today after oil prices rebounded from the 24% plunge yesterday, which was their worst one-day drop since 1991. 
A potential price war and escalating tensions between Russia and Saudi Arabia were cited as the catalyst for the oil selling on Monday as OPEC failed to strike a deal with its allies, led by Russia, about oil production cuts.
On the coronavirus front, World Health Organization (WHO) officials said they saw signs that the virus seems to have been controlled in China and some other countries such as Singapore. 
However, the officials noted that the virus is now present in more than 100 countries globally, while confirmed cases have topped 100,000. 
“In many countries, it will get worse before it gets better,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead of WHO’s emergencies program.
“Absolutely, we see a light at the end of the tunnel, but how quickly we get there depends on what countries do.”
China reported 19 new confirmed cases and 17 additional deaths as of March 9, according to the country’s National Health Commission, bring the total number of infection to 80,754, with 3,136 deaths to-date. 
Globally, there were at least 110,029 confirmed cases and 3,817 reported deaths, according to the WHO. 
Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 7.79% to hit a new 52-week low, while the S&P 500 index fell 7.60%, and the NASDAQ Composite index declined 7.29%.
It was their biggest one-day slide in stocks since the financial crisis in 2008."

Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Holdings Ltd on Monday said NAV, a key performance measure for investment companies, was $27.7 per share as of March 9, up 2.8% year-to-date.
Various hedges ""more than compensated"" for recent market declines that hit portfolio companies, Ackman said in a letter to shareholders.
Markets worldwide have come under pressure as the coronavirus spreads rapidly across the globe, causing widespread supply disruption and large-scale quarantine measures as governments scramble to contain the outbreak.
""We expect the capital markets and our portfolio to continue to be volatile,"" Ackman said.
Earlier this month, Ackman said he moved to protect the firm's portfolio against coronavirus-related panic selling in markets, though he declined to say what steps he took.
The S&P 500 index has lost nearly 15% so far this year.
""Despite recent market declines, we believe that equity and credit markets have not sufficiently discounted the economic risks of coronavirus,"" Ackman said.
The Pershing Square Holdings portfolio, the biggest at Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management firm, returned a stunning 58.1% last year, making it one of the world's best performing hedge funds."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) will cut its international capacity by nearly 25% over the next six months and delay an order for Airbus (PA:AIR) A350 planes as part of sweeping changes in response to a coronavirus-led plunge in passenger demand.
The Australian airline also said on Tuesday it is cancelling plans for a A$150 million ($98.73 million) off-market share buyback to preserve cash.
Qantas' chief executive and chairman will take no salary for the rest of the current financial year, the management team will receive no bonuses and all staff are being encouraged to take paid or unpaid leave.
""We are using every lever we can to avoid redundancies,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce told reporters in Sydney. ""We think we can do that into September with these cuts.""
Airlines around the world are experiencing a collapse in demand due to the coronavirus, which an industry body last week estimated could lower passenger revenue by as much as $113 billion this year.
Qantas shares fell as much as 7.2% in early trade on Tuesday but later rebounded to trade 6.8% higher at 0130 GMT, compared with a 1.5% rise in the broader market (AXJO). 
""This is a significant but appropriate response,"" Jefferies analyst Anthony Moulder told clients of the action taken by management.
The airline said it could no longer provide guidance on the financial impact of the coronavirus, which at the time of its half-year results on Feb. 20 it had estimated could result in a A$100 million to A$150 million hit to underlying earnings before interest and tax this financial year.
The carrier is now grounding the equivalent of 38 planes, more than double the 18 it had announced last month.
Qantas' capacity reduction for the June quarter will rise to 17%, up from 4% at the time of its interim results. That includes plans to ground eight of its 12 A380 superjumbos, with two remaining flying and the other two in maintenance. 
AIRBUS DELAY
The carrier had been expected to place an order for up to 12 A350-1000 planes capable of the world's longest flights from Sydney to London by the end of the month. 
Airbus had set that deadline on the basis the production slots were potentially valuable and could be sold to other airlines, Joyce said.
""In the current environment that doesn't seem to be the case. Nobody is ordering aircraft,"" he said. ""We have asked Airbus for a delay in the decision. We would rather wait for the coronavirus issue to be out of the way before we put a firm aircraft order in for the A350.""
Airbus did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Joyce said the airline remains hopeful of pilots voting in favor of a proposed pay package for the flights. Qantas last month said it would hire other pilots to fly the A350s if a deal was not approved. 

The union has not yet issued a formal recommendation to Qantas pilots on the issue. Two leaders last week sent memos, viewed by Reuters, advising pilots to reluctantly approve the company's offer but the pair do not represent the entire union committee.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -  Heineken  NV (AS:HEIN) will invest 865 million reais ($183.14 million) to expand its Ponta Grossa brewing plant in Brazil, the company said on Monday, as competition between the world's two largest beer makers bubbles up.
The Dutch brewer will make the investment this year and next and focus on it Heineken and Amstel brands at the third-largest brewing facility in Parana state in Brazil, its most important market worldwide.
The company did not give details of the expansion plan, stating only that production would rise by 75%.
""We are bringing forward by one year all the investments
of our strategic plan. Brazil is a key market for us,"" Heineken Brazil Chief Executive Officer Mauricio Giamellaro told Reuters.
""Basically, we are building a new brewery,"" he said in an interview.
Despite the slow recovery of the Brazilian economy, the world's second-largest brewer after  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) is not waiting to expand its beer production in a market that is more important for sales than the United States or Europe.
Heineken has reduced the lead in Brazil of top beer seller Ambev (SA:ABEV3), the Brazilian unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev, after buying the operation of Japan's Kirin (T:2503) for $1.2 billion in 2017, which doubled its Brazilian output. Heineken says it now has 22% of the market.
The expansion announcement came just on day after Ambev announced it will invest 2 billion reais to open a new brewery in northern Brazil, a malting factory in the southeast region, along with a can producing unit and additional premium beer production lines."
76,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 07:46PM ET</span>",Oil price plunge ramps up pressure on Pemex; hedge programs in focus,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A crash in crude prices has intensified pressure on the finances of Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), which is facing the threat of a ratings downgrade after posting one of its worst-ever losses last year.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office 15 months ago vowing to revive the struggling company, but he was unable to prevent another drop in crude production and has had only limited success in steadying its crushing debt load.
International crude prices on Monday experienced their worst daily rout since the 1991 Gulf War. Top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia began a price war that threatens to inundate global oil markets with supply and slash Mexico's oil revenues.
""The fact the oil market outlook has deteriorated due to this war is negative for Pemex, no question,"" said Raul Feliz, an economist at the CIDE think tank in Mexico City. ""And this could increase talk of a ratings downgrade.""
All three leading rating agencies have put Pemex's creditworthiness on a negative outlook, indicating that the company faces a significant risk of further downgrades.
Pemex's net loss of $9 billion in the final quarter of 2019 did little to ease those fears.
Fitch last year downgraded the firm's bonds to junk status. If another of the agencies followed suit, it would trigger a forced sell-off of billions of dollars in Pemex debt by investors who are obliged to hold investment-grade assets.
Rating agencies Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch did not reply to requests by Reuters for comment.
The government initially had some success in lightening Pemex's debt load via various financial market measures.
But financial debt crept up again and ended the year above $105 billion, almost back where it started, while Pemex's pension liabilities leapt by a third.
Not everything on the horizon is gloomy.
Mexico reported a 6.2% year-on-year increase in crude output in January, bucking the trend of years of decline.
The government and Pemex have also locked in higher crude revenues by contracting options through an annual hedging program used as insurance against price shocks.
Pemex's chief executive, Octavio Romero, said in January the company had contracted a ""small portion"" of its hedge for this year. He did not say at what price or how many barrels.
That same month, Mexico said the larger Finance Ministry hedge was completed at $49 a barrel, for $1.37 billion in total.
Feliz at CIDE noted Pemex's hedge would directly cushion the blow of the oil price slump, while the ministry's program could generate funds that could be plowed into the company.
But if the Saudi-Russian oil war is prolonged, Pemex's finances will likely come under increasing strain.
New oil discoveries or a bid by the government to lure private capital into the energy sector could mitigate that risk.
But there has been little indication of that from Lopez Obrador, who has set about carving out a bigger role for the state in energy, much to the chagrin of the business community.
At the center of rating agencies' gaze will be how Pemex's debt compares with its proven crude reserves, Feliz noted.
""Pemex's investment levels are not sufficient to stabilize production and simultaneously keep up proven reserves,"" he said."

HSBC identified six occasions between 2014 and 2018 when it failed to disclose an interest rate increase to borrowers, the commission said in a statement.

Investing.com - The S&P 500 is now a drop of about 32 points away from being in a bear market (it came within a couple of points intraday). That’s just a decline of 1.15% and relief rallies notwithstanding, shows investors are seriously concerned about a global recession.
Yields hit yet more record lows, with the 10-Year Treasury falling below 0.4% to an intraday low of 0.318% before recovering about 0.56%.
The economic and earnings calendars are sparse Tuesday, which is just as well since the markets are in the grips of big events and any granular numbers would be largely ignored.
Instead, along with Wall Street stock index futures investors should be looking at headlines about how governments are handling the Covid-19 spread and the economic impact of the virus.
1. White House Weighs Fiscal Options
With the markets in panic mode, President Donald Trump is set to meet with his economic team in crafting a further response to reassure investors and businesses.
Among possible actions are guaranteeing paid sick leave, a payroll tax cut or tax cuts for specific industries. A spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee said “targeted tax relief measures” are being considered.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow will brief Republican senators at a lunch Tuesday, NBC reported, so headlines could start to flow out then.
2. Who Goes on Lockdown Next?
Investors will also be looking for any more strict moves governments make in attempts to keep Covid-19 in check.
Israel announced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all foreign visitors and then Italy’s prime minister announced that restriction of movement will be extended to the entire nation.
This move will “lead to other European countries to become more risk averse” and spillover effects will be seen directly and indirectly through “the economics of fear,” Allianz (DE:ALVG) Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian tweeted.
It’s also another signal of how difficult it is for markets to get its hands around slowdown left-tail risk, or the risk of portfolio returns moving than three standard deviations from the mean due to a market shock.


3. Oil Shows Signs of Slight Recovery
The oil market had everything for bears today, with Saudi Arabia and Russia turning a busted production cut deal in to an all-out price war on top of more fears of demand destruction.
That resulted in crude prices plunging 25%, the worst drop since the 1991 Gulf War.
Price recovered slightly in late trading Monday, rising about 2.3% from the day’s settlement.
Tomorrow the American Petroleum Institute will release its measure of weekly U.S. oil inventories, which rose by 1.69 million barrels the week before.
The question is how much the market will be interested in U.S. supply, let alone numbers from last week."

The cosmetics maker has been struggling to attract youngsters in a competitive market that houses several upstart brands, including actor Millie Bobby Brown's Florence by Mills vegan cosmetics, and bigger companies such as L'Oreal (PA:OREP) and  Estee Lauder  (N:EL).
Its sales has declined for at least five quarters. Revlon posted preliminary fourth-quarter revenue of $699.4 million, well below market estimates of $755.4 million, hit by weak demand for its fragrances and namesake products.
It said it expects to incur between $55 million and $65 million in charges in 2020, mainly due to severance and contract termination costs.
Its biggest shareholder MacAndrews and Forbes, the holding company through which billionaire Ronald Perelman owns about 87% stake in Revlon, had said in August last year that the cosmetics maker was exploring options for its business.
The company also said it has entered to an agreement with Jefferies Finance LLC for $850 million in new finance to repay senior loans due in February 2021 and 2019 term loan. The company had long-term debt of $2.91 billion as of Dec. 31."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are betting that markets will stay turbulent in the coming weeks, after an avalanche of selling in U.S. stocks sent volatility to levels not seen since the financial crisis.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" climbed by more than 20 points above its Friday closing level to peak at 62.12, its highest level since December 2008. Its surge came as the S&P 500 notched a 7% drop on concerns over the spreading coronavirus and a 24% plunge in oil prices. The VIX ended Monday's session at 54.46.
Despite that sell-off, the term structure for the VIX remained inverted on Monday, with shorter-dated contracts at higher levels than longer-dated ones, an indication that investors may be bracing for sustained volatility.
An inversion is sometimes read as a contrarian signal, with U.S. stocks tending to recoup their losses in the weeks after the pattern occurs.
This time around, VIX futures have continued to rise, maintaining the inverted shape of the term structure, as markets have been roiled over the past two weeks.
The current inversion - stretching all the way to seventh-month contracts expiring in September - suggests that investors see enduring risks ahead, said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management in Orland Park, Illinois.
""To us, this indicates this is more of a systemic issue,"" he said. ""It's not a flash in the pan.""
The sustained rise of the VIX has rewarded investors who had placed bets on a surge in volatility during calmer times.
One trader purchased some 300,000 March VIX calls redeemable when the index hit 24 at near 50 cents each. On Monday afternoon, March VIX calls at a strike price of 24 were trading near $21 each, which would put potential profits at $615 million."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said on Monday it charged Fifth Third Bank, National Association, for creating fake client deposit and credit-card accounts and transferring clients' funds to those accounts without consent, citing an abuse of fair lending and savings laws.
The Cincinnati-based lender did not admit or deny the consumer watchdog's allegations that it engaged in unauthorized account openings and money transfers, the CFPB said in a statement.
""Despite knowing since at least 2008 that employees were opening unauthorized consumer-financial accounts, Fifth Third took insufficient steps to detect and stop the conduct and to identify and remediate harmed consumers,"" the CFPB said.
It also alleged that the program ""created incentives for employees to engage in misconduct in order to meet goals or earn additional compensation"" at least until 2016.
The CFPB's charges follow the pursuit of U.S. financial regulators to stamp out fair lending and savings abuses by another national lender,  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC). Wells Fargo agreed last month to pay $3 billion to resolve criminal and civil probes of fraudulent sales practices and admitted to pressuring employees in a fake-accounts scandal.
That scandal led to the resignation of two directors on Monday.
The consumer watchdog said it was seeking legal permission to stop First Third's conduct, seek redress for customers and impose a money penalty."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With the U.S. markets in turmoil due to coronavirus-driven recession fears and plunging oil prices, investors and analysts on Monday said they were factoring in the possibility that a blackening economic outlook could imperil President Donald Trump's re-election bid.
Wall Street on Monday suffered its biggest one-day loss since the 2008 financial crisis, and during the trading day the Dow came about a 10th of a percent from confirming a bear market -- defined by a drop of at least 20% below the most recent peak.
While Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat posed by the flu-like virus, investors and analysts warned that the economic fallout could hurt his re-election chances in November.
""President Trump's reelection likely hinges on the economy -- a medical and/or economic shock from COVID-19 are arguably the biggest threats to his re-election,"" Raymond James analysts said in a note on Sunday, referring to the virus's official name.
""To preserve the economy and prevent a further market sell-off, it is in the best interest of President Trump to aggressively push for a large-scale fiscal response,"" they wrote.
On Monday, several investors and economists said they expected the markets to slump further, adding that the longer the slump lasted, the greater the threat it posed to Trump's bid for re-election.
""If we go into recession, history speaks for itself. No sitting president has ever been re-elected in a recession, ""said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist for Spartan Capital Securities.
The selloff, which has wiped more than $4 trillion off U.S. equity markets, accelerated on Monday after Saudi Arabia and Russia began an oil price war that threatens to overwhelm global oil markets with a supply surplus. Crude prices fell 20% in their deepest daily decline since the 1991 Gulf War.
The Trump administration scrambled on Monday to assure Americans it was responding to the outbreak, rebutting criticism that it initially bungled its response and under-funded containment effort.
""The more these events affect more people, the more it's going to leave lasting impressions that can easily extend through the presidential race,"" said Jim Vogel, an interest rate strategist with FHN Financial. ""In an event like this typically the administration has the upper hand until it attracts so much negative attention. A national crisis is a positive for an incumbent as long as things don't get out of hand.""
Still, some investors said Trump may have time to recover if the outbreak is short-lived.
""If you’re President Trump fortunately for you it’s happening earlier in the year,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, an investment adviser. ""If coronavirus passes in a matter of months and the market and the economy recovers, he’ll be in as good a shape as he was coming into this year."""

BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks plunged more than 12% on Monday to record their biggest fall since 1998 and the central bank intervened twice in the currency market as the real slumped to another record low, in a day of widespread fear and selling across global markets.
The benchmark Bovespa index's 12.3% decline (BVSP) was its biggest one-day fall since October 1998 and the seventh largest ever, with preferred shares in oil giant Petrobras recording their steepest ever decline of 30% (SA:PETR4).
The savage sell-off came after Saudi Arabia decided to ramp up oil production as OPEC's supply-cut agreement with Russia collapsed, sending ripples across global financial markets already panicking about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
""Not a good day to be in Brazil,"" said Jason Vieira, chief economist at Infinity Asset Management in Sao Paulo. ""Brazil is taking the hit more than anyone else, again. The local market suffers for the massive presence of Petrobras in the Bovespa.""
""The real has probably found its floor, but it does not mean that markets won't test the central bank again. They will,"" he added.
(GRAPHIC: Brazil stocks - daily change - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3095/3060/BOVESPA.png)
In the currency market, the central bank followed up a $3 billion spot market auction in the morning with a $465 million sale in the afternoon, as the real slumped to a new record low just shy of 4.80 per dollar (BRBY).
That marked the central bank's first intervention in the spot market since November last year, and its largest sale of dollar reserves since 2009. It arrested the real's decline, but the currency still lost around 2% of its value on Monday and has now depreciated by more than 15% this year.
Monetary policy director Bruno Serra said on Monday that the central bank will do whatever is needed and in whatever size is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market, adding that Brazil's $330 billion of net reserves provides a ""robust insurance"" against external shocks.
""The new FX approach is the right one, as we're in panic mode,"" said a senior trader at a big bank in Sao Paulo. ""It's time to provide as much liquidity as possible to contain the pressure.""
The $3.465 billion spot market intervention followed interventions in the FX swaps market in recent weeks worth almost $10 billion. The action prevented the real from falling below 4.80 per dollar and helped ease market volatility, if only slightly.

In stocks, trading on the B3 Bolsa Brasil Balcao (SA:B3SA3) was halted minutes after the open by an automatic ""circuit breaker"" triggered by the Bovespa's 10% fall. The exchange resumed trading and extended its decline.
The steep fall, led by energy firms, miners and banks, pushed the Bovespa deep into bear market territory, signaling a decline of 20% or more from its peak.
The index is now down 28% from its all-time high of 119,593 points on Jan. 24. In dollar terms, according to Reuters calculations, the Bovespa is now down 35.5% year to date, the steepest drop of any major equities index in the world.
Common and preferred shares in state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) sank 30%, the largest ever intraday fall. Petrobras' market value lost 95 billion reais ($20 billion) compared with Friday's close."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Fears about the rapidly spreading coronavirus and its impact on the global economy, which deepened on Monday with the collapse of oil prices, have evaporated over $5 trillion of the S&P 500's market value in recent weeks.
The U.S. stock benchmark's (SPX) 7.6% drop on Monday, which triggered a temporary trading halt in its biggest one-day decline since 2011, came after Saudi Arabia and Russia began a price war that threatens to overwhelm global oil markets with supply, causing crude prices to tumble 20% in their deepest daily rout since the 1991 Gulf War. 
That price war broke out after major oil producing countries failed to reach an agreement to cut output to make up for lower demand related to the coronavirus.
""It's a perfect storm. You've got a lot of uncertainty in terms of how far the virus will spread in the U.S. You layer onto this the oil price cut. The third thing is financial instability, in the sense that with yields falling as far and as fast as they're falling,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisors Alliance.

""The lower oil price is going to decimate oil stocks, the oil industry, the shale producers, and the record low interest rates are going to decimate the banks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street suffered its biggest one-day loss since the 2008 financial crisis on Monday and recession worries loomed large as tumbling oil prices and ongoing coronavirus fears prompted investor panic on the anniversary of the U.S. stock market's longest-ever bull run.
All three major U.S. stock averages plunged sharply at the opening bell, triggering trading halts put in place in the wake of 1987's ""Black Monday"" crash. The Dow plummeted a record 2,000 out of the starting gate on the day marking the current bull market's 11th year. 
During the session, the Dow came about a 10th of a percent from confirming a bear market, or 20% below its record peak. 
The S&P 500 closed about 19% below its all-time high set on Feb. 19. 
""It's certainly one for the history books,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""The markets are now pricing in a high probability of recession.""

""There's a lot of fear in the market and if the price of oil continues to move lower it's an indication that a global recession is not far away,"" Cardillo said.
The CBOE Volatility index (VIX), a gauge of investor anxiety, touched its highest level since December 2008.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields briefly sank to 0.318%, a record low.
The sell-off began over the weekend when an oil supply pact between Saudi Arabia and Russia collapsed and both countries vowed to hike production amid weakening global demand due to the coronavirus and signs of an economic slowdown.
Oil prices crashed to their lowest since the 1991 Gulf war, with Brent crude futures (LCOc1) closing down 23.88% and front-month WTI falling 25.1%, sending the S&P Energy index (SPNY) sliding 20.1%, its largest one-day drop on record.
Global markets were already on edge as worldwide confirmed cases of COVID-19 surged past 110,000, causing widespread supply disruption and large-scale quarantine measures as governments scramble to contain the outbreak.

All 11 major sectors of S&P 500 ended the session deep in red territory, with energy and interest rate-sensitive financial (SPSY) stocks suffering the largest percentage losses.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) was the biggest drag on the Dow, tumbling 13.4% following the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) rejection of the planemaker's proposal regarding wiring systems in place on its grounded 737 MAX aircraft.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares fell 7.9% after data showed the company sold fewer than 500,000 smartphones in China in February amid the coronavirus crisis.
Chipmakers registered their largest drop since October 2008, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX) falling 8.3%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 17.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 19.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Investing.com – The Dow suffered its biggest one-day point drop on record, led by a slump in oil prices, as Saudi Arabia sparked fears of a price war and the coronavirus spread deepened fears of a global recession.
The S&P 500 fell 7.6%, Nasdaq Composite lost 7.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.8%, its biggest daily percentage loss since December 2008. It was down more than 2,013 points.
Oil prices fell 24%, their worst day since 1991, sending energy stocks tumbling after Saudi Arabia launched a price war against fellow oil superpower Russia.
Saudi Arabia slashed its April official selling prices by $6 to $8 to grab market share and pile pressure on Russia. The move came after OPEC and Russia failed to agree a deal to extend oil production cuts.
""This situation seems to have no equal in oil market history,"" International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol said, referring to ""a massive supply overhang and significant demand shocks (as) the major main driver of the crisis,""
The coronavirus threat to global growth, meanwhile, continued to sour investor sentiment as infections continued to mount, with the total death toll reaching nearly 4,000, and as many as 111,000 infected.
In Italy, the death toll increased by 97 to 463 in one day, with the total number of confirmed cases rising to 9,172 from 7,375 – the most infections outside of China, where infections have been slowing.
In tech, meanwhile, FANG stocks were shunned, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) leading the decline as the hit to iPhone sales in China from the outbreak could be worse than feared.
Apple sold 494,000 iPhones last month, down from 1.27 million a year earlier, Wedbush said, citing initial data Chinese Academy of Information and Communications Technology's. It closed down 7.9%.
The rout on Wall Street drove investors toward safe havens like Treasuries, pushing yields to record lows at a time when some are betting the Federal Reserve will cut rates aggressively. 
Goldman Sachs forecast that the Fed will slash interest rate by 50 basis points when policymakers gather on March 17-18 and again at their April 28-29 meeting, to a range of 0% to 0.25%, which was last seen in 2015.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors trying to gauge the further hit to U.S. stocks from a global coronavirus outbreak and plunging oil prices are looking to past episodes of market volatility, from World War II to the SARS virus.
The good news: Past geopolitical events have typically seen the S&P 500 (SPX) take three weeks to bottom and another three weeks to recover to prior levels,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists said in a report that examined 29 past incidents of geopolitically driven market volatility.
That list includes the 9/11 attacks, the first Gulf War and Britain's vote to exit the European Union, but not market-driven events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble.
The 2020 selloff, which started on Feb. 19, is also far deeper than many prior episodes of volatility the bank studied: As of afternoon trade on Monday, the S&P 500 had already fallen more than 17% from its Feb. 19 closing high.
By comparison, the median size of the selloff in the bank's analysis was 6.3%. That includes a nearly 16% decline around the first Gulf War, a 5.6% drop on Brexit worries and a nearly 26% tumble after Germany attacked France in 1940.
""We see parallels between the virus outbreak and geopolitical shocks in that both entail potentially large but difficult to quantify risks,"" Deutsche Bank strategists Binky Chadha, Parag Thatte and Srineel Jalagani said in an analysis last week.
Still, analysts at the bank cautioned that the “uniqueness” of the coronavirus outbreak means there is no single playbook that easily fits the current situation.
Uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus’ trajectory and uneven responses to the outbreak around the world have hampered investors’ ability to determine its economic damage and further impact on asset prices.
Monday’s oil price shock on the heels of Saudi-Russian supply tensions further clouded forecasts and added a new dimension to the selloff in equities, with the S&P 500 triggering a trading halt as it fell 7% after the open.
(GRAPHIC: Geopolitical events and stock selloffs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R8FFC7Z/eikon.png)
Stretched valuations on the heels of a 30% gain in 2019 may also be helping to exaggerate downside moves during the latest pullback, the bank’s strategists said.
Of the geopolitical events tracked in the report, stocks showed a median recovery of 14.1%, a year after the bottom. But they were not always higher a year later, especially during events that coincided with recessions, such as the 9/11 attacks.
The strategists also noted that the current selloff has similarities with pullbacks associated with spikes in volatility. In such events, stocks took twice as long to bottom compared with those linked to geopolitical events and saw sharper median selloffs."

""It's inevitable in the next couple of weeks we'll see more failures,"" Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a recent interview, citing Flybe and Norwegian as vulnerable.
Within days, the British regional carrier had ceased operations, blaming the virus outbreak for a sudden cash drain, and Norwegian scrapped 2020 guidance.
Norwegian did not respond to O'Leary's comments. However, the company - which raised cash from shareholders in November for the third time in less than two years - has been cutting costs and unprofitable routes, as well as selling assets, to bolster its finances. 
Whereas four airlines now control 80% of the U.S. market, Europe remains fragmented, with governments, unions and bilateral agreements impeding tie-ups. Consolidation happens when airlines grab routes and traffic from bankrupt rivals.
Flybe's demise reduces price competition on routes it shared with Ryanair and easyJet (LON:EZJ), just as a Norwegian exit would support competitors' fares and traffic.
""This virus will expedite the thesis of consolidation, possibly to extreme levels,"" Citi analyst Mark Manduca said, adding that 35% of Europe's short-haul market was loss-making in 2019.
For investors who still want airlines, Manduca added, ""we recommend sticking with the well-capitalized names who in 2021 should be able to consolidate the market: Ryanair and IAG.""
The virus's spread is hitting more routes - prompting a 50% Lufthansa capacity cut and similar moves by others - while the full traffic impact is yet to show up in published data.
International bookings to Europe plunged 79% as the outbreak mushroomed in Italy, leaving no doubt that the slump will be worse than the 2003 SARS epidemic. It may wipe $113 billion off airlines' revenues, according to IATA, their global association.

SHUTDOWN IMPACT
Airline executives still cling to the hope of a ""V-shaped"" rebound, mirroring SARS. Those with robust balance sheets can plan for the time when demand comes roaring back.
A three-month shutdown would inflate Air France-KLM's net debt to 7.7 times earnings, Citi calculates, and swell Lufthansa's multiple to 12.4.
But Ryanair's leverage would remain at a relatively manageable 1.2, easyJet's at 1.9 and IAG's at 3.5.
Ryanair's growth has been hampered by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft - it has 135 on order - and sold-out production of the Airbus A321neo it is eyeing for Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion.
But CEO O'Leary believes the crisis may bring aircraft deals as stressed customers relinquish delivery slots, and stands ready to place orders ""today, tomorrow, next week"" if the price is right, he said at a March 3 event in Brussels.
The MAX grounding, after two deadly crashes, has cushioned Ryanair against a downturn by leaving fewer seats to fill, O'Leary acknowledged. But, with an eye on the long term, ""I would prefer not to be cushioned,"" he added. 
Mid-sized carriers such as Portugal's TAP, Alitalia and SAS are ""not in a great leverage situation"" and could succumb, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said.
Sweden's SAS is taking ""strong measures"" to rein in costs with reduced timetables, temporary layoffs and a hiring freeze, a spokeswoman said. TAP, which was partially privatized in 2015, said recent cost-cutting and debt rescheduling would allow ""better management of its treasury position"".
Alitalia, which has received 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in state loans since filing for bankruptcy in 2017, suspended most of its Milan operations on Sunday as the government locked down large areas of northern Italy. The company did not address questions about its liquidity situation.
Among airlines whose failure could drive consolidation, ""the most meaningful would be Norwegian,"" Bernstein's Roeska said, citing its large network and overlap with rivals.
""It's not guaranteed they have to go bust,"" he said, with much depending on planned asset sales. ""It's still unclear to us how long they have cash for.""
(GRAPHIC: Europe's airlines and debt - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3050/3015/European%20airlines'%20debt.png)
'NO BAILOUTS'
Even if the crisis threatens larger airlines, few would expect an Air France-KLM or a Lufthansa to be allowed to fail by their governments. But large carriers are warning against state support for smaller rivals.
""There were airlines who were looking for state aid before this happened,"" said outgoing IAG boss Willie Walsh, who cleared European regulatory hurdles to merge BA with Iberia in 2011 before adding Vueling, Aer Lingus and Air Europa.
""I don't believe this is an excuse for those weaker airlines to demand state aid,"" Walsh said.
The slump may rattle Air France-KLM, as new CEO Ben Smith pursues a costly fleet renewal to cut operating expenses and improve the group's trailing profitability.
Business bookings have been hit, Smith told Reuters, but Asia may be bottoming out and some China services could soon resume. ""We're looking every week at when we'll start returning,"" he said.
Privately, however, other executives at the Franco-Dutch group expressed concern.

Its weaker margins make Air France-KLM more fragile than major peers, said one. ""I don't see any silver linings.""

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fearful of coronavirus and potential quarantine, U.S. shoppers are avoiding touching fresh fruits and vegetables in grocery stores and stocking their pantries with pretzels, powered milk, canned meat and other packaged food.
""People are getting supplies for a bomb shelter almost,"" said Victor Colello, who heads the meat and fish department at New York-based Morton Williams (NYSE:WMB), which operates 16 stores. ""When people buy produce, they touch it. So a lot of people are thinking twice about doing that.""
Sales of celery, asparagus, chili peppers, apples and mandarins slowed in the last two weeks of February, while purchases of easily stored products that are not handled by humans - like dried beans and canned meat - grew at a faster pace.
Powdered milk sales jumped about 84% in the week ended Feb. 29, racing ahead of a 5% increase the week earlier, according to data firm Nielsen. Similarly sales of papayas fell 15.6% year-on-year, declining at a much faster rate than the week prior when sales were down only 1.4%.
At Fairway market in Manhattan's Upper West Side, shelves normally filled with prewashed lettuce sold in plastic containers were bare on Sunday morning. By contrast, there was plenty of loose lettuce for purchase.
In a conversation on Twitter, user @rexthetvterrier wrote: ""Nothing like seeing someone cough into their hand and then start picking through produce.""
""I won't buy produce,"" Twitter user @Tbevellrice replied. ""We are doing canned or frozen veggies, canned soups, bagged rice, etc.""
About 3,800 people have died so far and more than 110,000 people have been infected in the outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, China late last year and has spread to at least 105 countries and territories.
Over the past month, U.S. consumers have stocked up on food, bottled water, hand sanitizer and cleaning products as fears about the novel coronavirus outbreak mounted. In some states, health officials have urged consumers to stock up on products in case they are required to isolate themselves at home.
""Shopping trends are mimicking what we see leading up to a weather event. Customers are stocking up on paper products and a variety of food items, particularly those with a longer shelf life,"" Wegmans director of public relations Deana Percassi said. More people are shopping for their groceries online as well, and that demand is expected to continue, Percassi said.
People are not just preparing for the uncertainty of the virus, they are also trying to get ahead of other shoppers doing the same, Nielsen Global Intelligence Leader Scott McKenzie said. Fruit snacks, for instance, have flavors similar to fresh fruit but their processing gives them longer shelf life with less direct human contact, McKenzie said.
Health-conscious consumers have for several years turned away from products like pretzels and dried beans, gutting sales at companies like SPAM maker Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) and Coffee Mate-owner Nestle. But they are now selling well.
Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said, however, that this growth may not last for long, and that she did not yet expect this to materially impact full-year sales."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration scrambled on Monday to assure Americans it was responding to a growing coronavirus outbreak as stock markets plunged and top health officials urged some people to avoid cruise ships, air travel and big public gatherings. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly played down the threat posed by the flu-like virus sweeping the globe, was planning to meet with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other members of his economic team to weigh possible action, an administration official told Reuters.
Paid sick leave is among policy steps being considered, the official said on condition of anonymity.
One camp in the White House, which includes Trump, backs an across-the-board payroll tax cut, said an economist advising the administration, while top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and others advocate specific tax credits, loans or direct subsidies to certain industries or hard-hit areas.
Florida health officials said all people returning from China, Iran, South Korea and Italy must isolate for 14 days while travelers from other countries affected by the outbreak should monitor their health.
The number of confirmed U.S. cases reached 566, including 22 deaths, according to state public health authorities and a running national tally kept by the Johns Hopkins University.
Thirty-four U.S. states and the District of Columbia have reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) infections of the respiratory illness COVID-19 that can lead to pneumonia. Louisiana had the state's first presumed coronavirus case, Governor John Bel Edwards announced on Monday.
U.S. stock markets, which have sold off in the past two weeks on fears the outbreak would push the global economy into a recession, plummeted on Monday, triggering a brief trading halt on the New York Stock Exchange. The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) index was down almost 8% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) shed more than 7%.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, said the plunge suggested investors lacked confidence in the administration's coronavirus battle plan.
Trump, who often points to the stock market as a gauge of his economic record, criticized news media organizations' coverage of the outbreak in a tweet and accused Democrats of hyping the situation ""far beyond what the facts would warrant."" 
The Republican president did not have any coronavirus-related events on his schedule heading into Monday despite growing signs the outbreak was disrupting the economy and the lives of millions of Americans.
The CDC advised colleges and universities to consider asking students studying abroad to return home and cancel or postpone upcoming travel.
New Jersey's Princeton University, one of the nation's most prestigious universities, will move to virtual instruction after its spring break later this month and decrease the number of gatherings on campus, its president announced. 
Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, and other health officials say older Americans, especially those with chronic medical concerns, should avoid big social gatherings, cruise ships and airline flights.
Warnings from Fauci and others about the need for greater ""social distancing"" - the practice of minimizing unnecessary contact in public settings - came amid a high-profile example of risks now inherent in large gatherings.
U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and U.S. Representative Paul Gosar announced over the weekend they would self-quarantine after coming in contact at a conservative political conference with an attendee who later tested positive for the virus.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the administration's overall response to the crisis, also attended the conference. The White House said there was no indication they came into contact with the infected attendee. 
CRUISE SHIP 
More than 110,000 people have been infected and about 3,800 have died in the outbreak, which originated in China late last year and has spread to at least 105 countries and territories. Italy, which has the second-highest death toll, has sealed off much of its wealthy industrial north in an effort to contain spread of the virus.
The hardest-hit place in the United States has been a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, and Washington state is considering mandatory measures such as banning large gatherings but not necessarily imposing massive quarantines.
The Life Care Center facility has accounted for most of the 18 confirmed coronavirus-related deaths in Washington state.
In California, officials planned to offload 2,400 passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship, which was barred from returning to San Francisco last week due to a coronavirus outbreak on board.
Most of the passengers will go into quarantine at four military bases across the country, with those requiring immediate medical attention heading to hospitals. The crew of 1,100 will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, unless they are in need of acute care off the vessel.
California has more than 100 confirmed cases, while on the East Coast, cases in New York state rose to 142, up from 105 a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday.
One of them was Rick Cotton, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that controls airports and other major travel hubs. He will be quarantined and work from home, Cuomo said.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio asked employers in the nation's most populous city to consider staggering workers' start times to ease crowding on public transport and to allow more telecommuting where possible. De Blasio said there were 20 confirmed cases there as of Monday afternoon.

99,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 03:16PM ET</span>",Market flop: Cineworld deal exposes stress in Europe's credit market,"By Sujata Rao and Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - The move by banks to force Cineworld's (L:CINE) top shareholder to refinance a loan without equity collateral is yet another sign of mounting stress in Europe's junk debt market as the coronavirus roils markets and businesses around the world.
Global City Theatres - a proxy for CEO Moshe Greidinger and his brother and deputy CEO, Israel - sold part of its stake in the movie theater business to a group of investors to refinance existing loans, after Cineworld shares plunged on concerns about the potential impact of the virus on box office attendance.
The deal removed the threat that GCT would have to sell some or all of the shares on the market but the stock still sank 6.4% to 7-1/2-year lows, reflecting worries about the company which is saddled with $3.48 billion in debt and cash-flow risks.
But it is also part of the broader concerns rippling through global markets, centering especially on businesses that are vulnerable to short-term liquidity squeezes, as consumers cut back on purchases, entertainment and travel.
""Given the volatility we've seen in the capital markets, there are likely to be examples of more aggressive types of financing that come to light,"" said Paul Watters, head of EMEA credit research at S&P Global, which rates Cineworld.
About 53.6 billion euro ($61.4 billion) in outstanding speculative-grade debt -- that rated below BBB minus -- will fall due this year, with another 70.4 billion euros worth maturing in 2021, according to S&P Global.
Companies carrying large amounts of debt have little wiggle room to refinance debt as markets crater and investors balk at lending more to higher-risk borrowers. Their numbers are expected to rise if the virus hit continues.
""It's early days, but I am anticipating liquidity issues and liquidity requests whether it's covenant relief or more seriously, interest relief or pushing out of maturities,"" said a London-based debt restructuring advisor, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Debt insurance costs on junk-rated European companies surged on Monday to near seven-year highs as investors rushed to protect against corporate defaults amid plunging oil prices and the rapid spread of the virus.
(GRAPHIC: Cost of insuring junk-rated European debt rises - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/EUROPE-MARKETS-CDS/0H001R8F0C6M/eikon.png)
SLOWER DEBT MARKETS
The region's debt capital markets have also slowed lately.
A mere 12 billion euros was raised via 21 deals last week, compared to an average of around 45 billion euros before market activity slumped in reaction to the acceleration of coronavirus outside China, Refinitiv IFR data shows.
Companies that were struggling before the virus hit have found life even harder.
Shares in London-listed shopping center operator Intu (L:INTUP) more than halved last week after it failed to secure 1.3 billion pounds in funding through an equity issue.
It's not yet clear what the lasting damage will be to the region's corporate landscape, but the travel, leisure and transportation sectors have been the hardest hit so far.
For now, S&P Global's Watters expects most companies to recover in a couple of months, following the dramatic short-term shock inflicted by the epidemic.
That's in stark contrast to the global financial crisis when lending evaporated, leading to the closure of many companies and a painful rebound for those that survived.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index fell on Monday by the most since the 2008 global financial crisis and the loonie hit a near-three-year low as a plunge in oil prices rattled investors, with pressure rising on the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates further.
The Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index (GSPTSE), which has a 15% weighting in energy stocks, was last down about 9%, its biggest drop since December 2008, as Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled they would compete on price rather cut output further.
The price of oil (CLc1), one of Canada's major exports, fell as much as 34% to its lowest level since February 2016, at $27.34 a barrel.
""Canadian assets are getting hit pretty hard because we are seeing a major crash in the oil price,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. ""We are into this phase of the market where it looks like people are selling everything. Pull-the-rip-cord-and-get-me-out-of-here kind of trading.""
The TSX sell-off came as stocks globally were pummeled by fears the coronavirus outbreak would trigger a recession.
The energy sector on the Toronto Stock Exchange (SPTTEN) tumbled by about 26%, with  Cenovus Energy  Inc (TO:CVE) down more than 50%, while the Canadian dollar slumped to its weakest intraday level since May 2017 at 1.3760 to the U.S. dollar.
""Crazy moves in USD-CAD over the last 24 hours,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. ""The plunge in the price of oil adds tremendous pressure on the BoC and on the Fed to cut further.""
Last week, both the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve slashed their key interest rates by 50 basis points. Should the sell-off in oil continue, they could decide to ease again without waiting for a policy meeting.
""Probably central banks would like to wait a few days, see where that (oil) settles, and it will depend entirely on market dynamics whether they have the luxury of waiting a few days to see where it settles,"" Anderson said.
Money markets expect a further 50 basis points of easing from the Bank of Canada by June, which would leave its benchmark rate at just 0.75%.
Bond investors are counting on further easing, with the 10-year yield hitting a record low of 0.233%. It was last down about 20 basis points at 0.522%."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. Senate Democrats is urging banks and their regulators to accommodate borrowers who may struggle financially amid the spread of the coronavirus.
In separate letters sent to the industry and watchdogs, the lawmakers said temporary hardships that could come with the wide spread of coronavirus should not be punished, and banks should endeavor to help those people and businesses whenever possible.
In an effort to control the spread of the disease, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended, among other things, people stay home for two weeks if returning from a high-risk country. Now, senators are pushing the financial sector to ensure those people do not suffer financially for it.
""No one should be penalized financially or suffer financial duress for following CDC guidance,"" they wrote.
The letter was signed by every Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, including Senators Mark Warner of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.
The lawmakers urged regulators, including the Federal Reserve, to issue guidance encouraging banks to work with consumers and businesses struggling due to the virus. The guidance could include allowing banks to modify terms on existing loans or extend new credit to help borrowers facing temporary hardships from the disease's spread, they said.
The banking industry should offer flexibility and loan forbearance to customers facing financial hardship due to the disease, the senators said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Coronavirus fears pushed British stocks to an almost four-year low on Monday but the government said it was not yet time to close mass events and insisted food supplies would continue.
As the worries about the economic impact of the outbreak battered global markets, Britain announced its fourth and fifth deaths from the virus and said that it now had 319 confirmed cases, up from 273 on Sunday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson held an emergency government meeting to discuss when to bring in more stringent measures, though the government said it was not yet advising the closure of large events. Food supplies, it said, would continue.
""We remain in the contain phase of the outbreak but ... our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own and that is why we are making extensive preparations for a move to the delay phase,"" Johnson said at a news conference.
""Whatever is happening in other countries, whatever measures are being urged upon us, be in no doubt we are considering absolutely all of them and in due time they may of course become necessary but ... timing is crucial.""
The new coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, causes a disease called COVID-19. It has spread around the world, infecting more than 110,000 people and 3,800 people have died worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. 
The FTSE 100 (FTSE) plunged to an almost four-year low as a crash in oil prices driven by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia stoked global recession fears, with investors alarmed about the economic fallout of coronavirus.
Yields on some benchmark British government bonds went negative for the first time as panicked investors dumped shares and rushed to the safety of gilts to hedge against the feared economic shock of the coronavirus. 
Early in the day the two-year gilt yield (GB2YT=RR) sank as low as -0.035%, down 13 basis points on the day, while benchmark 10-year yields hit a record-low 0.074% before rising off this low later in the day. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
Speaking alongside Johnson on Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said he was expecting numbers to ""increase initially slowly but then quite fast.""
""We are now very close to the time, probably within the next 10-14 days when ... we should move to a situation where we say everybody who has even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self isolating for 7 days afterwards,"" he said.
As some British supermarket shelves were emptied of basics such as lavatory paper, the British government said it had set up a team to tackle ""interference and disinformation"" around the spread of coronavirus.
The country's biggest retailer,  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), has restricted bulk buying of products such as anti-bacterial gels and wipes, dried pasta and long-life milk.
Health minister Matt Hancock told parliament he was ""confident that food supply will continue even in our reasonable worst case scenario"". The government later announced it would extend the hours that deliveries can be made to supermarkets to allow them to replenish their shelves more quickly.
Britain's finance minister is due to deliver his annual budget speech on Wednesday and investors are awaiting any indication of additional stimulus from the Bank of England and the government.

UK-based airlines easyJet (L:EZJ) and British Airways (L:ICAG) are expected to reduce their flights to northern Italy over the next three-and-a-half weeks after Italian authorities ordered a virtual lockdown of the area.

(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. banks sharply underperformed the broader stock market on Monday as investors bet tumbling interest rates would crush bank profits and worried about rising credit costs in the face of an economy spooked by coronavirus and plunging oil prices.
Among the sector's biggest decliners were smaller banks with the most direct exposure to energy companies as oil futures tumbled as much as a third on Monday due to a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. These banks, which include  BOK Financial Corp  (O:BOKF) and  Bank7  Corp (O:BSVN), were last down more than 20%.
But the biggest U.S. banks were also slammed, with the S&P 500 Bank index last down 14.0% on the day and on track for its biggest one-day percentage decline since April 20, 2009, during the financial crisis. The sector has dropped more than 34% since Feb. 20 and was 37% below its most recent record.
Stocks in the index were down between 8% and 18% with JPMorgan (N:JPM) down 12.6% and Bank of America (N:BAC) falling 15.5%. The biggest decliners in the index were Regions Financial Corp (N:RF) and  Comerica Inc  (N:CMA), both down 18% as they have the biggest energy loan exposure.
The collapse of U.S. Treasury 10-year yields to record lows was a huge factor since banks profit heavily from the difference between short-term interest rates, which they pay to borrow money, and the long-term rates they charge loan customers.
""Factoring in nothing else it's a much tougher interest rate environment for banks to earn revenue on. Of the two things weighing on them, it's the big one,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Jeffrey Harte.
""The second one is economic uncertainty. They go hand in hand,"" he said. ""Banks have historically been a pretty good proxy for the economy. You start thinking loan growth is going to slow and credit losses will pick up if the economy slows down.""
Among large-cap banks, KBW wrote that energy loans represent 15% of Citigroup's (N:C) tangible common equity (TCE) compared with 10% for  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and Bank of America (N:BAC) and 7% for JPMorgan.
Citi analyst Keith Horowitz cited ""relatively modest"" exposure to oil and gas loans among big banks in his research note but listed bigger issues including higher odds of a recession, a market overreaction to credit risks, and lower interest rates.
""The fear factor from the virus is clearly causing economic strain, and as a result, the odds of a recession are moving higher even though it is not in the data yet,"" said Horowitz.
The analyst said he was most worried that rates would fall further.
""Fundamentally, this is what we are most concerned about and believe that today’s actions only increase the likelihood of lower rates.""
While some market strategists have said Monday's broad sell-off, with the S&P last down 7% (N), could be a buying opportunity, Horowitz said his customers were wary.
""There is very little 'buy the dip' mentality in conversations we're having with investors,"" he said."
104,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 02:29PM ET</span>",Aon buys Willis for $30 billion in world's largest insurance deal,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Aon Plc (N:AON) said on Monday it would buy Willis Towers Watson Plc (O:WLTW) for nearly $30 billion, in an all-stock deal which will make it the world's biggest insurance broker and give it more pricing power, but also attract regulatory scrutiny.
The acquisition, the insurance sector's largest ever, unifies the second and third largest brokers globally into a company worth almost $80 billion, overtaking market leader Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (N:MMC). It comes at a time when insurers are facing rising claims and new threats from the global outbreak of coronavirus and climate change.
Aon had scrapped plans last year to pursue a merger with Willis, a day after media reports forced it to reveal it was in the early stages of considering an all-stock offer for the Irish-domiciled company. The merger agreement came right after a 12-month restriction under Irish rules for revisiting the deal expired.
The timing also coincides with a violent market correction, as Wall Street's main stock indexes plummeted and the Dow Jones Industrials crashed 2,000 points on Monday, driven by 20% slump in oil prices and the rapid spread of coronavirus.
This also weighed on Aon, whose shares dropped 16% on Monday, much more than the 8% drop in Willis shares. 
When asked about the timing of the deal, Aon Chief Executive Officer Greg Case told Reuters: ""This is the time we move,"" noting that he spoke to 250 senior colleagues on Monday who were ""energized"" by the deal. 
""In a world of volatility, clients have needs around protecting assets,"" Case said.
Willis shareholders will receive 1.08 Aon shares for each of their shares. The offer represents a premium of 16% to Willis' closing price on Friday.
Aon shareholders will own about 63% and Willis investors about 37% of the combined company. The deal is expected to add to Aon's adjusted earnings per share in the first full year, with full savings of $800 million achieved in the third year.
Aon will keep headquarters in London and be led by Aon CEO Case and Aon CFO Christa Davies. Willis CEO John Haley will become executive chairman.
Aon and Willis put together insurance contracts for clients that involve a number of insurance providers, for anything from airlines to large sporting events.
Brokers also play a key deal-making role in the 330-year-old Lloyd's of London [SOLYD.UL] commercial insurance market, which carries out much of its business face-to-face and insures specialist risks like oil rigs and soccer stars' legs.
Aon and Willis also provide investment and employee benefits advice, and broker deals for reinsurers, who share part of insurers' exposure to potential large losses like hurricanes, in return for part of the premium.
The combined entity will work across risk, retirement and health businesses. The deal will also allow the ""new"" Aon to offer clients services in areas like cyber, intellectual property and climate risk, executives said.

SECOND TIME LUCKY?
The deal follows Marsh's purchase last April of British rival Jardine Lloyd Thompson for $5.7 billion.
""The insurers and re-insurers are unlikely to be happy about the deal given the scale of the two players coming together,"" said analyst Ben Cohen at Investec.
The deal terms state Aon must pay $1 billion to Willis if the deal falls through.
Aon's Davies said she was confident of getting all the necessary approvals for the deal.
""We have had great counsel on the topic of anti-trust, feel really good about it,"" Case said.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) advised Aon, while Willis was advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

(Reuters) - Trading in options on Wall Street's fear gauge (VIX) was impossible in the first minutes of Monday's session due to a complete absence of prices from the market makers on whom trading depends, a representative of index operator CBOE Global Markets Inc (Z:CBOE) said. CBOE Senior Trade Desk Specialist Ryan Stone told Reuters that VIX options were tradable at 9:51 a.m. ET (1351 GMT) but a lack of liquidity led to a lag of about seven minutes until the first trade, around 9:58 a.m. ET.
When activity in options resumed, the VIX surged to its highest level since December 2008. The volatility spike occurred as global stock markets were melting down on fears about the spreading coronavirus and crashing oil prices.
It followed 15-minute trading halts across U.S. exchanges, triggered by an opening 7% decline in the S&P 500 (SPX) that set off circuit breakers.
The S&P was last 7.7% down and the VIX was up 13 points at 55.04.
According to CBOE's website, the VIX Index is calculated using standard S&P 500 options and weekly S&P 500 options that are listed for trading on CBOE Options.
""What caused the delay in opening SPX & VIX - with these being products - is we had to manually open them,"" Stone said.
""We gave market makers the delay to ensure they were getting proper market data so they could properly quote these.""
In line with its own rules, CBOE had earlier taken a ""precautionary measure"" to not open the VIX to trading before the bell as it was not able to calculate the index value at the time, after E-mini futures on the S&P 500  hit their 5% lower limit in premarket trade.

The VIX index is widely used by traders as a measure of expected volatility of the S&P 500 over the following 30 days and is traders main way of protecting against or betting on sharp moves in stocks.

107,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 02:11PM ET</span>","Twitter, Elliott reach deal for Dorsey to stay CEO, new directors","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) on Monday reached an agreement with Elliott Management that lets Jack Dorsey stay as chief executive and adds three new directors a few days after Elliott's plan to push out the social media company's chief became public.
Elliott's head of U.S. activism, Jesse Cohn, and private equity firm Silver Lake's co-chief executive officer Egon Durban, will join the social media site's board immediately and the company plans to appoint a third new director soon. Silver Lake also will invest $1 billion in Twitter.
The agreement brings together hedge fund Elliott, which owns a $1 billion stake in Twitter, and Silver Lake in an unusual arrangement that lets Dorsey continue to lead the company, for now, and sidestep a potentially nasty proxy contest.
""While our CEO structure is unique, so is Jack and so is this company,"" Twitter's lead independent director Patrick Pichette said in a statement.
Twitter shares were up about 0.4% on a day of heavy selling on Wall Street.
In reaching the agreement, Elliott keeps a close eye on Dorsey while also giving the company more time to formulate long-term plans and repair missteps, people familiar with Elliott's thinking said.
They added that the deal avoids a mad scramble to find an immediate replacement for Dorsey. 
Twitter said it would use the Silver Lake investment to help fund a $2 billion share repurchase program.
Twitter also pledged to grow daily users by 20% or more in 2020 and beyond, roughly in line with user growth in its most recent quarter and its projections that costs and expenses would increase 20% this year. 
The board will also create a temporary committee to evaluate Twitter's leadership structure and CEO succession plan that will share the results publicly before the end of the year.
Late last month Elliott nominated four directors to Twitter's board and was pushing to remove Dorsey, criticizing him for being the CEO of two publicly traded companies: Twitter and Square, a financial services company.
Each company, Elliott and other investors argued, deserves a full time CEO.
Investors had also expressed concern about Dorsey's plan to spend time living in Africa this year, something he walked last week amid growing fears about the virus.
""We invested in Twitter because we see a significant opportunity for value creation at the company,"" Elliott's Cohn said, adding ""I am looking forward to working with Jack and the board to help contribute to realizing Twitter's full potential.""
2020 promises to be a big year for Twitter with people looking to the company for news about the coronavirus, the U.S. election and the planned Olympics in Tokyo.
Silver Lake sent its first tweet ever to announce the news, saying ""Silver Lake is excited to partner with @Twitter by investing and joining the board and we look forward to working alongside @Jack and the whole team.""
Twitter is one of the few U.S. technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about 2% of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott.

Dorsey, 43, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent entrepreneurs, and also runs  Square Inc  (N:SQ), a mobile payments company he co-founded.

Investing.com – The S&P hurtled toward its lows of the day Monday as selling in oil deepened, pressuring energy stocks, and fears of the coronavirus becoming a pandemic continued to mount.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,870, or 7.23%, after failing to maintain its intraday bounce of about 860 points from session lows. The S&P 500 fell 6.84% and Nasdaq Composite plunged 5.53%.
The move back toward the lows for the major averages arrived as oil prices heaped further pressure on energy stocks, which earlier had fallen to their lowest since 2004 on worries about an oil price war.
Crude Oil WTI Futures were down 20% after cutting losses to 16% earlier in the session.

111,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 01:52PM ET</span>",Orders sink for Italy's luxury suppliers as virus spreads - sources,"FLORENCE/VENICE/MILAN, March 9 (Reuters) - By Silvia Ognibene, Riccardo Bastianello, Silvia Aloisi
Global luxury brands including Gucci and Louis Vuitton are scaling back orders with Italian suppliers, as the spread of the coronavirus from key market China to major manufacturing hub Italy hits business across the sector, industry sources said.
Italy, home to scores of specialist manufacturers of high-end goods from shoes and leather goods to menswear, has seen the biggest epidemic of the virus outside China, prompting Rome to impose a virtual lockdown over much of its wealthy north.
Reuters spoke to a dozen textile and leather goods suppliers in the region of Veneto, which is affected by the quarantine, and nearby Tuscany. Many said that even before the unprecedented restrictions were put in place on Sunday, brands had been cutting orders from late January, as demand plunged in China.
""We were producing 800-1,000 handbags a month for Gucci. In February we made 450 and we have no orders for March,"" said the owner of a small supplier for Kering's (PA:PRTP) top brand employing eight people in Scandicci, a district outside Florence that is the hub of leather goods production in Italy.
""We don't have orders for April or May either. The company has been brought to a standstill and we are having to put our workers on temporary redundancy schemes,"" he said.
Like most of the suppliers who spoke to Reuters, he declined to be named for fear of losing future contracts.
The 280 billion euros ($320 billion) per year global luxury goods sector, already reeling from months of protests in the shopping hub of Hong Kong, was dealt a hammer blow earlier this year by the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China.
As authorities battled to contain the emergency in a country that is home to more than a third of global luxury shoppers, brands were forced to shut shops, shelve new openings and postpone advertising spending there.
The spread of the virus across the world, and to Italy in particular, has compounded the pain, with countries including Britain and the United States warning against non-essential travel to Italy, slowing tourism to a trickle.
That is set to translate into a major sales hit for the country's 90 billion euros fashion and textile industry.
SUPPLY CHAINS
It also has implications for the luxury industry worldwide due to Italy's importance as a supplier, said Flavio Cereda, an industry analyst at Jefferies, who on Monday cut his 2020 sales forecast for the sector for a second time this year.
He now expects a sales decline of 3% at current exchange rates, compared with his previous forecast for 1% growth.
""Prolonged disruption of economic activity may well result in supply chain issues for most brands,"" he said, adding, however, that he had no evidence of that happening yet.
Though Tuscany is not part of the lockdown, its Scandicci manufacturing hub - which had been booming in recent years as luxury giants from LVMH (PA:LVMH) to  Kering  and Prada (HK:1913) expanded their production sites and snapped up workshops - is suffering.
Massimiliano Guerrini, whose family owns Almax, a Scandicci-based producer which makes bags for 10 brands including Kering's Saint Laurent, Gucci and Balenciaga as well as LVMH labels, said he had seen a decline in orders ""of a few percentage points"" due to the coronavirus emergency in China.
""I thought things were not too bad given the circumstances, but now this new alarm in Italy risks making more casualties among businesses than among people and disrupting the supply chain for the orders that are still in the pipeline,"" he said.
""We have 270 employees and have diversified our customers, so we managed to mitigate the impact so far. But some of the smaller suppliers are not going to make it.""
A leather goods and handbag supplier in Veneto reported a 30% plunge in orders from LVMH's Louis Vuitton, while others said Prada and Ferragamo were also cutting back orders.
Ferragamo said it could not comment for this story as it is due to publish 2019 results on Tuesday. Prada said it was also not commenting as it is due to release its results on March 18. Kering declined to comment, while LVMH had no immediate comment.
WHOLE YEAR AT RISK
Claudio Marenzi, who is in charge of fashion at business lobby Confindustria, said foreign buyers of Italian textiles had started cancelling orders in late February and some retail outlets had seen sales halve.
""Since the virus emerged in China we knew there was going to be a slowdown in the first quarter. But now the whole year risks going up in smoke for us,"" he said.
A source with knowledge of the situation said Ferragamo had told employees to take Fridays off for the next eight weeks, frozen new hires and the renewal of fixed-term job contracts.
After holding its Milan fashion week show behind closed doors, Giorgio Armani closed its northern Italy factories for a week in late February. A spokeswoman said on Monday they had reopened in the first week of March, although most employees were working from home.
Luca Bortolotto, head of apparel and accessories at artisans and small businesses association Confartigianato in Vicenza, one of Veneto's main cities, said he was thinking of hiring a child minder to help workers at his leather goods business, given schools have been closed across the country.
""And as if all this was not enough, we live in fear that one of our workers may fall sick, which would mean putting everyone under quarantine and paralyzing the whole company,"" he said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street banks and brokers are in ""robust"" talks with regulators to secure rule-waivers that would allow thousands of traders to operate from home as the coronavirus spreads in New York, the chief executive of a top industry group told Reuters.
Overnight, the number of confirmed cases of the virus rose by 37 to a statewide total of 142 people, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday. He has issued a declaration of emergency to bolster the financial hub's efforts to contain the virus.
Kenneth Bentsen Jr., CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), which has been leading the industry response to the outbreak, said the group was discussing how companies could meet their compliance requirements if trading staff are not operating from a branch or a redundant site where they have high levels of regulatory oversight.
Regulators include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
""We're having very robust discussions, we're all trying to figure this out on both sides,"" said Bentsen.
""They've done this in the past around the 2008 financial crisis and 9/11. This is about identifying where there might be problems that could impair market operations, and providing guidance or forbearance on a temporary basis outweighs any potential risks.""
Banks including  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America (N:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) have triggered contingency plans, sending staff home, splitting up trading teams and activating backup offices in a bid to contain the spread of the virus in one of the world's largest financial hubs. [L1N2B107O]
Goldman Sachs has split some groups into “white teams” and “blue teams,” which shift between working from home or in the office, a person familiar with the matter said.
Citigroup is keeping fewer than 60% of its Buffalo-based staff at its main site, with the rest either working from home or at a back-up site near Rochester, New York, Reuters reported on Sunday.
Some of the issues banks are discussing with regulators include how to replicate the technology required to supervise real-time trading from home; strict infrastructure requirements, since dealing in some markets requires dedicated telecommunications lines; records-keeping and cybersecurity.
There are some concerns that liquidity could be disrupted if traders are restricted in their activities when operating under remote work arrangements.
Bentsen said he was hopeful regulators would quickly issue initial formal guidance to address some of the most pressing issues, which could be updated depending on how the situation evolves. That could involve temporarily waiving some rules or providing flexibility on others, as the SEC has done during previous disruptions and in other areas of the market.
The agency said last week it would give publicly listed companies affected by the coronavirus more flexibility when trying to meet financial filing deadlines.
""The goal is to keep markets operating in a fair and orderly fashion: that’s the goal of the regulatory perspective and industry perspective, and to do it in a way that meets the rule sets,"" said Bentsen.
The CFTC, SEC and FINRA did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday."

Investing.com –  The Dow clawed back some gains, but the sea of red continued to cloud over stocks amid a historic plunge in oil prices after Saudi Arabia launched a price war against Russia and spread of the new coronavirus continued to dent investor sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,373 or 5.29%, but was down more than 2,000 points at lows, the S&P 500 fell 5.15%, after trading was halted just after the open following a 7% slump. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.51%.
Energy fell to its lowest intraday level since 2004, as oil prices plunged 30%, before slightly paring losses, after Saudi Arabia sent shockwaves throughout the market by launching a price war against fellow oil superpower Russia.
Saudi Arabia slashed its April official selling prices by $6 to $8 to grab market share and pile pressure on Russia. The move came after the OPEC and Russia failed to agree a deal to extend oil production cuts.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) fell 35%, Apache (NYSE:APA) fell 45% and Diamondback Energy (FANG) plunged 44% after cutting its capital expenditure plans for the year.

Both deaths occurred in North Rhine-Westphalia, the state with the country’s highest population and the most cases of the virus. One male person died in the district of Heinsberg, while an elderly female succumbed in the city of Essen, according to the state’s health ministry.
The first German fatalities underscore the risks posed by the disease, which started in China and has since spread across the world. The number of cases in Germany more than doubled to over 1,100 in the last few days, putting pressure on the government to act.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration early on Monday announced measures to cushion the economic blow.

LONDON/BANGKOK (Reuters) -  Tesco  (L:TSCO) plans to return $6.6 billion to shareholders after agreeing to sell its supermarket businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to  Charoen  Pokphand Group as part of plans to refocus on Britain.
Having withdrawn from South Korea in 2015, Britain's biggest retailer began a review of its remaining Asian businesses last year in a further retreat from its global ambitions.
The sale of its Thai and Malaysian businesses for an enterprise value of $10.6 billion comes more than five years into a recovery plan launched by Chief Executive Dave Lewis after an accounting scandal and dramatic trading downturn. 
Lewis declared Tesco's turnaround complete last October and will step down in October this year, when he will be succeeded by Ken Murphy, formerly of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA).
Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne on Monday said that Tesco had secured ""a very strong valuation"" for the Thai and Malaysian assets and investors could look forward to a special dividend representing 21% of the group's current market capitalisation.
The price for the businesses, including debt, implies an enterprise value multiple of 12.5 time core earnings.
After completion of the disposal to the Thai group controlled by Dhanin Chearavanont, Tesco intends to return cash to shareholders via a special dividend with an associated share consolidation. It will also inject 2.5 billion pounds ($3.28 billion) into its pension fund.
Reuters reported on Sunday that CP Group was the frontrunner to buy the assets.
Tesco shares were down 1.3% at 1249 GMT, outperforming the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, which fell 6.9% on coronavirus fears.
""The coronavirus outbreak won't stop people from eating: on the contrary, food-at-home will get a boost at the cost of food-out-of-home,"" said Monteyne.
REGULATORY SCRUTINY
The deal is conditional on the approval of Tesco's shareholders and regulatory approvals in Thailand and Malaysia, which is expected during the second half of 2020.
However, CP Group will face a newly empowered Thai antitrust regulator, which could block the transaction if it finds that the deal would create a monopoly or market dominance, lawyers and analysts said.
CP Group is buying Tesco's assets through its CP Foods (BK:CPF) and CP ALL (BK:CPALL) businesses.
""We believe the reason management has broken down the investment into small pieces is that it does not have to pass a shareholder vote and to minimise capital-raising risk as much as possible,"" Citi analysts said in a report.
CP Group runs its 12,000 7-Eleven convenience stores through CP All and about 80 cash-and-carry stores under  Siam Makro . (BK:MAKRO) It will gain control of the 1,965 stores Tesco operates in Thailand - much of which the British retailer bought from CP Group during the 1997-8 Asian financial crisis - including 200 Tesco Lotus hypermarkets and 1,600 Tesco Lotus Express convenience stores, plus 74 outlets in Malaysia.
Chearavanont, senior chairman of CP Group, has repeatedly said he wanted to buy back the company.
Tesco completed its exit from China last month with the 275 million pound sale of its joint venture stake to state-run partner China Resources Holdings ( CRH  (LON:CRH)).
Completion of the deal for the Thai and Malaysian assets would increase speculation over the future of Tesco's central European division, consisting of stores in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, which would be the group's only remaining overseas supermarket operation apart from Ireland.

Tesco was advised by Greenhill, Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Barclays  (L:BARC), while JPMorgan (N:JPM) and UBS (S:UBSG) were joint international advisers and financiers for CP Group. Siam Commercial Bank (BK:SCB) and advisory firm Quant Group also worked with CP Group on the deal.

The Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points when policy makers gather on March 17-18 and again at their April 28-29 meeting, Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs’s chief economist, said in a report to clients on Monday.
Such cuts would repeat the reduction carried out last week by the Fed in its first emergency rate cut since 2008 and would ultimately push the key U.S. rate to the range of 0% to 0.25% last seen in 2015.
As recently as late-February, Goldman Sachs was predicting the Fed would leave interest rates on hold this year. Prior to Monday’s forecast, it was expecting the central bank to cut by 25 basis points in both March and April."
121,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 11:59AM ET</span>","Apple sells fewer than 500,000 smartphones in China in February amid coronavirus","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple (O:AAPL) sold fewer than half a million iPhones in China in February, government data showed on Monday, as the coronavirus outbreak halved demand for smartphones.
China placed curbs on travel and asked residents to avoid public places in late January, just ahead of the Lunar New Year festival, a major gift-giving holiday. Those restrictions stayed largely in place through most of February.
In total, mobile phone brands sold a total of 6.34 million devices in February in China, down 54.7% from 14 million in the same month last year, data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed (CAICT).
It was also the lowest level for February since at least 2012, when CAICT started publishing data.
Shares of the iPhone maker fell about 6% amid a broader slump in Wall Street on rising fears of a recession due to a steep fall in oil prices and the fast-spreading virus.
""While this is very nervous time...we caution that Chinese demand in the March quarter is not the trend, but a ""shock event"" that we believe will be short lived,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note.
Android brands, which include devices made by Huawei Technologies (O:AAPL) and  Xiaomi  (HK:1810), accounted for most of the drop, as they collectively saw shipments decline from 12.72 million units in February 2019 to 5.85 million, the data showed.
Shipments of Apple devices slumped to 494,000, from 1.27 million in February 2019. In January, its shipments had held steady at just over 2 million.
Research firms IDC and Canalys previously forecast that overall smartphone shipments would drop by about 40% in the first quarter as the virus outbreak hit demand and disrupted supply chains.
Apple's branded stores in China were shut for at least two weeks in February as fears over the epidemic mounted.
The company's chief executive, Tim Cook, wrote a letter to investors that month warning it would not meet its initial revenue guidance for the current quarter due to weak demand."
122,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 11:23AM ET</span>",Investors Dodging Market Meltdown Say They Can’t Find Liquidity,"(Bloomberg) -- Fund managers are being faced with a collapse of liquidity as they try to handle record market moves.
Investors say it is becoming increasingly difficult to trade due to the extent of swings on a day that saw 30-year Treasury yields drop the most since the 1980s and a fall in U.S. stocks so sharp that trading was halted minutes from the open. Even before today financial conditions were tightening at the fastest pace since the 2008 crisis.
“I have yet to find liquidity,” said Richard Hodges, a money manager at Nomura Asset Management, whose bets on Italian and Portuguese bonds last year put him in the top 1% of money managers. “There is none.”
The dry up in liquidity was seen across markets. In Italy, one of the deepest pools of bond trading in Europe, two-year yields surged more than 50 basis points at the European open, with unreliable bid and offer prices shown on screens.
Indonesian and Mexican bonds also suffered a liquidity crunch, according to Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. In money markets too, signs of stress were abundant.
A key gauge of banking-sector risk, known as the FRA/OIS spread, soared to its highest level since 2011, while dollar swap spreads widened, suggesting stresses in U.S. markets are becoming increasingly severe. A gauge of financial conditions in the U.S. tumbled, with the Federal Reserve on Monday lifting the amount of temporary cash it’s willing to provide markets.
“The one thing I would say to buy is Treasuries,” Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said on Bloomberg Television, pointing to the risk of other markets drying up. “If you own a ton of risk assets, the only safe haven asset right now is the 30-year. It’s shocking that I’m saying it.”
While oil and stocks slump, bonds have seen massive inflows, with 30-year Treasury yields plummeting almost 60 basis points and European rates hitting record lows. The U.K. became the latest to join the negative-yield club, which now encompasses over a quarter of the entire investment-grade market. Germany’s entire yield curve is below 0%, with five-year yields touching -1%.
For those investors who are old enough, it’s a hark-back to 2008’s financial crisis. For a newer generation, it poses an unprecedented challenge -- how to preserve the value of your investments.
Default Risk
A significant reason for the lack of depth in bond markets is the emergence in stress indicators of uncertainty about what the Fed will do next. One example is the fluctuations in liquidity in the financial system.
Liquidity strains are unleashing “deep-seated fears that the coronavirus crisis could lead to the same dislocation of financial markets that we saw over a decade ago,” wrote Steven Barrow, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Standard Bank, in a note to clients. “The worst-case scenario for the market is that dollar liquidity shortages start to emerge, putting leveraged borrowers in jeopardy.”
In turn, volatility has spiked. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) MOVE Index, which measures price swings in Treasuries, jumped to the highest level since 2009 Monday. Funds that brace for so-called “black swan” events are one of the few to benefit.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Liquidity holes and the unleashing of suppressed volatility has seen convexity options outperform given the acceleration in volatility gains as tail risks reprice. For example, VIX calls funded by SPX puts would work for those looking for long convexity exposure. Now, extracting vol premium should come into play while managing the further deterioration of risk.”
-- Tanvir Sandhu, Chief Global Derivatives Strategist
For Nomura’s Hodges, the problem is exacerbated by the proliferation of exchange-traded funds, which track particular asset classes or instruments. When the market goes into freefall, they are required to sell the underlying asset, prompting a frantic search for anyone who will buy it.
“People are asking for bids and then dealing when they see them,” said Luke Hickmore, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “You can definitely sell for sure, you just might not like the price.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) named top trader Michael Daffey as global markets chairman on Monday, with a remit to strengthen key client relationships as the Wall Street giant tries to remodel its trading business in Europe after Brexit.
In the newly-created role Daffey, who is global co-chief operating officer of Goldman's equities franchise, will establish his presence as a ""trusted adviser"" for some of Goldman's biggest clients, particularly in Europe.
""We're taking one of our most senior executives and giving him a license to advise our key clients,"" Goldman's president and chief operating officer John Waldron told Reuters.
""It will allow us to operate at a higher level as we want to deepen our client relationships in places like Germany, Italy, Spain and all across Europe.""
Daffey, a 26-year veteran of Goldman, will also be tasked with helping safeguard the markets business from disruption expected when the Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31.
The 53-year-old Australian will oversee the implementation of Goldman's new post-Brexit structure out of London.
The appointment - announced in a memo sent by Goldman CEO David Solomon, CFO Stephen Scherr and Waldron - comes as markets recoil in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, which has left 2020 economic growth forecasts in tatters.
Under Solomon, Goldman has shifted its focus from its money-spinning trading business to building a bigger consumer bank to shield its revenue from swings in financial markets.
Trading makes up roughly 40% of Goldman's revenues but margins are shrinking in the face of tougher competition and a sustained shift toward passive investing.
Net revenue at Goldman's global markets business was up 2% last year to $14.78 billion, split equally between equities and fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC).
Goldman competes head to head with  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and JPMorgan (N:JPM), with Refinitiv data showing Morgan Stanley tops the league tables for global equity and equity-related products so far this year.
Brexit poses further challenges for global banks, with EU authorities still not decided on whether the likes of Goldman can trade EU stocks and bonds outside the bloc.
""We want to serve our clients better and more effectively after the end of the transition period in Britain,"" Waldron said.
Since Britain's 2016 vote to leave the EU, Goldman has beefed up its European outposts, particularly in Frankfurt, which serves as its EU trading hub. It recently poached Sara Woerner from Morgan Stanley to lead equity execution for Germany and Austria.
Daffey will help Goldman ""plan for further changes"" during the transition period, the memo said, as top rainmakers and traders are expected to be more scattered across the continent.
'ONE GOLDMAN'
Waldron said Daffey's promotion is part of the bank's ""One Goldman"" strategy, in which senior leaders from all parts of the bank work closely to address clients' priorities.
This approach - outlined by Solomon at an investor day in January - seeks to end the siloed trader versus dealmaker structure that prevailed under former boss Lloyd Blankfein.
Daffey has built his career in the trading division, rising to top roles including running equities sales globally as well as fixed income and foreign exchange sales for Europe, Middle East and Africa.
His promotion adds another layer to the markets leadership structure where a trio of senior executives - Ashok Varadhan, Marc Nachmann and Jim Esposito - are splitting responsibilities as global co-heads of the securities business.
Waldron said the power-sharing structure in markets will stay, calling Daffey's appointment a ""long-term investment.""
""This is not about expanding our footprint. The goal is to improve the quality of our relationships and services,"" he said."

Boeing shares were down at $231.60 in early trading, a level not seen since 2017.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told Boeing on Friday it did not agree with the planemaker's argument that the wiring bundles meet safety standards and now it is up to Boeing to decide how to proceed.
Boeing in February said it did not believe it was required to separate or move wiring bundles on its grounded 737 MAX jetliner that regulators had warned could cause a short circuit on the 737 MAX, and lead to a crash if pilots did not react soon.
There are more than a dozen different spots on the 737 MAX where wiring bundles may be too close together. Most of the locations are under the cockpit in an electrical bay.
Boeing has noted in talks with the FAA that its 737 NG has the same wiring bundles and that it has been in service since 1997, logging 205 million flight hours without any wiring issues.
A company official told Reuters in January, Boeing had been working on a design that would separate the wiring bundles, if necessary.
Moving the bundles could pose further delays to the return of the MAX, however. A key certification test flight is not expected until April or later.
Further, an interim report by the government in Addis Ababa said on Monday a faulty sensor reading and the activation of an anti-stall system on the 737 MAX preceded the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight in 2019."

126,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 09:47AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Trading Halted at Open as Rout Deepens; S&P -7%,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Trading in U.S. stock markets was halted within minutes of opening on Monday, as major indices broke through the level that triggered the New York Stock Exchange’s ‘circuit-breakers’ amid a fresh wave of panic-selling.
Trading was halted with the  S&P 500 down 7.1% from Friday’s close at 2,762 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,833 points, or 7.1%, from Friday. 
The latest wave of selling put the market on course for its worst one-day drop since 2009. It came in response to a disorderly rout in the oil market as Saudi Arabia launched an all-out price war to reclaim market share from Russia and U.S. shale producers.  
The kingdom signaled it would sharply raise output in a market that is already badly oversupplied due to a virus-induced collapse in demand. The International Energy Agency warned earlier on Monday that global oil demand would fall for the first time in a decade this year, having earlier forecast demand growth of some 1.2 million barrels a day.
The resulting 30% drop in U.S. crude prices triggered wholesale selling of oil and gas names, with oilfield service providers Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) among the worst hit. Highly-leveraged shale producers such as Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) also plunged.
Elsewhere, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 7.4% after Chinese data showed its iPhones sales fell 60% on the year in China in February. The number fleshed out Apple’s sales warning last month, when it declined to offer a new forecast after saying it would miss its original target.
Also weighing on the index was DJ heavyweight Boeing (NYSE:BA), which fell `11.6% to its lowest since 2017 after The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are set to delay the return to service of the 737 MAX even further, due to problems with its electrical wiring.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 09:47AM ET</span>","Saudi Aramco shares dive, Gulf debt markets hit as oil drops","By Yousef Saba and Saeed Azhar
DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) shares fell by as much as 10% on Monday, dropping below their December listing price after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would raise oil production in a battle for market share, sending crude prices down by a third.
Government bonds from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf oil producing countries were also pummeled after the collapse of the deal between OPEC, Russia and other oil producers that had propped up oil prices since 2016.
Aramco shares fell below their 32 riyals initial public offering price on Sunday for the first time since trading began in December. The Aramco listing was considered the culmination of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's efforts to diversify the Saudi economy. The December IPO valued the company at $1.7 trillion in the world's biggest share offering. 
Since then oil prices and oil companies' shares have come under pressure from fears over the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand and Russia's refusal to support deeper output cuts to bolster prices. As a result, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has removed all limits on its own production. 
Aramco shares closed at 28.35 riyals ($7.55), 11.4% below its IPO price. The shares closed 5.5% lower.
Benchmark Brent (LCOc1) crude fell by up to a third on Monday after Saudi Arabia, the world's lowest cost producer, said it would increase output to gain market share.
""The Saudi reaction to the breakdown (with Russia) was to revert to the 2014 playbook. By precipitating an oil price collapse, they are looking to end their subsidy of higher cost producers,"" Akber Khan, head of asset management at Al Rayan Investment, said.
""This is a painful strategy that requires time to play out and failed on the previous attempt."" 
Arqaam Capital cut its Aramco rating to ""hold"" on Monday, citing the company's exposure to the oil price cut and the impact on its 2020 earnings. It also lowered its target price to 30.80 riyals a share from a previous 39.20 riyals.
Saudi stocks also fell by 7.8%, while international bonds issued by Saudi Arabia, Aramco and other Gulf sovereigns also sank.
DEBT MARKET TURMOIL
The cost of insuring against a potential debt default by Saudi Arabia also spiked by nearly 70% on Monday, IHS Markit data showed after oil prices plunged.
Aramco bonds due in 2049 were nearly 9 cents lower and the state oil giant's bonds due in 2029 fell 4.5 cents.
Saudi government bonds maturing in 2049 dropped by more than 9 cents, while 2029 bonds dropped 3.5 cents.
One-year dollar/riyal forwards, which are trades scheduled to take place a year from now, were at 85 points, up from Friday's close of 10 points. They were as high as 182.5 points on Monday, surpassing a peak of 181.3 at the end of 2018.
The bearish mood spread to other Gulf states, with Omani bonds maturing in 2048 down 7.6 cents, Abu Dhabi 2047 paper down 3.4 cents and Bahraini notes due in 2047 5 cents lower.
A regional fund manager, who asked not to be named, said it was difficult to estimate the extent of the price fall (in Gulf government bonds) following the tension between OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and Russia.
""(Saudi Arabia) has got reserves for the time being, but at $30 a barrel, it's going to be running a significant fiscal deficit in 2020 and going forward. It doesn't have a lot of financial flexibility in terms of adjusting its budget,"" he said.
If Saudi Arabia tapped the debt markets, he said it would likely pay around 60 basis points higher in interest as credit default swaps rose by that level on Monday.

130,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 08:17AM ET</span>",Fed Rates at 0% Now Seen Within Months Amid Global Bond Frenzy,"(Bloomberg) -- The entire U.S. yield curve fell below 1% for the first time in history as rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut policy rates to zero in the coming months drove investors to reach for longer-dated securities.
Traders are pricing in about 80 basis points of cuts in March, and 100 basis points by July, which would drag borrowing costs down to zero. Those bets fueled a rally in U.S. Treasuries, with the rate on 30-year bonds diving as much as 59 basis points. Benchmark U.K. bond yields tumbled below zero for the first time, Germany’s two-year bonds and rates in Australia and New Zealand fell to new lows.
The latest frenzy in markets, spurred by concerns over an oil price war between the world’s biggest exporters, prompted the New York Fed to say it will boost the size of this week’s overnight and term repo operations to ensure reserves are ample and reduce the risk of pressures in money markets.
“The more I think about it, the more it makes sense to me that the U.S. cash rate will fall below zero some time very, very soon,” said Chris Rands, portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the U.S. tries negative rates, especially with the tailspin in oil now adding to the virus fears.”
The spread of the coronavirus and its fallout on supply chains and consumer spending have seen a dramatic repricing of global interest-rate expectations in the past month. The jolt lower in oil from the price war will sap inflation.
Rush to Safety
The stampede for Treasuries comes after a weekend dominated by crisis headlines including the oil price-war, plunging Chinese exports and Italy’s virus-induced lockdown. Adding to the sense of malaise, Japan posted its biggest economic contraction in more than five years, while France said its economy may barely expand.
Risk assets plunged with S&P 500 futures dropping about 5% to hit circuit breakers, and European stocks plunged by the most since 2016, putting the STOXX Europe 600 Index on course for a bear market. Commodity-linked currencies weakened, with Norway’s krone and Canada's dollar falling at least 1.9% against the U.S. dollar. Italian bonds plunged, sending the yield on 10-year debt to 1.3%.
Meanwhile, the yen and the euro strengthened. And the dollar, which suffered its worst week in two years, was up 0.2%, as soaring demand for U.S. Treasuries canceled out concerns that more Fed cuts would hurt the greenback’s appeal. The dollar has an edge over its peers by being the world’s reserve currency of choice.
On a Tear
Treasuries, the world’s deepest pool of haven assets, have been rallying in the past few weeks as the virus wreaked havoc across the globe. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell surprised markets last week with an emergency rate cut of 50 basis points, raising the specter that the virus fallout will be longer and worse than anticipated.
The yield on 10-year bonds dropped as much as 45 basis points to 0.31%, before settling at 0.4% as of 11:43 a.m. in London. Most of the German curve is now trading under negative 0.55%, which, together with the euro’s advance, may give the European Central Bank food for thought when it decides on interest rates this week.
“We know what the financial crisis looked like, the tech wreck, but this bond rally we’re seeing is just unchartered waters,” said Stephen Miller, adviser at GSFM, a unit of Canada’s CI Financial Group. “A global recession is now a probability, not a possibility.”
Central Bank Action
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Friday that policy makers should be allowed to buy a broader range of assets if they lack sufficient ammunition to fight off a recession with interest-rate cuts and bond purchases.
And money managers are expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia to turn to QE as soon as the middle of the year, while bets are increasing for the Bank of Japan to ease this month.
“The market is panicking,” said Shinji Hiramatsu, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Position adjustment, loss-cut buying and all sorts of buying are emerging. Everybody’s buying Treasuries.”"

132,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Historic Day in Markets Has Traders Rethinking What’s Possible,"(Bloomberg) --
What started with the biggest oil-price collapse since 1991 is shaping up to be one of the wildest days in years for global markets.
Panic selling, margin calls, vanishing liquidity and coronavirus work-from-home arrangements were just some of the challenges traders faced as risk assets plunged, currency volatility soared and money flooded into government bonds. They also had to figure out how an oil-price war and rapidly spreading outbreak will affect the global economy, companies and geopolitics.
“The day has been absolutely chaotic,” said Eugene Kang, whose team trades assets including Russian government bonds at NH Investment & Securities Co. from Seoul. “Financial markets have been caught off guard.”
Here’s how the turmoil is playing out on trading desks around the world.
Blowout in Oil
Zhang Chenfeng, an oil-trading analyst at Chinese hedge fund Shanghai Youlin Investment Management Co., hardly slept last night. He knew Saudi Arabia’s decision to launch an all-out price war with Russia would pummel the market, but the 30%-plus decline on Monday still came as a punch to the gut. “It was shocking,” Zhang said. “It was historical.”
It also quickly spread to other markets. The 10-year Treasury yield fell below 0.5% for the first time. Oil-sensitive currencies plunged, with the Mexican peso weakening 6%. Futures on the S&P 500 Index sank about 5% -- triggering trading curbs -- and European stocks looked set to follow Japan into a bear market.
Hypnotized by Selling
Some trading floors were eerily quiet. “It’s almost like everyone is hypnotized together and levels are just going south with nobody able to halt the slide,” said Tsutomu Soma, a bond trader at Monex Inc. in Tokyo, who has been in the market long enough to experience the Black Monday crash in 1987. “It’s been a while since I saw this kind of sell-off,” he said. “But I’m not seeing the kind of yelling across the trading floor or people throwing in their towels like back in the old days. Perhaps it’s a difference in the generations I’m surrounded by now.”
For one of those millenials, 29-year-old Futures First research analyst Rishi Mishra, market madness has given way to hysteria. “To me, personally, it’s just funny now! The kind of prices that traded today, no one could make any sense out of them.”
“These moves are pretty amazing,” said Takeo Kamai, head of execution services at CLSA Securities Japan. “We are witnessing once-in-a-career type moves and I think many professionals are left in awe. Only a handful could have fathomed this type of scenario for global markets in 2020.”
Currencies Gone Wild
As the turbulence spread to currencies, some traders struggled to keep up with rapid swings in markets that had only just recently seen volatility plunge to record lows. Both the Australian and New Zealand dollars had quick legs down before recovering some of the losses. The yen surged as much as 3.6% and Norway’s krone slid 4.7%.
“When you see a 4% move in just a couple of minutes, it tends to be pretty safe to take the other side of the short -- but this time it was just too short a window,” said Stuart Simmons, a senior portfolio manager in Brisbane, Australia, at QIC Ltd., which oversees A$83 billion ($54 billion) in assets. “When they start triggering stop losses, the currencies end up cascading on themselves. Price action turns dysfunctional.”
Margin calls may have added to the volatility, said Margaret Yang, a strategist at CMC Markets Singapore Pte. “We have seen more margin calls and fundings this morning,” she said. But some clients were also topping up to take larger positions, Yang added, a sign that at least some viewed Monday’s turbulence as an opportunity.
Coping With Panic
With fear in the air, the only topic of discussion at GAM Investment Management is how much worse this can get, said Paul McNamara, who oversees more than $7 billion of developing-market fixed-income assets.
In Taipei, where the normally subdued Taiex index plunged more than 3% and closed at its low for the day, two fund managers took starkly different approaches to the rout. Shin Kong Investment Trust’s Sean Lee sped up adjustments to his holdings, saying he needed to act fast because “it’s hard to say what will happen next.”
By contrast, SinoPac Securities Investment Trust’s Hiroki Lu is planning to wait before making big moves.
“I just checked market performance when it opened and moved on to do other things. There is no point of monitoring markets in a situation like this -- it’s too volatile and investors are too panicky,” Lu said. “It’s not the first time that the market has been so panicked, so I am cool about it. My clients didn’t ask about it, either.”
Working From Home
Mandatory work-from-home arrangements imposed by financial firms to contain risks from the coronavirus outbreak added another layer of uncertainty.
“When you’re working at home without colleagues, you feel more nervous about things because you’re on your own,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors.
Kirby Wang, managing director at Beijing Haihuiyuan Investment Co., has been working from his home office for more than four weeks. He has to balance his time spent on investing with teaching his young children Chinese poetry, after their school moved all classes online. The market is bringing back uncomfortable memories of 2008, when he worked at Lazard Asset Management in New York. “I certainly hope this won’t be as bad as 2008, but it’s not out of the question,” he said.
Luke Hickmore, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, is finding having a dog is helping him deal with the plunge in Treasury yields.
“It’s a lot calmer with a labrador,” he said. “I did try to explain it to her -- she licked my cheek, fair reaction.”
Welcoming Volatility
For some investors, the return of market volatility couldn’t have come sooner. Chris McGuire, whose Phalanx Japan AustralAsiaMulti-strategy Fund is geared to profit from widening price swings, has gained nearly 10% this year through March 6, after a rough past three years that saw his firm’s assets under management drop to $22 million from about $160 million.
Chicago-based McGuire, whose fund is still up about 13-fold since April 2005, said his bets on Japanese convertible bonds have “finally” started to pay off again. “Covid-19, at least for now, is providing the black swan event that the markets never realized could happen,” he said.
Ali El Adou, head of asset management at Daman Investments in Dubai, said he rushed to the office much earlier than usual on Monday so he could invest quickly if needed: “Although markets are crashing and volatility is spiking, we are closely monitoring prospective investment opportunities.”

LONDON (Reuters) - A massive oil price collapse overnight and the fast-spreading coronavirus has led to wild price swings across global financial markets on Monday, with some moves as great as 25%.
Those moves came as Saudi Arabia launched a price war with Russia, sending investors already panicked by the coronavirus fleeing for safety.

134,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>",VIX Futures Spike to Highest Since 2009 in Manic Monday Trading,"(Bloomberg) --
Volatility traders haven’t been this spooked since the financial crisis, according to a key gauge of fear on Wall Street.
As the oil-price plunge frazzled traders on edge over the coronavirus, the generic front-month futures contract for the CBOE Volatility Index surged as high as 51.3 on Monday morning in London. That’s the highest level since 2009.
A jump of more than 10 points from Friday would be the biggest single-day move for the contract since Feb. 5, 2018. On that day, one of the most violent jumps ever in implied volatility helped spur a stock rout and the death of several exchange-traded products in an event known as Volmaggedon.
The VIX, which measures the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 based on out of the money options prices, wasn’t being quoted as of 10:53 a.m. London time. A notice on CBOE’s website said the opening for S&P 500 and VIX products has been delayed.
Futures on the S&P 500 Index fell about 5% in Monday trading, triggering trading curbs designed to limit the most dramatic moves while cash markets are closed.
The VIX was already clocking eye-watering levels last week. On Friday, it surpassed 50, a threshold last breached when the complex broke down in February 2018. While those moves may appear extreme, over the past 10 sessions, the S&P 500’s realized volatility is 52.
Some of last week’s jump in volatility expectations may have been exacerbated by a short squeeze, according to Tallbacken Capital Advisors LLC’s Michael Purves. Net speculative positioning in futures on the VIX still flashed short as of Tuesday, hours after the Fed made its emergency rate cuts, according to the strategist.
“With the aggressive sell off on Thursday and again Friday, that would likely have driven a lot of ‘compelled’ VIX buying on Thursday and Friday if shorts were getting stopped out,” he wrote in a note on Friday.
Traders have also been piling into the biggest short-volatility exchange-traded product, adding $233.5 million over the past six sessions. While inflows into the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF typically reflect bets that calm will break out, they may also be part of a hedging strategy or create-to-lend activity.
Either way, anyone who had bet on market calm this week looks set for a world of pain."
135,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 07:23AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Set to Drop Almost 1300 Points; Treasury Yields at Historic Lows,"By Noreen Burke
Investing.com - U.S. stocks futures plunged to levels that halted trading on Monday after a massive rout in oil prices added to fears that the economic fallout from the rapidly spreading coronavirus will deepen, leading to a U.S. recession and a credit crunch.
Before circuit-breakers kicked in Dow futures were down 1,256 points, or around 4.8%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both down around 4.9%.
The move triggered another response from the Federal Reserve, which increased the amount of liquidity on offer at its daily and two-week repo operations. Daily operations will offer at least $150 billion, up from $100 million, while the two operations on Tuesday and Thursday will offer at least $45 billion, up from $20 billion.
Oil prices crashed over 20% in what was on track to be the largest one-day decline in nearly 30 years on Monday after Saudi Arabia launched a price war with Russia in a market already oversupplied as a result of a virus-induced collapse in demand.
The rout in oil prices was compounded by fears over the prospect of a U.S. recession and a freeze in credit as the economic fallout from the virus worsens.
Over the weekend, Italy, the country worst affected by the virus in Europe, locked down much of its wealthy north, including the financial capital Milan, in a move aimed at containing the outbreak. The number of deaths leaped again on Sunday.
As of Sunday, more than 109,000 people have been infected around the world, with at least 3,600 deaths.
Investors continued to pour into safe haven assets, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to historic lows of 0.425%.  Gold futures, another safe haven asset, rose above the $1,700 level for the first time in eight years.

(Reuters) - European shares slumped on Monday, with the benchmark STOXX 600 in bear market territory, as fears of a global recession were amplified by a 25% plunge in oil prices and a lockdown in northern Italy to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 7%, meeting the common criteria for a flip into a more negative ""bear"" environment, implying a 20% drop from all-time highs. The index was on course for its biggest percentage drop since June 2016, when Britain voted to exit the European Union. 
European firms have now lost nearly $3 trillion in value since the rapid spread of the coronavirus sparked a worldwide selloff in February.
Europe's oil & gas index (SXEP) tumbled 13%, after Saudi Arabia launched an oil price war with Russia by slashing its official selling price and outlining plans for an increase in crude production next month. [O/R]
London's commodity-heavy FTSE 100 (FTSE) was down 6%, with oil majors  BP  (L:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) both off almost 20% and set for their worst day ever. A whopping 38% drop sent  Tullow Oil  (L:TLW) to the bottom of the STOXX 600.
""Wild is an understatement,"" said Chris Brankin, chief executive at TD Ameritrade. ""I figured maybe we'd see a 5% or 10% drop in the oil market, but 25% down has literally just spooked the rest of the market.""
All European sub-sectors were deep in the red, with growth-sensitive miners (SXEP), automakers (SXAP), banks (SX7P) and insurers (SXIP) falling between 6% and 8%. 
Defensive sectors, considered safer during times of economic uncertainty, also posted slight losses. 
Italy's blue-chip index (FTMIB) shed 9%, the most among regional indexes, after the government ordered a virtual lockdown across much of its wealthy north, including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic new attempt to try to contain the virus.
The government has pledged about 7.5 billion euros ($8.55 billion) in measures to aid an economy already on the brink of recession.
In the starkest warning yet of the economic damage from the health crisis, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries (US10YT=RR), the benchmark for global borrowing costs, dropped to a record low of 0.4258%. German 10-year bond yields (DE10YT=RR) fell to a new record at -0.8%. [US/] [GVD/EUR]
""What we're seeing is a supply driven shock, it's not a demand problem,"" said senior equity analyst Renata Klita, at asset manager London & Capital.
""But now with what's happening with oil, I would say it's more likely (to become a demand shock) because you have this big sector that's affected.""

All eyes are now on the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday, following interest rate cuts by central banks in the United States, Canada and Australia last week to soften the blow of the outbreak.

Japan has been preparing for years and has invested about $12 billion in the Olympics, which start on July 24.
The number of virus cases in Japan passed 1,100, including about 700 from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo, the capital, last month. Fourteen people have died, including seven from the liner.
Organizers of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics pushed on with the test event for sports climbing last week despite a worldwide raft of cancellations or postponements of matches and tournaments, due to concerns over the virus.
About 340 Japanese children will be unable to participate in the Olympic torch ceremonies for the handover in Greece and arrival in Japan due to precautions against the spread of the virus, Tokyo 2020 chief Yoshiro Mori said.

Shares of audio and visual equipment firm Hibino Corp were the biggest decliners this year, among the Olympics-involved firms tracked by Reuters. By Friday's close, the stock had shed 47.5% this year.
H.I.S. Co, Japan's largest listed travel agent by revenue, had also fallen 42% for the year. Last week, the company said it expected a full-year loss, rather than a profit, citing the virus impact.
Sportswear maker Asics Corp, which gained more than 50% in the second half of 2019, has shed about 30% over the past month.
Dentsu Group Inc, Japan's largest advertising agency and the main marketing agency for the Tokyo games, and its rival Hakuhodo DY Holdings Inc, have fallen about 28% and 26.5%, respectively, in the past month.
Consumer retail firms, transport infrastructure, hotels and restaurants were the hardest hit, the data showed. 
Most of these firms have underperformed Japan's Nikkei and broader Topix stock index.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",Robots step in as cheap labor dries up in Eastern Europe,"By Gergely Szakacs and Jason Hovet
KOSZARHEGY, Hungary (Reuters) - Istvan Simon's factory in western Hungary churns out more than a million plastic parts a day but on a busy morning in one of its large production halls there is only the sound of machines clicking and whirring. Workers have all but disappeared.
Similar transformations are underway on production lines across the European Union's eastern wing as surging wage bills undermine the region's reputation as a cheap production base. Factory owners from Hungary to the Czech Republic and Poland find themselves with little choice but to invest in the automation of their manufacturing processes if they want to remain competitive.
Manufacturing in the region has boomed since the EU expanded eastwards in the mid 2000s, with companies such as automakers Audi (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) opening local production lines and spawning supplier ecosystems, but more recently strong economic growth has led to a shortage of workers and rising wages.
""We can see human labor being replaced with machinery and artificial intelligence,"" Hungarian union leader Zoltan Laszlo said. ""Not just in the car sector ... but also in the steel and machinery industries.
""Such investments can already be seen in these sectors, leading to job losses. You need to glue numerous tiny slivers together and all of a sudden you get the big picture.""
Employment figures are one indication the region's industry may be at a turning point.
While Hungary's economy grew nearly 5% last year and manufacturing investments rose at the fastest pace in three years, the sector shed nearly 23,000 jobs, ending a six-year run of annual employment growth. Czech data showed a year-on-year loss of almost a thousand manufacturing jobs in the third quarter of 2019, suggesting employment in the sector could have declined for the first time since 2013 over the full year.
""There are no operators in this hall right now,"" said Peter Simon, chief executive of Simon Plastics, as he overlooked a line of machines making plugs for car parts, a key product line at the company founded by Istvan, his father, 35 years ago.
""Wages are going up, the prices of robots are coming down, so this is the way to get returns,"" he said. Looking to expand output but pressured by surging wages and falling prices, all of the company's recent 1 billion forint ($3.32 million) investment was spent on automation.
The company hasn't cut any of its 400 jobs so far, finding other positions for those whose work has been replaced by robots, but it intends to automate its remaining manual work after a 50% jump in operator wages over the past three years.
JOB LOSSES
Although the automation process has so far been a gradual one, Josef Stredula, head of the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions, said based on various estimates up to 10% of jobs could disappear.
""Big changes are awaiting us,"" Stredula said, adding that while automation may ease the burden of heavy or repetitive manual work it was important to ease the transition, for example by retraining affected workers.
""We have to do everything to make the future not so bleak but relatively easier for everyone.""
Staffing company  Hays  (L:HAYS) recently noted that the average annual wage increase in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary of around 10% was far higher than in many western countries and estimated that almost 5% of Hungarian jobs, or 200,000 roles, could be fully automated over the next decade.
Hungarian recruitment portal profession.hu registered an 11% fall in manufacturing sector job postings last year. In the Czech Republic, Grafton Recruitment has seen a similar drop, while consultancy Deloitte has estimated around half of current jobs could be replaced by machines.
""It is only a question of when it will be more economical for most companies to start with automation on a much bigger scale,"" said David Marek, Deloitte's chief economist in Prague.
NOT BLACK AND WHITE
At a distribution center near Prague, Czech yoghurt maker Hollandia Karlovy Vary installed three robotic arms last year to sort and load yoghurts onto pallets, replacing the work of 10 people who were moved to other positions.
Meanwhile, Poland's largest clothing retailer LPP (WA:LPPP) plans to invest in logistics and automation in a bid to improve margins and combat higher labor costs.
Judit Kovacs, a manager at human resources company  Randstad  (AS:RAND), said factories with high capacity utilization in western Hungary had started reducing headcount by attrition over the past year, while new plants in eastern Hungary were being planned with a high degree of automation as investors looked to curb their labor market exposure.
It's not only manufacturing that is falling to the machines, insurance company Allianz's (DE:ALVG) Hungarian unit, for example, is automating data processing to offset rising wage costs.
The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) expects robot sales in major Eastern European economies to rise through 2022 but although it acknowledges that some jobs will disappear, it does not foresee a major net effect on employment.
""The question is not do I invest in manual labor or automation,"" IFR General Secretary Susanne Bieller said, explaining that automation could help companies maintain a competitive edge over cheaper production hubs elsewhere in the world.
""You cannot see this in black-and-white terms."""

The Japanese automaker said on Monday it had sold just 15,111 vehicles last month in the world's biggest auto market as demand for its Sylphy sedans and X-Trail and Qashqai SUV crossovers continued to tumble.
Nissan has been betting on growth in China to cushion the impact from its slumping business in the United States and Japan, where car sales fell 27% last month.
But commuting bans and road closures in many Chinese regions in February has led to a slowdown in production since last month, curbing output and raising risks to the automaker's global supply chain.
As uncertainty about the coronavirus outbreak shakes global markets, demand in the world's second largest economy is expected to remain week in the short- to mid-term, which could further pressures sales at global automakers.
Nissan has been grappling with falling sales for the past two years and its new executive team could come under increasing pressure to deliver deeper cost cuts in its recovery plan, which is expected in May."
142,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",StockBeat: No Hiding Place (Except Tesco),"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- There was nowhere to hide on Monday in Europe’s stock markets, with all of the continent’s main indices falling by over 6% in the worst intraday movement since the panic of 2008. 
The spread of the coronavirus – and draconian public health measures to halt it – had already pre-programmed markets for a rough ride. What made it many times worse was the rout in crude oil markets as Saudi Arabia began an all-out campaign to regain market share by slashing its official selling prices. Brent crude futures fell over 32% at one stage before rebounding to be down ‘only’ 20% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT).
The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 22.4 points or 6.1% to 344.60, while the U.K. FTSE 100 fell 7.1% and the Italian FTSE MIB, at the epicenter of Europe's largest Covid-19 outbreak, fell 10%.
The worst hit were not oil and gas majors, but the service companies that depend on their business. U.K.-based  Hunting  (LON:HTG) fell 26%, while Norway’s  Seadrill  (OL:SDRL), which only emerged from bankruptcy two years ago, lurched back towards it with another 24% slide.
The majors suffered too, though, as their liquidity made them one of the easiest stocks to turn into cash on a morning of indiscriminate selling.  BP  (LON:BP) stock fell 18% while Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) fell 21%.
The travel sector also underperformed, with tour operator Tui AG NA (DE:TUIGn) stock falling 13.7% and French hotel group  Accor  (PA:ACCP) tumbling 9.0%. Miners such as  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) fell by over 15%. Banks tumbled, as further monetary easing from the European Central Bank - and a bigger wave of corporate defaults - became a near-inevitability. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) fell 14.5%, while Lombardy-based Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) slid another 18% after losing 25% last week.
Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, noted in a podcast that oil price wars ultimately only transfer wealth from oil producers to oil consumers. However, the benefits to the latter generally only feed through into stock markets in calmer times. The International Air Travel Association noted last week that the benefit, for example, to airlines of lower fuel prices in no way outweigh the demand destruction caused by fear of the coronavirus.
Over the weekend, Germany’s Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) appealed to the German government for help after slashing its operating capacity by 50% while the virus wreaks havoc on the travel sector.
The German government late on Sunday approved its first virus-related stimulus measures, earmarking 12 billion of euros for subsidies to companies who have to reduce their staff’s working hours.
Another sector worse hit than most on Monday was luxury, due to the concentration of manufacturing facilities in northern Italy, which was effectively placed under quarantine at the weekend.
Moncler stock fell 11.5%, while Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) stock fell 8.4% and LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock fell 7.3%.
U.K. supermarket chain  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) was a rare name in the black, rising 0.2% after agreeing to sell its businesses in south-east Asia for a surprisingly robust price.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets fell by the most in a decade on Monday, while government bond yields fell to new all-time lows, after emergency measures taken by Italy to stop the spread of the coronavirus threatened an even bigger hit to the world economy.
Rome effectively locked down 16 million people at the weekend – a quarter of the Italian population – including the wealthy and productive regions around Milan, Venice and Parma.
The German DAX and U.K. FTSE 100 both opened down over 8%. The Euro Stoxx 50 opened down nearly 5%.
The move came as crude oil prices suffered their worst one-day drop in almost 30 years, after Saudi Arabia cut its official selling prices and signalled it will ramp up output in the wake of the failure to agree new production cuts with Russia on Friday.
Brent crude futures were down 24.1% at $34.36 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $31.27 a  barrel.
The virus continued to spread across the continent over the weekend, with Germany, France and the U.K. all continuing to register large increases in new cases, prompting the Bank of France to cut its first-quarter growth forecasts to 0.1% from 0.3% previously.
The European Central Bank will update its economic forecasts at its policy meeting on Thursday, where markets now broadly expect both a 10 basis-point cut to the bank’s deposit rate, and an expansion of its quantitative easing program. 
That’s needed, among other reasons, to stop the euro rocketing higher on the foreign exchange market. EUR/USD was at $1.1431, having gained nearly 5% against the dollar in the last two weeks. However, it hit bank stocks hard:  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) fell 16.2%, while most of Spain's banks were down by between 9%-10%."

Futures on the S&P 500 Index fell about 5%, triggering trading curbs. Japanese stocks sank 6% and futures on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index tumbled over 6%. Exchange rates including the yen and Australian dollar saw sudden moves that showed traders struggling to establish where new trading ranges might be. Sovereign bond yields plumbed fresh lows, on mammoth moves including a tumble of more than a quarter percentage point for 10-year U.S. yields.
Among the tumultuous moves to kick off the week:

For the first time, the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 0.5% and the 30-year yield dropped under 1%
Crude plummeted more than 30%, sliding the most since the Gulf War in 1991. The broader Bloomberg Commodity Index hit its lowest since 1986
Norway’s krone slid to its weakest against the dollar since the 1980s. Mexico’s peso slid as much as 8%, to the weakest since the aftermath of border-wall advocate President Donald Trump taking office
Australian and New Zealand 10-year government bond yields hit record lows
The yen climbed to its strongest since 2016

The oil-price crash, if sustained, would upend politics around the world, exacerbate strains in U.S. high-yield credit and add pressure on central bankers trying to avert a recession. It would otherwise prove a boon to consumers, but the coronavirus is increasingly keeping them at home. Italy over the weekend effectively put its industrial heartland in the north of the country on lockdown.
Equities and haven assets showed little immediate reaction to news that the Trump administration is drafting measures to blunt the economic fallout from the virus -- speaking to the state of stress in markets.

MUMBAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The unexpected writedown of some bonds issued by crisis-hit Indian lender  Yes Bank  Ltd (NS:YESB) as part of a state-led rescue is set to raise borrowing costs and make capital-raising tougher for other banks, investors and analysts said.
The take over of Yes Bank by India's central bank last week comes against the backdrop of a string of scandals in the country's financial sector in the last couple of years - from a $2 billion fraud at a large state-owned bank to mismanagement of funds at shadow banks.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it would work on a revival plan, as part of which bonds classified as Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital will be written down ""permanently, in full.""
So-called AT1 bonds were introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis. They carry higher interest rates than more senior debt as investors accept the risk they can lose their investment at certain pre-agreed points if the funds are needed to bolster a struggling bank's capital.
Yes Bank had about 88 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) in AT1 capital as of March 2019, its annual report showed, under the Basel III framework. Investors included Nippon India Mutual Fund, Franklin Templeton, a slew of local fund houses and retail investors.
""What this incident does is penalize the good names too,"" said a fund manager, who holds Yes Bank AT1 bonds, adding some investors are now considering a legal challenge against the central bank's plan to wipe them out.
""You're in effect creating an environment where the liquidity dries up on AT1s. Only risk-hungry funds will be buying AT1 bonds now,"" said the fund manager, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
""A minimum 50-100 basis point rise in AT1 borrowing costs could happen.""
Nippon India and Franklin Templeton did not immediately provide comment to Reuters' queries.
Underscoring the challenges, mid-sized  IndusInd Bank  Ltd (NS:INBK) said on Saturday it was deferring its Monday board meeting to consider raising capital via debt issuance, including AT1 bonds.
IndusInd added it was adequately capitalized and the decision to defer was due to current market conditions.
""It's not that investors will altogether ignore BFSI as a sector,"" said Siddharth Purohit, research analyst at Mumbai-based SMC Institutional Equities, referring to the banking, financial services and insurance sectors.
""The large ones, who have the ability to absorb any shock and those who have a time tested model, will be in a position to raise money and keep on expanding their book.""
Government-owned  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), the country's biggest lender, said on Saturday it would invest funds to buy a 49% stake in Yes Bank as part of the initial phase of a rescue deal.
While the bonds are designed to help a bank through a crisis, investors warned the fallout for other banks could be substantial.
Boutique rating agency Acuité Ratings warned in a note that the RBI's plan to wipe out AT1 holders would ""substantially add to the risk perception on these hybrid instruments and limit their issuances.""
""A resilient economy can digest these things very quickly and move on. The biggest concern is these things are happening when the economy has slowed down sharply,"" said the head of an Indian fund that manages more than $10 billion in assets.
The fund manager, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media, added he has been paring his portfolio holdings of Indian bank shares due to economic headwinds."

On Saturday, the carrier cut most of its flights to Japan for the rest of March, after Japan said Chinese and Hong Kong passport holders faced two weeks of quarantine on arrival.
""Although we do expect our passenger belly cargo operations to be impacted, we are currently evaluating how to continue serving our cargo customers to and from Japan,"" Cathay told freight clients in an update.
""This includes the retention of certain passenger services for cargo carriage only.""
The South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Friday that there were concerns the curbs on travel to Japan could hurt Hong Kong's supply of fresh seafood and fruit, typically flown in the hold of passenger jets.
The destinations of the cancelled Cathay passenger flights include Tokyo, Osaka, Sapporo, Fukuoka and Nagoya.

Cathay, one of the world's biggest freight carriers, said on Monday it was also exploring opportunities to increase cargo capacity.

Investing.com - Troubled Carrier Hong Kong Airlines is in talks with multiple parties, including Air China, for a strategic lifeline, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Monday citing three sources familiar with the matter. 
 
“Hong Kong Airlines is here to stay and committed to sustaining our long-term growth,” the airlinetold SCMP. “We are always open to strong strategic investors.”
 
The sources noted earlier multiple takeover bids made by parties including Citic Group, Wuxi Communications Industry Group have failed to progress because of a disagreement over pricing. 
The airline was close to the brink for more than a year amid months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong and the coronavirus outbreak. 
 
In February, Hong Kong Airlines said it was slashing 400 jobs and ask remaining staff to take at least two months of unpaid leave. Chairman Hou Wei said the changes were made to 
ensure the airline’s very survival. 
 
Indebted HNA Group currently owns 29% of the carrier, while former director Zhong Guosong has 27%. 
 
HNA turned into a net seller of assets since a couple of years ago after China cracked down on its debt-fueled acquisitions. 
 
The original disposal of Hong Kong Airlines is now awaiting the decision by HNA Group’s risk management committee on the overall strategy for the entire group, the sources said.

151,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2020 11:58PM ET</span>",U.S. stock futures sink by 5% down limit after crude rout,"By Herbert Lash
(Reuters) - U.S. stock futures plunged 5% to hit their daily down limit and halt trading after the biggest single-day loss in oil futures in almost 30 years on Sunday exacerbated fears of a credit crunch across financial markets.
Saudi Arabia's plans to hike crude production and slash its official selling price came after Russia on Friday balked at steep production cuts proposed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stabilize prices hit by economic fallout from the coronavirus.
The decline in S&P 500 futures contracts was compounded by fears the impact from the fast-spreading coronavirus will intensify, leading to a U.S. recession and sharp tightening in credit markets.
The depth of the recent sell-off in both equities and high-yield bonds reflected uncertainty about the virus' impact, but also indicated confidence that markets would eventually stabilize and resume their upward trend, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston.
The plunge in stock futures suggests confidence is being fractured and the impact of the coronavirus no longer is manageable, he said.
After-hours trading in the futures contract for the benchmark S&P 500 stock index saw it slip to its 5% down limit. The decline indicates how much the S&P 500 might fall when trading begins on Monday.
The collapse in U.S. Treasury yields signals a potentially more adverse economic impact, Joy said. ""In my experience, the bond market is more prescient than equities.""
The implied yield on the futures contract for the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell below 0.5% for first time. The benchmark Treasury hit a historic low of 0.469%, having halved in just three sessions, as markets reacted to the coronavirus.
The 20% plunge in oil prices, which in normal times would be positive for global growth, led to panic selling in stock markets as the risks of loss in oil positions added to already rising fears of a U.S. recession and a freeze in credit.
John Lekas, chief executive and senior portfolio manager at Leader Capital in Vancouver, Washington, was blunt in his assessment.
""We are in an Armageddon situation,"" Lekas said.
Saudi Arabia said it plans to boost crude output above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in April after the current deal to curb production between OPEC and Russia - known as OPEC+ - expires at the end of March, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
Investors earlier were spooked after Italy, the country hardest hit by the virus in Europe, essentially locked down much of its wealthy north, including the financial capital Milan. The move was aimed at containing an outbreak that saw the number of deaths leap on Sunday.
More than 107,000 people have been infected worldwide and 3,600 have died, according to a Reuters tally."
152,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2020 11:26PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Plummet Amid Oil Price War,"By Alex Ho
Investing.com - Asian stock markets traded sharply lower on Monday morning as oil prices slumped following reports that OPEC failed to reach a deal with its allies on production cuts.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 5.5% on 10:15 PM ET (02:15 GMT) after data showed the country’s GDP shrank at an annualized pace of 7.1%, which was faster than expected. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to detail new emergency measures on Tuesday. 
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component fell 2.5% and 2.4% respectively. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slumped 3.4%.
South Korea’s KOSPI lost 3.8%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 plunged 5.6%. 
Oil prices plunged about 25% after Saudi Arabia announced massive discounts on Saturday to its official selling prices for April. The kingdom will reportedly up its production level above the 10 million barrel per day. 
It was reported that talks between OPEC and its allies broke down on Friday in Vienna. The cartel had recommended additional production cuts on Thursday, but that was rejected by Russia.
Existing production cut is set to expire at the end of the month. 
“As from 1 April we are starting to work without minding the quotas or reductions which were in place earlier,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters at the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna, adding, “but this does not mean that each country would not monitor and analyze market developments.” 
In other news, the new coronavirus continued to spread as the number of people infected topped 107,000 globally. Over the weekend, Italy’s government ordered a lockdown in parts of the country, including Milan. 
“You just don’t know which way things are going to go, it makes it very hard to price anything right now,” said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics, in an interview with Bloomberg. “We’re seeing that in the market with the wild oscillations that are coming through.”"
153,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2020 11:06PM ET</span>","Investor fears rise over recession, bear market as coronavirus spreads in U.S.","By Megan Davies
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The words ""bear market"" and ""recession"" are being used with increasing frequency as investors try to assess how badly the coronavirus outbreak will damage global growth and to what extent it could further weigh on asset prices.
The accelerating outbreak has stoked violent swings in markets around the world. Many investors say there is little clarity on what trajectory the virus will take and how effective government measures will be, making it difficult to gauge how much economic damage has already been baked into asset markets.
Rabobank in a note earlier this week said the initial strategy in most Western countries, which was to do nothing and tell people all is well, was not effective.  
As the virus has spread in the United States, investors have become increasingly worried about a number of factors, including what some have called an uneven government response, confusion about the number of cases in the country and concerns that fear of contracting the virus or government-imposed limits on movement will hit consumer spending and damage the economy.
""The market has not caught up to the facts. We are thinking another 20% or so lower in equity markets this year,"" said John Lekas, CEO and Senior Portfolio Manager at Leader Capital, who sees a recession as likely. ""Basically we just jumped off a 20 story building and we are at floor 10.""
U.S. stocks have fallen about 12 percent from their closing high on Feb. 19. S&P futures opened on Sunday night sharply lower and were last trading 4.5 percent lower, after oil plunged around 30 percent, following Saudi Arabia's starting a price war with Russia. That intensified fears of credit problems.
""Between oil and the virus, the headlines are creating hysteria right now,"" said Ken Polcari, senior market strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in Jupiter, Florida. ""High yield will get crushed and credit defaults will be the talk all over again by week's end if oil doesn't rebound.""
Nineteen people have died out of about 450 reported U.S. cases of the novel coronavirus, which originated in China and rapidly spread around the world. More than 3,600 globally have been killed.
Analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) outlined a scenario where the benchmark S&P 500 index falls into a bear market - commonly defined as a price drop of 20% or more from highs - if the disease is not contained quickly. The index was down around 8% from its peak on Friday.
""The market has only moved from being significantly overvalued ... to being modestly so,"" analysts at the bank wrote. ""Equities are yet to price in any drops in macro and earnings growth from the expected slowdown in activity.""
The bank's main scenario forecasts a drop of 15% to 20% in U.S. stocks followed by a rebound. A more pessimistic outlook sees a larger drop and a recession.
TRAIN WRECK
The explosion in market volatility has come as the bull market marks its 11th year. The S&P 500’s lowest close following the 2008 financial crisis was 676.53 points on March 9, 2009. The index's most recent high was 3,393 on Feb. 19.
A report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) compared the coronavirus to a ""slow-moving train wreck"" where the ""market comes slowly and progressively to the realization of the magnitude of the events unfolding.""
Michael Purves, CEO at Tallbacken Capital Advisors, said the tech sector ""is still too strong"" and added that ""until we see some stronger selling in tech, we won’t be satisfied that late-to-the-party sellers are done.""
Some analysts are focusing on potential pressures on cross-currency basis swaps, which institutions use to hedge currency exposure and obtain access to foreign currency funding, and other instruments that function as the ""plumbing"" of money markets. Others are worried about the credit markets and businesses' access to cash.
Investors in the coming week will look to a raft of U.S. data, including on small business optimism and consumer prices, to gauge what kind of shape the U.S. economy was in last month, before the coronavirus started spreading so widely and quickly.
The most serious threat to the economy may not come from the amount of cases or deaths, but rather the toll that disruptions to daily life, curtailed travel activity and possible government restrictions could take, analysts at Oxford Economics said.
The firm now sees a 35% chance of a recession occurring in the United States this year, up from an estimate of 25% it made in early January."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's proposal to leave wiring bundles in place on the grounded 737 MAX has not won the backing of U.S. aviation regulators, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.
Last month, Boeing told the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) it does not believe it needs to separate or move wiring bundles on its grounded 737 MAX jetliner that regulators have warned could short circuit with catastrophic consequences.
The source said the FAA told Boeing on Friday that it did not agree with the planemaker's argument that the planes' wiring bundles meet safety standards and now it is up to Boeing to decide how to proceed.
The FAA said Sunday it ""continues to engage with Boeing as the company works to address a recently discovered wiring issue with the 737 MAX. The manufacturer must demonstrate compliance with all certification standards.""
Boeing said Sunday it was in ongoing discussions with the FAA over the issue. Boeing could opt to make a new proposal or move the bundles or try to convince the FAA to reconsider its position, but a U.S. official said it was ""unlikely"" the FAA would reconsider.
Boeing and the FAA first said in early January they were reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the 737 MAX, and under certain circumstances lead to a crash if pilots did not react in time.
Boeing’s 737 MAX was grounded worldwide last March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months.
There are more than a dozen different locations on the 737 MAX where wiring bundles may be too close together. Most of the locations are under the cockpit in an electrical bay.
If the bundles pose a potential hazard, regulations would typically require separating the bundles or adding a physical barrier.
Boeing has noted in talks with the FAA that the same wiring bundles are in the 737 NG, which has been in service since 1997 and logged 205 million flight hours without any wiring issues.
New safety rules on wiring were adopted in the aftermath of the 1998 Swiss Air 111 crash.
A company official told Reuters in January Boeing had been working on a design that would separate the wiring bundles, if necessary. Moving the bundles could pose further delays to the return of the MAX, however, a key certification test flight is not expected until April or later."

NEW YORK -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) is splitting its staff in Buffalo, New York, to ensure it can keep its operations humming as the coronavirus spreads across the state, according to a source familiar with the plans. 
The third largest U.S. bank will this week keep fewer than 60% of its Buffalo-based staff at its main site, with the rest either working from home or at a back-up site near Rochester, NY, the source said. Citigroup has around 1,800 employees at the Buffalo location, many of whom work in operational roles.
Banks in the world's largest finance hubs like New York and London have been splitting up trading teams and activating backup offices in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. Citigroup's latest move shows contingency planning has now extended to smaller cities as well.
The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York state rose to 105 on Sunday, up from 89 the day before, according the state governor's office.
Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a declaration of emergency on Sunday as the pace of confirmed cases accelerated. As of Sunday there were no confirmed cases in Eerie County where Buffalo is located. Twelve people have tested positive in New York City, where Citigroup is headquartered. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) split some of their Manhattan-based teams last week.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Automakers across the world face the possibility of extended supply chain disruptions as factories in China stutter back to life after closures due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The car industry is especially exposed as Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - is known as one of China's 'Detroits', accounting for nearly 10% of vehicles made in the country and home to hundreds of parts suppliers.
Non-essential factories in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province remain on lockdown at least until Wednesday. When they reopen on March 11, or whenever authorities give the go-ahead, it is not clear if companies will have the raw materials or workers to get back to normal operations.
Automakers are concerned about their employees' health and the uneven and unpredictable application of rules in different cities and regions that is making it hard for an industry that is used to uniformity to plan ahead.
""In some cities, one worker gets infected, the whole factory where he works needs to be shut down,"" said one official at Honda Motor Co, which has a manufacturing hub and more than 100 suppliers in Wuhan and the surrounding area.
""In Wuhan, that has not been clarified,"" he said. ""You don’t know what’s going to happen to your factory until you report an infection case to authorities. It’s hard to live with that kind of uncertainty when you’re running a massive factory.""
Employees reported back to work at Honda's other Chinese manufacturing hub, in the southern China city of Guangzhou, on Feb. 10 and partial production restarted on Feb. 17. Production there is still running well below capacity due to parts shortages and logistical delays, the company official said.
Honda is expecting to reopen its Wuhan hub this week, after the lockdown is lifted or whenever authorities allow it. Together, Honda's two China hubs have the capacity to produce 1.2 million vehicles a year, or more than 20% of the company's total global production.
Like other manufacturers in Wuhan, automakers and parts suppliers are still dealing with partially blocked roads and health inspections on major transportation arteries, which are creating problems moving around raw materials and finished parts, according to Yohei Shinoda, personnel manager for Kasai Kogyo Co, a Japanese company with four plants in China producing interior door and roof trims for Honda and other automakers.
""Even if we wanted to resume production, we can't access the materials we need due to supply chain disruptions,"" said Shinoda, whose firm has plants in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Kaifeng and Dalian. ""On top of that, we’re facing staffing shortages at our plants.""
A joint venture between U.S. company  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI) and truck maker Dongfeng Motor Group which makes diesel engines for big buses and commercial vehicles in the city of Xiangyang in Hubei province may face problems.
""The logistics between cities remains an issue, we expect it will take longer for us to get parts from upstream suppliers and send engines to Dongfeng plants in other cities,"" an official of the joint venture told Reuters.
LASTING DAMAGE
The corporate damage in Hubei could be significant and long-lasting. A joint survey of 573 Hubei companies - including 12 involved in auto manufacturing - by Wuhan University and the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce late last month showed more than 97% of them halted or partially halted production due to the coronavirus outbreak. Nearly 60% said they would be bankrupt in three months or fewer if operations are not restored.
The picture in the rest of China is slightly better. More than 90% of some 300-plus automotive parts suppliers outside Hubei say they have resumed production, with 80% of workers present, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
However, the association said production rates were still not high, given the dearth of orders from manufacturers and logistics problems at smaller second- and third-tier suppliers.
Chinese automakers and parts producers exported $53 billion worth of automotive components to the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere last year. If plants do not get back up to speed quickly, vehicle assembly lines across the world are at risk of slowing or shutting down.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra said on Wednesday that the company's North American car and truck plants have secured components to last ""quite far into this month."" Normally, automakers have parts shipments lined up and assured for many months in advance.
Companies are doing what they can to get back on track, but there is no guarantee against disruptions.
U.S. drivetrain supplier Dana Inc's global purchasing team scrambled to get more than 200,000 facial masks for its plants in China to keep workers safe on the job. So far, Dana has avoided any significant disruptions, CEO James Kamsickas said.
U.S. auto supplier Cooper Standard has 13 factories across China which have resumed production with 65% of the normal workforce, said Larry Ott, Cooper Standard’s head of global human resources at the company’s headquarters outside Detroit.
""That's basically what we need right now to satisfy the customer demand,"" he said.

(Reuters) - As the coronavirus spreads in the financial hub of New York, financial firms – led by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA)– have triggered their contingency plans and are taking other precautions. As of Sunday, here is the state of play:
BACKUP OPERATIONS
Firms began last week to test and roll out aspects of their business continuity plans in a bid to mitigate the risk of the illness laying low staff or stopping them from commuting into the city. Those measures include asking staff to work from home, splitting up teams and moving some teams to alternative sites.
Last week, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co was the first bank to activate contingency plans and split its U.S. sales and trading staff between New York and secondary sites in New Jersey.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is also shifting part of its New York-based sales and trading staff to its sites near Westchester County, New York, as well as having some teams work from home starting on Monday, Reuters reported last week.
According to SIFMA's website, banks are also testing workers' home telecoms, internet and virtual private network capacity and other systems necessary to support remote activities, including interfaces with stock exchanges. Banks are also assessing the preparedness of their third-party partners like technology vendors, said SIFMA.
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS
Many banks including JPMorgan,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Morgan Stanley have imposed a range of travel restrictions. Those include canceling or banning travel to coronavirus hot spots, restricting non-essential overseas travel and limiting the size of internal and external meetings.
Some banks require individuals to work remotely for 14 days following their return from affected regions, and are also asking visitors to disclose if they traveled recently to coronavirus hot spots. Last month, for example, signs at  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) Inc's New York headquarters asked guests who traveled recently to China, or had close contact with someone who did, to reschedule their meetings. [L2N2AT017]
HEALTH AND HYGIENE
Financial institutions are also urging employees and visitors to follow basic precautions against viruses, as suggested by the World Health Organization.
They include frequently washing hands, social distancing such as canceling events and moving desks farther apart, covering coughs and sneezes, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth and refraining from shaking hands when greeting people. Employees are also encouraged to stay home if they feel ill."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates airline expects its financial performance to be impacted by the coronavirus outbreak that has led to a global drop in air travel, according to an internal notice seen by Reuters.
The Dubai state-owned carrier, whose financial year ends this month, has suspended flights to Iran and most of mainland China. The United Arab Emirates has urged citizens and residents against traveling abroad.
""At this stage, there is very little doubt that our financial performance for the year will be impacted,"" according to a March 4 internal staff notice that also said passenger numbers were increasingly impacted.
Emirates, one of the world's biggest long-haul carriers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
An industry body warned last week the virus outbreak could cost carriers up to $113 billion in revenue as airlines across the globe rush to cut flights and costs.
""Emirates is a very strong and financially solid airline. The type of aircraft we operate, the length of our routes and our general cost base do mean however that the impacts of adversity can be felt quickly,"" the notice said.
""The business has moved to review routes, downgrade to smaller capacity, where appropriate, and take out unprofitable flying almost on a daily basis,"" it added.
Most of Emirates passengers transit through Dubai to other destinations. The airline does not operate domestic services.
The airline reported a surge in half-year profit last November, helped by weaker fuel prices.
Emirates on March 3 said it had more resources than presently needed and was asking staff to take paid and unpaid leave.
It has since told pilots and cabin crew that unpaid leave was only available for non-operational staff and not them, other internal emails seen by Reuters showed.
Emirates did not respond to a Reuters' query on that matter."

Railnet CEO Donald Kress said in an interview his railway development and construction company was in talks with governments in the three countries and signed an agreement to start feasibility studies in Zambia.
""We have a group known as Magcor International and their CEO has arranged financing through a group of investors,"" Kress told Reuters on Sunday following the signing of an agreement on Saturday.
""Until we have signed a contract with the investors, they have requested to remain anonymous,"" Kress said in an interview.
The investment in the project, running from Zambia's Copperbelt province to the port of Beira in Mozambique via Harare in Zimbabwe includes the cost of locomotives and wagons, he said.
Feasibility studies were expected to begin in the next six weeks and would be followed by detailed engineering design for the project on the Zambian side, Kress said.
Construction was expected to begin in January 2021, Kress said, adding that Railnet would replace the existing system to allow freight trains to travel at 120 km/hour and passenger trains at 160 km/hour.
Transport and Communication Permanent Secretary Misheck Lungu, who signed the agreement for Zambia said Railnet would build the new railway line parallel to the existing old one.
Lungu said the project would enable business including mining companies in Africa's second-largest copper producer to transport bulk cargo by railway instead of using roads.
Railnet would operate the modern railway for a number of years and hand it over to the government after recovering its investment from the profit made, Lungu said."

The company, which has suspended routes and canceled flights as the outbreak spreads across the globe, revised the estimated decline in revenue it expects for January to April to $140-$160 million. It previously warned of a $50-$70 million decline for the period.
Of the total, El Al said the decline in revenue for the first quarter will be $80-$90 million.
A decline in expenses will partially offset the drop in revenue, so the company expects the final impact for the first four months of the year on its results to be $70-$90 million.

El Al, which has already announced a major round of layoffs, said it has requested government aid and is in talks with the Finance Ministry.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Sunday remanded the founder and former managing director of crisis-hit  Yes Bank  Ltd (NS:YESB) in police custody until March 11 after he was arrested on money-laundering charges. 
India's Enforcement Directorate, the country's federal financial crime agency, arrested Rana Kapoor early on Sunday after hours of interrogation and searches at his and his daughters' residences in Delhi and Mumbai. 
Kapoor was produced in a Mumbai court in western Maharashtra state and a case of money laundering has been registered against him.
Sunil Gonsalves, representing the Enforcement Directorate, said at the hour-long hearing the total proceeds of the alleged crime amounted to 43 billion Indian rupees ($581.07 million), and that Kapoor had refused to cooperate with the investigation. 
Kapoor denied this. 
""I want to cooperate with them,"" he told the court through tears. ""I’m willing to cooperate day and night despite the fact that I haven’t slept a wink.""
Zain Shroff, Kapoor's lawyer, told the court his client had been made ""a scapegoat"" due to public outrage against Yes Bank after India's central bank placed the bank under a moratorium and imposed limits on withdrawals.
A spokesman for Yes Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Weighed down by an increasing pile of bad debt, Yes Bank tried unsuccessfully for months to raise the capital it needs to stay above regulatory requirements.
On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of Yes Bank and said it would work on a revival plan.  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI) said on Saturday it would invest funds to buy a 49% stake in Yes Bank as part of the initial phase of a rescue deal for the troubled lender. 
Last week finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Yes Bank had granted loans to entities including bankrupt Dewan Housing and Finance Ltd (NS:DWNH).
The bank is the third significant Indian financial institution to unravel in the last six months, following the RBI's moves to take control of Dewan Housing and Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank.
In the court the Enforcement Directorate lawyer alleged that Yes Bank had bought 37 billion rupees worth debentures of Dewan Housing, which had granted a 6 billion rupee loan to a company called Doit, owned by Kapoor's three daughters.
The lawyer said the federal agency believes the loan to Doit was a kickback for Yes Bank subscribing to the debentures of Dewan Housing. Kapoor and his lawyers said the debentures were AAA rated and Doit is servicing the debt on time.
The Enforcement Directorate lawyer also said that the loan to Doit was extended against a collateral of 7 billion rupees, while the actual value of the assets is just 400 million rupees.

""Given our very strong market position in China, of course we are massively hit by the temporary closing of hundreds of stores,"" he told Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.
""But we are seeing fewer problems on the supply chain side because Swatch Group produces a lot by itself in Switzerland,"" he added.
""We are a basically solid group without debt and not infected by the virus of stock market short-termism. This situation as well will get better despite all the prophets of doom.""
Hayek dismissed suggestions that the Swiss watch industry was at risk from lower-cost foreign rivals or digital smartwatches like Apple Inc's Apple Watch (O:AAPL).
""I don't see a crisis for the Swiss watch industry. On the contrary,"" he was quoted as saying, noting actual sales were more important than export data.
""Since 2010 the middle and upper segment at Swatch Group with its seven brands from Tissot to Longines has grown by more than 36% to far more than six million pieces,"" he said.
""Tissot alone -- and this is the first time I make this public -- has grown more than 30% since 2010 to around 3.6 million pieces. Tissot's only sharp drop in volume was last year, with a fall of around 250,000 pieces in the second half due to the situation in Hong Kong.""
Unrest amid pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong was having a notable effect, but Tissot sales in the United States and Japan were up by around a third last year versus 2015, he noted.
Hayek said exports of entry-level Swiss watches were falling because other manufacturers were focusing solely on the luxury segment in the false belief that was the only area to make money.
Asked about attacks on the mid-priced segment by Apple Watch, Hayek said Swatch had cut its distribution network by around 30% since 2015 because many department stores and shops were hit by online competition.
He acknowledged the company should have acted faster to switch to e-commerce, but said it was well on the way to break the one million barrier in online sales this year.
Swatch was also hit in the lower-price segment by the Swiss franc's strong appreciation since the Swiss central bank ended its ceiling against the euro (EURCHF=) in 2015, he said.
The group had no need for job cuts other than a reduction linked to the expiration of a license agreement for Calvin Klein watches in the lower segment, he said."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Shares of Saudi state oil company Aramco (SE:2222) slumped below their initial public offering (IPO) price on Sunday for the first time since they began trading in December, after OPEC's pact with Russia to restrict oil supplies fell apart on Friday.
Aramco shares were down 6.2% at 30.85 riyals ($8.22) at 0852 GMT, their sharpest percentage fall in a day, and below the IPO price of 32 riyals. The Saudi market (TASI) was down 7.4%.
Aramco's record IPO in December gave it a price tag of $1.7 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock hit an intraday high of 38.70 riyals on its second day of trading, but has eased since then.
The shares have fallen more than 11% since the start of the year amid concerns the coronavirus outbreak will slow oil demand from China and hurt the global economy. 
Oil prices have also slumped, and fell further on Friday after a three-year pact between OPEC and Russia aimed at supporting the market ended in acrimony when Moscow refused to back deeper production cuts. OPEC responded by removing all limits on its own production. [O/R]
""Aramco is under pressure because of the failure of the deal,"" said Marie Salem, head of institutions at Daman Securities. 
Other Gulf markets were also in the red. The Abu Dhabi stock index (ADI) was down 5.8% and Dubai's (DFMGI) down 7.4%.
""We expect to see Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other large producers in OPEC increase production over the rest of 2020 as they return to a market-share strategy rather than price targeting,"" said Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD in a note on Sunday
""The market-share strategy bears considerable risk for OPEC producers as fiscal positions would deteriorate and balance of payments crises and questions about the sustainability of monetary policy re-emerge.""
Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the world’s biggest oil exporter. Its economy has suffered in recent years from low oil prices and austerity measures aimed at reducing a huge budget deficit.
Jaap Meijer, head of equity research at Arqaam Capital, said Aramco investors should be sheltered by the guaranteed dividend streams, as the government will scale back its own dividend payments to protect minority shareholders.

Aramco has planned a dividend of $75 billion for 2020, more than five times larger than Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) payout, which is among the biggest for an S&P 500 company.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are stepping up measures to guard against the spread of coronavirus through person-to-person contamination on airplanes, from eliminating wine and water refills to keeping passengers from touching serving trays and food baskets.
Rather than bringing wine or water bottles into the aisles for refills, flight attendants on United Airlines will now provide a new cup or glass.
Facing a sharp drop in travel demand due to rising coronavirus outbreaks across the world, airlines are offering travelers free rebooking options while trying to calm jitters about cabin cleanliness and air-circulation systems.
In a letter to customers on Saturday, United Airlines Holdings Inc Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said it is ""important that we give you as much information as possible about the procedures we follow to clean our aircraft and maintain a sanitary environment once we're in the air.""
In addition to extra cabin-cleaning measures including washing ceilings and scrubbing overhead bins, United said its flight attendants may wear gloves during all food and beverage service and pickup.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc have also introduced extra cabin protections, including eliminating self-serve snack and fruit baskets, and all of the carriers are working with airports to regularly disinfect common surfaces like kiosks and ticket counters.
Airlines and flight attendant unions have also been retaining infectious disease and aviation medicine experts for town hall meetings with crew members to explain best practices like frequent hand-washing to protect against contracting the virus.
""Unfortunately, there is risk involved in this line of work, and exposure to passengers carrying disease is one of those risks,"" Dr Kris Belland, a medical adviser for the union representing American Airlines' flight attendants, said in a letter to crew.
There are now 102,000 coronavirus cases and more than 3,480 deaths across the world, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements. Most cases and deaths have been in China but numbers are mounting outside its borders, with around 90 other countries reporting infections.
Airline stocks have plummeted as worries about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy have taken hold. On Wall Street, the broad S&P 500 index has dropped more than 12% from its Feb. 19 high, with the NYSE ARCA airline index down nearly 31% over the same time frame."
171,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Sovereign wealth fund appetite for investing in start-ups wanes,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth fund investment in venture capital deals slipped to its lowest level in six years in 2019, with the drop-off deepening in the months after WeWork's planned share sale failed, data showed on Friday.
Sovereign wealth-backed venture capital rounds fell to $7.2 billion in 2019, a sharp slide from a record $31.6 billion the previous year, according to research from ICEX and the Spanish-based IE Center for the Governance of Change.
The move could indicate sovereign funds were taking a pause from the start-up sector in the wake of office-sharing firm WeWork' aborted listing and Uber's underwhelming IPO, the center's director of sovereign wealth research Javier Capape said.
Both companies were backed by SoftBank's Vision Fund, and fueled with cash from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment.
Sovereign funds have been moving into venture capital in recent years to tap strong returns from technological innovation, broaden their assets and, in some cases, diversify their local economies. In 2018, sovereign funds participated in 9% of global venture capital deals by dollar volume.
However, deal value has more than halved to $2.4 billion in the six months since WeWork pulled the plug on its IPO in September 2019 compared to the previous eight months, said Capape.
This lack of interest could be seen across the investment sector, he said. ""We've not observed many sovereign wealth funds joining direct investment in recent months.""
""Maybe they are taking decisions, going on hold for a while, applying more scrutiny of the selection of venture capital managers or reconsidering other investment areas.""
The research encompasses deals sovereign funds participated in directly.
The amount of sovereign fund investment via funds such as the Vision Fund is more difficult to assess as most venture capital or private equity fund managers do not disclose their limited partners.
Even when that is known, how much each investor commits is generally not.
Singapore-based sovereign funds Temasek, GIC and Mubadala are among funds that have built up in-house teams in recent years to make investments directly.
The former two participated in the $14 billion financing of Chinese online payment platform Ant Financial Services Group in 2018, one of the biggest-ever single fundraisings globally by a private company.
In the coming years, interest in direct venture capital dealmaking is expected to grow.
""The smaller, pinpoint type direct VC investments are very much in flavor,"" said Tihir Sarkar, London-based partner at Cleary Gottlieb, which counts several prominent sovereign funds as clients.
One uncertainty in the immediate future is how much damage the coronavirus will do to venture capital.
China, the second-largest destination for deals backed by sovereign money, has reported the largest number of cases and locked down some parts of its economy.
That could mean fewer investors flying for meetings and a need to re-evaluate deals given new market conditions, said Capape. However, existing interest in biotechnology could intensify because of the outbreak, he added.
Biotechnology accounted for 15.3% of sovereign fund-backed venture rounds between 2014 and 2019, already more than any other sector, according to IE Center for the Governance of Change research."

The Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement (SHTA) aims to ensure Swiss-based exporters and trading firms in the medical, pharmaceutical and food sectors have a secure channel with a Swiss bank to guarantee payment for exports to Iran.
The arrangement has been in the works since U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions in 2018 after walking away from a deal over Iran's nuclear program, well before the coronavirus outbreak which has hit the Islamic Republic badly.
The channel went live last month after a pilot deal in January involving Swiss bank BCP and drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) for shipments of cancer and organ transplant drugs worth 2.3 million euros ($2.6 million).
""There are 50 companies that are interested at the moment, and we think there will be more,"" said Marie-Gabrielle Ineichen-Fleisch, director of the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) agency that oversees the program.
She did not name any of the companies.
""Iran has been especially hit by the coronavirus, and while there is no substance that helps against the virus, in general the health situation is difficult,"" she said in an interview with broadcaster SRF on Saturday.
""If we can provide some support there and ensure exports take place then we are making a good contribution.""
Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from U.S. sanctions but the measures targeting anything from oil sales to shipping to finance have deterred many foreign banks from doing business with Iran - including humanitarian deals.
In the Swiss project, exporters and banks give the government information about their business activities and partners in Iran. Bern verifies it and shares it with the U.S. Treasury, which then signs off on which deals can go ahead without those involved being sanctioned."

In a company-wide memo sent on Friday, chief executive officer Mushafiz Mustafa Bakri said the airlines have implemented several measures to cope with the revenue shortfall, including suspending flights, appealing to suppliers to defer payments, and asking staff to volunteer for unpaid leave.
""With a heavy heart, with not much of any further concrete options, we are now left with no choice but to ask each one of you to take a pay cut of your basic pay of up to 50% for the next several months until normalcy returns,"" Mushafiz said in the memo.
As part of the pay cut, employees were asked to reduce their number of working days by up to 15 days a month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bargain-hunting investors are eyeing the shares of airlines, hotels, cruise lines and other companies that have been among the worst-hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
The recent declines have brought down the valuations of travel and leisure-related companies to levels some investors are believe are attractive.  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), for example, now trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 3.3, compared to 5.4 at the start of the year. Marriott International (O:MAR) trades at 17.6 compared to 23.2, while the forward price for Carnival Corp (N:CCL) has fallen to 6.4 times forward earnings from 11.6 at the start of the year. 
Few believe these companies are in the clear, as the outbreak continues to accelerate beyond China’s borders to the United States and other countries. On Friday, Reuters reported that U.S. officials are considering ways to discourage U.S. travelers from taking cruises. Shares of Carnival Corp hit an 11-year low, while shares of Royal Carribbean touched 5-year lows. 
Yet the sharp decline in stocks tied to tourism and leisure in the wake of the virus’ spread has pulled down valuations in the battered sectors and attracted the attention of investors looking to take advantage of recent market declines. 
Noah Hamman, chief executive of Advisorshares, an investment firm that focuses on actively-managed exchange-traded funds, is adding to positions in airlines that focus on regional and domestic travel, such as  Hawaiian Holdings  Inc (O:HA) and  SkyWest  Inc (O:SKYW), a bet that these carriers have better prospects of surviving a travel slowdown because they are more often used for regional and domestic trips. 
At the same time, he is short shares of American Airlines, which has a greater reliance on revenue from international travel. Shares of the company are down nearly 43% for the year to date. 
""Those smaller regional carriers we think can weather the storm quite a bit more … but the big carriers we think will continue to struggle,"" he said. 
The International Air Transport Association said Thursday that the coronavirus outbreak could slash up to $113 billion in airline revenues this year, an estimate more than 3 times greater than its projections from two weeks ago. Budget carrier Southwest Co (N:LUV), meanwhile, predicted up to a $300 million hit from first-quarter revenues.
Investors in the coming week will be looking for signs of how much the virus' spread has accelerated in the United States and other regions. Sectors hard hit by the outbreak are likely to join a broader market selloff if it appears the outbreak is spreading faster than expected. 
Bond yields plunged and U.S. stock futures were down sharply on Friday morning as heightened fears about the economic damage from the coronavirus epidemic drove investors to perceived safe havens such as Treasuries and gold.
Jamie Cox, a financial advisor at Harris Financial, remains bullish on the shares he owns of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), a bet that consolidation in the industry has reduced the number of competitors and will allow airlines to weather a slowdown in traffic without cutting their prices in a bid to lure back customers.
“If you want to be able to travel, you have to use these carriers because there are so few of them,"" he said. 
He’s far less optimistic on a rebound in shares of cruise companies, some of which have dropped by 50% or more since the start of the year. 
News reports about coronavirus outbreaks on ships like the Diamond Princess--a vessel owned by Princess Cruises that was moored in quarantine for two weeks off the coast of Japan in February - will likely weigh on investment sentiment toward these companies, he said. 
""People are going to remember the Diamond Princess a lot longer than they will that airlines canceled flights to China,"" he said. 
Not all investors are ready to jump in. 
Brian Frank, portfolio manager of the Frank Value Fund, said that cruise liners and airline companies would need to fall by another 50% or more for them to become attractive given the fact that they were trading at near-record valuations before the coronavirus outbreak. 
His fund has built up about 60% of its portfolio in cash and he is waiting for further declines before buying, he said.

""There's no shortage of great companies, just a shortage of good valuations,"" he said. ""We're ready to start buying if coronavirus gets bad and we go into a recession.""

176,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 05:44PM ET</span>","U.S. lawmakers fault FAA, Boeing for deadly 737 Max crashes","By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - A U.S. House investigative report into two fatal Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes on a Boeing 737 MAX faulted the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) approval of the plane and Boeing's design failures, saying the flights were ""doomed.""
Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide for nearly a year following the second of two crashes, one in Indonesia in October 2018 and one in Ethiopia last March, that together killed 346 people.
The preliminary investigative findings from the U.S. House Transportation Committee, released on Friday, called the FAA's certification review of the 737 MAX ""grossly insufficient"" and said the agency had failed in its duty to identify key safety problems.
""The combination of these problems doomed the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights,"" the panel said in the 13-page report.
It also said Boeing's 737 MAX design ""was marred by technical design failures, lack of transparency with both regulators and customers, and efforts to obfuscate information about the operation of the aircraft.
The report, which comes days ahead of the anniversary of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, adds that the findings should prompt legislative changes to address how U.S. regulators approve new aircraft for service. 
The committee has been probing the crash for almost a year and received hundreds of thousands of documents and interviewed key Boeing and FAA employees in its investigation.
Boeing said it has cooperated extensively with the committee’s investigation and said it would review the report.
The FAA said in a statement it welcomed the report's observations and said lessons learned from the two fatal crashes ""will be a springboard to an even greater level of safety."" 
""While the FAA’s certification processes are well-established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs, we are a learning agency and welcome the scrutiny,"" the FAA said.
Ethiopia plans to release an interim report into the March 10 crash before the first anniversary, an official said last month.
A final report into the Lion Air crash released last October by Indonesia faulted Boeing's design of cockpit software on the 737 MAX but also cited errors by the airline's workers and crew.
RED FLAGS
The committee also concluded the FAA and Boeing missed ""multiple red flags and clear data points” in recommending that the 737 MAX should continue to fly after the first crash.
Those decisions ""gambled with the public’s safety,"" it said.
Boeing is facing around 100 lawsuits from families of victims of the Ethiopian crash who have questioned why the U.S.-based planemaker and authorities did not ground the MAX after the Lion Air crash.
The U.S. House panel also faulted Boeing for what it described as a ""culture of concealment"" for failing to disclose information to airline pilots about the 737 MAX's MCAS stall-prevention system linked to both crashes, and that a key angle-of-attack cockpit alert was ""inoperable on the majority of the 737 MAX fleet.""
Boeing did not tell U.S. regulators for more than a year that it inadvertently made an alarm alerting pilots to a mismatch of flight data optional on the 737 MAX, instead of standard as on earlier 737s, but has said the missing display represented no safety risk. Boeing has said it will make the feature standard before the MAX returns to service.
Erroneous data from a sensor responsible for measuring the angle at which the wing slices through the air - known as the Angle of Attack - is suspected of triggering a flawed anti-stall system that pushed the plane downward in two recent crashes.
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI are reviewing the plane's certification as are a grand jury and the Transportation Department inspector general’s office. Several independent reviews have also faulted Boeing's design and called for improvements in how the FAA certifies new airplanes.
Representative Rick Larsen, who chairs an aviation subcommittee, said Friday's report and other independent reviews make ""it abundantly clear Congress must change the method by which the FAA certifies aircraft.""
Boeing halted production of the MAX in January and a key certification test flight is not expected before April, Reuters has reported, as Boeing addresses several software issues and whether it must move wiring bundles on the plane. Boeing says it hopes to win approval for the plane to return to service by mid-year.

Separately, the FAA on Friday proposed fining Boeing $19.7 million for allegedly installing equipment on hundreds of 737 aircraft containing sensors in heads-up displays that regulators had not approved for use.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 05:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. considers discouraging some travelers from cruises - sources,"By David Shepardson, Alexandra Alper and Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is considering ways to discourage U.S. travelers from taking cruises as part of a broader Trump administration effort to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to four officials familiar with the situation. 
The officials, who asked to remain anonymous, said no decision had been made. The discussions were taking place ahead of a meeting this weekend between Vice President Mike Pence, who is in charge of leading the U.S. response to the coronavirus, and the cruise industry.
The administration could advise some or all U.S. travelers to temporarily avoid taking cruises in the face of a growing number of coronavirus cases on cruise ships or potentially impose travel restrictions related to cruises, officials said. 
Pence's office did not immediately comment.
Shares of cruise operators in U.S. trading turned negative after the Reuters report. Carnival Corp (N:CCL) and  Royal Caribbean  (N:RCL) shares dropped nearly 2% and Norwegian Cruise Lines (N:NCLH) stock was down nearly 1%. 
Shares in Royal Caribbean Cruises, Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings have fallen around 50% since January.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill on Friday allocating $8.3 billion to bolster the country’s capacity to test for the new coronavirus and fund other measures to stem an outbreak that has now infected some 100,000 people worldwide.
Democrats have said Trump - a Republican who faces re-election on Nov. 3 - has not adequately prepared the country for the possibility of a pandemic.
Trump said during a visit to a tornado-stricken area in Tennessee on Friday that his administration was exploring options to help airlines and other industries hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a pool report. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow also told CNBC that the administration was considering “targeted and timely” tax relief for such industries.
DEBATING MEASURES
Trump said on Friday that he had spoken to Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom about a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco after at least 35 people developed flu-like symptoms. The ship has been linked to two confirmed cases of the illness caused by the virus.
The administration is urgently debating measures aimed at reducing outbreaks on board cruise ships with several officials confirming the administration has reviewed potential restrictions on U.S. cruise ship travel.
Officials differed on whether the dramatic step of temporarily barring new cruises was being seriously considered. Cruise lines in recent days have liberalized cancellation and rebooking policies and some cruise travelers reported ships are traveling with far less than maximum capacity.
The Cruise Lines International Association said this week cruise lines would take steps to limit coronavirus concerns, denying boarding to all persons who had traveled from hot spots including South Korea, Iran, China and parts of Italy. The group also said cruise lines would conduct illness screening for U.S. citizens who have recently visited those destinations.
The cruise industry contributed nearly $53 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018 and generated more than 420,000 jobs, according to an analysis by the association. 
""Singling out the travel and tourism industry, and cruise lines specifically, will have significant detrimental impacts - some possibly irreversible - on the national and local economies,"" the group said in a written statement.
Senior Trump administration officials discussed the cruise ship issue on Thursday and expected to revisit it during a meeting on Friday, according to a White House official.
The official called the ships ""huge incubators"" and said older passengers could be especially vulnerable.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said its current information suggests that older people and people with severe chronic health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, have a higher risk of developing a serious illness as a result of the virus.
The U.S. State Department said in guidance last month that Americans should reconsider travel on cruise ships in Asia due to the coronavirus outbreak. 

The department said the situation remained ""dynamic"" and that any travel by ship could be subject to restrictions and quarantine by local authorities.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 05:11PM ET</span>","Coronavirus concerns drag down Wall Street, but indexes eke out weekly gains","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday as fears of economic damage from the spread of the coronavirus intensified, though Wall Street's major indexes ended well above their session lows.
The S&P 500 posted its 10th decline in 12 sessions as moves to contain the virus crippled supply chains and prompted a sharp cut to global economic growth forecasts for 2020. Since its record closing high on Feb. 19, the benchmark index has lost more than 12%, wiping out $3.43 trillion from its market capitalization, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Even so, for the week the S&P 500, along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq, posted a modest gain as stocks on Friday pared losses late in the session. Comments from Federal Reserve officials about the possibility of using other tools in addition to interest rate cuts to blunt the economic impact of the coronavirus helped stocks ease declines, said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York.
Nonetheless, ""it's very unclear what the economic impact will be,"" Levine said.
Yields on long-dated U.S. Treasuries fell to record lows as investors fled to bonds, whose prices move inversely to their yields. The drop in Treasury yields weighed heavily on shares of financial companies, which tumbled 3.3%. The S&P 500 banks index dropped 4.7%, bringing its total decline for the week to more than 8%.
Shares of cruise operators Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd slid after Reuters reported that the administration of President Donald Trump was considering ways to discourage U.S. travelers from taking cruises. Carnival shares fell 2.6%, and Royal Caribbean shares dropped 1.2%.
""The decline today is all about the efforts to contain the spread of the virus,"" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management in Boston. ""The measures being taken could dampen commerce and consumer activity, and markets are responding to that.""
Data showing a robust pace of hiring in February largely went ignored, given that the data captured little of the impact from the coronavirus. A sharp downturn in later economic and corporate earnings data would likely strike a further blow to U.S. markets, analysts said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 256.5 points, or 0.98%, to 25,864.78, the S&P 500 lost 51.57 points, or 1.71%, to 2,972.37, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 162.98 points, or 1.87%, to 8,575.62.
For the week, the S&P 500 gained 0.6%, the Dow added 1.8% and the Nasdaq rose 0.1%.
All 11 S&P sectors ended lower on the day Friday, led by a 5.6% drop in energy stocks, which tracked a 10% slump in U.S. crude prices. [nL4N2AZ0SL]
The Cboe Volatility Index, known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" hit its highest level since August 2015 during the session but pulled back as stocks pared losses. It ended 2.32 points higher at 41.94.
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares declined 1.1% after the coffee chain said it expected its sales in China in the quarter ending in March to fall by 50% in stores open for at least a year.
Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) shares fell 1.4% as it said it was struggling to keep up with demand for essentials, including disinfectants.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.77-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and 142 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 16 new highs and 542 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.20 billion shares, compared to the 10.54 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com - Stocks closed in the red Friday, but well off lows thanks to some late-day buying in what was another hectic final hour of trading.
The S&P 500 lost 1.71% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 1.87%. The Dow fell 0.98%, or 256 points.
As stocks fell, bonds rallied, pushing yields to historic lows again. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stood around 0.7%. It slipped below that level for the first time ever earlier.

In a market experiencing this many sharp swings, sudden bursts and record-sized moves, it seems almost quixotic to pinpoint one reason why stocks were up or down.
But looking at bonds and fed funds futures, the market is telling us that it really wants rates down and indications of that could have been enough to spur the late-session buying.

LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. retailers face an estimated $700 million sales hit from the coronavirus and some shipping lines are sending vessels to retrieve empty cargo containers from Los Angeles to prevent further supply disruptions.
The extended shutdown of factories in China caused by the virus, travel restrictions on workers and canceled sailings by shipping lines have thrown off the movement of containers, resulting in a surplus at the Port of Los Angeles and a shortage in Germany.
U.S. retailers' cumulative losses from coronavirus-related production and transportation shortages could hit $700 million between March 9 and April 20, said Patrick Hasani, chief of staff for digital freight forwarder Zencargo.
U.S.-bound electronics, clothing and furniture have had the biggest supply chain interruptions, Hasani said.
A spokesman for the world's biggest container line Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) said three large ships would be deployed to carry both full and empty containers from the United States back to Asia. It is too early to comment on further deployments, he said.
""We're only weeks away from a real tipping point,"" Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said of the empty container backlog at the busiest U.S. seaport.
Robert Loya, vice president of port trucking firm CMI West, has nearly 1,000 empty containers in his yard and at customer facilities - significantly more than normal - as terminals cut gate opening hours to reduce labor costs. CMI's clients include major retailers.
Lingering empties could jam up the vital Los Angeles trade gateway when China factory production rebounds - exacerbating the supply chain havoc from the COVID-19 outbreak that started in China and is spreading around the globe. 
China accounts for 55% of the ""lifts"" at the Port of Los Angeles - which expects to have 41 canceled ship calls during the first quarter, more than double the number in the same period last year. First-quarter container volume is forecast to drop 15% year-on-year.
The rise in so-called blank sailings means that fewer ships are docking to pick up empty containers.
Shipping consultancy Alphaliner expects further cuts to U.S. West Coast cargo capacity in April due to lingering coronavirus impacts.
Triton International (N:TRTN), the world's largest container leasing firm, in February said it is positioned to have ""150,000 containers sitting at the right ports in China"" as the country's factories ramp up.

(Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak that has led people to cancel holiday plans, movie outings and business travel is raising the risk of default by some of the worst-hit companies, an index widely used as a barometer of European corporate debt sentiment suggests.
The Markit iTraxx Europe Crossover index of five-year credit default swaps - which measures the cost of insuring exposure to a basket of junk-rated companies - surged on Friday to 380 basis points, the highest since June 2016.
Constituents of the index include household names such as Air France (PA:AIRF), ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG),  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS).
Based on index pricing, the default probability of some of these firms is as high as 30% over the next five years.

The surge in the crossover index may spook many, who will recall it blowing out to over 1,000 bps in the run-up to the 2008 crisis that eventually resulted in double-digit default rates in the junk sector .
The Crossover index, which comprises credit default swaps (CDS) of 75 sub-investment grade European firms, allows investors to buy or sell protection on all the constituents with a single trade - essentially a short (or long) bet on the junk bond market.
""The move in CDS reflects a grab by trading desks and funds for a hedge,"" said James Tomlins, co-manager on M&G Investments' global high-yield bond fund. ""It's difficult to trade large volumes in European high-yield, so rather than sell cash bonds, you just buy protection.""
CDS trading volumes were far higher than in the corporate bond market, he added.
The index does not contain many names which are already experiencing high levels of distress, such as Norwegian Air (OL:NWC), which saw shares collapse on Friday to 15-year lows.
Already-troubled UK airline Flybe has also gone into administration.
Tomlins said it had become clear recovery would take longer, and that market stress was skewed towards some sectors such as consumer discretionary and travel.
The moves have happened fast as the virus spread across Europe and the United States - the index was at 303 bps last Friday, and has almost doubled from end-2019 levels.
The index pricing implies a 30% probability for Air France to default over the next five years, while German steel firm Thyssenkrupp is seen with a 17% chance.
The latter has roughly 16 billion euros ($18.1 billion) in debt and pension liabilities, more than twice its market value.

Interest rates at rock-bottom and falling could cushion the blow. U.S. rates were cut by half a percent this week and euro zone and UK rates may follow suit. Fiscal stimulus and government bailouts are also possible.
Default rates for European junk credits are currently around 2.5%, Eyerman of Fitch said. That may rise, he said, adding that he had asked his ratings analysts to ""assume additional stresses"" due to the virus.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) ranked as the top adviser to companies targeted by activist investors in 2019, dethroning  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), which had held the top spot for three straight years, according to Refinitiv data published on Friday.
In 2019 Goldman advised on 48 campaigns to capture the top spot while Morgan Stanley advised on 37 campaigns, the data shows.
Goldman worked on some of the year's biggest campaigns, helping defend Sony (T:6758) against hedge fund Third Point, AT&T (N:T) against Elliott Management, and eBay (O:EBAY) against Elliott and Starboard Value.
In 2018, the two New York-based investment banks advised on roughly the same number of campaigns each with Morgan Stanley having been involved in 33, compared with Goldman Sachs' 32, Refinitiv data shows.
Spotlight Advisors, founded by Greg Taxin, a lawyer who worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities, captured the No. 3 spot last year with 31 campaigns.
Spotlight works for both companies and activists, while most banks work only for corporations.
Lazard (N:LAZ) and Evercore followed on the list with 10 and 9 campaigns, respectively. Both banks worked on more deals in 2018, with Lazard having handled 16 engagements and Evercore having handled 18, Refinitiv data shows.
League tables are compiled by various providers and are often used as data points in trying to woo new clients. But they seldom tell the entire story, bankers have said, noting that discrepancies can arise because many companies fend off activists privately and ask their advisers to stay silent about their involvement.
Activists mounted 400 campaigns last year pushing companies to spin off divisions, put themselves up for sale or give them board seats. The number represents a 21% decline from campaigns mounted in 2018, but activists also went after big companies like AT&T, which were long thought to be out of activists' reach.
Consumer cyclical companies were the most heavily targeted last year, Refinitiv said, with 68 campaigns in the sector.
Elliott Management ranked as the busiest activist, having launched 13 campaigns in 2019.
Okapi Partners and Innisfree were the top proxy solicitors, firms hired to gather shareholders' votes, while Olshan Frome Wolosky beat out two competitors to rank as the busiest law firm with 86 mandates working for activists."

200,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 01:46PM ET</span>","U.S. swaps regulator boosts monitoring, scrutiny as markets succumb to virus fears","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. regulator charged with overseeing derivatives markets said on Friday it is boosting communications with industry players and oversight as disruptions from the spreading coronavirus epidemic worsened, roiling global financial markets.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is ""closely monitoring the situation and its impact on the derivatives markets"" by boosting oversight briefings and staying in ""regular contact with clearing firms to ensure critical market infrastructure is operating as expected,"" Michael Short, the CFTC's chief communications officer, said in a statement.
U.S. Treasury debt yields plunged to historic lows on Friday, and U.S. stocks tanked as the Dow Jones Industrials (DJI) shed more than 800 points. In Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell sharply and the travel & leisure sub-index (SXTP) dropped into bear market territory, down 20% from a recent peak.
The CFTC is the U.S. regulator of the swap market, which has a notional value of $600 trillion and was a flashpoint of the 2007-2009 financial crisis that brought down Lehman Brothers in 2008 and nearly toppled insurance giant AIG (N:AIG). Liquidity crunches sparked by volatility in commodity derivatives markets have felled other big firms in the past, including MF Global in 2011.
With the introduction of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has dramatically beefed up its authority and oversight of the swap market, imposing new data reporting, trading, margin and central clearing requirements for dealers.
In 2017, the agency created a new unit to build the agency's market intelligence capabilities. It monitors over 100 commodity markets worldwide, assessing a range of issues including stress or liquidity, said Short. That unit is providing multiple daily and intraday updates, he said.
The CFTC has also been in regular communication with other regulators, exchanges and the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory derivatives industry body, the agency said.
The National Futures Association said on Wednesday it had been coordinating with industry groups to address technical concerns around contingency arrangements which may make it difficult for trading firms to comply with all the rules, the group said in a statement on Wednesday.
A representative for the association did not respond immediately to a request for additional comment on Friday.
Also on Friday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said it has increased monitoring and conversations with regulated institutions to ensure contingency plans are ""current, relevant, and reflect a comprehensive understanding of each bank’s unique risks and business profile.""
The OCC, a unit of the U.S. Treasury Department, also said it is consulting with other agencies and has reviewed its own contingency plans."

202,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 01:41PM ET</span>","Once unthinkable, negative Treasury yields enter the realm of possibility","By Karen Brettell
(Reuters) - A collapse in Treasury yields as concerns about the spreading coronavirus sends investors scurrying for low-risk government securities has led some to start preparing for the possibility that the U.S. debt yields could turn negative.
The Federal Reserve on Tuesday made its first emergency cut since the financial crisis, dropping the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to the 1.0% to 1.25% band.
The move has not satisfied markets, however, with stock markets cratering and Treasury yields continuing to plunge to record lows. Interest rate futures traders are now pricing in a 41% probability that rates will be zero-bound by June, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.
Even if the Fed is resistant to adopting negative rates, as most expect, Treasuries should hold their appeal as the world’s largest and most liquid market. That means that strong demand could send yields on some shorter-dated notes into negative territory, an outcome that seemed unthinkable only a few weeks ago.
Two-year Treasury yields (US2YT=RR) dropped as low as 0.394% on Friday, the lowest since October 2014, when the fed funds rate was zero-bound. Benchmark 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) plunged to a record low of 0.660%.
“Even if the Fed’s effective lower bound for fed funds is still positive, there is no reason that twos, fives, even potentially 10s couldn't trade negative,” said Jon Hill, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
Yields on short-term Treasury bills have briefly traded negative during times of stress. It would be unprecedented, however, for short and intermediate-dated notes do the same. A negative yield means that investors would pay the U.S. government to hold the debt.
The Fed is reluctant to cut rates into negative territory as it risks disrupting the large U.S. money market sector. There are also questions over whether negative rates have been successful at stimulating growth in other countries.
“We have a very, very large money market complex,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in New York. “The Fed has resisted taking interest rates to negative territory because they don’t want to disrupt the liquidity in the financial system.”
Economic growth overseas has been far more sluggish than in the United States. The European Central Bank introduced negative interest rates in 2014 and the Bank of Japan followed in 2016. Two-year notes in Germany (DE2YT=RR) and Japan (JP2YT=RR) currently yield -0.86% and -0.28%, respectively.
If longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields hover near zero, some see a risk that a new wave of buying could turn shorter-dated ones negative, even without the Fed adopting a negative policy.
“The one thing about the Treasury market that makes it so attractive regardless of the price is the liquidity and the depth of the market,” said Michael Lorizio, senior fixed income trader at Manulife Asset Management. If longer-dated yields continue to drop then, “the front-end in that scenario would be under significant pressure to maintain the positive yield.”
A notable factor about the current bond rally is that investors are not only preparing for zero-bound rates, but a raft of additional measures including quantitative easing as the Fed battles an economic slowdown. That adds to anticipation that future yield moves may also be unprecedented.
""This is the first time we’re cutting back to zero with a full-blown expectation that QE will soon follow,” said Hill. “We’re at an extremely fragile state right now in the global economy.”"

LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) Chief Executive Bill Winters is expected to stay at the bank until the conclusion of its current strategy, its Chairman Jose Vinals said in an internal memo seen by Reuters on Friday.
The memo, which follows British media reports that Vinals has been sounding out replacements for Winters, did not mention any timeline, but the bank's strategic plan is set to run until at least 2021.
A spokeswoman for the bank confirmed the contents of the memo.
""I want to comment on recent press speculation about CEO succession at major UK banks, including at Standard Chartered,"" Vinals said in the memo sent to all staff.
""Both Bill and I have said unequivocally that (we) intend to work together through the delivery of our strategy and the transformation of our bank,"" he said.
Vinals' backing of Winters will be seen as a strong signal of support by staff at the bank, after the Chief Executive has drawn criticism over the last two years from investors disappointed by the lender's performance.
Former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) banker Winters won plaudits from investors during his first three years at the lender from 2015 to 2018 when he repaired its balance sheet and overhauled its lending culture.
He has since endured a tougher time. The bank's share price has languished as it struggles to grow revenues, and some investors criticized his pension allowance for being above that of the wider workforce.
StanChart's share price has nearly halved since Winters joined in 2015, as the bank suffered from slowing global trade, low interest rates and the costs of its own restructuring.
CHANGES AT THE TOP
Vinals alluded in the memo to a spate of changes at the top of some of Europe's biggest banks.
HSBC (L:HSBA) is hunting for a chief executive to replace John Flint, ousted last August and replaced by interim boss Noel Quinn, who is jockeying for the full-time role.
Quinn did not get the job as some expected at the bank's annual results presentation, however, and media reports said Chairman Mark Tucker preferred UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier or another external candidate.
Mustier subsequently ruled himself out of the HSBC job.
Meanwhile  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) boss Tidjane Thiam left last month following a spying scandal, and Swiss rival UBS (S:UBSG) is replacing Sergio Ermotti with ING's Ralph Hamers.
 Barclays  (L:BARC) CEO Jes Staley is also under pressure from an activist investor who wants him to cut back its trading business, and regulators probing his past ties to the deceased U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself awaiting sex trafficking charges.
Staley has said he did not know Epstein's true nature and that he regrets the relationship."

(Reuters) - The U.S. telehealth industry, including market leader Teladoc Health Inc, is preparing for a surge in demand as public health officials aiming to contain the fast-spreading new coronavirus encourage use of alternatives to clinic visits and patients seek to avoid public spaces.
The virus, which originated in central China in December, has spread to around 90 countries with more than 3,400 deaths worldwide. It has also spread across the United States with cases so far in 17 states and 14 deaths, all but one in Washington state.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/guidance-hcf.htmlexploring alternatives to face-to-face doctor or clinic visits to help limit exposure to the virus in the United States and free up resources for those who may really need it. Remote diagnoses through telehealth services could play a critical role, although actual testing for the new virus would have to be done in person.
""One of the technologies that has emerged loudly is telehealth,"" said Bruce Pyenson, an actuary and adjunct professor at NYU's school of public health, who has studied influenza pandemics.
""Telehealth services ... could play a very helpful role in an epidemic, especially for the triage function of 'How sick is someone? Do they really need immediate attention or are they probably going to be OK?'""
Virtual patient traffic at privately-held telehealth company American Well has risen about 11% since the first U.S. coronavirus death was reported on Saturday, while other companies have also had increased demand.
""We have seen an uptick in the phone calls we are receiving specifically around coronavirus,"" Grand Rounds Inc Chief Medical Officer Ami Parekh told Reuters.
""Some patients just want to know if they can safely travel ... some are calling with early viral symptoms and some are seeking more information on how to stay safe,"" she said.
But similarities in symptoms of seasonal flu and COVID-19 - the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus - could pose a challenge to remote diagnosis.
Brad Younggren, chief medical officer of 98point6, which offers private text-based diagnosis and treatment via a mobile app, said their physicians were encouraging patients diagnosed with influenza to reconnect if they do not improve.
Teladoc said it has been partnering with the CDC to provide near real-time surveillance data on the spread of the virus.
It said it was still too early in the outbreak to judge whether the virus had boosted its business.
An $8.3 billion U.S. bill signed into law on Friday to fund the coronavirus outbreak response includes $500 million to waive certain restrictions on Medicare telehealth coverage. That provision is aimed at encouraging senior citizens to opt for at-home virtual healthcare services.
On Friday, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) said members of its Aetna (NYSE:AET) health insurance unit should use telemedicine as their first line of defense, adding it would offer zero co-pay telemedicine visits for the next 90 days."

The S&P 500 Index’s two-day rout hit 6%, wiping out gains from earlier in the roller-coaster week, as the spreading virus shook investor confidence in the world’s largest economy. Treasuries fell to all-time lows, with the 10-year yield dropping as far as 0.66%. The dollar slid for the sixth time in seven days. Oil plunged more than 8% as OPEC+. A derivatives index that investors use to hedge against losses rose the most since at least 2011.
Investors have grown increasingly anxious that the Trump administration’s preference for forgoing fiscal stimulus in favor of pressuring the Federal Reserve into more action will fall short of propping up the economy as airlines cancel routes and events get delayed around the nation.
“As long as we’re seeing cases climb, it’s going to drive volatility in the market,” Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. “What you’re seeing is almost a coordinated response to try to counteract that drop in sentiment, the fear of what the actual economic impact’s going to be.”
While concerted efforts from central banks and governments to soften the blow from the virus spurred gains across equity markets earlier in the week, investors are back to taking risk off the table and piling into the world’s safest and most liquid assets. The number of coronavirus cases globally surpassed 100,000 as more infections were reported in the Europe and Iran.
Markets mostly shrugged off the latest U.S. jobs report, which showed the biggest gain in nearly two years, because it only reflected conditions before the virus outbreak began snarling global supply chains and intensified across America.

Containing the virus is important for U.S. farmers and meat processors like  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and WH Group Ltd's (HK:0288) Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] because an outbreak would shut the $7 billion export market for American pork.
The USDA would stop the transportation of pigs if the United States detects a case in an effort to stop the disease from spreading, the agency said in a statement. The halt would prevent farmers from delivering pigs to slaughterhouses where they are turned into bacon and pork chops.
With no vaccine or cure available for African swine fever, experts recommend that infected pigs and others housed in the same barn be culled. The USDA said the best options for disposing of dead pigs would be to bury them on farms or turn them into compost.
""USDA plans to pay for virus elimination at a uniform, flat rate, based on the size of affected premises,"" the agency said."

Oil tanked.
The S&P 500 pushed its two-day drop past 6%, wiping out all gains notched during the roller-coaster week, as the spreading virus shook investor confidence in the world’s largest economy. The possibility of fiscal stimulus stoked by White House adviser Larry Kudlow’s comments earlier in the day only gave investors a brief moment of respite before losses retrenched.
Treasuries fell to all-time lows, with the 10-year yield dropping as far as 0.66% and the 30-year rate falling the most since 2009. The dollar slid for the sixth time in seven days. Oil plunged more than 8% as OPEC+ was unable to agree on deep output cuts to combat the spread of Covid-19.
“As long as we’re seeing cases climb, it’s going to drive volatility in the market,” Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. “What you’re seeing is almost a coordinated response to try to counteract that drop in sentiment, the fear of what the actual economic impact’s going to be.”
While concerted efforts from central banks and governments to soften the blow from the virus spurred gains across equity markets earlier in the week, investors are back to taking risk off the table and piling into the world’s safest and most liquid assets. The number of coronavirus cases globally surpassed 100,000 as more infections were reported in the Europe and Iran.
Markets mostly shrugged off the latest U.S. jobs report, which showed the biggest gain in nearly two years, because it only reflected conditions before the virus outbreak began snarling global supply chains and intensified across America.

The world's biggest coffee chain had announced a similar policy for the United States on Wednesday.
Companies across the world are having to rethink the way they operate to slow the spread of a virus that first emerged in China, with some opting to freeze travel, stockpile goods and have staff work from home.
For Starbucks that means pausing the use of personal cups or tumblers in its stores out ""of an abundance of caution"". 
Coffee chains have in recent years encouraged customers to bring their own reusable cups or thermal tumblers to cut the number of paper cups and plastic lids that end up in landfill. 
Many offer discounts or increased loyalty stamps to promote the trend.
""We will continue to honor existing discounts for anyone who brings in a personal cup,"" Starbucks said. 

""As a result, we are suspending our 5p (UK) and 5c (Germany) charges for paper cups as well, given this decision prevents customers from opting for reusables.""

217,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 11:28AM ET</span>","U.S. Banks Tumble With Record Low Yields, Dimon’s Surgery","(Bloomberg) -- Shares of the biggest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., kept tumbling on Friday morning as yields plummeted to record lows, spurred by concern about the rippling impact of the new coronavirus.
With 10-year Treasury yields down about 25 basis points to 0.662%, industry profits are “on sick leave,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo said in a phone interview. At the same time, bank balance sheets are still strong, and “the foundation remains for growth once the virus period passes.”
The KBW Bank Index fell as much as 5% to the lowest since the end of 2018 in early trading; the index is down 25% so far this year versus a 9% decline for the S&P 500. BofA slid as much as 6.3% and Citigroup shed 5.8%. JPMorgan sank as much as 7.9% after Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was sidelined by emergency heart surgery.
Analysis last week showed bank earnings per share would face about 30% downside from “the Fed going to zero, bond yields touching 50 basis points and a modest recession,” KBW Chief Equity Strategist Frederick Cannon said via email. Now, it “feels like bank stocks are close to reflecting that.”
Dimon’s surgery doesn’t change KBW’s view on shares, analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a note, as the bank has a “deep management bench” and appointing Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith co-chief operating officers set the firm up for “transitional times like this.” Even so, Kleinhanzl said Dimon is “often viewed as a steady hand for the banking industry during turbulent times (like we are in now), so not having him at the helm of JPMorgan is a modest negative.”
Regional banks declined as well, with the KBW Regional Banking Index down as much as 3.5% to the lowest since August 2016.
Analysts at Piper Sandler and SunTrust cut ratings and price targets across the sector, with Suntrust’s Jennifer Demba downgrading asset-sensitive Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc. and First Midwest Bancorp Inc. to hold from buy. Cullen Frost also has a larger concentration of exploration and production loans in its portfolio, about 9% of loans, than peers, while crude prices have fallen, she added. Cullen/Frost lost as much as 4.3%; First Midwest dropped 7.1%.
Collapsing bank shares were among the key issues weighing on broader investor sentiment, along with coronavirus worries, earnings concerns and elections politics, Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli wrote in a note. “Bond prices are surging globally, destroying bank stocks in the process,” he said. “It’s very hard for anyone to comfortably buy the S&P 500 when the KBW Bank Index falls about 6% and hits 52 week lows.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - A meltdown in Europe's banking shares?
A quarter of their value has been wiped off in less than a month as rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the United States have darkened the outlook for the global economy, pushing central banks to cut interest rates further.
The U.S. Federal Reserve shocked financial markets on Tuesday with an out-of-cycle 50-basis-point rate cut, seen as the first of many to come from the rest of the world.
The European Central Bank's rates are already deep in negative territory and with fast-falling bond yields signaling at least another 10-basis-point cut, banks are feeling the heat. The Bank of England is also expected to cut rates later this month.
That's clearly set to further dent profit margins on loans.
The STOXX 600 banking index (SX7P) has hit 2009 lows, while the euro zone one (SX7E) has touched 2012 lows and are a few bad trading sessions away from testing lows last seen back in the 1980s.
Both indexes are trading in so-called 'bear market' territory, meaning more than a 20% drop from recent highs, and notably the moves have happened in less than a month.
""The new coronavirus has derailed the sector’s recent rebound and wiped out optimism about recent ECB measures, such as tiering and longer-term loans to stimulate lending,"" Christian Stocker, UniCredit's lead equity sector strategist, said in a note.
""To make matters worse, the ECB is now leaning toward further easing and rate cuts to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak.""
1/ BANKS HAVE LOST 84% OF THEIR VALUE SINCE 2007
Though it still hasn't quite matched the bottom of the 2008 financial crisis, the index has lost 85% of its value since its peak in 2007.

Kudlow, speaking in a round of television interviews, said it was too early to determine the magnitude of any slowdown but that the nation's overall economy remained fundamentally strong and was not headed for a recession.
U.S. officials were concerned about people who may have to stay home because of the outbreak and lose wages, as well as about small business and airlines, among others, he said. 
""We're looking for targeted measures that will do the most good in a short period of time,"" Kudlow told Bloomberg News. 
""We're not looking at big, expensive, macro cash rebates --helicopter money from the sky that never works,"" he added on Fox Business Network, saying any help would be directed to ""those areas that have been hit the worst."" 
""We are not looking at giving everybody $1,000,"" he added.
U.S. and global markets have slid for the past two weeks as the spread of coronavirus outside of China has raised investors' fear of the outbreak's impact as the number of cases neared 100,000 worldwide. In the United States, the death toll from the respiratory illness rose to 14.
The U.S. market slide alone had wiped out nearly $4 trillion of value through Thursday.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. stocks have fallen hard - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2980/2945/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Kudlow said the administration needed more information first before it could act and that more details could come next week. 
""We don't want to act prematurely,"" he told Fox.
U.S. President Donald Trump could act via an executive order, or he could also turn again to Congress, which this week approved an $8.3 billion bill aimed at efforts to boost the U.S. response to the outbreak, including money for drug and vaccine development as well as the public health efforts. 
Trump signed the measure into law earlier on Friday. 
He said the administration was not inclined to enact a temporary payroll tax cut, or lowering tariffs on imports, which some experts have said could ease global supply chain problems.

Kudlow again reiterated that long-term investors should buy stocks now amid the global dip in prices.

Several companies have launched precautionary moves, including travel bans, to avoid the spread of the disease to their employees. Many of them have backed out of conferences and business events.
Here are some major corporate events hit by the spread of the disease, which has claimed over 3,000 lives so far:
** Mobile World Congress, Barcelona: The annual telecoms industry gathering that draws more than 100,000 visitors to Barcelona, was canceled on Feb. 12 after a mass exodus by exhibitors despite health officials' assurances at the time that it would have been safe to hold it.
** Also in Barcelona, event organizer Fira decided to postpone the Alimentaria conference, which hosts around 150,000 attendees. The conference is now scheduled for September, compared with the original plan to host it in April.
** Game Developers Conference: Organizers said on Feb. 28 they decided to postpone the event, attended by 29,000 professionals last year, after close consultation with their partners.  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) had announced its withdrawal a day prior to the cancellation.
** Google's I/O developer conference: Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) on Tuesday canceled its annual developer event and said it would ""explore other ways to evolve"" the event. The company had earlier moved its annual cloud conference online.
** Facebook Inc's (O:FB) F8 conference: The company late last month said it will cancel the annual developer conference and instead organize ""a combo of locally hosted events, videos and live streamed content."" The F8 conference had attracted over 5,000 people last year."

Investing.com - Volatility continued to dominate Wall Street trading Friday, with stocks lower but swinging around on a myriad of headlines regarding the global impact of Covid-19.
Investors are dealing with a disease that is rapidly spreading, government responses whose effectiveness is questionable, bureaucratic standoffs in the case of OPEC and Russia, and a real ambiguity on whether good economic data is really good news given interest rate expectations.
And the market as a whole looks genuinely baffled.
The S&P 500 fell 2.3%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.3% and the Dow was down 2%, or 517 points.
The major indexes were well off their early lows. Losses were trimmed after White House Adviser Larry Kudlow said the U.S. was considering fiscal stimulus measures to combat the impact of Covid-19.
Data compiled by John Hopkins University showed that there are now 233 confirmed cases in the U.S., with 14 deaths recorded, of which 12 were in a single county in Washington state.
But strategists also said the bounce could also have been triggered by short-covering or algorithmic buy orders.
Stocks opened sharply lower as selling accelerated in futures following a better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report. The economy added 273,000 jobs in February, far more than the 175,000 expected. January’s hiring was also revised up.
While that looked like good news for the economy, it puts the Federal Reserve in a tougher position to justify more easing. That’s disappointing to an easy-money addicted market that’s calling for a further 75 basis points in rate cuts by mid-April.
The energy sector sank 3.5% as oil prices plunged more than 8% following reports that OPEC and Russia not only failed to agree on new output cuts to bolster prices, rolling over current output cuts was in question.
Among individual stocks, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 5% after the bank confirmed that chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had had to undergo heart surgery. The bank will be run jointly by its two co-chief operating officers while Dimon recovers."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said on Friday that she is asking Congress to give the regulator power to pay whistleblowers for tips that help them track down wrongdoers.
The authority, which would require legislation, would help the CFPB spot abuses, particularly in the area of fair lending, CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger told reporters.
The proposal would offer whistleblowers a bounty in exchange for their tip, but only if the information leads to penalties against companies, Kraninger added.
""We want to incentivize whistleblowers to contact us if they believe their employer is not complying with the law,"" the watchdog said.
The agency has been criticized for bringing fewer enforcement cases. However, expectations for any significant legislation from Congress in the 2020 election year are low, according to analysts.
When creating the agency as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, lawmakers granted the CFPB power to solicit whistleblowers, but did not allow the agency to offer monetary rewards in exchange for those tips.
Also on Friday, the agency said that it would establish an advisory opinion program that would give companies an opportunity to ask compliance queries and get agency responses.
The agency said the new program would make it easier for companies to adhere to consumer-finance laws, and the agency would publish its responses to allow other companies to rely on it as well."

LONDON (Reuters) - More than 50 staff at Societe Generale's (PA:SOGN) London office were working from home on Friday as a precautionary measure against the spread of coronavirus, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The French lender joined other banks sending staff home, splitting up trading teams and activating backup offices in a bid to contain the spread of the virus in Europe's biggest financial hub.
The mood among financial firms echoed that of British authorities, after Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Thursday that the country was moving from the ""containment"" to the ""delay"" phase of a four-stage plan to combat the epidemic.
Britain so far has 163 confirmed cases of the virus, which has spread to more than 100,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,000.
 Societe Generale  declined to comment on how many staff were working away from its office in Canary Wharf but said it has put in place measures including travel restrictions, rotation of staff, and working from home arrangements.
Commodity broker Marex Spectron also said late on Thursday that one of its London employees had tested positive for coronavirus.
It said the individual concerned had attended a Marex Spectron-sponsored event during IP week, a major petroleum industry gathering, on Feb. 25 in London.
 Citigroup  (N:C) has sent 10% of traders who usually work in its Canary Wharf office to a backup site in Lewisham, a source familiar with the move said.
Banks including HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) have also convened committees of senior executives to give daily briefings on the crisis.
Allied Irish Banks (I:AIBG) has canceled a planned post-results roadshow to London as a result of a ban on non-essential travel and has conducted a deep clean of all branches, Chief Executive Colin Hunt said in a radio interview.
""Earlier this week we introduced a ban on all non-essential travel across the group, that's one of the reasons why I'm talking to you this morning from Dublin and not London,"" he said.
DON'T PANIC
The mood among financial firms was more practical than panicked, despite the growing number of confirmed cases.
""Had a few hedge funds that went into full shutdown on Monday because of coronavirus but then realized they were over-reacting and went back into the office later in the week,"" said one hedge fund recruiter.
Staff in coffee shops in the Canary Wharf financial district said business is down, but that they hoped for only a short-lived disruption to normal customer traffic.
""We expect it to be quieter for the next few days,"" a worker named Tahar in a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in Canary Wharf said.
An employee in a branch of the Notes coffee chain in the financial area said business was down compared with the usually busy Friday rush.
""People just want to be safe I guess, we are hoping things pick up soon,"" she said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. renewable fuel credits fell more than 15% on Friday, traders said, after news the Trump administration plans to appeal a federal court decision that cast doubt on a program exempting small oil refineries from biofuel blending laws.
The administration had previously intended to respond to the court decision by scaling back the waiver program. But a conversation between President Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas helped push the administration to shift course, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Renewable fuel blending credits, or RINs, which refineries must earn or purchase to show compliance with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), traded at 34 cents each on Friday morning, down from 40.5 cents each the previous session, traders said.
The RFS requires refineries to blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the country's fuel pool each year, or buy the credits from those that do, a requirement that has created a valuable market for corn but which refiners say is too costly.
Since the adoption of the RFS, the Environmental Protection Agency has granted waivers to small refiners exempting them from their obligations if they prove compliance would cause them financial distress. The Trump administration has roughly quadrupled the number of exemptions since it took office in January 2017.
In January, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals challenged the program, saying the EPA overstepped its authority by granting those waivers because the RFS requires them to take the form of ""extensions"" after the year 2010, and none of the refineries had received them in the previous year.
The bulk of waivers granted to refineries by the EPA in recent years do not meet that standard.
After the court decision, prices for renewable fuel credits skyrocketed, at one point gaining around 250%.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow recently informed Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a vocal supporter of biofuels interests, that the administration had decided to appeal the ruling instead of curtailing the waiver program, two sources told Reuters on Thursday.
Senators representing oil states had previously engaged in a major drive this week to steer the administration to appeal the decision ahead of a March 9 deadline. The senators claim the program is essential for keeping refineries that provide tens of thousands of jobs afloat.
The news is a blow to farmers and biofuels advocates, who claim the exemptions hurt demand for corn-based ethanol. The oil industry rebuts that claim.
U.S. biofuel laws for years have been a major point of contention between the oil industry and Big Corn, two pivotal political constituencies for Trump as he seeks re-election this November. During his time in office, Trump has tried and often failed to appease both sides."

233,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Opens Down 740 Points as Virus Outweighs Jobs Report,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks tumbled again at the opening Friday as the number of confirmed cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus topped 100,000.
Investors fled equities and other risk assets with increasing urgency, pushing the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond down to an all-time low of 0.69% at one stage.
By 9:35 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 736 points or 2.8%. The S&P 500 was down 3.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.8%.
The Dow had already fallen by 970 points on Thursday.
The release of data showing the U.S. labor market in rude health in February was largely ignored, given that markets have put an increasingly narrow focus on the spread of the virus and the measures likely to be needed to contain it.  The economy added 273,000 jobs in February, far more than the 175,000 expected. January’s hiring was also revised up.
“Measures suspending travel, closing schools and enforcing temporary business closures and an increase in working from home all risk material economic disruption in the short term,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer with BlueBay Asset Management, in a weekly post. “With fear and some degree of panic driving sentiment, this can be further exacerbated, leading to a dangerous combination of both supply and demand shocks to the global economy.”
Data compiled by John Hopkins University showed that there are now 233 confirmed cases in the U.S., with 14 deaths recorded, of which 12 were in a single county in Washington state.
Earlier, President Donald Trump cancelled a planned visit to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The White House said in a statement that Trump, who has called the virus a “Democratic hoax” and repeatedly compared it a routine seasonal flu outbreak, “does not want to interfere with the CDC’s mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency.""
Among individual stocks, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 6.3% after the bank confirmed that chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had had to undergo heart surgery. The bank will be run jointly by its two co-chief operating officers while Dimon recovers.
JPMorgan stock has already fallen some 17% over the past two weeks, along with many other bank stocks. High market volatility has led to the cancellation of many deals, while the Federal Reserve’s emergency interest rate cut will put fresh pressure on lending margins, allowing homeowners and consumers to refinance debt at lower levels.
Elserwhere, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 3.1% and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 3.8%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nissan (T:7201) is pushing on with plans to build its new Qashqai sports utility vehicle at its British factory despite warnings over Brexit, announcing on Friday a 52-million pound investment in a new press line at the site.
The Japanese carmaker has said that if Britain's departure from the European Union leads to tariffs, its European business, which also includes a plant in Barcelona, would be unsustainable.
It said it would build the new Qashqai at its northern English Sunderland site in 2016 after government reassurances that Brexit would not hit competitiveness, reflecting how far in advance investment decisions are made for a vehicle due around the start of 2021.
""Our team in the UK continues to set the standard for productivity and quality,"" said Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta.
Globally, Nissan is grappling with the need to accelerate cost-cutting and rebuild profits, repair its partnership with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) and handle the fallout from former boss Carlos Ghosn's arrest.
It currently builds the LEAF, Qashqai and Juke models in Britain, where it directly employs more than 7,000 people, but it axed premium Infiniti vehicles last year, cutting output, and has been hit by a slump in diesel demand.
The new extra-large press line is part of a 400 million-pound ($520 million) investment for the vehicle on top of the 100 million pounds spent for the new Juke, which entered production last year and has reached an output of 35,000.
Nissan's Sunderland site, Britain's biggest car plant, built nearly 350,000 vehicles in 2019, down almost a third since a recent high of over 500,000 cars in 2016.
Although Britain formally left the bloc in January, trading terms with Europe will remain unchanged until the end of the year after which a new partnership, which has yet to be negotiated, will come into force.
Manufacturers fear any additional customs checks, tariffs and regulations could add costs, slow down production processes and potentially grind output to a halt."
250,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Treasury Yields Hurtle Toward Zero as Bets on Fed Cuts Mount,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury yields plummeted to record lows Friday as concern about the global economic and financial impact of the coronavirus spurred demand for havens and traders amped up bets on further central bank easing this month.
“We are staring at the abyss of a credit crunch,” said Kaspar Hense, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management, who said the market is pricing in a recession.
The moves came as stocks around the world plunged and futures pointed to another day of losses in U.S. equities. The number of coronavirus cases globally approached 100,000, as more infections were reported in the U.S., Germany and South Korea. Singapore warned of a global pandemic and Britain’s chief scientific adviser said a vaccine could take as long as 18 months to develop.
The five-year Treasury yield breached its 2012 low, dropping to a record low 0.5339%. The yield on 10-Year debt -- which has fallen by more than half in just over two weeks -- dropped as much as 22 basis points to an unprecedented 0.6932%, before bouncing to around 0.76% as of 6:14 a.m. in New York. The 30-Year rate, meanwhile, plunged as much as 27 basis points Friday to 1.2742%, also a record low. Other havens also rallied, with the yen at one point climbing more than 1% to around 105 per dollar, while Bund yields became even more deeply negative.
“What we are seeing is symptomatic of not enough positive yielding, defensive assets within global fixed income,” said John Taylor, a money manager at AllianceBernstein. “Central banks are doing everything they can to provide stimulus, which can add fuel to the flames of the bond rally.”
The Federal Reserve earlier this week joined central bank peers in providing support to the economy and markets. It slashed its target by half a point at an emergency meeting to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. But traders are betting they will have to do much more. Fed funds futures contracts now indicate that the U.S. central bank benchmark will drop to less than a quarter of a percentage point in the second half of this year. And more than half a point of additional easing is priced in for this month alone.
“The market’s focus is squarely on the growing likelihood of the Fed once again hitting the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates and restarting quantitative easing,” said Chris Jeffery, head of rates and inflation at Legal & General Investment Management. “With the number of coronavirus cases spiraling higher every day, it’s a brave investor who stands in front of that trend.”
Sidelined bank cash may also be adding fuel to the recent surge in the Treasury market, which this week alone has seen two intra-day drops of more than 20 basis points for the 10-year yield. Around $1.8 trillion, or about 10%, of U.S. commercial banks’ assets is in cash that hasn’t been lent out or invested, according to Federal Reserve data and FHN Financial Chief Economist Chris Low estimated that pile could more than double in the event of a recession brought on by the spreading coronavirus.
“I’m hearing about mountains of cash looking for a home,” said Mary Ann Hurley, a Seattle-based vice president of fixed-income trading at investment firm D.A. Davidson & Co.
Outside the U.S., government debt markets are also being shaken. China’s 10-year rates fell to the lowest since the country was battling deflation in 2002. German yields closed in on record lows and those on short-dated U.K. debt neared 0% as the market braces for more stimulus from central banks.
“I can make some exploding noises with my mouth, which about sums it up,” said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe Ltd."

PSA and FCA are hoping to finalise a $50 billion merger in early 2021 that would create the fourth-biggest car maker in the world.
""We are in China to stay, we need to find a formula in order to succeed,"" Tavares said.
Car sales of PSA in China have dropped by 55% to 117,084 units in 2019 due to fierce competition from local rivals. Its production site in the country is tailored to produce 1 million cars per year.
FCA has a co-enterprise with Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) (SS:601238) in China, which has a 0.35% market share for passenger cars.

FCA Group vehicles' sales in China were down to 90,000 in 2019 from 163,000 in 2018, according to its annual report.

For a few glorious weeks around the turn of the year, things had appeared to be looking up. Mario Draghi, the architect of profit-killing negative interest rates, had left the European Central Bank, the China-U.S. trade war had been put on ice and everyone was looking forward to a year when U.S. policy would be firmly focused on keeping the expansion going in the run up to the election. Regulators even gave their blessing to tentative plans for buybacks and higher dividends from some of the continent's biggest institutions.
Then the coronavirus hit China, killing demand for imports of everything from industrial robots to luxury purses.
Then the coronavirus came to Europe, threatening to push the euro zone into a new recession.
Then the Federal Reserve cut big, and markets realized that the European Central Bank was in no place to follow. That has pushed the euro up by over 4 percent against the dollar in less than a month, making eurozone exports more expensive just as the U.S. prepares to ratchet down purchases of everything except masks and hand sanitizer.
The risks for banks – assuming no major changes to eurozone policy – are obvious: a collapse in investment banking revenues, as all but the most pressing deals get pulled, and a big jump in problem loans at businesses across the continent. Thanks to the recently adopted accounting changes under IFRS 9, they’ll have to provision against those risks much earlier. That  will make for grim readings throughout the first half of the year at least.
At the same time, another squeeze on interest income as falling bond yields put additional pressure on squeezed margins. The German 10-year government bond yield ground lower to equal its all-time record low of -0.74% on Friday.
Small wonder that the market has wiped over 24% off the Stoxx Banks index since the outbreak began, sending the sector into a new bear market (if labels like that actually count for anything).
Three of the four worst-performing stocks in the CAC 40 this week have been  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), all down by between 11% and 14.5%.
Italy’s Banco BPM, a regional bank focused on the virus-stricken province of Lombardy, has fallen 23%.  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), which had appeared to be emerging from a decade-long nightmare, has fallen a gut-wrenching 34% from its 2020 high.
Spain’s largest banks have all lost over 20% in the last month, albeit their investment case hasn’t been helped by a European Court of Justice ruling that exposes them to more litigation risk over their past mortgage pricing.
The response of both the Eurogroup and European Central Bank this week has been underwhelming. Next week’s ECB meeting is turning into an early, unexpected, wholly unwelcome and potentially impossible challenge for its new President Christine Lagarde."
255,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 05:12AM ET</span>",India’s Chaotic Bank Seizure Sends Shockwaves Through Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s attempt to buttress its financial system by taking control of the country’s fourth-largest private lender has instead triggered widespread confusion and signs of investor panic, adding a fresh layer of risk to an economy that’s already headed for its weakest expansion in more than a decade.
The seizure of Yes Bank Ltd. by India’s central bank late Thursday was the country’s biggest such intervention in at least 13 years. Speculation of a government rescue had been swirling for months, but the announcement unnerved markets by leaving several key questions unanswered, including the fate of depositors, creditors and shareholders.
Also unclear was how Yes Bank clients and counterparties would cope with government-imposed caps on individual withdrawals and a 30-day moratorium on new loans and payments. A Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.-backed Indian payments service that relies on Yes Bank to process transactions for more than 175 million users went down late Thursday, underscoring the far-reaching consequences of halting major portions of the bank’s operations.
Investors responded by dumping Yes Bank’s bonds and shares as well as those of other smaller lenders. State Bank of India, which has been tapped to inject new capital into Yes Bank, suffered its biggest intraday tumble since 2012. India’s benchmark Sensex index plunged as much as 3.8%, one of the biggest declines in Asia, and the rupee weakened toward a record low. Lines to withdraw money at one of Yes Bank’s branches in Mumbai were larger than usual around midday on Friday, with security officers telling customers they would have to wait one and a half hours to get cash after ATMs ran out of bills.
“The market was expecting a solution,” said Nilesh Shah, chief executive officer and managing director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. “People are bound to react the way they have this morning, but the panic can easily be controlled if the government announces the contours of the revival plan.”
The flight from Indian assets persisted even after Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said the nation’s banking system was “sound” and a proposed resolution plan for Yes Bank would be released quickly.
The RBI, smarting from the failure of a small lender last year, took the decision to seize Yes Bank after noticing a surge in withdrawals by depositors, people with knowledge of the matter said. Policy makers were concerned that the outflows would accelerate once the bank releases its earnings on March 14, which could show a jump in bad loans, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter was private. The decision came as a surprise to most Yes Bank executives.
The hashtag #YesBankCrisis was trending worldwide on Twitter. Many users shared their worries about possibly losing their deposits, even after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters on Friday that the money was safe. The RBI has placed a 50,000 rupee ($679) limit on individual withdrawals from Yes Bank accounts.
“I have about 150,000 rupees in savings here,” said Amit Shinde, a 28-year-old construction contractor, as he waited in line to take out cash. “I will be withdrawing it as soon as its possible. I don’t have confidence in the institution any more.”
Regulators’ failure to provide a detailed road map for Yes Bank’s rescue was criticized by some analysts and investors, who said the uncertainty could disrupt the smooth functioning of India’s financial system and crimp funding to non-state banks. Private lenders accounted for about 60% of the nation’s new loan growth over the past 12 months, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
More financial turbulence is the last thing India’s economy needs. While it expanded at the fastest pace among large countries worldwide about a year ago, it has since been battered by a shadow-banking crisis, waning consumer demand and the global coronavirus outbreak. Growth is projected by the government to slow to 5% in the fiscal year ended March, an 11-year low.
Yes Bank’s troubles are rooted in the rapid expansion under its former Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Rana Kapoor. In his last year in charge (the fiscal year to March 2018), Yes Bank had the fastest loan growth of any bank in India. But it was also piling on risk. The RBI forced Kapoor out last year after challenging Yes Bank’s accounting, saying the lender was downplaying the scale of its spiraling bad loans.
The shadow banking crisis that erupted in September 2018 added to Yes Bank’s woes. A Credit Suisse report last year said the company had the biggest proportion of outstanding loans to large stressed borrowers, including to Anil Ambani group companies and Dewan Housing Finance Corp., which was seized by the RBI in November.
Kapoor’s successor, Ravneet Gill, a former  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) executive, embarked on a prolonged quest for new capital last year as provisions against bad debt mounted. Gill received expressions of interest from investors including JC Flowers & Co., Silver Point Capital and even a mysterious Canadian lumber tycoon. But the money never materialized.

State Bank of India, the nation’s largest lender, has been selected to lead a consortium that will inject new capital into Yes Bank, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The government-owned lender was slowly cajoled by policy makers into agreeing to take a stake as Yes Bank’s situation became more dire, one person said.
The rescue is unlikely to result in forced haircuts for depositors and senior creditors, according to Ashish Gupta, an analyst at Credit Suisse.
Still, a prolonged period of uncertainty while policy makers finalize the plan could have ripple effects on the economy, Gupta noted. It has already weighed on investor perceptions of other private lenders, sending a gauge of their share prices down more than 4% on Friday, the most in about five years. Yes Bank’s stock tumbled as much as 85%.
“The delay in bailout creates an unnerving precedent and uncertainty for deposit holders and debt providers,” Gupta wrote in a report to clients. “This would also likely further aggravate the credit crunch in the economy as private banks have been the primary loan growth driver.”

Stock markets have been selling off since mid-February, wiping out roughly $6.5 trillion of market values, as the number of coronavirus cases climbed higher.
Analysts at BofA, parsing weekly data from flow tracking specialist EPFR, said $23.3 billion was pulled out of equity funds and $12.6 billion had left bond funds, the most since December 2018.
The data also showed risk-averse investors withdrew $5.3 billion from emerging-market equities, the most in 30 weeks.
Investment-grade, high-yield and emerging- equity saw the biggest drawdown since the 2013 'taper tantrum' -- the U.S. Federal Reserve's first hint it would reduce a stimulus program installed during the financial crisis.
Meanwhile,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it is ""much too early"" to declare the stock market sell-off is over. It expects a 15% to 20% drop in the S&P 500 from its latest peak.
The benchmark U.S. equities index has so far fallen 10.7% to 3023.94 points from the record highs it touched on February 19. Deutsche Bank sees the index hitting a bottom ""some time"" in the second quarter and recovering from there to 3,250 points by the end of the year."

Major brokerage  Citic  Securities Co's (SS:600030) (HK:6030) net profit in February jumped 37% from January, and is up 45% from a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on monthly results of the parent company released on Friday.
Guotai Junan Securities Co's (SS:601211) (HK:2611) results showed its net profit in February tripled from the previous month, while smaller brokerage TF Securities reported a nearly eight-fold earnings surge.
Results from dozens of other brokerages also point to a robust first quarter, setting them apart from other sectors such as tourism and entertainment whose operations have been hit by the epidemic.
""During the epidemic, investors are fully confident of the country's ability to defeat the virus, and their market participation also increased on the back of stimulus measures,"" said Cao Weidong, vice president of Yuekai Securities.
""The sectors' first-quarter results are very promising.""
PROMISING OUTLOOK
Brokerages' trading and wealth management business benefited from a boisterous stock market that saw its main index (CSI300) jumping roughly 14% from January lows on the back of monetary easing.
Meanwhile, China loosened rules for equity and bond sales to aid struggling companies, benefiting brokerages' investment banking business.
Fu Ziheng, economist at China Fortune Securities, said recent trading commission income is as good as it was during the 2015 market boom, describing the current run as a ""water buffalo"", a reference to the market's ample liquidity and bullish direction.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 04:13AM ET</span>",Special Report: Sleeping Beauty - How suspect gold reached top brands,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi, Mitra Taj and Peter Hobson
LA RINCONADA, Peru (Reuters) - From the Andes mountains, thousands of artisanal gold-diggers for years sent fragments of metal to a Swiss valley. There, a refinery purified the gold to sell to banks, watchmakers, fine jewelers and electronics companies. It circulated as ingots, phones and trinkets - some branded with names including Apple and Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF).
A trade worth billions of dollars, it was championed by the Swiss refinery, Metalor Technologies, as part of a program with Peru's government to integrate gold prospectors into the economy.
In early 2018, Metalor stopped taking the gold. The reason: It couldn't be sure where the metal came from. Peruvian prosecutors had come to suspect Metalor's main supplier was a front used by criminals to filter illegally produced gold into the world market.
Metalor is not under investigation in Peru, and there is no suggestion of illegality by the refiner. But the story of the project - and of how it was monitored by the companies and regulators involved - illustrates the risks of illicit commerce that lie beneath gold's glamor. 
Peruvian authorities are exploring criminal charges against Metalor's supplier, a trading firm named Minerales del Sur, after seizing a cargo worth nearly $4 million destined for Metalor in 2018, prosecutorial and customs documents seen by Reuters show. Customs inspectors found some participants in the program were selling more gold than they could produce, according to customs reports. The prosecutors allege these inflated volumes suggest Minerales del Sur was a cover to launder metal from illegal sources, such as mines financed by narcotics dealers or in banned sites in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
Minerales del Sur, which declined to comment for this article, has told Peruvian authorities it obtained gold legally.
BULLETS THROUGH THE HEAD
As global hunger for gold accelerates, so too do problems in its production. 
Industrial mines have long been accused of depriving indigenous people of land, polluting their homes and breeding crime. Now, high gold prices are making it attractive for individuals to try what the industry calls artisanal and small-scale mining. Every year around 500 tonnes, worth $25 billion at current prices, of gold is dug in this way, according to industry estimates - 15% of all the gold that is mined. 
Metalor is one of at least five major refineries, including two in the United States, which have come under legal scrutiny in the last two decades after taking artisanal gold from countries including Colombia and Peru, where most of the world's cocaine is produced and narcotics gangs have invested in gold production. One U.S. refinery closed after its employees were jailed for trading illegal and smuggled gold. 
This Metalor program was supposed to be part of the solution - a state-backed scheme to bring informal diggers into the formal market and improve their conditions. 
Minerales del Sur was hired to collect and check gold from small miners across the highland region of Puno, which extends from the fringes of the Amazon to Lake Titicaca. The region's apex, and the source of some of the gold, is a shantytown of about 50,000 people located 16,700 feet above sea-level. Called La Rinconada, it sits below a glacier-capped mountain known as La Bella Durmiente, or Sleeping Beauty. 
Said to be the highest permanent human settlement in the world, La Rinconada is no fairytale. Last year, authorities reported rescuing at least 68 trafficking victims from the shantytown's nightclubs. Last April, seven gold miners were found in a tunnel beneath the mountain with bullets through the head. 
Media organizations and NGOs repeatedly published reports that Metalor's Peruvian gold suppliers may have been infiltrated by criminals. The Swiss company - which prosecutors estimated processed about 106 tonnes of gold worth $3.5 billion from Minerales del Sur since 2001 - said it was confident of the checks it imposed on its suppliers.
""To our knowledge, we believe that this was done in a proper way,"" said Metalor CEO Antoine de Montmollin. ""But due to the complexity of the supply chain, we cannot have 100% certainty. We await the conclusion of the current investigation."" 
In 2018, Metalor supplied gold to firms including Tiffany & Co., Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Gold is used to conduct electricity in phones and other electronic devices.
Apple said it is committed to setting the highest standards for responsible sourcing, and has stopped working with 60 gold refiners since 2015 because they were unable or unwilling to meet its standards. It declined comment on whether it continued to accept gold from Metalor. 
Tiffany said it upheld industry-leading standards aligned with its commitment to responsible sourcing. It said Metalor was among several refiners which provided gold used in non-jewelry items. Its website shows these include $375 golden drinking straws and $1,500 paper-clips.
Samsung declined to comment. 
Metalor said its executives and local staff made dozens of visits, including to Minerales del Sur's offices, to ensure suppliers were operating legally. Each time gold was shipped, it also verified documentation to ensure the metal came only from members of the state formalization program. 
But Metalor told Reuters it did not inspect mines. And its executives were not aware of two independent audit reports, produced for a Peruvian state firm involved in the program and seen by Reuters, that found flaws which made it easy for gold from unknown sources to be slipped into shipments.
Peruvian prosecutors have said their investigation will remain open in a preliminary phase through 2020. No charges have been issued, and the case may be closed if not enough evidence is assembled.
Peru's Energy and Mining Ministry said it was working on improvements to the program, which it said has helped hundreds of thousands of people. In 2014, the incomes of as many as 600,000 people in Peru depended on artisanal and small-scale mining, according to estimates accessed on Delve, a global platform for information on such mines.
""You're not going to find any country where traceability of small-scale mining is 100% trustworthy,"" Lenin Valencia, director of mining formalization in the ministry, told Reuters. Small-scale mining is so important to society and the economy that compromises have to be made, he said. ""If we stuck to the law, there probably wouldn't be enough jails in the country to imprison so many people.""
Minerales del Sur declined to comment. A company representative told a judge in Lima its gold was all sourced legally. Daniel Jo Villalobos, attorney for Minerales owner Francisco Quintano Mendez, did not respond to emails. 
Metalor has been owned since 2016 by Japan's biggest gold retailer, Tanaka Kikinzoku, which said it had nothing to add.
A COMPLICATED PLACE
Peru is the biggest gold producer in Latin America. Its illegal gold trade, worth an estimated $4.38 billion in 2015, is at least twice as big an industry as drug trafficking, according to a 2017 report by the Peruvian banking regulator's Financial Investigation Unit. 
Energy and Mines Ministry data shows Peru's small-scale miners produced almost 19 tonnes of gold in 2018 - more than any single industrial mine in the country. Just over a third of its informal gold production that year was recorded in Puno, the region that was supplying Metalor. 
More than one in three people live in poverty in Puno, a land of rocks shot through with gold. Since 2000, rising gold prices have lured more to try their luck - in riverbeds, the rainforest, and in tunnels dug so haphazardly they risk collapse. 
To extract the metal, some use toxins including mercury which they sluice into waters such as Lake Titicaca, where studies have documented high levels of heavy metals in fish. On satellite maps, pools near mining areas show up sulphurous yellow and neon green. 
Miners in La Rinconada melt ice from the glacier to process ore. Yellow plastic bags of garbage slide uncollected down the snowy slopes; raw sewage collects in the hollows. The main drag bristles with black-market pop-up stalls marked ""Compro Oro"" (""I Buy Gold"") where men and women sell specks of metal. 
Metalor's supplier Minerales del Sur had two gold-buying outlets in La Rinconada. Its headquarters in the town of Juliaca were shuttered when a reporter visited in June. A man who answered the door said the company was no longer operating. 
Metalor showed Reuters data from its suppliers in the last four weeks it took gold from the Peruvian program. Almost one-third of the nearly $30 million worth of gold sent to the refinery in Switzerland over those four weeks came from suppliers who were identified in the Peruvian prosecutorial documents as ""suspicious,"" based on customs inspectors' findings. 
La Rinconada produced only a small share, according to the records. It's hard to be sure of the provenance: Customs inspectors found some of the names on the list were not producing gold where they said.
For example, in March 2018, Metalor accepted more than 40 kilos of gold (worth about $1.7 million) from a company outside La Rinconada which customs officials said in a report later that year they couldn't find at the address listed. When the inspectors phoned, the person they reached told them the firm was currently ""at the investment stage,"" the report said. 
Last June, a Reuters reporter in La Rinconada watched as hundreds of police officers in riot gear swept through the shantytown. A court had ordered miners out of ground owned by a local family. 
But the miners refused to move. They massed into a blockade and set off explosions of the dynamite they use to split the rocks. After a two-hour standoff, the police left. 
""La Rinconada is a very complicated place,"" said Federico Chavarry, who has spent the past decade as an environmental crimes prosecutor in Puno. He said the state lacks the resources to rein in illegal trade in the shantytown, because it makes so much money for many people.
""I think it spun out of the government's hands a long time ago."" 
Valencia at the mining ministry said prosecutors should be more active in controlling organized crime that fuels abuses. ""Right now, we don't just have informal economies, we have criminal economies,"" he said.
In one of two health clinics in the shantytown, physician Nelson Gadea, who has lived there for seven years, said that when he arrived he was shocked by the violence. The mercury the miners use causes mood swings, he said, flipping through pictures on his cellphone of patients disfigured by knife wounds: ""I don't go out after 6pm.""
Men offer lighted cigarettes and coca leaves to the mountain spirits to win their favor. Women, barred by the men from the mines, scavenge on mountains of scree. 
The men ""bring the rocks, dump them and we recycle the gold they didn't see,"" said one scavenger, Carmen Inofuente.
""There've been a lot of accidents, rocks fall on us, there have been deaths, too.""
There is no question that conditions in La Rinconada are very difficult, Metalor said; its aim had been to help. 
WATCH VALLEY
From the Andes to Metalor's headquarters is more than 6,000 miles and a world of contrast.
With views of the Jura Mountains, Metalor's neat lab and offices in Marin-Epagnier, a village at the tip of Lake Neuchatel, sit in ""Watch Valley,"" at the heart of Switzerland's watchmaking industry. The country exported timepieces worth more than $21 billion in 2018: One in every three watches shipped out of Switzerland is made of precious metal. 
In a conference room in Metalor's headquarters, CEO de Montmollin - who joined in 2005 and has been running the company since January 2019 - said artisanal gold had made up less than 5% of its annual throughput. Projects to make artisanal gold easier to trace face challenges, he said. 
Metalor refines roughly 500 tonnes of gold a year, around one-tenth of the total handled by the main global refineries. To be certain metal has been fairly produced often demands working with small quantities from single, closely monitored mines.
That adds costs that many end-users are not yet willing to pay, de Montmollin said. 
Metalor first started buying gold from small miners in Peru in the late 1990s and has experienced problems before: In 2004, U.S. authorities fined one of its subsidiaries for being slow to respond after employees found couriers were picking up gold from the refinery and repackaging it in shampoo bottles to smuggle to South America. The company improved its compliance systems. 
In 2007, according to Swiss prosecutorial documents seen by Reuters, Switzerland's Attorney General opened an investigation into two Peruvian mining companies it suspected had laundered drug profits through cash and gold sent for refining to Metalor. Metalor said it stopped buying and refining gold from them in 2007. The Swiss closed their inquiry in 2008. 
Jose Camino, Metalor's legal counsel since 2014, said these cases emerged under previous managements and were no reflection of Metalor today. 
Instead, Metalor worked with government officials on a new approach: Informal miners in Peru could sell their gold without fear of prosecution if they submitted a sworn statement saying they were committed to establishing legal tax-paying businesses, or becoming ""formalized."" 
A Peruvian state company, Activos Mineros, was tasked with commercializing the gold. In 2014, it hired four companies nationwide to buy it at prices above the black market. Minerales del Sur, which already did business with Metalor, won the tender for Puno: It would check that gold genuinely came from miners on the program, and smelt the fragments it collected into bars. These, it would fly to Switzerland to be refined. 
The following year, Minerales del Sur's shipments to Metalor more than doubled to some 16 tonnes, worth over half a billion dollars, according to prosecutorial documents seen by Reuters. 
In a press release in 2015, Metalor said the project had implemented ""clear reporting and verification of supply chain of minerals.""
CACHORREO
But the program is flawed, say prosecutors, auditors and the government. One problem, said Valencia at the Energy and Mines ministry, is ""basically, anyone could sign up."" This means some of those in the program may not be miners. 
Another gap: Rather than signing up for taxes and regulation, participants need only swear they intend to work toward that goal. 
If they do, their names are listed in a ""Commitment Register"" at the mining ministry. Miners with such sworn declarations have in effect been shielded from prosecution for illegal mining. 
That, said environmental crimes prosecutor Chavarry, has created an atmosphere of impunity. He said he, too, had tried in vain to enforce the law in La Rinconada. He once seized a truck with 200 kilos in contraband explosives. ""They didn't let me take it,"" he said of the suspects. ""They threatened to burn the truck, to burn me alive and to burn the police officers supporting me alive.""
Peru's deadlines for miners to formalize have been repeatedly extended. So far, about 9,000 people have formalized out of around 200,000 on the Commitment Register nationwide, said Valencia. 
Much of Metalor's gold came from suppliers on the Commitment Register, which was the basis of its assurances that its suppliers were legal. ""We were checking all the documentation one by one,"" said Camino. To this day, Metalor said, all but one of the suppliers are still listed on the Commitment Register. 
But Metalor's checks missed flaws flagged years ago. An auditor's report, reviewed by Reuters, found problems already in 2015, a year after the program started. 
The auditor, Rejas, Alva y Asociados, sent inspectors to Minerales del Sur's operations in the region. In sites including La Rinconada, they found many miners worked mainly as unpaid laborers for contractors, which sold gold to suppliers on the register. 
It's a system called ""cachorreo"" - a term with no direct translation from Spanish - and miners in La Rinconada told Reuters it is still widespread. Companies with legal concessions rent tunnels to contractors who hire hundreds of miners - as well as the women scavenging for rocks on the mountainsides - to extract metal.
Most of the time, the concession-holders take all the miners' rocks but do not pay them for an initial period. This is illegal, said Cesar Ipenza, a lawyer and an expert on illegal and informal mining.
But after laboring for a while for the concession-holder, diggers are free for a short time to take whatever they can carry. Instead of wages, benefits, or social security, they live by crushing and processing the rocks and selling their gold to ""Compro Oro"" stores. 
La Rinconada miner and labor activist Filiberto Arapa said that of the estimated 18,000 miners in the shantytown, only about 3,000 are legal. ""The legal workers have their documents and benefits,"" he said. ""The rest don't even know who they're working for."" 
Metalor said it had not been aware of the practice. 
Several miners in La Rinconada said they were not interested in formalizing. 
""If you work for a formal company, you receive labor benefits but make less,"" said Martin, a 36-year-old former farmer. He said he digs for one day in six entirely for himself and pockets between 1,000 and 2,000 soles a month. Peru's minimum wage is 930 soles, or $275. ""For me, it's better to make a little more"" by mining illegally, he said.
UNKNOWN ORIGINS
A second audit of the program, also reviewed by Reuters, found more gaps. 
During 2015 and 2016 the auditor, Inveritas Global Holdings, visited the 10 biggest gold suppliers in the scheme - five in Puno, and five in the Amazon region - and found four of Minerales del Sur's top five suppliers in Puno were booking big sales without mining at all. It also found Minerales del Sur had not provided evidence it checked its suppliers. 
""They're using their sworn declarations as legal guise to commercialize gold of unknown origins,"" concluded the report, which states that it was sent to Activos Mineros in May 2017. 
Activos Mineros said it could not comment in detail while the investigation is underway. But it said none of the companies it hired had criminal convictions when they tendered. Minerales del Sur, it added, did not come under investigation until July 2018 and has not registered any transactions in the program since then.
Valencia said the mines ministry did not see the audit reports, and Metalor executives told Reuters they had not seen them either. 
Metalor said it had been reassured the program was working by Activos Mineros' decision in 2018 to renew its contract with Minerales del Sur. ""If you renew the contract, that means that everything is okay. If not, you don't,"" Camino said.
The refinery said it will focus in future on gold from industrial mining companies, whose origin is clearer. It was a difficult decision, it said - in part because Metalor pulling out of the Peruvian program means that buyers with less concern for good practice will step in. 

""It's better to be part of something which is not perfect, but that at least things are improving, than doing nothing,"" said de Montmollin. ""We regret the decision, because gold will find its way, either way.""

259,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 04:06AM ET</span>",How Lipper Award-winning fund managers are playing coronavirus scare,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uncertainty over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak has prompted at least some winners of the U.S. Lipper Fund Awards to look for companies that can withstand a prolonged pullback. 
U.S. stocks are down sharply from the record highs they reached in late February as companies ranging from Apple Inc (O:AAPL) to Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) warn investors their supply chains and revenues could be derailed by the rapidly spreading virus known as COVID-19. 
As a result, fund managers from firms including  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), GMO, Madison Investors and Needham & Company say they are looking at companies in the healthcare, technology and financial services sectors which could continue to gain market share regardless of any economic disruptions from the outbreak.
""We felt that we were due for a correction, we just didn't know what would trigger it, and when it would begin,"" said Chris Retzler, portfolio manager of the Needham Small Cap Growth fund. 
""I don't know how low we go and how long we stay there, but I still remain firmly of the belief that we are in a bull market,"" said Retzler, adding that he was actively adding to companies during the market sell-off.
Retzler is focusing his portfolio on companies that can benefit from the growth of 5G communications, military modernization and data security, among other areas.
He also remains bullish on healthcare companies, which saw share prices decline earlier this year on concerns that Bernie Sanders, a self-avowed democratic socialist senator from Vermont, could win the Democratic presidential nomination and push a Medicare for All plan. 
""We have healthcare investments where we think that names are misunderstood, and we think the opportunities are great but are taking a little bit longer to excite investors,"" Retzler said. 
Mike Smith, portfolio manager of the Wells Fargo Endeavor Select fund, said he reserves a portion of his portfolio to focus on companies with compelling valuations and has been more active in the last week about adding to healthcare and technology names. 
Among the more recent additions to his portfolio is  DexCom  Inc (O:DXCM), a medical device company that makes continuous monitoring devices for patients with diabetes. Shares of the company are up nearly 32% for the year to date through March 5, while the broad S&P 500 is down slightly more than 5% over the same time. 
""We're trying to find those companies that are impervious to what's going on right now,"" Smith said. 
Matt Hayner, portfolio manager of the Madison Investors fund, began buying shares of Becton Dickinson and Co (N:BDX), a maker of medical supplies and devices, in January. The company, whose shares have dropped about 11% year to date, now represents about 4% of Hayner's portfolio.
""Even in the face of economic disruption, people will still need healthcare and maybe even more so with a disease traversing the globe that ultimately hospitalizes people,"" he said. 
NEW 'QUALITY' STOCKS
The annual Lipper Fund Awards granted by Refinitiv, formerly the financial and risk business of Thomson Reuters, recognize the top funds and fund management firms in more than 20 countries based on risk-adjusted returns. Winners were announced on March 5 in New York. 
The market risks from the coronavirus outbreak should ""burn themselves out"" within the next two quarters, setting up a rebound in the shares of companies that have seen sharp declines, said Tom Hancock, portfolio manager of the GMO Quality fund. 
Hancock added a new position in a healthcare company to his portfolio last week and built up a new position in ride-hailing firm  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) over the last two quarters after the company's ""broken"" initial public offering left its shares trading at an attractive valuation, he said. 
Hancock is now focused on companies that can grow regardless of the economic impact of the coronavirus, he said. 
""We still have concerns that are stopping us from going out and buying absolutely everything,"" Hancock said.
He said he was focusing on giant technology companies like Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Apple Inc which have what he called ""natural monopolies."" Shares of both companies are down about 5% over the last month. 

""If you say high quality stocks, people think of names like Procter and Gamble and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),"" Hancock said. ""But we think the new quality stocks are the technology stocks that have very low capital requirements and operate winner-take-all business models.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - WeDoctor will push ahead with a Hong Kong listing and invite pitches from investments banks next week to lead an IPO valuing the Chinese healthcare platform at up to $10 billion, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The Hangzhou-based company, which is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS), could look to raise up to $1 billion in the IPO, and could be among the first major Hong Kong listings since the coronavirus outbreak began.
WeDoctor has invited investment banks in Hong Kong and mainland China to a 'beauty parade', which will be held via video conferencing and in person at the company's offices for bankers located in China, three sources said.
The company's new chief financial officer John Cai, who is set to join from WeDoctor shareholder and strategic partner AIA (HK:1299) where he was chief executive, will take part in the discussions from Hong Kong with bankers in the city.
Founded in 2010 by artificial intelligence expert Jerry Liao, WeDoctor has more than 210 million registered users mainly in China for its online appointment booking, prescription and diagnosis services. It is also linked to about 3,200 hospitals and 360,000 doctors.
The planned float, which will likely take place in the second half of the year, will include its core business - online healthcare services, one source said. It is considering whether to exclude some units such as cloud-services from the IPO.
WeDoctor declined to comment on its IPO plans.
The deal would be a sign that Hong Kong's equity capital markets, which have been battered by a coronavirus-led slowdown, are set to regain some confidence in the second quarter of 2020.
WeDoctor raised $500 million https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tencent-wedoctor/tencents-wedoctor-raises-500-million-values-firm-at-5-5-billion-pre-ipo-idUSKBN1IA08G in a private funding round in May 2018 which valued the company at $5.5 billion at the time.
It is among a spate of technology-driven firms looking to shake up China's overburdened public healthcare market, with increasingly affluent consumers willing to pay for ways to get more convenient access to doctors and health services.
Its move also comes two years after rival Ping An Good Doctor, formally known as Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co Ltd (HK:1833), raised $1.1 billion in an IPO, but saw its shares later tumble as investors worried about its high valuation."

BENGALURU/MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Shares in India's  Yes Bank  Ltd (NS:YESB) plunged 60% on Friday as panicky depositors rushed to withdraw funds after the central bank took control in a dramatic late-night move and limited withdrawals from the troubled lender.
The shock move by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) followed months of steady deterioration in the financial position of the country's fifth-largest private lender and growing concerns over governance.
Shares of Yes Bank plunged as much as 85% to wipe out more than $1 billion of market value, marking the biggest intra-day fall in an Indian blue-chip stock. By early afternoon, the stock was down 60% after paring losses.
(For timeline of events, please click on)
As thousands of customers rushed to pull out funds and tempers flared at overcrowded branches nationwide, police deployed in some states to help control the crowds.
Many business owners feared the central bank's move would hit their operations too, as the lender, with 1,000 branches across India, has many commercial clients.
""I will struggle to pay salaries to my staff, or pay any of my vendors, because of the restrictions,"" said Chintan Patel, a building contractor in the western city of Ahmedabad.
Many customers took to social media to complain that the bank's online system was down, preventing fund transfers, while payment apps, such as PhonePe, which use Yes Bank to help process transactions, were also affected.
""Effectively, Yes Bank should have no equity value left,"" said Sandip Sabharwal, a Mumbai-based fund manager. ""Ideally, trading should be suspended till formal restructuring is announced.""
The rout of Yes Bank sent the broader market and the banking index into a tailspin.
As global markets reeled from uncertainty over a coronavirus outbreak, the debacle sent the NSE Nifty 50 (NSEI) tumbling as much as 3.9% to its lowest since last September. The Nifty Bank Index (NSEBANK) was down 4.65% by 0630 GMT.
RESCUE PLAN
The RBI placed Yes Bank under a moratorium on Thursday, and said it would swiftly work on a revival plan.
In a note, rating agency Moody's said the moratorium was credit negative as it affected timely repayment of depositors and creditors. It said the lack of coordinated action underlined continued uncertainty over bank resolution processes in India.
""It will be done very swiftly, it will be done very fast,""
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said at an event in the commercial capital of Mumbai, responding to a query about the rescue plan for the bank.
""Let me assure you that the Indian banking sector continues to be sound and safe,"" Das said on Friday. ""We stand committed to maintain stability in the financial and banking sector.""
In a regulatory filing on Thursday,  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), the largest state-run lender, said its board had given in-principle approval to explore an investment in Yes Bank.
SBI shares tumbled as much as 12% on Friday, in its biggest intraday drop since October 2012.
""(RBI's move) was inevitable, and was in the offing for some time,"" said Deepak Jasani, an analyst at HDFC Securities.
""The collateral damage it will have on the equity markets and debt investors is something that we have to be worried about in the near-term.""
Yes Bank, struggling under a huge pile of bad debt, has battled for months to raise the capital it needs to stay above regulatory requirements.
Since late last year, it had been trying to raise $2 billion in fresh capital, and in February delayed its December-quarter results.
""We believe forced bailout investors will likely want the bank to be acquired at near zero value to account for risks associated with the stress book and likely loss of deposits,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Saurabh Kumar said in a note.
JPMorgan cut its price target on Yes Bank to 1 rupee, from 55 rupees ($0.7468) a share."

Investing.com -- Europe's stock markets opened sharply lower on Friday, following another session of high volatility on Wall Street in which U.S. stocks had given up almost all of their gains from the day before. 
With the number of confirmed cases rising rapidly across Europe, and with increasingly severe measures being taken to safeguard public health across the continent, fears of a major hit to the economy have strengthened substantially this week. The number of cases in Germany has risen to 534 as of early Friday, while France now has 423 confirmed cases.
By 3:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 6.7 points, or 1.8%, at 374.10. The German DAX was down 1.7%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 1.3% and the Italian FTSE MIB - headquartered in the epicenter of Europe's largest coronavirus epidemic - was down 2.1%. 
Travel names were again prominent among the biggest losers. Cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) shares fell 3.8% while BA parent IAG (LON:ICAG) shares fell 6.4%. But banks, too continued their underperformance. The Stoxx banks sub-index has fallen 24% in the last three weeks as markets have abandoned any hopes of an end to deeply negative interest rates at the European Central Bank. 
The virus has cruelly exposed the structural faultlines that the euro zone has failed to address in eight years since the last Italian debt crisis. Italy, whose debt burden and chronic low growth is already a source of concern to its eurozone partners, has proposed over 7 billion euros of emergency measures to address the public health crisis that has spread across its northern regions, measures that would put the country in clear violation of the euro zone's fiscal rules.  The Eurogroup avoided either endorsing or rejecting that plan in a teleconference meeting earlier this week.
Oil and gas stocks were also under pressure amid fears that Russia will refuse to sign up to the 1.5 million barrel-a-day output cut proposed on Thursday by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The cut is conditional upon support from Russia on others, putting responsibility for any subsequent collapse in oil prices firmly with Moscow if it doesn't play along. Eni was down 2.8%, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) was down 1.4% and  BP  (LON:BP) shares were down 1.3%.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Straining under a massive debt load and at risk of a ratings downgrade, Mexican state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) was hit with a record jump in its pension liabilities last year as more workers retired on generous benefits.
Pemex [PEMX.UL] is fighting to avoid having its bonds cut to ""junk"" or speculative grade, which would put pressure on Mexico's sovereign rating and deal a heavy blow to populist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to revive it.
Unfunded pension liabilities at Pemex rose 34.8% last year to almost 1.5 trillion pesos ($77.3 billion), the company's accounts show. It also has $105.2 billion in financial debt.
""No company in the world, whether private or public, can sustain these,"" said Jorge Sanchez, director at financial think tank FUNDEF. ""What has brought Pemex to bankruptcy is, amid other things, its terrible pension system.""
Pemex negotiated most of its pensions with Mexico's oil workers' union years ago, when oil prices were higher and life expectancy was lower. But over the past decade and a half, crude output has fallen while the company's obligations mounted.
Backed by an implicit government guarantee, Pemex is one of Mexico's largest employers, as well as the world's most indebted oil company.
It had 159,400 active workers and 130,444 pensioners in 2018. Some retirees received up to 300% of their former salary in pension payments, a recent audit shows.
Nearly half the pensioners received between 10,000 and 20,000 pesos a month, far more than most Mexicans. Hundreds more claimed more than 100,000 pesos.
The audit also found irregularities in 13.3% of pension payments. In some cases it was unclear if the beneficiaries were still alive.
Pemex, the oil workers union, and the finance ministry did not comment.
Pension liabilities were only higher in 2014, Pemex accounts show. Then, the previous government assumed a chunk of the debt and negotiated changes to the pension scheme, which included raising the retirement age.
(GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Tbs9Wj)
Aaron Gifford, an analyst at asset manager T. Rowe Price, said the pension load was another worry for Pemex's credit profile. ""The question is whether the market is underappreciating it,"" he said.
Fitch Ratings said that while Pemex has implemented measures to contain its pension liabilities, it will take years for them to take effect. Other ratings agencies did not comment.
UNCERTAIN DESTINY
Lopez Obrador has thrown Pemex various lifelines, including cash injections, tax breaks and debt refinancing.
Investors are increasingly skeptical he can rescue Pemex, whose crude output fell again last year, and which all ratings agencies have on negative outlook, signaling further downgrades.
""Pemex is a company that has no control over its balance sheet, let alone its destiny,"" said Kim Catechis, head of investment strategy at asset manager Martin Currie.
Lopez Obrador's largesse with Pemex cannot offset the strain of giving it a new $8 billion refinery to build and reducing scope for private investors to partner with the firm, Catechis added.
Meanwhile, interest rate cuts by central banks around the world are putting downward pressure on the returns made by pension funds, Catechis said.
Worse still, Mexico's economy slipped into a mild recession last year, and if pension liabilities climb further, the government will be less able to provide support, said Gonzalo Monroy, an independent energy expert.
""(Can) the Mexican government ... continue the cash injections in a low-growth, stagnated, economy?"" he asked."

The companies accused the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. of taking more crude than it was entitled to under four deals that were signed in 1993 to incentivise them to develop deep offshore blocks. Those projects today account for about 30% of the country’s 2 million barrels of daily output.
Independent arbitration tribunals seated in Nigeria sided with the companies and awarded them damages. But the NNPC successfully challenged the awards in the Nigerian courts, which ruled the disagreements were either tax disputes and not subject to arbitration, or the tribunals had no right to impose the penalties.
In September last year, the U.S. District Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York dismissed a lawsuit filed by Exxon and Shell units that aimed at enforcing a 2011 arbitration ruling requiring NNPC to pay them $1.8 billion for a contractual breach. Judge William Pauley noted that the companies had multiple appeals pending in Nigeria.
‘No Justice’
The companies have appealed the U.S. judgment, saying the Nigerian courts denied them due process by annulling the award and they are now owed $2.7 billion with accrued interest.
The case was filed in the U.S. because Nigeria’s courts have never ordered NNPC to pay monetary damages to a foreign plaintiff over two decades and lack “the political independence to render impartial judgments in a high-value dispute,” the companies said in a court filing. It could take at least a decade for Nigeria’s Supreme Court to adjudicate in the appeals process, “which renders the prospect of justice so illusory as to amount to no justice at all,” they said.
Umar Gwandu, a spokesman for Justice Minister Abubakar Malami, didn’t respond to a request for comment. NNPC must file its response to the U.S. appeal by April 10.
The companies “face a formidable challenge” to persuade a U.S. judge to reinstate damages already set aside by a Nigerian court, said Tafadzwa Pasipanodya, a Washington-based partner in Foley Hoag LLP’s international litigation and arbitration department.
Read more about another legal dispute has with the oil majors.
Separate tribunals in Nigeria instructed NNPC to pay a Shell-led consortium $1.4 billion in damages in 2013, and Eni SpA more than $500 million the following year, while  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and Equinor ASA secured a $1 billion award in 2015. Those awards were also set aside by the local courts.
Chevron and Equinor initiated their own proceedings in the Southern District of New York in March 2018 to enforce their award, with oral argument scheduled to be heard on April 20. Eni approached the same court in mid-2017, but suspended its legal action in November while Nigeria’s Federal High Court considers the matter.
While U.S. courts can enforce arbitration awards made and subsequently overturned in other countries, they “apply a strong presumption in favor of following the foreign court’s ruling,” according to Jonathan Blackman, New York-based senior counsel at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.
The parties must show the decisions of the Nigerian judiciary were “repugnant to basic U.S. principles of justice and fairness or due process,” he said. “This is a difficult -- but not impossible -- standard to meet.”
Industry Support
The case brought by Exxon and Shell meets that threshold, according to the American Petroleum Institute, which filed a brief in support of the companies’ appeal. The conduct of Nigeria’s courts “runs contrary to central concepts of justice in the United States,” it said.
Spokesmen for Exxon, Chevron and Equinor said their companies don’t comment on ongoing litigation. Representatives of Shell, Eni and NNPC didn’t respond to requests for comment.
There is an example of an arbitration decision that went against Nigeria being enforced in the U.K., which threatens to put further strain on the nation’s already stretched finances.
In September, a British judge ruled that Process & Industrial Developments Ltd. can collect on a compensation award for losses incurred on an aborted gas-processing project in Nigeria -- a claim that now stands at $9.6 billion, or more than a quarter of the nation’s foreign reserves.

Lodha Developers International Ltd. closed its books on a $200 million bond, but fell $25 million short of the target of as much as $225 million. The debt sale forms part of a complex plan involving other sources of money to repay its $324 million bond due March 13.
Any stumble could lead to one of India’s largest offshore bond defaults. Policy makers are already grappling with a slowing economy and credit crisis that most recently claimed Yes Bank, which was seized by the Reserve Bank of India on Thursday.
The result of the fundraising came despite an unusual move to sweeten the terms of the deal.Lodha said in a statement after the bond sale that it would use the procceeds of the issue to “fully repay” the $324 million note due next week.
“In addition to raising $200 million, the company had earlier raised GBP 86 million in the U.K.,” it said. “With these proceeds and additional cash flows from the company’s U.K. and India businesses, Lodha Developers is fully committed to closing its maturing bond payments.”Moody’s Investors Service had warned earlier this week that Lodha didn’t have an alternate plan to repay the bond, and that any failure to meet the complicated conditions would “likely lead to a default.”"

275,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 12:04AM ET</span>",JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recovering after emergency heart surgery,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon is recovering from emergency heart surgery done on Thursday morning, with two deputies taking over as he recuperates, the largest U.S. bank said.
Dimon, 63, experienced a tear in his heart's main artery, which was detected early and treated successfully, JPMorgan said, publicly releasing an internal memo.
He is ""awake, alert and recovering well,"" according to the memo. The bank did not disclose where Dimon is being treated.
The bank's co-presidents and co-chief operating officers, Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith, sent the message to all employees, and are running JPMorgan as Dimon recovers.
Dimon has been CEO of JPMorgan for over a decade, and is a larger-than-life figure on Wall Street.
He has fashioned himself into a voice of the industry and become more active in Washington in recent years. He often uses his platform as head of the country's biggest bank to opine on issues that fall outside that scope, including immigration, education and healthcare.
At various times, Dimon has also mocked financial regulators, cursed during public appearances and joked about becoming U.S. president.
During his time at the helm of JPMorgan, Dimon has turned the bank into a global behemoth, with leading positions in many key businesses, through crisis-era acquisitions as well as opportunistic market-share grabs.
His most vulnerable time as CEO may have come after a trader known as ""the London Whale"" caused billions of dollars' worth of losses from derivatives positions in 2012 that management overlooked.
SUCCESSION WORRIES
Industry analysts characterized Pinto and Smith as capable hands at the helm of JPMorgan, but noted that Dimon's health scare raised new questions about who will succeed him for the long term. He also battled throat cancer after a diagnosis in 2014 that sidelined him for several months.
“This will definitely get the board to step up their efforts to put in place a succession plan because it is not going to be easy to replace someone like Dimon,"" said a Hong Kong-based consultant who works with the bank. ""They will have to cast their net very, very wide and will have to look both internally and externally.” 
The condition for which Dimon had surgery on Thursday is called an acute aortic dissection, where the inner lining of the aorta tears away from the outer edge of the tube. 
It is a serious, potentially deadly event that, left untreated, can lead to a heart attack or the aorta collapsing, said Dr. Gabriele Di Luozzo, director of thoracic aortic surgery at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital in New York.
During surgery, about 6-8 inches of the aorta nearest to the heart is replaced typically with a synthetic tube, said Di Luozzo. 
""This is a major operation,"" Di Luozzo said. ""In a typical elective surgery (to replace) an aorta, the risk of death is in the 2-3% range. But when you have an emergency operation it can be as high as 20%.""
If treated in time, patients typically spend a week in hospital followed by several weeks recovery at home, he said.
Dimon's surgery was successful and bank executives said they expect him to return to work.
When Dimon was going through cancer treatment, he curtailed travel and made fewer public appearances, but eventually recovered and got back to work.
Questions about who might succeed him have existed for years, as many executives who were viewed as potential successors left out of impatience or for other opportunities.
Pinto and Smith are relatively close in age to Dimon, who said in promoting them in 2018 that he wanted to stay in the job for five more years.
Two other people often talked about as potential CEOs are Marianne Lake, who runs JPMorgan's consumer business, as well as Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak.

""The bottom line is that Mr. Dimon is often viewed as a steady hand for the banking industry during turbulent times (like we are in now),"" KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note to clients, referring to recent market chaos and economic concerns stemming from the coronavirus outbreak. ""Not having him at the helm of JPMorgan is a modest negative.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - Former United Auto Workers (UAW) President Gary Jones was charged on Thursday with embezzling more than $1 million of union funds amid a U.S. corruption probe that has raised the specter of a federal government takeover of the union.
Jones, 62, of Canton, Michigan, was charged in an information, a court document typically used when the government has reached a plea deal with a defendant. J. Bruce Maffeo, a lawyer for Jones, declined to comment. The documents were filed previously and unsealed on Thursday.
The UAW said in a statement that members should be angry at Jones, calling the actions he was charged with ""a violation of trust.""
Matthew Schneider, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said federal officials would continue to investigate any corruption allegations, and a takeover of the union remained an option.
""We are not done,"" he said at a press conference. ""That's one of the options... whether or not federal government oversight of the UAW is necessary."" 
The charging of Jones and other senior UAW leaders has shaken the union and led General Motors Co (N:GM) to file a racketeering lawsuit against its smaller rival,  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU). FCA has brushed off the lawsuit as groundless.
Jones resigned his post and UAW membership in November after the union removed him from office, as U.S. prosecutors widened a criminal investigation of illegal payoffs in which at least 13 people have pleaded guilty.
Jones, a certified public accountant, was charged with conspiracy to embezzle funds from the UAW from 2010 through September 2019, and with conspiracy to defraud the United States by failing to pay taxes on the money prosecutors charge he stole. He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
Jones was implicated in the corruption case in September when his former deputy was arrested on embezzlement charges.
The revelations stemming from that arrest included lavish spending on entertainment by labor leaders - such as buying $440 bottles of champagne and hiring scantily clad women to light union leaders' cigars. 
In the scandal's wake, the UAW has announced ethics reforms and changes to its financial procedures.
Rory Gamble, who was appointed president following Jones' fall from grace, has promised to clean up the union and avoid a possible U.S. government takeover. But Schneider said Thursday he wants additional cooperation from the UAW.

In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appointed a trustee because of the union's connection to organized crime. The government oversaw the union from March 1989 until 2015, and five-year transition period followed.

278,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 06:41PM ET</span>",China tariff exemptions boost U.S. poultry shipments,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. chicken products are entering China without retaliatory tariffs after Beijing made poultry eligible for exemptions to the extra duties, shippers and an industry group said on Thursday.
The additional tariff relief may help China follow through on pledges to significantly increase purchases of American agricultural goods as part of an initial trade deal signed in January. U.S. chicken company  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) said it had already seen chicken shipments rise as a result.
China said last month it would grant exemptions on retaliatory duties to 696 U.S. goods as part of efforts to ease the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
U.S. poultry was not eligible for exemptions until this week, said Jim Sumner, president of the trade group USA Poultry and Egg Export Council. China-based importers have applied for and received exemptions from the 30% retaliatory duty, which Beijing recently reduced from 35%, he said.
""We now have product getting in without any retaliatory tariffs,"" Sumner said.
Global meat and poultry suppliers are competing for sales to China, where an outbreak of the fatal pig disease African swine fever has shrunk the hog herd by more than 40% and raised the need for imports.
Beijing lifted a nearly five-year ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat in November, a move the U.S. Trade Representative said at the time would lead to more than $1 billion in annual shipments to China.
""We are now on a level playing field with the other poultry suppliers to China,"" Sumner said. ""They knew that it was not in their best interest to have this duty, which could have impeded imports.""
Tyson Foods said it was encouraged by China's decision to provide tariff exemptions on chicken.
""Many of our customers in China have already qualified, boosting our chicken shipments there,"" Tyson Foods said in an email.
 Sanderson Farms  Inc (O:SAFM) said last week that since the ban was lifted, it had shipped to China or received customer orders in China for about 18 million pounds of chicken products. That included 137 loads of dark meat and 283 loads of chicken feet, Chief Executive Joe Sanderson said on an earnings call.
Logistics problems linked to the outbreak of coronavirus in China have eased after temporarily disrupting meat shipments."
279,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 06:39PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 6,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - With market volatility continuing there’s little chance of predicting now how stocks will be moving at the opening bell tomorrow. But it’s a good bet the move will be big.
And amidst the volatility, investors have a few things definitely on the calendar to watch Friday, including the big U.S. employment report.
There’s still plenty of uncertainty surrounding OPEC, Russia and production cuts as the cartel wraps up its meeting and also another healthy does of Fed speakers.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Nonfarm Payrolls in Rare Supporting Role
It’s not often that the monthly U.S. employment report isn’t the end-all-be-all of economic news, but this hasn’t been your typical week and the spotlight could easily be elsewhere by the time the number come out.
The Labor Department will issue its report on February jobs at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
For those keeping score, economists are forecasting that nonfarm payrolls rose by 175,000 last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 3.6% and average hourly earnings are expected to have rise 0.3%, or up 3% on an annual basis.
“A return of seasonable weather, the spillover effects triggered by cuts to Boeing’s 737 Max production and the first signs of weakness associated with Covid-19 are all expected to have put a damper on employment in February,” Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk said in a note.
“The question mark is leisure and hospitality,” Swonk said. “Visa recently warned of a significant blow to profits from reduced travel and tourism to and from Asia. Chinese tourists, who are some of the wealthiest in the world, are now absent from major tourist destinations. Much of that weakness is yet to come.”
2. OPEC Plays ‘Deal or No Deal?’
It seemed that every day this week OPEC had a production-cut deal – sort of.
But tomorrow is high noon for a decision, with the Saudi cartel in an apparent Mexican standoff with Russia on the last day of its meeting in Vienna. And given crude’s 2% drop today, the market isn’t confident they’ll pull the trigger.
OPEC is looking for a big cut of 1.5 million barrels per day, but are indicating that Russia’s participation is required or there will be no deal at all.
“OPEC is making the cuts conditional on Russia joining. What Moscow perhaps is underestimating is that Saudi Arabia may be ready to walk away if it doesn’t get a positive answer,” Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd., told Bloomberg.
3. Fed-Head Extravaganza
With an emergency half-point interest rate cut this week you may think the Federal Reserve had earned some breathing room.
But as far a the money markets are concerned that Fed isn’t even done for this month.
Fed funds futures are pricing in a 100% chance of another half-point cut March 18 and a 77% chance of a further quarter-point cut in April, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
How an intermeeting emergency cut was deemed insufficient in just a matter of days might be a good question to ask one or all of the bevy of Fed members who will be on panels at the Shadow Open Market Committee Meeting in New York Friday.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester will be on the Transparency and Communications panel at 9:20 AM ET (14:20 GMT).
At 11:20 AM ET, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will be on the Inflation Targeting and Rules-Based Policy panel.
The Northeast represents at the Monetary Policy and Zero Lower Bond panel with New York Fed President John Williams and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. It starts at 2:00 PM ET.
To close things out, Kansas City Fed President Esther George is on the Fed’s Balance Sheet and Credit Policy panel at 3:30 PM ET."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. financial companies are doubling down on travel restrictions to include domestic trips, replacing meetings with video calls, and webcasting events as the coronavirus outbreak starts to alter business-as-usual across the sector.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Thursday that employees should forgo any non-essential domestic business travel in all of its worldwide locations, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
""Meet across cities and countries by telephone or telepresence,"" the bank encouraged employees in the memo.
Similarly  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said on Thursday that it was restricting all non-essential domestic business air travel in the United States, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The moves made Wells Fargo and JPMorgan the first large U.S. banks to restrict domestic travel, after recently restricting international travel.
Rival  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) has also started discouraging face-to-face meetings, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is asking all visitors to its office where they have traveled to in the past few weeks and is rescheduling meetings to video or phone whenever appropriate, according to a statement.
Hedge-fund firm Third Point LLC decided to replace the in-person portion of its March 9 investor day in Manhattan with a webcast, according to a message sent to attendees on Thursday, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
Buyout firms Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and Apax Partners LLC postponed their annual meetings or will hold them remotely because of the coronavirus.
The changes to day-to-day business come as several states across the U.S. start registering more cases of the new coronavirus.
In the United States 12 people have died of coronavirus and the virus has killed more than 3,300 worldwide.
Some of the sector's younger and more tech-savvy firms are getting creative in their coronavirus preparation plans.
New York-based cryptocurrency data firm Messari implemented an indefinite work-from-home policy this week, and bought virtual reality headsets for everyone on the team to start experimenting with the technology which could be used to participate remotely in events.
""Might sound crazy, but it's worth the experiment,” said founder and Chief Executive Ryan Selkis."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are growing increasingly worried that the spreading coronavirus will hit U.S. corporate cash flow and credit in some sectors, especially if the outbreak keeps workers at home or prevents companies from paying employees.
U.S. corporate debt is near all-time highs, as is the size of the so-called triple-B segment of the market - companies one notch above junk status. Sudden shocks to the economy disrupt cash flow and put companies at a greater risk of downgrade.
""This is altering people's travel plans and work schedules,"" said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Reynolds Strategy. ""You could see defaults pick up because a slowing of economic growth. If you see what's happened to credit spreads, that has already discounted some modest increase in defaults.""
Corporations around the world have begun issuing profit warnings and curbing activities, as more than 96,500 people have been infected by the coronavirus globally and over 3,300 people have died, according to a Reuters tally. The U.S. death toll stands at 11, in Washington state and in California. New York's governor said on Thursday that 22 people in New York have the virus.
Junk bonds are pricing in a higher level of default and spreads over safer Treasuries have widened to 475 basis points from 403 at the start of February, using the ICE/BofA high yield index. February’s widening was the largest the index has seen since December 2018.   
A shutdown of parts of the Chinese economy has created problems for U.S. companies dependent on the country's production and consumption. But as the outbreak spreads, reduced economic activity in the United States could also become a factor. Various investors and market watchers are now cautioning about the risk to credit markets if the virus causes significant slowdown to the economy.
Macro advisory firm Exante Data on Monday warned that banks may be reluctant to refinance loans to companies if creditworthiness is deteriorating rapidly.
Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG) and a widely followed economist, in a column in the Financial Times earlier this week, pointed to the ""large amount of U.S. investment-grade corporate debt that hangs over the high-yield market like a Damocles sword.""
""Much of it is now facing a considerably higher risk of downgrade, given the inevitable global economic slowdown caused by coronavirus,"" wrote El-Erian.
AT RISK SECTORS
Ratings agencies Moody's, S&P and Fitch have all said that coronavirus poses risks to U.S. companies' earnings and cash flow, citing in particular sectors dependent on discretionary consumer spending and global supply chains.
    On the front line have been sectors affected by reduced tourism: airlines, hotels, cruise companies and casinos, which Fitch said could see a material reduction in cash flows in the event of a severe pandemic.
    The global automotive industry is also expected to suffer from the one-two punch of slowdowns in Chinese consumption and production, with the greatest impact on the sector likely to come from reduced sales during the outbreak, according to Fitch Ratings.
    Lower Chinese demand for commodities is expected to hit U.S. energy companies, in particular U.S. liquid natural gas producers who already face some stress. U.S. chemicals companies will also see lower earnings, Moody's said, especially those with significant sales and production in China.
Other industries cited include U.S. toymakers, payments firms and luxury brands.
""The default cycle could be much more abrupt this time as coupon misses are going to be the likely trigger,"" said Peter Cecchini, global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in a research note on Wednesday. ""Once again, they will likely and initially be focused in the energy sector, especially if oil prices remain in the mid to low-40s.""
Airlines around the world have been cancelling flights and warning of a hit to profitability. Britain's Flybe collapsed on Thursday after a plunge in travel demand.
Credit default swaps, which measure the cost to insure a company's debt, have risen for Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL), although they are still far off levels that would be considered indicative of potential default.
“If you’re a company that is not fine starting out and you’re already exposed, that’s where you’re starting to see some big cracks,” said Joseph Lind, senior portfolio manager for non-investment grade credit at Neuberger Berman in Chicago.
Among those are exploration and production companies in the energy sector.
“The bonds that have been issued this year have performed pretty terribly,” Lind said. “I think we will see a rise in defaults.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Traders at the world's biggest banks are swapping their plush city center offices to work from suburban outposts in New York and London, facing lengthy commutes as their employers attempt to reduce the disruption caused by coronavirus.
Disaster recovery sites in Greenwich, Connecticut in the United States and Northolt in Britain are currently being tested by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Barclays  (L:BARC), with entire teams working in sales and trading already heading to the suburbs, several sources told Reuters.
""This is happening as we speak. It's a test disguised as a real move to prevent contagion,"" said a source familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity as the plans are confidential.
The number of those in transit is expected to rise in the coming weeks as regulation - along with complex technology and the need for high-speed connections - means trading desks cannot operate remotely.
HSBC on Thursday sent 100 staff home from its Canary Wharf headquarters in London, after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus, the first known case at a major company in Europe's main financial hub.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) was the first bank to activate contingency plans and split its sales and trading staff between central locations in London and New York and secondary sites in Basingstoke - about 50 miles (80 km) from its London base - and New Jersey.
For traders who have early morning starts, it means resetting their alarms and traveling for an additional 30 to 45 minutes on average.
Most traders feel the precautions are useless as hundreds of people are still expected to work in the same office and it only takes one to spread the virus. They note no one is checking temperatures.
But banks argue that scattering staff and traveling away from central areas will help them minimize the risk of contagion.
Some Barclays staff working at the bank's Northolt site – about 13 miles from central London - have complained to colleagues about the longer commute and the increased risk of catching the virus while traveling.
""It's a very long tube journey,"" one source said.
In the United States, Goldman Sachs has secondary offices in both Greenwich, Connecticut, and Jersey City, New Jersey.
Goldman's Jersey building is located 10 to 15 minutes by ferry from its existing New York base, making it the destination of choice for most of its traders.
In Britain, Goldman has been testing a facility in Croydon, on the outskirts of London.
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) are testing UK sites near London's Heathrow Airport and the southeast district of Lewisham, respectively, and have yet to decide whether to shift staff.
None of the banks intends to arrange bus or coaches to make the commute easier, the sources said.
JPMorgan expects the bulk of its moves to happen on March 9 and has informed traders that line managers would privately disclose their new destination and this would become their daily office until further notice.
""You're just expected to get there,"" said another source familiar with the changes.
""They are not buying out hotels or anything... at best you get reimbursed for your taxi ride.""

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of people who have the novel coronavirus in New York state doubled to 22 on Thursday following an increase in testing, as Tennessee and the city of San Francisco reported cases of the fast-spreading illness for the first time.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference testing expanded after the federal government approved its use of additional laboratories, boosting capacity. He said more testing would inevitably identify more cases.
""Those numbers are going to keep going up,"" Cuomo said.
The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed an $8.3 billion bill to combat the outbreak 96-1, a day after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved it. The bill will now go to President Donald Trump for his signature.
More than $3 billion of the approved funds would be devoted to research and development of coronavirus vaccines, test kits and treatments. There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the illness that began in China and has infected more than 95,000 people in some 80 countries and territories.
Of the new cases in New York, eight are connected in some way to a Manhattan lawyer who lives in Westchester County and was previously diagnosed with the virus, two are in New York City and one in nearby Nassau County. 
Mayor Bill de Blasio told a news conference the new cases in New York City - a man in his 40s and a woman in her 80s - were critically ill and being treated in hospitals. Both had ""substantial"" pre-existing conditions, he said.
Neither person had recently visited any other affected countries or had any connection to other confirmed cases, suggesting the city is confronting local person-to-person spread. ""Our level of concern is rising for sure,"" de Blasio said.
A pair of new cases in San Francisco also were deemed likely to be a result of ""community transmission,"" local health officials said.
Tennessee became the 14th state to report a case, an adult male in Williamson County. Williamson County schools will be closed for a deep cleaning on Friday and Monday, according to its official Twitter page. 
The U.S. death toll from the COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the virus stands at 11, all but one them in Washington state, which has a cluster of at least 39 infections in the Seattle area. The other death, announced on Wednesday, was in California.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday reported 149 confirmed and presumed U.S. cases. They do not necessarily include new cases reported on Thursday. 
U.S. health officials say they expect to be able to get enough privately manufactured coronavirus tests - around 1 million - to public laboratories this week with the capacity to test about 400,000 people.
CDC official Anne Schuchat said her agency would also supply testing kits by the end of the week that could test around 75,000 people. 
""Right now, it is a challenge if you are a doctor wanting to get somebody tested,"" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters following a briefing with lawmakers.
MARKETS TUMBLE 
Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the U.S. response, visited mask-manufacturer 3M Co (N:MMM). He urged Americans not to purchase masks if they are healthy to free up supply for healthcare workers and people who are sick.
""Unless you are ill, you have no need to buy a mask,"" Pence said at the Minnesota company, which has ramped up production to help respond to the coronavirus.
""The risk to the average healthy American from contracting coronavirus remains low,"" Pence said, adding that ""there will be more cases,"" especially among more vulnerable populations such as seniors and those with chronic health conditions. 
Pence was scheduled to visit Washington Governor Jay Inslee later on Thursday. 
Global equity markets tumbled as coronavirus cases outside China mounted, fuelling warnings that world growth is likely to reach its weakest level since the global financial crisis a decade ago.
In late afternoon trading, the main U.S. stock indexes were down 4%. 
Corporations have begun issuing profit warnings and curbing activities.
Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google on Thursday joined Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) in recommending employees in the Seattle area work from home, after some were infected with the coronavirus.
The companies' work-from-home recommendation will affect more than 100,000 people in the area, as both Microsoft and Amazon employ over 50,000 each. Facebook employs more than 5,000 in the area and Google about 4,500, according to media reports.
California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency in response to the outbreak. California now has 55 cases, the most of any U.S. state.

Investing.com – Wall Street plunged Thursday as the coronavirus-led volatility continued and bond yields set record lows yet again.
The S&P 500 sank 3.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 3.6%, shedding 969 points.
The one-day-surge-one-day-plunge action is more evidence that Wall Street is still in the dark about how much impact Covid-19 will have on economic activity and corporate bottom lines.
California declared a state of emergency as the number of U.S. and global confirmed cases grew, while the Trump Administration said it would fall well short of its promise to have 1 million Covid-19 tests ready by the end of the week.
But investors seemed more shaken by domestic carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which warned on first-quarter sales. Although other airlines have warned and canceled flights due to low demand, the hope had been the effects would be more concentrated on international carriers.
Southwest closed down 3.6%.
Dow component Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 8%, taking more than 156 points off the Dow, on worries that plane orders could be delayed or canceled as the airline industry struggles.
Bonds rallied as money bounced back into safety and away from risk, sending the 10-Year Treasury Yield to a record low of 0.899% intraday, below 0.9% for the first time.
Although financials usually do well when yields fall, narrowing net interest margin, that benefit “is more than offset by the sharp drop in the overall levels of yields” and “weakening economic conditions can pressure the credit quality of banks’ loan books,” Allianz’s Mohamed El-Erian tweeted.
The financial sector was one of the worst performers of the day.
Also struggling were energy stocks, as oil prices dropped 2%. OPEC said it would like to cut production by a further 1.5 million bpd, but Russia has yet to agree."
290,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>","Coronavirus boosts Wall Street trading, easing pain from lower rates","By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Market volatility related to the coronavirus has provided a welcome boost for Wall Street banks' trading businesses, helping to offset the much-bigger drag of lower interest rates on lending profits, analysts said.
Volumes have soared across stock and bond trading as investors reacted to worries about the COVID-19 virus spreading around the globe, and the U.S. Federal Reserve slashing interest rates.
Fund managers have been buying and selling stocks more aggressively as they sorted winners and losers from the outbreak. Global stock markets have whipsawed from having the worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis last week to major surges this week.
Meanwhile, bond investors who for weeks had been expecting rates to rise had to rush into 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds last week to protect against a possible recession as pressure built on the Fed to cut its key rate target.
""We're expecting March to be a good month for trading results,"" said Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""As of right now, it has been good volatility.""
That kind of volatility happens when volumes run high despite big price moves, with banks acting as intermediaries between investors with opposing views. It turns bad when uncertainty causes investors to stay on the sidelines, creating unpredictable price swings with little work for trading desks.
Broad trading volumes for recent weeks are not yet available from major data sources, analysts said.
However, volumes on  Tradeweb Markets Inc  (O:TW) jumped 47% last month, the electronic-trading platform said on Wednesday. Similarly, online trading platform CMC Markets (L:CMCX) raised income projections on Tuesday due to higher volumes.
For some big U.S. banks, the overall income picture may be less rosy.
Those that rely on lending as a main source of income are likely to see significant pressure on net interest income (NII), the difference between what banks pay for the money they borrow compared with what they get from lending or investing in securities.
The Fed's half-percentage-point cut, which lowered the central bank's key overnight lending rate to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%, clobbered analysts' outlook for NII. The only major lending business helped by that move was home mortgages, due to refinancing demand, they said.
""While trading and mortgage will likely be bright spots in the quarter they will be overshadowed by lower-than-anticipated net interest income,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg said.
LOW-RATE LIFE JACKET
Trading contributes an unpredictable portion of revenue, but can make or break a quarter for the biggest players.
That is especially true for banks like  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), which does not have sizeable businesses in traditional areas the way competitors like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) do. Even its closest rival,  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), has a huge wealth-management operation to cushion profit swings caused by trading.
Last year, trading accounted for 40% of Goldman's revenue, compared to 18% at JPMorgan Chase.
But it may become an earnings life jacket for Wall Street banks in the first quarter. Before volumes surged, JPMorgan had already expected trading revenue to be up by a ""mid-teens"" percentage during the period ending in March.
The swings in recent weeks have been hard to predict, said Bill O'Donnell, an interest rate analyst at Citigroup who meets with major investors.
Fund managers had to reverse widely-held views that rates were about to go higher, switching to a reality where they were dropping, fast, he said. If those moves prove too much, the same investors may have to trade more to reverse course.
""The volume and turnover that would result from a rebound in rates could also be good for the bank trading desks,"" O'Donnell said."

The U.S. printer maker last month increased its offer by $2 to $24 per share, after its previous buyout offers were rejected by the PC maker for the same reason.
Chip Bergh, chair of HP's board, said the offer would leave shareholders with an investment in a combined company that is burdened with an irresponsible level of debt.
""(It) would subsequently require unrealistic, unachievable synergies that would jeopardize the entire company,"" Bergh said in a statement.
He pointed to declining sales at Xerox and said its recent sale of its interest in the Fuji-Xerox joint venture raised concerns about the company's future position.
Xerox decided https://www.reuters.com/article/us-xerox-fujifilm/xerox-exits-fujifilm-venture-with-2-3-billion-stake-sale-to-japan-partner-idUSKBN1XF0NB to sell its 25% stake in Fuji Xerox, its joint venture with Fujifilm Holdings (T:4901), for $2.3 billion in November last year, following investor activism that scuppered a deal between the two companies.
After Xerox raised its bid last month, HP said it would implement a poison pill plan to stop investors from amassing more than 20% stake in the company.
HP on Thursday requested shareholders to reject Xerox's tender offer launched earlier this week, saying it would disproportionately benefit Xerox shareholders relative to HP shareholders.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said on Thursday it plans to provide access to a suite of its credit products to recipients of the DACA program that protects from deportation some young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children.
The move comes ahead of hearings next week that will see the bank's Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf and its Chair Betsy Duke testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee for the first time.
The credit products will include education loans, personal lines and loans, and credit cards among others, the U.S. lender said in a statement.
The DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, which was introduced in 2012, has shielded from deportation a group of immigrants dubbed ""Dreamers"" and has given them work permits, though not a path to citizenship.
Wells Fargo also said it will make mortgage and home equity loans to eligible DACA customers, except where prohibited by specific investors.
The bank will roll out the new offerings in phases starting in the first half of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021, it said.
Earlier in the day, House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters said that she applauds the bank's recent actions like raising minimum wage and addressing consumer issues like excessive overdraft fees, but said the bank has more work to do.

Airbus also said it had no received no cancellations during the month and delivered 55 aircraft, bringing its total for the year so far to 86, fractionally below the same period of 2019.
It is the second time in as many months that a leading manufacturer has failed to generate sales in a calendar month after Boeing (NYSE:BA) drew a blank in January for the first time in decades.

The airline sector has idled hundreds of aircraft in the past month, while Boeing continues to wrestle with the grounding of its 737 MAX, imposed almost a year ago after two fatal crashes.
Although the Singapore Airshow went ahead in February, attendance was thinner than organizers had predicted and the show is not traditionally a major venue for commercial orders because it comes soon after the year-end deadline for many business deals.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A key congressional panel's chair on Thursday said she may ask the Justice Department to probe whether former  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) Chief Executive Tim Sloan misled lawmakers, and called for bank Chair Betsy Duke to resign following a yearlong investigation into its sales practice scandals.
Speaking to reporters, Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters, who chairs the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said Sloan gave ""inaccurate and misleading testimony"" when he told the panel last year that the bank was in compliance with a settlement to remediate customers harmed by its sales practices.
Waters also called for the resignations of Duke, who chairs the Wells Fargo board, and director James Quigley, saying they failed to appreciate or swiftly act on the bank's problems.
Counsel for Sloan did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Representatives for Wells Fargo and the Justice Department declined to comment. 
While Waters does not have the power to order a Justice Department probe or remove bank executives, the report threatens to taint more senior executives at the bank, which lost two CEOs and several senior managers to the scandal.
Her comments also indicate Duke, previously a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve board, will be in for a rough ride next Wednesday when she testifies alongside Quigley before Waters' panel, preceded by new CEO Charles Scharf on Tuesday.
On Wednesday evening, Waters released a report finding that the bank's leadership and its regulators failed for years to address long-running issues at the bank regarding its culture and sales practices.
The report also said Sloan wrongly testified in March 2019 that the bank was in compliance with a 2018 consent order issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) relating to mis-selling of mortgages and auto loans.
Emails between OCC staff later showed that the bank was not in compliance with one aspect of the order's customer remediation plan. On Wednesday, the OCC said it was confident it had the tools to ensure the bank fixes its problems.
In January, the OCC banned fined former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf $17.5 million to settle charges he failed to halt the misconduct and brought charges against eight other former executives. Wells Fargo has also paid out more than $7 billion in penalties related to the scandal since 2016. 

Over the past three years, the bank has taken various steps to fix the issues and rebuild trust with customers, investors and regulators. That includes changes to its board, centralizing risk teams and hiring a chief executive from outside the company.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>","Coronavirus, politics and trade compound problems for Airbus A330neo","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is battling to shore up support for its A330neo wide-body passenger jet as the coronavirus crisis, geopolitics and trade wars raise fresh questions over demand for the aircraft, industry sources said.
The response has included Airbus focusing on A330neo sales ahead of other models, pressing for Chinese sales in expectation of the country's eventual economic recovery while also trying to tie orders to sales of its smaller A321XLR jets, which are in higher demand.
The European planemaker trimmed A330 output in January to a little more than three a month, from about four a month in 2019, and has not ruled out reversing that in 2021, people close to the company said. After that, the picture is much less clear, with doubts over dozens of existing orders as the coronavirus crisis deepens.
""2020 represents the trough (in production),"" a person familiar with the program said.
Airbus shares fell 4% on Thursday after Bloomberg News reported that Airbus was considering production cuts, days after top buyer AirAsiaX (KL:AAX) said it wanted to defer orders.
""We gave guidance in February and we are closely monitoring the situation,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
Airbus last month said it was targeting 40 deliveries of A330 jets in 2020, down from 53 in 2019.
Industry sources said the long-stalled AirAsiaX order had been restructured and built into revised planning last year, when it was expanded from 66 aircraft to 78.
That latest tranche of 12 jets is seen as more deliverable than the earlier 66, one of the sources said. Others questioned whether the cash-strapped airline would take any of the jets.
Airbus launched the A330neo in 2014 promising an affordable, fuel-efficient successor to its 250 to 300-seat A330.
Financiers have said that rival Boeing (N:BA) cut prices of some of its 787s to counter the A330neo, the launch of which was also disrupted by a glut of large jets. Boeing officials have denied launching a price war.
STRATEGIC HEADACHE
Pressure mounted as AirAsiaX ran into financial problems and the collapse of a nuclear deal between Iran and the West scuppered another 28 orders. Together AirAsiaX and IranAir represent a third of the 292 undelivered jets on order.
Airbus has had a number of breakthroughs, however, including a recent sale to GECAS, the leasing affiliate of engine maker  General Electric  (N:GE). GECAS only very rarely jets powered by Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines, such as the A330neo.
But efforts to maintain that momentum are being undermined by market forces, analysts said, with Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa predicting that A330 deliveries will slide by a further 25% to 30 planes in 2021.
Losing the A330neo would present a strategic headache, making Airbus largely dependent on its A350-900 in the lucrative wide-body market. The smaller of two A350 versions already represents almost 50% of its wide-body order backlog.
Airbus has said that both the A330neo and larger A350-1000 will emerge strengthened as airlines renew fleets.
However, strategists also worry that A330neo problems could speed polarization in an industry in which Boeing dominates the wide-body segment and Airbus - buoyed by its A321XLR and the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX - leads the narrow-body field.
In a surprise bid to boost the program, Airbus recently struck a deal to sell 40 of its A330neo jets to troubled HNA Group's Hainan Airlines, Reuters China reported.
It appears to have gambled that Hainan would be bailed out or bought by stronger Chinese carriers, winning the A330neo a valuable place in their fleets, analysts said. HNA has asked for government help, but the outcome of the politically sensitive shake-up is far from clear.
Analysts say the cost of such deals can be high. One source said Airbus could lose as many as 23 orders for the A350 and five for the older A330ceo as part of the HNA restructuring.
Tusa said that leaves the A330neo's future largely in the hands of U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), which has been caught up in a separate political row.
Delta has ordered 35 jets but faces tariffs on the A330neo as part of a long-running trade battle between the United States and Europe. Delta had no immediate comment."

The All India Online Vendors Association filed the appeal at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2018 said that Flipkart and the local unit of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) did not breach anti-trust rules.
The NCLAT, in its order published on Thursday, said the ""CCI is directed to direct the Director General to cause an investigation"" into the matter.
It was not immediately clear how soon the CCI could start a probe.
The order is another headache for Flipkart, which along with Amazon's India unit has faced mounting criticism from brick-and-mortar retailers which accuse the firms of funding steep discounts and discriminating against small sellers.
Both companies have denied the allegations.
""It's a massive victory for all online sellers, since there is no ongoing probe against Flipkart,"" Chanakya Basa, a lawyer for AIOWA, told Reuters.
""This order could pave a way for other online sellers to take their grievances against online platforms to the CCI.""
A spokeswoman for Flipkart said the company was awaiting a copy of the order.
The CCI, in a separate case this year, ordered a probe into Amazon and Flipkart over an alleged violation of anti-trust law and discounting. That probe was stayed by a court order last month."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) has moved up to 100 staff from Madrid to a location just outside the city as part of its strategy to cope with the coronavirus outbreak and other Spanish banks, including  Bankia , (MC:BKIA) plan similar measures, bank officials said.
The European Central Bank has asked banks to review their contingency plans and across Europe, lenders are readying out-of-town offices and isolating teams to ensure they can keep trading if the coronavirus spreads in major financial centers.
BBVA employs 400 people at its trading floor at its Madrid headquarters. Around a quarter were being transferred as of Thursday to Las Rozas, a suburb 20 kms (12 miles) northwest of the city, a spokesman said.
""The measure consists of the relocation of 80-100 people in total to this new room from today,"" he said, adding that ""all critical functions are replicated on a smaller scale in this other room"".
Bankia also plans to protect operations from potential disruption and is working on moving some staff from its back and front-office departments to Las Rozas, while sending some employees to work from home, a spokeswoman said.
The areas affected would be mainly the trading floor, the IT department and cyber-securtiy, the spokeswoman for the state-owned lender said.
She did not give details of how many people would be affected, saying the plans were still being drawn up.
BBVA POSTPONES INVESTOR DAY, AGMs IN FOCUS
On Wednesday, BBVA postponed its Investor Day, scheduled to take place in Madrid on March 24, until further notice.
A spokesman said the bank was monitoring each day whether the situation would affect its annual shareholder meeting in Bilbao scheduled for March 13.
""The bank is considering different alternatives for its next shareholder meeting but for the moment it still stands as planned,"" the spokesman said.
On Thursday, Swiss tech firm Sherpany said online voting at annual shareholder meetings had jumped since the coronavirus outbreak as investors shunned large gatherings because of travel restrictions or fear of infection.
Shareholder meetings for other Spanish banks, such as Santander (MC:SAN), Bankia, Caixabank (MC:CABK), Sabadell (MC:SABE) and  Bankinter  (MC:BKT), were for now still expected during March and next month, the banks said.
BBVA has also prevented staff from going to high-risk areas, such as mainland China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Iran and northern Italy. The bank has also restricted travel elsewhere.
Other Spanish banks, such as Santander (MC:SAN) and Sabadell (MC:SABE), are following the situation and complying with the guidance from relevant authorities, including recommending employees avoid non-essential travel and meetings with a significant numbers of employees."
319,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 11:43AM ET</span>","Kroger's quarterly profit, sales top estimates on private-label strength","(Reuters) - U.S. supermarket chain  Kroger Co  (N:KR) topped fourth-quarter profit and sales estimates on Thursday, boosted by strong demand for its high-margin private-label brands, sending its shares up as much as 7.2%.
The company's shares touched a three-year high of $33.18, even as broader markets dipped as coronavirus fears hit California.
The company maintained its forecast for fiscal 2020, that excluded any impact from the global epidemic, which has infected thousands and killed over 3,000, including 11 in the United States.
Kroger has limited supply chain exposure in China and sources a majority of its products domestically, Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen said.
""It's really too early for us to have a sense of how customers' overall behavior will change and what the impact will be,"" Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip told analysts.
""I think you've seen more in response to the media activity and some of the advice out there in the market of customers starting to spend more on things like water and hand sanitizer, hand soap, paper.""
For the fourth quarter, the company was able to boost sales under its strategy to add a wide selection of high-margin private-label brands, which comprises everything from plant-based meats to its own line of seltzer waters at competitive prices.
As part of its ""Restock Kroger"" program, the supermarket chain is attempting to gain market share though improved sales by stocking more of its own brands on shelves, while also improving store layouts.
Kroger said its ""Our Brands"" private label saw its best year ever, with sales more than $23.1 billion in 2019.
It has also been improving delivery services and digital presence to compete better in a grocery space dominated by retail giants Walmart (N:WMT) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN).

The Wall Steet bank said sales and trading employees in London and New York would need to shift to other locations as a ""precautionary measure"" that would ensure ""seamless execution over time.""
The memo, sent by JPMorgan's head of sales Marc Badrichani and its head of trading Troy Rohrbaugh, said splitting the workforce into different locations would improve its ability to ""serve clients continuously while reducing the health risks associated with physical contact should a case arise.""
JPMorgan runs a disaster recovery site in Basingstoke and has an alternative building in central London near the Blackfriars bridge.

MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co (N:MMM) has avoided major supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak by sourcing materials for its protective face masks from regional suppliers instead of far-flung locations, a company official told Reuters.
More than 3,200 people have died from the fast-spreading coronavirus, which has reached more than 80 nations. It has spurred buying sprees on medical supplies like face masks, even as world health officials have warned that citizens generally do not need to buy such supplies, and that stockpiling by the public can put healthcare workers, who do need them, at risk. 
3M has ramped up testing and production of single-use N95 respirator masks, designed to filter 95% of airborne particles, along with more robust respiratory protective gear amid the coronavirus outbreak. 
So far, the company has not seen disruptions in production, Nikki McCullough, global lead for occupational health and safety at 3M, told Reuters at its global testing lab outside of Minneapolis, 
""If we start to see disruptions, we'll certainly work to alert our customers. At this point in time, we are able to manufacture and we are continuing at capacity for respirators,"" she said.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the coronavirus response team in the United States, said on Sunday that the U.S. government is seeking 35 million additional masks per month from 3M. Pence will visit the 3M facility on Thursday. 
3M produces all of the components of the filters in its N95 respirator masks in house but sources other materials from regional suppliers, including the straps and metal nose clips that hold the masks in pace, McCullough said.
""Since we have this regional manufacturing model, many of our items are coming regionally. And we're working with our supply partners very closely to monitor the situation,"" McCullough told Reuters.
The company is not currently under contract to produce the masks and is preparing to respond to the government's request, 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich said.
Demand for masks like the ones produced by 3M has outpaced supply as the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China, has spread. The outbreak has riled markets and disrupted global supply chains, largely in export-dependent China.
""The demand is outstripping capacity right now, and we're working 24/7 to ramp up and be able to meet as much of that demand as we can,"" CEO Michael Roman told investors at an industry conference last month.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services intends to buy 500 million N95 respirators over the next 18 months for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), the nation's supply of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's top court has recognized the right of an Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver to be considered an employee, a ruling that could upend the U.S. firm's business model and potentially require it to pay more taxes and benefits such as paid holidays. 
The decision by the Cour de Cassation could also have ramifications for France's wider ""gig economy"", as other taxi and food delivery apps from Deliveroo and Just Eat-Takeaway to UberEats rely heavily on self-employed riders to conduct their business without having to meet a range of employee costs and benefits. 
The Cour de Cassation upheld a previous decision by a court of appeal, saying the Uber driver could not qualify as a self-employed contractor because he could not build his own clientele or set his own prices, making him a subordinate of the company. 
""When connecting to the Uber digital platform, a relationship of subordination is established between the driver and the company,"" the court said in a statement.
""Hence, the driver does not provide services as a self-employed person, but as an employee.""
The decision could pave the way for other drivers to ask for a reclassification of their work relationship with Uber, which, under the current framework, does not pay a wide range of taxes that fund France's welfare system. 
""It's an entirely different business model (for Uber),"" said Cédric Jacquelet, a partner at Proskauer law firm in Paris. 
""It requires much more legal and human resources, at a much higher price,"" he added, saying that Uber might now review the conditions under which its drivers perform their service so that they can no longer claim to be employees. 
The decision also follows a series of legal challenges to Uber and similar companies from Brazil to Colombia and the United States itself.
California, where Uber is based, recently passed a law aimed making it harder for apps to classify their workers as independent contractors rather than employees..
""The ruling does not reflect the reasons why drivers choose to use Uber: the independence and freedom to work if, when and where they want,"" Uber said in a written statement. 

""Over the last two years we’ve made many changes to give drivers even more control over how they use Uber, alongside stronger social protections,"" it added, noting the court's decision would not lead to an automatic reclassification of drivers.

Collapse of U.K. Airline, IATA Warning Stoke Concern (7:20 a.m. NY)
The failure of Europe’s biggest regional airline and a dire revenue outlook from the industry’s leading trade group stoked concern that the impact of the coronavirus could trigger the collapse of weaker carriers around the world.

While the threat from the virus to Asian airlines has long been clear, its spread has unleashed concern that carriers once seen as safe may now be at risk.

The Federal Reserve’s emergency rate cut, the approval of an $8.3 billion spending bill for measures to tackle the virus in the U.S., and the supposedly market-friendly outcome of the Democratic primaries on ‘Super Tuesday’ were all quickly forgotten as more and more countries adopted travel restrictions and other emergency measures to contain the outbreak.
By 9:53 AM ET (1453 GMT), the Dow was down 764 points or 2.8%, while the S&P 500 was down 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.4%.
Airline stocks were once again in the thick of things, after a global industry body nearly quadrupled its estimate of how much the sector could lose in revenue this year due to the disease to $113 billion from $29 billion.
The International Air Travel Association said revenue losses at North American airlines could hit over $21 billion, while European airlines could lose double that.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock fell 5.0% after it warned of a $300 million hit to revenue in the first quarter alone.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock, meanwhile, fell 7.8% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock fell 5.5%, while United Airlines stock 7.6% and JetBlue stock fell 8.2%.
The shockwaves continued to pass through the rest of the travel sector, with traditional players such as hotel operator Marriott falling 4.6% and newer players such as Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com falling 4.7%.
On the upside, Zoom Video Communications stock rose 2.4%, bouncing from premarket losses of over 7%, as more people placed bets on a boom in remote meetings as a result of the collapse in business travel due to the virus.
Elsewhere, crude oil futures lost early gains amid doubts that OPEC can persuade Russia to sign up to a new output cut of 1.5 million barrels a day, while gold futures roared higher on a fresh wave of flows into haven assets.

326,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 09:31AM ET</span>","Coronavirus hit to airlines could top $100 billion, Flybe collapses","By Sarah Young and Aradhana Aravindan
LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The coronavirus epidemic could rob passenger airlines of up to $113 billion in revenue this year, an industry body warned on Thursday, more than three times a projection it made just two weeks ago as the virus continues to spread around the world.
The warning from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) came as British regional carrier Flybe became the first big casualty of the slump in travel demand due to the crisis.
Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) also scrapped its profit forecast for 2020, while U.S. budget carrier Southwest (N:LUV) predicted a $200-300 million hit to its first-quarter operating revenues.
""There are lots of airlines that have got relatively narrow profit margins and lots of debt, and a cash flow shock like this could certainly send some into a very difficult situation,"" IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce told a media event in Singapore. 
Airlines across the globe are rushing to cut flights and costs, and warning of a hit to earnings, as a new virus that started in China spreads, raising fears of a pandemic that could plunge the global economy into recession.
In a sign of the difficulties this is creating for airlines, a Turkish Airlines jet (IS:THYAO) was flown back to Istanbul without any passengers on board on Thursday on orders from Singapore after a passenger who had arrived on the same plane on Tuesday tested positive for the virus.
IATA projected the hit to passenger airlines in lost revenue from the crisis could be anywhere between $63 billion and $113 billion this year, depending on the virus's progression. On Feb. 20, it had forecast a hit of $29 billion.
The latest estimates equate to a drop of between 11% and 19% compared with its 2020 industry revenue forecast in December. 
IATA said its lower forecast was based on the virus being contained in current markets with over 100 cases as of March 2, while the higher estimate was based on a broader epidemic. Both scenarios assume there will be a recovery by late summer.
The COVID-19 virus has killed more than 3,000 people and infected tens of thousands more, mostly in China. But it has now spread to more than 60 other countries, leading to travel and other restrictions. 
South Korea, Italy, and Iran have been particularly badly affected. Germany, Japan, France, Spain, the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong have all reported more than 100 cases.
Among the latest events to be cancelled is the world air traffic management congress in Madrid, which had been scheduled for March 10-12. 
'INEVITABLE'
The failure of British regional airline Flybe comes less than two months after a rescue deal for the company was agreed by its owners and the UK government.
Despite its commitment to improving regional transport links, the British government backed away from that deal due to the scale of the hit to demand from the virus outbreak.
""All flights have been grounded and the UK business has ceased trading with immediate effect,"" Flybe said as it entered administration, a form of protection from creditors.
The failure of the airline, which has long struggled with losses, not only puts around 2,400 jobs at risk but could also see some regional UK airports struggle.
Flybe carried around eight million passengers a year between 81 airports and was owned by a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group (L:STOB) and Cyrus Capital.
Its collapse came a day after Ryanair (I:RYA) CEO Michael O'Leary told Reuters it was ""inevitable"" the coronavirus crisis would lead to airline bankruptcies.
CANCELLATIONS
Norwegian Air (OL:NWC), a pioneer of low-cost transatlantic travel, has also been struggling for years due to cut-throat competition and heavy debts built up during rapid expansion.
The company, which has repeatedly raised cash from shareholders to stay in business, said on Thursday it was scrapping its 2020 earnings guidance, which had predicted a return to profit after three years of losses, due to the drop in travel demand and disruption caused by the virus.
It also said it would cancel 22 long-haul flights between Europe and the United States from March 28 to May 5, with routes from Rome to Los Angeles, Boston and New York seeing a reduced number of departures.
Norwegian shares, which have lost more than 50% of their value this year, were down almost 7% at 1130 GMT.
Analysts say few airlines are likely to remain unscathed, as both business and tourist travel is being affected. 
The Global Business Travel Association said last week the crisis could scythe $560 billion from spending on corporate travel this year, a 37% drop from its 2020 global expenditure forecast, as meetings and events are cancelled and companies limit travel to protect employees.
Data provider ForwardKeys said on Thursday new flight bookings to Europe from elsewhere in the world fell by 79% in the last week of February, as the virus took hold in popular tourist destinations such as Italy.

""The drop-off in bookings to Italy is even worse than we have observed in the past for some of the most disruptive events such as terror attacks,"" ForwardKeys Vice President Insights Olivier Ponti said.

Shares of the company fell about 3% premarket, with those of bigger rivals United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL),  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Delta Airline Holdings (N:DAL) falling about the same.
Southwest said it has seen a significant rise in ticket cancellations and decline in traffic due to the epidemic, which has killed over 3,000 people and caused airlines across the world to cut flights and implement cost controls.
United Airlines on Wednesday suspended its full-year forecast over the outbreak and said it would cut 20% of international flights and 10% of U.S. flights in April as it launched a hiring freeze, voluntary unpaid leaves and delayed salary increases for executives. 
Concerns over the still largely unknown impact of the virus led top executives from Southwest, United Airlines, American Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday. 
Trump said the executives did not ask for any financial assistance to make up for the hit to their businesses.
Southwest said it now expects first-quarter total revenue per available seat mile - a closely followed measure of airline performance - to be down 2% to up 1%, compared with a 3.5% to 5.5% growth it forecast earlier.

It said it expected operating revenue to take a $200 million to $300 million hit. The company's total operating revenue for the first quarter last year was $5.15 billion.

The losses in premarket trade came  a day after the Dow and the S&P 500 surged more than 4% as former Vice President Joe Biden's strong showing in the Super Tuesday Democratic primary contests powered a jump in healthcare stocks, and upbeat economic data soothed worries about the impact of the spreading coronavirus outbreak.
Stocks had also been boosted after the U.S. House of Representatives approved an $8.3 billion funding bill to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The emergency legislation followed a surprise rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday.
But markets resumed their selloff on Thursday as cases of the coronavirus surged in the U.S., leading California to declare a state-wide emergency.
The coronavirus epidemic showed no signs of slowing, with deaths mounting globally.
""There is little doubt that the COVID-19 outbreak will slow global growth considerably this quarter, and we expect it to actually produce a rare non-recessionary contraction in GDP,"" said JPMorgan economist Joseph Lupton.
A steady stream of corporate warnings about the impact of the outbreak reminded markets of the limitations of policy measures such as interest rate cuts.
Shares in Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) were down around 3% in premarket trade after the budget carrier warned its first-quarter operating revenue would take a hit of up to $300 million from the virus, prompting it to cut its quarterly revenue outlook.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - PetroChina (SS:601857) has suspended some natural gas imports, including on liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments and on gas imported via pipelines, as a seasonal plunge in demand adds to the impact on consumption from the coronavirus outbreak.
The company issued the force majeure notice to suppliers of piped gas and also to at least one LNG supplier, though details of the force majeure notice could not immediately be confirmed. 
PetroChina, China's top gas producer and piped gas supplier, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A spokesman for state firm KazTransGas which handles gas exports had no immediate comment while Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) could not immediately be reached for comment.
A spokesman for Uzbekistan state energy firm Uzbekneftegaz had no immediate comment. Turkmenistan’s gas exporter Turkmenneftegaz could not immediately be reached for comment.
A Turkmen government source said he was not aware of the force majeure. “If this is the case, we hope this measure will be short-term and will not affect long-term, strategic and mutually beneficial Turkmen-Chinese partnership in the gas sector”. 
China is one of the world's top gas and LNG importers, so any cancellation of purchase is expected to have a big impact on prices, traders said. 
Force majeure is a clause in contracts, typically referring to unexpected external circumstances that prevent a party to a contract from meeting their obligations.
PetroChina meets 40% of its total gas needs through imports and about 70% of imports are through piped gas from central Asia, Myanmar and Russia while the rest are through LNG, one of the sources said. 
""The supply cuts will fall on suppliers proportionately but LNG suppliers will have a lesser impact versus those on piped gas,"" said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the situation. 
It was not immediately clear what volumes PetroChina had declared force majeure on or the time period the notice covers.
But one major LNG supplier to the Chinese company told Reuters that PetroChina had requested some cargoes be deferred to the third quarter instead. 
For piped gas, PetroChina will likely ask for a cut in daily nominations, the first source said. 
PetroChina has long-term LNG import contracts with QatarGas, Gorgon LNG in Australia, U.S. firm Cheniere Energy (A:LNG), Papua New Guinea LNG plant as well as an equity stake in Russia's Yamal project in the Arctic where it lifts cargoes from.
China's Sinopec (SS:600028) also supplies PetroChina during the colder months from mid-November to mid-March under a state-mandated ""inter-connected"" supply scheme.
The source said senior PetroChina officials recently spoke on phone with Qatari energy officials explaining the demand situation, during which Qatar had pledged to cooperate as much as possible.
""PetroChina has done its best over the past month to mitigate the virus impact, including diverting cargoes to India and Singapore, and tried not to issue such a notice,"" the source said.
""But unlike CNOOC (which sent a notice earlier) which may see demand slowing recovering, PetroChina is grappling with a sharp seasonal demand fall from mid-March (for piped gas) when the heating season ends.""
Last month, the country's top LNG importer China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) suspended contracts with at least three suppliers, which drove spot LNG prices to a record low. 
""Demand is down the hill, especially from mid-March as all the boilers for heating are going to be switched off, while gas consumption from retail users like restaurants and hotels are barely visible yet,"" said an executive at one of the north-China based gas receiving terminals operated by PetroChina.

The executive said the operating rate at the regasification terminal in northern China, currently at 30 million cubic metres per day, will fall sharply in the second half of this month as demand drops.

""We've conducted a what-if scenario analysis that assumes a short-term drop in growth of 2 percentage points and a risk-premium increase of 2 percentage points,"" Thomas Verbraken, executive director at MSCI's risk management solutions research told clients.
""Our model indicates that, in such a scenario, there's room for further short-term losses: U.S. equities — already down 11% from Feb. 19 through March 3 — could drop a further 11%.""
Verbraken said that if the global economy suffered only short-term pain, the market could bounce back. However, a hit to long-term growth trajectory which would also impact corporate earnings due to the pandemic could be felt over a much longer horizon."

Investing.com -- Airline stocks came under fresh pressure again on Thursday as the International Air Transport Association appealed for government help for the industry as it sharply raised its assessment of the economic hit to be expected from the coronavirus.
The IATA said in a statement that it now sees total revenue losses this year for the industry as high as $113 billion - nearly four times its previous estimate of $29 billion.
 
European airline stocks tumbled again on the update, with Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) falling 8.1% and IAG (LON:ICAG), the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, losing 4.0% by 5:40 AM ET (1040 GMT).

337,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 05:26AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Continental, ITV Warnings Show the Limits of Rate Cuts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It doesn’t take much to remind markets that central banks can’t stop the coronavirus damaging the world economy on their own.
Fear of Missing Out - which was the dominant theme during Wednesday's post-Fed bounce - gave way again on Thursday to Fear, pure and simple, amid new warnings from various sectors of the economy about the inevitable impact of the disease on their business.
German auto parts supplier   Continental AG   (DE:CONG) said it expects the global passenger car market to shrink by as much as 5% this year, as the virus compounds existing problems caused by trade conflicts, technological change and tighter emissions regulations.
Chief executive Wolfgang Schaefer told a press conference that world car output could shrink as much as 10% on the year in the current quarter due to the closure of factories in China and elsewhere. Chinese production alone will fall by “at least 30%” year-on-year this quarter, he added.
Continental stock dropped 10.1% on the news, making it the worst performer in the DAX and putting it on course for its worst day in over 18 months. The news also dragged down sector rivals: Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p) stock fell 4.2% and   Valeo   (PA:VLOF) stock fell 4.0%.
As for the rebound that many are pinning their hopes on – Schaefer wasn’t too encouraging there either. He expects Conti’s annual revenue to fall over 2% from 2019 levels, and its operating margin to be in a range between 5.5% and 6.5%, a full percentage point below consensus.
Continental, like many others in the sector, already has problems aplenty with the transition from internal combustion engines to battery-powered vehicles, a process that renders many of its components businesses obsolete. Schaefer indicated that the company will have to take further cost-cutting measures, telling investors that they could expect an update by May.
The company had already said in September that it may have to cut as many as 20,000 jobs, or 8% of its global workforce.
Continental wasn’t the only voice warning on Thursday. U.K. broadcaster   ITV   (LON:ITV) said it expected a 10% drop in advertising revenue in April as travel companies rein in spending, aware that no amount of advertising can outweigh the negative publicity generated by such cases as the Diamond Princess, the ship on which more than 700 passengers caught the disease during an Asian cruise. At least six passengers are known to have died.
Elsewhere, Italian soccer club Juventus (MI:JUVE) fell another 2.4% after the Italian government said it would temporarily ban spectators from major sports events. It’s fallen 10% in the last week, in line with Geman rival Borussia Dortmund (DE:BVB), whose location in the region most affected by the virus has prompted fears of a similar disruption to ticket sales.
By 5:25 AM ET (1025 GMT), the Stoxx 600 was down 0.9 points or 0.2% at 385.96, while the DAX was down 1.4% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 1.8%."

(Reuters) - European shares headed lower on Thursday, as a slump in British stocks and profit warnings from several companies soured market sentiment even after central banks this week tried to ease the blow of the coronavirus outbreak on global growth.
The main European equity benchmark (STOXX) reversed early gains to trade down 0.8%.
London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) fell 1.3%, with several companies including  Evraz  Plc (L:EVRE)  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO),  Persimmon  (L:PSN) and BHP (L:BHPB) sliding as they traded ex-dividend. (L)
Among euro zone stocks, German auto supplier Continental (DE:CONG) slumped 10.5% after it posted a net loss of 1.2 billion euros ($1.34 billion) in 2019, as it suffered from a global downturn in demand for passenger cars.
The broader automakers index (SXAP) dropped 2.2%, while miners (SXPP) fell 2.8%, leading declines among the STOXX 600 subsectors.
Airbus shares (PA:AIR) fell 2.8% after Bloomberg reported the company was considering a cut in production of the A330neo jet after its biggest customer deferred deliveries due to a slump in travel demand.
In a sign of deep damage to the travel industry, British regional airline Flybe collapsed, making the struggling carrier the industry's first big casualty of the outbreak.
Following late February's rout that pushed European markets into correction territory, markets stabilised somewhat this week as investors were hopeful stimulus measures from governments and central banks would protect the global economy.
Analysts firmly expect the European Central Bank to cut interest rates by 10 basis points next week, joining the U.S. Federal Reserve and its peers in Canada and Australia in reducing borrowing costs.
""The Fed has some room to ease further, but Europe doesn't have a lot of room,"" said Artur Baluszynski, head of research at Henderson Rowe.
""If we see a round of disappointing earnings or outlooks this earnings season, we might see markets moving from the narrative of 'we need easy money' to 'we need some serious fiscal stimulus'"".
The outbreak shows little signs of peaking globally, with Italy closing all schools and California declaring a state of emergency.
Ratings agency S&P Global halved its eurozone growth forecast for the year to 0.5% from 1% on Wednesday and predicted a 0.3% contraction for hard hit Italy.
British commercial broadcaster  ITV  (L:ITV) fell 9.0% after warning that ad revenue for April could fall by about 10% as travel companies deferred campaigns.
German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media (DE:PSMGn) dropped 10.5% after saying its e-commerce arm NuCom would buy U.S. dating app developer Meet Group Inc (O:MEET).
Among stocks in the black was science and technology company Merck KGaA (DE:MRCG), rising 2.8% after it forecast ""strong"" growth core earnings for 2020."

  Kingfisher   Plc's (LON:KGF) demotion from the FTSE 100 index provides the latest sign of the mounting challenges facing Britain’s traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.
The owner of Britain’s B&Q and France’s Castorama chains will join former U.K. retail bellwether Marks and Spencer Group Plc (LON:MKS) in the mid-cap FTSE 250 Index, FTSE Russell announced Wednesday after markets closed. NMC Health Plc (LON:NMC) and TUI AG (DE:TUIGn) were also relegated from the FTSE 100, with   Fresnillo   Plc (LON:FRES), Intermediate Capital Group Plc and Pennon Group Plc being promoted.
Like Marks & Spencer, demoted from the benchmark index six months ago, Kingfisher has seen its share price slide over the last five years. Increasing competition from online and discount retailers and an onerous property market continue to make life tough for many of the sector’s stalwarts, who now also have to contend with the impact of the coronavirus. Where retailers had a 6.2% weighting in the FTSE 100 back in 2007, that has now fallen to 3.4%, or just 2.6% for brick-and-mortar retailers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“More and more retail-based companies are being edged out of the FTSE 100, simply because it’s the way the markets are moving,” Helal Miah, an analyst at The Share Centre, said by phone. “Structurally, we’re not shopping on the high street as much, we’re preferring to do things online. And for the supermarkets it’s just this incessant competition from the German discounters.”
Miah sees retailers becoming an even smaller part of the benchmark gauge in future, to be replaced by financials, property and services businesses. With a market value of 4.4 billion pounds ($5.7 billion), Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc hadn’t been far away from losing its spot this time, while grocery rival J Sainsbury Plc is also toward the lower end of the FTSE 100 by market value.
The changing face of retailing is illustrated by stocks that have recently arrived in the benchmark index: online grocer Ocado Group Plc joined the gauge in June 2018, while sneaker seller JD Sports Fashion Plc gained FTSE 100 promotion a year later. Restaurant delivery firm Just Eat Plc, now known as Just Eat Takeaway following last year’s merger, first entered in late 2017.
“There is a clear point to be made about technology,” Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, said by email. “That is the real lesson -- that even in retail you need to be a technology leader in order to thrive, you cannot just sit back on your bricks-and-mortar sales and hope online will magically work.”"

S&P 500 index futures contracts expiring in March slid 1.3% at 8:50 a.m. in London. Contracts dropped 1.2% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 1.1% for the Nasdaq 100.
In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index erased earlier gains of as much as 0.7% to trade little changed as cyclical sectors slid, with miners, carmakers and banks dropping the most.
“A sense of caution remains on top of investors’ minds as the virus situation continues to escalate in North America,” said Margaret Yang, a strategist at CMC Markets Singapore. “The Fed cut effect is fading and can be overtaken by virus concern.”
California has declared a state of emergency to give authorities greater leeway in combating the coronavirus, while the death toll from the disease surpassed 3,000 in China.
The S&P 500 had surged into the close Wednesday, nearly matching Monday’s rally that was the best in 14 months. Health-care firms led the spike, rising the most since November 2008, as the weak performance in Tuesday’s primaries by Bernie Sanders dented the threat of policies that would upend the industry.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell again on Thursday, taking their cue from U.S. equity futures, which implied a lower open for Wall Street as cases of the coronavirus surged in the U.S.
European markets snapped a three-day winning streak. Frankfurt and Paris fell 0.3% and Milan, which is at the heart of Europe's coronavirus outbreak, and London slipped 0.5% as evidence mounted of the damage the coronavirus outbreak was inflicting.
Futures for U.S. stocks pointed to more pain ahead. E-Minis for the S&P 500 fell 0.6% after California declared a state of emergency as coronavirus cases increased.

U.S. stocks soared after the U.S. House of Representatives approved an $8.3 billion funding bill to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The emergency legislation followed a surprise rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday.
Wall Street also seemed to find relief in Joe Biden's performance in the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden is considered less likely to raise taxes and impose new regulations than rival Bernie Sanders.

The Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada have both responded by cutting interest rates by 50 basis points. Markets in the euro zone are pricing in a 90% chance that the European Central Bank will cut its deposit rate, now minus 0.50%, by 10 basis points next week.
""We have to get past the threshold where COVID-19 shifts from panic to headline exhaustion and subsequent news on it becomes more and more of a fade,"" Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets. ""Then risk assets can move higher in earnest.""
Ten-year Treasury yields fell below 1% again before recovering. Yields had fallen for 10 straight days, the longest slide in at least a generation.
The dollar held steady, with the euro dropping back to $1.1137 from a two-month high of $1.1212 earlier in the week.
The dollar stood at 107.28 yen, up from a five-month low of 106.84. The dollar index held steady at 97.329.

EasyJet (L:EZJ) said in November it would become the first major airline to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across its whole network through offsetting of its flights.
Meanwhile, British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) has said it will carbon-offset its domestic flights, with international airlines collectively counting on a global carbon offsetting plan to cap CO2 emissions from air travel at 2020 levels.
Finnair said most of its emission cuts would be achieved through compensation but it will partner up with Finnish biofuels producer Neste (HE:NESTE) to gradually increase the use of biofuel to 10 million euros annually by the end of 2025.
""The oil price has come down quite significantly just recently, as has the price of kerosene so at the moment biofuel is as much as 4 to 5 times more expensive than normal aviation kerosene but this is an exceptional situation,"" Finnair chief executive Topi Manner told a news conference in Helsinki, referring to price cuts caused by the coronavirus epidemic.
The airline's other efforts to cut emissions include a 3.5 to 4 billion euro investment by 2025 in a new fleet in order to cut carbon emissions in its European traffic by 10 to 15% and an additional investment of 60 million euros ""in sustainability"" between 2020 and 2025, it said.
Finnair said it was going to reduce the weight of its planes to cut emissions by 15,000 tonnes per year, including ending in-flight travel retail sales within the EU by the end of April to focus on pre-order sales only.
By the end of 2020, it will introduce an optional biofuel ticket for passengers who wish to cut their carbon footprint."

LONDON (Reuters) - British regional airline Flybe collapsed on Thursday after a plunge in travel demand, making the long-struggling carrier one of the first big corporate casualties of the coronavirus outbreak.
The failure of an airline that connects all corners of the United Kingdom with major European destinations not only puts around 2,400 jobs at risk but could also see some airports struggle and regional economies hit. 
""All flights have been grounded and the UK business has ceased trading with immediate effect,"" Flybe said after the government walked away from a rescue package agreed in January.
Airlines around the world have been cancelling flights and warning of a hit to profitability after coronavirus first emerged in China, hitting flights across Asia, before it spread to Europe and beyond.
British Airways (L:ICAG), easyJet (L:EZJ), Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) and United Airlines (O:UAL) are among those warning on the impact of a virus that looks set to hit the industry harder than the 2003 SARS outbreak. 
Flybe's collapse will also cause more problems for Prime Minister Boris Johnson who had promised to ""level up"" Britain by investing in regional transport links.
His government had agreed a rescue deal for the 41-year-old airline in January, saying it was important to maintain connections across the country for its eight million passengers. It said on Thursday there was nothing more it could do.
""We are also urgently working with industry to identify how key routes can be re-established by other airlines as soon as possible,"" Transport Minister Grant Shapps said.
Flybe, the largest independent regional airline in Europe, operated between 81 airports and was owned by Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group (L:STOB) and Cyrus Capital.
The owners said they had plowed more than 135 million pounds ($174 million) into the business in the last 14 months, including around 25 million pounds pledged in January.
FINANCIAL TROUBLE 
January's rescue deal had seen the government agree to match the owners' support for Flybe with a potential loan, a deferral of taxes and a review of local flight tax rules.
That briefly formed part of Johnson's plan to try to boost the regions of Britain beyond London. Without Flybe though, some regional airports like Exeter, Birmingham and Southampton will have much poorer connections. 
However, rival airlines complained that the state should not prop up failing companies and environmental campaigners argued any move to reduce the cost of flying did not fit with the government's aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
Flybe's 68 aircraft flew to airports including Belfast City in Northern Ireland, Jersey in the Channel Islands, Birmingham in central England and Scotland's Inverness and provided more than half of UK domestic flights outside London. 
The pilot's union said airline staff had been betrayed by the owners and the government. 
In a sign of the ripple effect the virus can have, Britain's biggest commercial free-to-air broadcaster  ITV  (L:ITV) warned on Thursday its advertising revenue had already been hit by travel companies pulling spending. 
Stobart and Virgin Atlantic said they were deeply disappointed with the outcome. 
""Sadly, despite the efforts of all involved to turn the airline around, not least the people of Flybe, the impact of COVID-19 on Flybe's trading means that the consortium can no longer commit to continued financial support,"" they said.
It is the second major British airline to go bust in six months after the world's oldest travel firm Thomas Cook collapsed in September, stranding hundreds of thousands of passengers and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history. 

The country's broader airline strategy was also thrown into disarray last week when a court ruled a plan to expand Europe's biggest airport Heathrow was unlawful.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Aviva  (L:AV) shares jumped on Thursday as the life and general insurer posted a record profit in its first year under chief executive Maurice Tulloch, although he said coronavirus added uncertainty to the outlook.
The insurer has received around 500 travel insurance claims related to the coronavirus so far and paid out around 500,000 pounds ($644,750), its executives said.
Tulloch said the coronavirus epidemic ""presents a new uncertainty in 2020"".
The Aviva insider took over a year ago and has shied away from radical change to the business, which offers life and general insurance and has operations in Europe, Canada and Asia as well as Britain.
Operating profit rose 6% to 3.2 billion pounds ($4.12 billion), slightly above forecasts, on strong performance across the board, though profits in the UK life business dipped.
""There is still much to do,"" Tulloch told a media call.
""We will improve business performance further...with discipline on expenses and underwriting.""
KBW analysts said the results were ""positive"", reiterating their market perform rating on the stock. Aviva's shares rose 4.3% to 365 pence per share at 0845 GMT, at the top of the FTSE 100 (FTSE).

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is planning to backstop its growing electronics sector by arranging to airlift components from China, three government officials said, as it tries to contain the fallout from the coronavirus crisis in China.
India's federal technology ministry has asked electronics and smartphone industry lobby groups to draw up a list of components made in China which then can be airlifted, two of the officials said. China is slowly getting back to work after an extended shutdown, but it is still grappling with a range of production and logistics delays.
Electronics manufacturing, especially the assembly of smartphones, is a bright spot for India's otherwise flagging economy. But the country is still highly dependent on China for components such as camera modules and display screens.
The emergency airlift plans underscore the interconnected nature of global supply chains and the continued dependence on China for key goods even as some manufacturers - prompted in some cases by the U.S.-China trade war - move to build up capacity outside of China.
Other industries are also exploring airfreight options.
The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India has reached out to its members to assess which parts are in short supply and can potentially be air-lifted, according to a source aware of the matter. India's auto industry relies heavily on China for parts such as electronic components, pressure sensors and fuel injectors.
India's embassy in China is also helping coordinate an airlift of drug ingredients from China, said a government adviser with direct knowledge of the matter.
For the electronics and smartphone components, the technology ministry ""is in touch with aviation carriers and air freighters and they've been connected with the industry,"" one of the government sources said.
The airlifting of components from the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Shanghai is one option being discussed, the official said.
The sources did not say when the airlifting might begin. The aviation ministry did not immediately respond a request for comment.
Lack of truck drivers, a proliferation of road checkpoints and a shortage of workers at Chinese ports have slowed shipments even for parts that are still being produced, Reuters has reported. Air cargo firms have also reduced services in response to crew health concerns and uncertain demand.
China is India's biggest trading partner, but India's imports of Chinese goods contracted in February to their lowest levels in nearly four years, trade ministry data reviewed by Reuters showed.
SCRAMBLING IN INDIA
Smartphone makers in India thus far have largely weathered the virus crisis, partly because they had built up inventories of Chinese-made parts to cover the Lunar New Year holiday period when China's factories close down.
But those stocks could dry up soon. S.N. Rai, the co-founder of homegrown smartphone maker Lava, said the supply of some components had resumed, but the pace of production at his factory on the outskirts of New Delhi could soon slow down.
""The period between March 10 and March 20 is going to be very tough,"" Rai told Reuters. ""In the absence of supplies, we might have to cut one or two of the three eight-hour shifts we have daily.""
Others are scrambling for components too.
The India units of contract manufacturers  Wistron Corp  (TW:3231), which makes some of Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) lower-priced iPhones, and Flex Ltd (O:FLEX) have, through an industry body, asked for government help in securing components including camera modules and displays from China, according to two industry sources.
Wistron and Flex did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Chinese smartphone makers Oppo and Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) did not respond to requests seeking comment on their supply chains."

Investing.com -- European stock markets quickly lost early gains on Thursday, as the widening impact of the coronavirus on public life in the short term muted optimism about stimulus measures coming down the line.
By 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was flat at 386.27 points. The German DAX was down 0.3% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.8%.
Strong gains overnight in the U.S. and Asia were quickly forgotten as companies ranging from TV broadcasters to auto suppliers and fashion houses warned of substantial hits to their business this year from the disease. 
Auto components group Continental (NYSE:CLR) said it expected margins this year to be a full percentage point below consensus forecasts due to demand weakness tied to the outbreak, while German fashion chain   Hugo Boss   (DE:BOSSn) said it doesn’t expect business to return to normal before the middle of the year.
U.K. broadcaster   ITV   (LON:ITV) meanwhile said it expected a 10% drop in advertising revenue in April, a consequence of travel companies tightening their purse strings in the face of collapsing demand.
Those warnings followed on the heels of increasingly drastic measures in Europe to stop the spread of the virus, notably Italy's decision on Wednesday to close its schools for two weeks and ban spectators from major sporting events. 
The mood also reflects concern at the spread of the virus in the U.S. and its impact on the world's biggest economy. The state of California declared a state of emergency on Wednesday after registering its first death, while the withdrawal of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has made the cancellation of the SXSW festival in Austin later this month more likely than ever.

LONDON (Reuters) - Switzerland's UBS (S:UBSG) said the value of its 'sustainable' investments rose by more than 50% to nearly $500 billion in 2019, while lending to the energy and utilities sectors fell by 40% as it tightened its rules.
UBS, which has assets of more than 3.6 trillion Swiss francs ($3.76 trillion) and invests for some of the world's richest individuals, has increasingly looked to carve out a market-leading position in sustainable investing.
That comes as policymakers and regulators push financial institutions to do more to help accelerate a global push to a low-carbon economy and meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, tackling poverty and other global challenges.
""As the world's largest truly global wealth manager, we have a responsibility to take a leading role in shaping a positive future for everyone, including future generations,"" UBS Chairman Axel Weber said in a statement.
""We aim to be the financial provider of choice for clients who want to engage toward the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) while helping achieve an orderly transition to a low-carbon economy.""
What counts as 'sustainable' varies across institutions, but can range from simply reflecting environmental, social and governance-related risks in the investment process, to 'impact investing', backing projects aiming to provide a measurable positive impact on society.
UBS defines all of these as 'core' sustainable investments and said they had collectively risen to $488 billion by the end of the year, or 13.5% of total invested assets, up from $312.9 billion a year earlier.
The value of equity and debt capital market deals and financial advisory services linked to climate change mitigation and adaptation hit $87.2 billion in 2019, up from $56.5 billion in 2018.
Bank lending to the energy and utilities sectors fell more than 40% to $1.9 billion in 2019, equivalent to just 0.8% of its total gross banking products exposure, down from 1.6% at the end of 2018.
Since the end of the year, UBS said it had further toughened its guidelines for lending to the sector, including not financing new greenfield thermal coal mines, offshore oil projects in the Arctic or greenfield oil sands projects.
It would also only provide financing to companies with greater than 30% of reserves or production in Arctic oil and/or oil sands if the money was to be used on renewable energy or conventional oil and gas assets.
Transactions linked to Liquefied Natural Gas infrastructure and ultra-deepwater drilling, meanwhile, would face enhanced environmental and social due diligence, the bank said.
Corporate lending to climate-sensitive sectors was $37.6 billion in 2019, or some 15.5% of the group's total $242.6 billion in lending, with the biggest slice of that, $15 billion, for the real estate sector."

Israel on Wednesday ordered travelers arriving from Germany, France, Spain, Austria and Switzerland to return home into home quarantine over coronavirus concerns.
""At this stage the company cannot estimate the extent of this impact,"" Israel's flag carrier said in a regulatory filing.
The Israeli government measure effectively cut off foreign tourism from those countries, whose citizens, the Health Ministry said, would not be allowed into Israel unless they could show they had made quarantine arrangements ahead of time.
Israel has already imposed the edict with regard to flights from Italy, China, Thailand and Singapore.
El Al said on Wednesday before the latest restrictions were announced that it was laying off 1,000 of its 6,000 employees and cutting salaries of top management as it struggles to cope with the impact of the global coronavirus outbreak.
Last week, El Al warned of an expected loss in revenue of $50-$70 million in the January-April period due to coronavirus and it has suspended or cut back on many of its flights to Asia and Europe."

Hugo Boss said it expects a gradual normalisation by the middle of the year, but it still foresees a major hit to 2020 results. It forecast currency-adjusted sales will rise from zero to 2% in the full year, including a single digit decline in Asia/Pacific.
Asia/Pacific accounted for 15% of sales in 2019, making Hugo Boss less exposed than other luxury brands like  Burberry  (L:BRBY), but the region had been its biggest growth driver, expanding 5% in 2019 and at double-digit rates in mainland China.
After a very encouraging start to the year in the region, Hugo Boss now expects significant sales losses as more than half its 150 points of sale in China have been closed since the end of January, with shopper traffic well down at those still open.
It added it was currently recording a ""noticeable decline"" in sales in other key markets.
It forecast 2020 earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) to come in at 320 million-350 million euros ($356-390 million) after a 4% fall to 333 million in 2019 as it invested in sprucing up its store network.

Hugo Boss cut its 2019 earnings forecast in October, citing weak demand in the United States and Hong Kong, but it then went on to report better than expected fourth-quarter sales growth, helped by strong demand online and at its renovated stores.

352,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 01:55AM ET</span>","Lego CEO Undaunted by Virus Fear, Sees 60% More China Shops","(Bloomberg) -- The chief executive of Lego A/S says the novel coronavirus only represents a short-term blow to China’s economy that won’t change the toymaker’s expansion plans in its fastest growing market.
Lego reported record sales on Wednesday and said growth in 2020 will once again be led by China. It’s targeting almost 60% more stores there this year, bringing the number to 220.
“Despite any challenges there may be, we expect to be able to reach that number,” CEO Niels B. Christiansen said in a phone interview on Wednesday. “We’re family owned, which gives us the ability to plan long term and focus on the investments that will help in the future.”
The situation in China creates “some short-term uncertainties, but it doesn’t change the long-term strategy with our investments” in the country, he said.
The coronavirus has already triggered mass panic, as its potential to disrupt trade feeds a market sell-off. In response, central banks have started adding emergency stimulus, amid warnings that the virus will dent global growth.
The Lego CEO says it’s too early to judge how the virus will affect 2020 sales. The company will continue to rely on its so-called branded stores to draw in crowds of customers in new cities, a model the CEO says tends to result in a bump from all other sales channels.
GLOBAL INSIGHT: Virus to Drag China GDP to 1.2%, Send Shock
For now, China is dealing with more than 80,000 cases of coronavirus, with the outbreak shuttering shopping malls and emptying streets as the authorities urge residents to stay at home.
But Christiansen points out that just because shoppers aren’t going to stores doesn’t mean they’re not still buying, given the ubiquitousness of online commerce.
“In the short term, there may be a shift in where we sell,” he said. “This is what typically occurs and we’re well positioned when it happens. We’re always trying to move our sale to the channel where we see the demand.”

For Lego, committing to China is a question a simple demographic logic. “By 2032, 90% of the world’s two billion children will live outside Europe and North America, with more than three quarters of these living in Eastern Asia. As a result, we are stepping up investment in the growth markets of tomorrow,” the company said in its annual report. It’s a strategy that has so far fed record revenue growth.
Earlier this year, Lego briefly closed its China office, as well as its factory in Jiaxing. But both have since been opened again, Christiansen said. Lego’s factory in China mainly serves the Asian market. Lego also has a Mexican site that produces for the Americas. On top of that, the company has factories in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Denmark for its European stores.
“We have the advantage over some of our competitors that we have a more flexible supply chain,” the CEO said. “Because the products are the same, we can use some factories to help in other regions, if capacity is needed.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday announced proposals making it easier for firms to raise capital via online platforms before they meet a requirement to register with the agency - a lengthy and costly process.
The SEC hopes the changes to so-called crowdfunding rules would allow smaller companies to access more capital before deciding to go public. However, they may raise worries among some investor advocates who say the current, stricter rules are not enough to encourage robust disclosure.
Under the measures, which are subject to public consultation, the SEC will allow firms to raise $5 million online, rather than the current $1 million, before they have to register.
In a statement, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said the measures aimed ""to address the gaps and complexities in the offering framework that may impede access to capital for issuers.""
The 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act empowered the SEC to create a regulatory regime for crowdfunding. It also relaxed securities regulations to help encourage small companies to go public with the idea of boosting the economy following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.
Wednesday's measures would also raise the maximum share offering limit over a single year to $70 million from $50 million for small firms that qualify under a registration exemption known as Regulation A.
The proposal would further permit issuers to advertise as a means of sounding out prospective investors before deciding whether to register with the SEC for any exemption they may use for the sale of private securities.
The SEC and industry lawyers say the existing JOBS Act exemptions are under-used and that the SEC's proposed revisions would hopefully make them more appealing to a new swath of companies and investors.
""The SEC's proposed regulation to make it easier for companies to raise capital in the private markets represent an opportunity to get some real changes made to enhance capital formation and give retail investors more opportunities to invest in startups,"" Dina Ellis Rochkind of the New York law firm Paul Hastings LLP said in an email."

The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee released the findings of its year-long probe into the bank ahead of hearings next week that will see its new chief executive, Charles Scharf, and its chair, Betsy Duke, testify before the committee for the first time. 
Drawing on internal emails and meeting notes, the report paints a picture of a complacent Wells Fargo board and management who did not take seriously settlements the bank agreed with federal regulators between 2016 and 2018 to resolve charges it had abused customers. 
A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said the bank was reviewing the report.
Specifically, according to the report, Wells Fargo's board of directors allowed management to repeatedly submit materially deficient plans to regulators in response to the consent orders. The report said the regulators, for their part, failed to hold Wells Fargo accountable for its wrongdoing.
The report also says former Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan gave ""inaccurate and misleading testimony"" to Congress during a March 2019 committee hearing when he said the bank was in compliance with a 2018 consent order issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) relating to mis-selling of mortgages and auto loans.
Emails between OCC staff-members late showed that the bank was not in compliance with one of two aspects of the order's customer remediation plan, and that the OCC staff concluded that Sloan gave inaccurate testimony to Congress, the report says.
Sloan could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday evening. Spokespeople for the OCC did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Wells Fargo has paid out more than $7 billion in fines and penalties related to the scandal since 2016, including to the U.S. Department of Justice. Internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo’s major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank.
Over the past three years, Wells Fargo has taken various steps to fix the issues and rebuild trust with customers, investors and regulators. That includes changes to its board, centralizing risk teams and hiring an external chief executive.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) are cutting flights and implementing cost controls in the most drastic actions by U.S. airlines to get ahead of depressed travel demand due to the spreading coronavirus.
The United measures, announced by executives in a letter to employees on Wednesday, include a 10% reduction in U.S. and Canadian flights and a 20% reduction in international flying in the month of April, with similar cuts planned in May.
JetBlue said in a memo Wednesday seen by Reuters that it was cutting capacity by approximately 5% ""in the near term to address the fall in demand"" as a result of the coronavirus and said it assessing if more cuts are needed.
JetBlue is taking other steps ""aimed at preserving cash"" including ""delaying or canceling upcoming events and meetings"" and ""reducing hiring for frontline and support center positions."" It is also considering voluntary time-off programs and is ""limiting non-essential spending.""
United is freezing new hiring except for critical roles, delaying 2019 merit salary increases for management and administrative employees and offering all U.S.-based workers the option of a voluntary unpaid leave of absence.
""We sincerely hope that these latest measures are enough, but the dynamic nature of this outbreak requires us to be nimble and flexible moving forward in how we respond,"" United CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby said in the letter.
The coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has spread globally with more than 94,000 cases and 3,220 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. 
Conferences and gatherings around the world have been canceled, and companies have changed work and travel plans. Plane maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co itself on Wednesday said it was taking precautions including restricting travel to essential trips.
Chicago-based United's announcement followed a meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and the heads of major U.S. airlines at the White House where they discussed the effect of the virus on the industry and demand.
Concerns over the effect of reduced travel demand on airlines have hit airline shares and stoked fears of a financial bailout for the sector, an idea that the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday moved quickly to dismiss.
Trump also said on Wednesday that the airline executives had not asked for a bailout. After emerging from bankruptcy in the last decade and with new business models that include fees for everything from baggage to boarding, the U.S. airline majors are in a better financial position to weather a crisis, analysts have said. 
UNCHARTED TERRITORY
The rapid, global spread of the virus has forced airlines to abandon their usual strategies for crisis management, which in the past have included lowering fares and redirecting flights to trouble-free areas. 
Until now, United and other U.S. carriers had only reduced flying to the areas most hit by coronavirus cases, though international rivals Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and British Airways recently announced broader reductions.
Leaders of the unions representing United's pilots and flight attendants called the move a ""responsible approach"" to addressing the impact of COVID-19 on air travel.
In one effort to win over hesitant travelers, U.S. airlines have suspended rebooking fees for new ticket reservations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday took another step to try to prod Britain to reverse its decision to allow China's Huawei Technologies Co to build portions of the UK's next generation 5G networks.
Republican senators Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio proposed legislation requiring the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review Britain's place on the foreign investment ""whitelist,"" which exempts some Australian, Canadian and UK companies from increased U.S. scrutiny of their foreign investments.
The British Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.
Also on Wednesday, a U.S. Senate committee heard testimony from Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Ericsson (ST:ERICb) about how rural U.S. carriers can swap out equipment from Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063), also from China, to stay within recently issued federal rules.
Republican President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies deemed to pose a national security risk, such as Huawei. The Trump administration also added Huawei to its trade blacklist.
In November, the Federal Communications Commission followed up by voting unanimously to designate Huawei and ZTE as national security risks, effectively barring their rural customers in the United States from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment.
""We need to do more to shore up our own network defenses against hackers and state-sponsored actors, especially in our nation’s rural and underserved communities. This effort will require the development of a comprehensive strategy to secure the telecommunications supply chain,"" said Senator Roger Wicker, the Commerce Committee's Republican chair.
Last week, Congress passed legislation to reimburse telecommunications providers with fewer than two million customers who replace equipment in their networks deemed to pose a national security risk.
Steven Barry, who heads the Competitive Carriers Association, said at Wednesday's hearing rural carriers were ""essentially attempting to rebuild the airplane in mid-flight"" by having to remove and replace network equipment.
Huawei said the congressional legislation was ""considerably underfunded, would take longer than anticipated and could put at risk some of our customers, who serve the most undeserved areas."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial firms in New York City were testing remote-work capabilities, implementing new travel restrictions and canceling or modifying upcoming events as the coronavirus outbreak - already on the finance capital's doorstep - showed little sign of abating.
MetLife Inc (N:MET), whose headquarters sits atop Grand Central Station, imposed a ban on international travel that is not ""essential,"" a person familiar with the matter said.
The insurer is requiring staff to get approval from the executive team before taking such trips, and encouraging employees to hold virtual meetings via conference call or video chat rather than travel domestically.
A small number of employees – fewer than 10 – are self-quarantining because they have traveled to regions that are affected by the virus, the person said. MetLife directed employees who are worried about using public transit to speak to their managers about possibly working from home, although it has not imposed a broad work-from-home mandate.
Hedge-fund firm Third Point LLC sent a note to those attending its March 9 investor day in Manhattan, outlining new procedures including a ""no handshake policy,"" according to the message, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
Attendees must ensure they have spent at least two weeks outside of high-risk territories prior to the event, the message said.
Morgan Stanley's (N:MS) prime brokerage unit went a step further, postponing an event scheduled for March 19 until November. It is one of several industry events that have been canceled or pushed back.
Government officials have detailed ten confirmed coronavirus cases in New York state, leading to self-quarantine orders for 1,000 people in the suburb of Westchester.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) began rolling out emergency coronavirus plans across the United States this week, asking thousands of employees to work from home or from secondary locations, including two outside of Manhattan.
Big U.S. lenders have been dusting off contingency plans, implementing travel restrictions, postponing events and staying in touch with regulators. 
But some New York-based employees told Reuters it was business as usual.
One employee who took his normal commute to Manhattan from the suburbs on Wednesday morning said his train had as many Wall Street types as it usually does. Another joked about buying a mask and expressed enthusiasm about the idea of working from home.

""I just delete those emails,"" a third employee said, referring to a company-wide coronavirus memo. ""Unless it says you can go home, it isn't useful to me.""

363,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 06:14PM ET</span>",U.S. should give China leeway in implementing trade deal due to virus: Grassley,"By Andrea Shalal and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington needs to give China some leeway in implementing a Phase 1 trade deal given a downturn in the world's second largest economy caused by the coronavirus, U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said on Wednesday.
Grassley told Reuters in an interview that he saw no evidence that China intended to try to escape its commitments under the deal to sharply increase its purchases of U.S. farm goods, manufactured products, energy and services.
But the coronavirus could require some adjustments and would likely delay the start of negotiations on a Phase 2 trade agreement, the Iowa Republican said. 
China's moves to reduce some tariffs on U.S. goods and allow U.S. inspections of their food showed they were acting in ""good faith,"" Grassley added.
""We have to give some leeway to them because of the downturn in their economy, and less consumption as a result of it,"" he told Reuters.
Even before the outbreak, experts had questioned China's ability to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over the next two years. They said the epidemic, which led to widespread work stoppages across China, will make it extremely difficult for Beijing to hit its purchase targets this year.
The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said the outbreak had slowed in China and Chinese officials expected to restore production capacity to around 90% soon. But it said China's economic growth was still expected to fall short of the IMF's recent forecast of 5.6% in 2020.
A Washington-based Chinese official last week said Beijing was serious about implementing the trade deal, but a halt in air traffic and a travel ban on Chinese people entering the United States would complicate meeting the targets.
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Wednesday predicted China will come into the U.S. market for soybeans in late spring and summer. 
Grassley said the Federal Reserve Board's interest rate cut could help offset negative impacts from the virus, adding that cuts to U.S. tariffs on China would be a way for the U.S. government to stimulate the economy if needed.
""If they needed to do something, they'd get the tariffs done a lot faster than they'd get a tax cut through Congress,"" he said. ""Right now, with what the Federal Reserve has done, we'll just feel our way along.""

364,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 06:08PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 5,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Investors will naturally be watching reports of the number of new Covid-19 cases across the globe Thursday, as well as government and private sector moves to contain the virus and signs of direct impact on companies like United Airlines today.
Beyond that there will be more economic data, which helped the U.S. dollar gain a little traction today and the 10-Year Treasury yield to reclaim territory above 1%.
The oil market is still waiting for a move from OPEC and earnings reports are still coming.
Here are three things that could move the market tomorrow.
1. Jobless Claims, Factory Orders Due
There’s more data on the employment front tomorrow, ahead of Friday’s payrolls report.
Weekly initial jobless claims arrive at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to dip to 215,000 from the week before, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 10:00 AM ET the Commerce Department will issue its latest report on factory orders.
Economists expect that the value of new purchase orders placed with manufacturers fell 0.1% in January.
2. OPEC Meeting Begins
OPEC starts its official two-day meeting in Vienna tomorrow, although the market has been swinging on headlines from the cartel this whole week.
Saudi Arabia is trying to convince Russia to sign off on more output cuts, but Russia has been playing it coy so far. A technical panel recommended cutting output by as much as 1 million bpd in the second quarter.
Adding to a prior deal in December, OPEC+ would be removing a total of 3.1 million bpd, or 3.1% of global supply,
Oil prices reacted negatively today to a report that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak had returned to Russia.
But a deal definitely hasn’t been ruled out, Investing.com’s Barani Krishan said.
3. Kroger Reports After Buffett Endorsement
On the earnings calendar investors will get a chance to see how a new Buffett bet is faring.
Warren Buffett’s   Berkshire Hathaway   (NYSE:BRKb) revealed in a regulatory filing last month that it had initiated a new position in Kroger (NYSE:KR). Berkshire said it owns about 18.94 million shares in the supermarket chain.
Kroger (NYSE:KR) will report quarterly results before the bell tomorrow.
Analysts are looking for a profit of 55 cents per share on sales of about $28.8 billion.
Shares are up about 8% year to date."
365,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 05:46PM ET</span>","RBC to cut Canada prime rate to 3.45%, with rivals expected to follow","By Nichola Saminather and Bharath ManjeshR
(Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY) said on Wednesday it would cut its prime rate to 3.45% from 3.95% in its first reduction since July 2015, with the country's other lenders expected to follow suit, even as the moves weigh on margins already under pressure.
Canada's biggest lender announced the move, which will take effect on Thursday, after the Bank of Canada cut benchmark rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday to help tackle a coronavirus outbreak and said it was ready to cut again.
The central bank's cut is ""well in advance of the banks' expectations,"" said Rob Colangelo, senior vice president for credit ratings at DBRS Morningstar.
The Bank of Canada's reduction, following a similar move by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday, will lead to margin compression at or slightly above the higher end of the 1-to-2 basis-point-per-quarter range expected by the banks at the end of fiscal 2019, Colangelo said.
The last two times the Bank of Canada lowered rates, in January and July of 2015, the banks passed on only 30 basis points of the 50-basis-point cuts. But the major banks matched the central bank's three quarter-percentage-point increases in 2018.
""They're choosing to err on the side of caution and put more stimulus into the economy,"" said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities. ""But it will squeeze them.""
The economic growth spurred by the cut would improve loan growth, but it ""likely won't be enough to offset net interest margin compression,"" said Laura Lau, chief investment officer at Brompton Group.
Canadian banks are somewhat protected by their skew toward more fixed-rate loans, said Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank Financial (NBF), contrary to the dominance of variable rates in the U.S.
""It's not an immediate hit when the central bank cuts,"" Dechaine, who expects the cuts to result in a 1% to 2% reduction in his earnings estimates for the major banks.
The decline in margins would be driven more by commercial loan portfolios, which price more frequently, Colangelo said. Banks have been growing their business loan books at double-digit rates recently.
The Fed's rate cut would weigh more on Canadian banks' U.S. operations, Dechaine said in a note on Tuesday. Canadian banks experienced 43 basis points of average net interest margin compression following the Fed's three rate cuts in 2019, he said.
Canadian banks' earnings could fall by between 0.6% to 1.5% in the next two quarters, with the more U.S.-focused TD Bank (TO:TD) and Bank of Montreal (TO:BMO) taking the biggest hits, he said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street roared back to life on Wednesday, with both the Dow and the S&P 500 surging more than 4%, after former Vice President Joe Biden's strong showing in the Super Tuesday Democratic primary contests injected a dose of confidence.
Biden's pack-leading results - on course to win in 10 of the 14 states that held primaries on Tuesday - powered a jump in healthcare stocks, and upbeat economic data soothed worries about the impact of the spreading coronavirus outbreak.
After the S&P 500 reached an all-time high on Feb. 19, the stock market slid into a correction as the rapidly spreading COVID-19 sparked recession fears.
The S&P 500 has recovered nearly 6% from Friday's closing trough, but remains about 7.6% below the all-time high reached on Feb 19.
The S&P 500 healthcare index (SPXHC) had its best day since November 2008, advancing 5.8%. Health insurers, in particular, gained ground, with the S&P 500 Managed Care index <.SPLRCHMO> jumping 12.4%.
Biden emerged as the front-runner in a narrowing race for the Democratic presidential nomination following a string of primary victories, providing relief to market participants who are wary of the more progressive policy positions of rival Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist. Sanders' embrace of a Medicare for All healthcare policy that would essentially abolish private insurance had cast a shadow on healthcare stocks.
""It's a relief to the market that it appears that Joe Biden is increasingly likely to get the Democratic nomination,"" said Oliver Pursche, vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
""Many Americans, even those inclined to agree with Trump's policies, are clamoring for a unifying voice,"" Pursche added. ""And Joe Biden is about as benign as anyone can be."" 
Biden's showing acted at a balm to investors day after the market slumped following the U.S. Federal Reserve's emergency 50-basis-point interest rate cut to head off potential economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak. There are now 93,000 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide.
""(The Fed's rate cut) coming two weeks before a policy meeting signals a certain level of panic,"" said Pursche. ""We're all worried about the coronavirus and the economic impact but so far the data has held up."" 
Indeed, separate data released on Wednesday showed stronger-than-expected private sector hiring, while the services sector expanded at its fastest pace in a year.
Additionally, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the average 30-year fixed contract mortgage rate fell last week to a seven-year low.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 1,173.45 points, or 4.53%, to 27,090.86, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 126.75 points, or 4.22%, to 3,130.12 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 334.00 points, or 3.85%, to 9,018.09.
All of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 posted solid advances, led by healthcare and utilities (SPLRCU).
 Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) forecast underwhelming first-quarter sales and profit, sending the discount retailer's shares down 3.6%.
Abercrombie & Fitch Co (N:ANF) jumped 9.0% after beating quarterly sales and profit estimates.
 Campbell Soup  Co's (N:CPB) beat-and-raise earnings report gave a 10.1% boost to its shares.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.64-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and 31 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 37 new highs and 130 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.04 billion shares, compared with the 10.00 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com – The Dow racked up its second-biggest point gain on record Wednesday, driven by a surge in healthcare stocks as former Vice President Joe Biden's race for the Democratic presidential nomination gained traction following a surprisinly strong Super Tuesday performance.
The S&P 500 surged 4.22%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.85% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.53%, or 1,173 points.
With his campaign widely believed to be on the brink of collapse a few weeks ago, Biden won ten of the 14 states in which voters cast ballots on Super Tuesday, setting up a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination against Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Healthcare stocks surged as Biden's strong showing eased the prospect of a Sanders victory, which many fear would trigger major disruptions for the industry with a Medicare for All policy.
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) surged 10.8%, Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) rose 15.6%,   Centene   (NYSE:CNC) was up 15.5%, Humana (NYSE:HUM) gained 14.5 and Cigna (NYSE:CI) rose 10.7%.
The surge in stocks came against signs the novel coronavirus spread continues to accelerate in the U.S.
New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo confirmed five more infections in the state, raising the number of cases in the state to 11, and nearly 130 nationwide, with 11 deaths reported so far.
The virus outbreak has wreaked havoc on travel demand, prompting United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) to cut domestic and international flights for April.
United Airlines rose 2% on the day, with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) 3.9%.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, shrugged off a decline in oil prices to rise more than 2% day.
Sentiment was also boosted by better-than-expected services sector activity, which drives the bulk of economic growth.
ISM nonmanufacturing  data for February showed an uptick to 57.3, beating expectations of 54.9. This represents the highest reading for the service sector index since February 2019."

The pay hikes, which will take effect by the end of 2020, will increase the wages for more than 20,000 U.S.-based employees and will be based on employee location. (https://reut.rs/3cvH0DU)
In recent years, Wells Fargo has increased its minimum hourly base pay in the U.S. by 32%, most recently to $15 in March 2018, the company said.
Employees working in the cities of New York or San Francisco will receive a minimum hourly pay rate of $20, while employees in Charlotte or Des Moines will receive a minimum of $16 per hour, according to the company.
Last year, Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) said it would raise its minimum wage to $20 per hour over a two-year period. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) has been raising hourly wages to between $15 and $18, but has fielded criticism from U.S. lawmakers that it should raise it further.

The announcement from Wells Fargo comes a week before Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf is scheduled to testify before the U.S. Congress over measures the bank taken related to its sales scandal.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's executive aims to introduce laws to combat gender pay gap across the bloc for the first time ever in a bid to fight inequality and boost the economy, according to a document seen by Reuters ahead of official publication.
The European Commission will present on Thursday a list of steps to promote gender equality in the 27-nation bloc, and its strategy said women in the EU earn on average 16% less than men, perpetuating a pension disparity of 30% between the sexes.
""Accumulated lifetime gender employment and pay gaps result in an even wider pension gap and consequently older women are more at risk of poverty than men,"" the strategy read.
To alleviate that, the Commission will roll out ""binding measures on pay transparency"" this year, it said, adding that improving gender equality in the labor market would boost EU's GDP per capita by up to a tenth.
Currently, 13 EU member states have no pay transparency measures in place. Others vary from Germany, which introduced the right to pay information in companies employing at least 200 workers, to collective bargaining envisaged in Belgium.
Acute shortage of female workers compared to male employees affects the tech and AI sectors, financial services, science and communication, as well as construction, agriculture and transport.
Conversely, women outweigh men significantly in education, health and social services. The Commission's data also shows a third of members of national parliaments in the EU are women, and less than 8% of board chairs and CEOs of Europe's top firms.
While a third of board seats in the FTSE 100 index in Britain are held by women, only four companies in the cohort have female CEOs, consultancy Kearney said in a report on Wednesday.
Britain has now left the EU. Introducing laws to combat labor market discrimination may be an uphill battle among the remaining 27 member states, since EU countries have refused since 2012 to adopt laws to bring in more women to corporate boards.
Six EU countries have not ratified the 2014 Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women. They are Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Lithuania, home of the EU's agency for gender equality."

387,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 03:26PM ET</span>",United Steelworkers union mulls new negotiating partner for oil bargaining,"By Laura Sanicola
PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union (USW) is considering designating a new lead negotiator in the National Oil Bargaining process, the union's president said on Wednesday, as current lead negotiator Shell cuts back on the number of refineries it owns.
Speaking at the National Oil Bargaining conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania USW International President Tom Conway noted that Shell Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa), had publicly committed to reducing the number of refineries in its portfolio.
Shell has been the lead company in contract talks for U.S. union-represented refinery workers since the late 1990s. In that role, it has negotiated over national issues like wages and safety standards with the USW, used as a blueprint for the U.S. fuel and petrochemical industry. Site-specific issues are negotiated locally.
""The industry is changing,"" Conway told Reuters at the conference, adding that a number of refiners are being considered and the union has not yet decided on the lead company for 2022 contract talks.
Shell is trying to use its global scale to build a power business as the world moves toward cleaner energy. The Anglo-Dutch company has committed to selling more than $5 billion of assets per year in 2019 and 2020.
Most recently, Shell sold its refinery in Martinez, California, to independent refiner PBF Energy (N:PBF). Shell's refineries in Anacortes, Washington and Sarnia, Ontario, are also understood to be for sale.
Peer European oil major  BP  Plc (L:BP) quit a major U.S. refining lobby last week, and only operates three refineries in the United States.
Meanwhile, independent refiners have been acquiring assets and adding refining capacity in recent years.
Since its $23 billion acquisition of Andeavor in 2018, Marathon Petroleum (N:MPC) can now refine more than 3 million barrels-per-day of crude oil.
The USW last year reached an agreement with Shell that boosts pay by 11% over three years for 30,000 U.S. refinery, chemical plant and pipeline workers.
Rolling strikes in 2015 left more than 7,000 workers at 12 refineries and three chemical plants off their jobs for between two to six months.

United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) fell 0.4% on the news.
The airline will cut international flights by 20% and domestic flights by 10%.
The move comes airlines are reeling from the sudden hit to travel demand, with some experts warning the impact from the virus outbreak could be the worst travel crisis since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB) said it is ordering more ingredients to ensure it can keep enough soups, sauces and snacks on hand to meet growing demand from retailers as U.S. consumers hoard food in preparation for potential coronavirus quarantines.
Over the weekend, a few retail customers began stepping up orders, Campbell Chief Executive Mark Clouse told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. The company had already begun building inventory for ingredients that are usually stockpiled during natural disasters, including canned soups, snacks and Prego pasta sauces.
""We're working very closely with folks to make sure that we keep them in stock,"" Clouse said, adding that ""honestly before this weekend we had not seen much"" higher demand.
The outbreak has killed more than 3,000 people globally and is in nearly 80 countries and territories. In the United States, people have been stocking their pantries in case they cannot leave their homes. A few state health departments have urged residents to stock up on non-perishable foods, prescription medications and sanitary supplies.
Some worry supply chains could be strained and store shelves of major retailers such as Walmart (N:WMT) and Kroger (N:KR). U.S. retailer  Target  Corp (N:TGT) said on Tuesday it was seeing a surge in store traffic due to the virus.
Data firm Nielsen has reported that demand for some consumer products - such as pretzels and fruit snacks - was up 5-7% in January and February. Clouse said sales growth over the last couple of weeks was comparable, but that he did not know if this would continue.
""There's no question that we're seeing some uptick - it's just hard for me yet to know the level of sustained need,"" Clouse said. SpaghettiOs canned pasta and Swanson canned chicken are also seeing higher demand, he added.
On Tuesday, Campbell reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit. The 150-year-old company has been working to revitalize its canned soup business, rolling out new recipes, eliminating preservatives and ramping up marketing to lure back health-conscious customers. Campbell's stock has gained about 24% since late 2018 when Clouse was hired to turn the company around.
The company is looking for alternatives to ingredients it buys from places where supply chains are being disrupted. Yet Clouse, who sold the fresh food unit and some international brands to focus on the U.S. business, noted that the company is far less exposed to global supply chain disruptions than it was before.

""Only about 10% of our total ingredients come from outside of North America, with China under 2%.""

Investing.com – The Dow clawed back its losses on Wednesday, following a sharp sell-off a day earlier, with health-care issues leading the charge after former Vice President Joe Biden racked up major victories on Super Tuesday.
The S&P 500 surged 2.73%, Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.80% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 2.82%.
Health-care stocks have underperformed the broader market recently on fears a Bernie Sanders' victory could usher in major disruptions for the industry, with the socialist democratic keen to pursue a ""Medicare for All"" policy, which would scrap private health insurance.
But those fears eased somewhat after Joe Biden won nine of the 14 states that voted to pick a Democratic White House candidate on Super Tuesday, setting up a close race for the Democratic nomination against rival Sanders.
Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) rose 15%, Centrene was up 14%, Humana (NYSE:HUM) and Cigna (NYSE:CI) were up more than 10%.
Despite the rally, investors were also monitoring the impact of the coronavirus as infections in the U.S continued to mount.
Officials in Los Angeles reported six new COVID-19 cases in the county over the last 48 hours, prompting them to declare a local emergency, taking the total number of cases in the U.S. to 130 and the death toll to nine."

(Reuters) - Global banks and small investment firms in Europe are urging staff to work from home and curb travel as the financial industry braces for disruption from the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak.
For many companies it will be a first-time experiment with home working on a wide scale, but as many Asian offices begin to normalize working practices after their own attempts to stop the spread of the virus, the signs are that the European industry will adapt.
In Italy, the European country with the highest number of known coronavirus cases so far, number one lender UniCredit has allowed many of its staff to work from home, with less than a third of workers at its Milan headquarters currently turning up to the office, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
Swiss banks  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and UBS have joined other global lenders in imposing restrictions on international travel to stem the spread of the virus, people familiar with the situation told Reuters, while France's Natixis and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) also said they had stopped staff going to high-risk areas and limited travel elsewhere.
Although the large majority of coronavirus cases have been recorded in China, the virus is spreading worldwide with some 80 countries reporting confirmed cases of the flu-like illness that can lead to pneumonia. South Korea and Iran have been particularly hard hit and the number of cases in Europe is rising.
Italy had reported 107 coronavirus-linked deaths as of Wednesday and more than 3,000 confirmed cases since the outbreak surfaced 13 days ago.
A spokeswoman for the European Central Bank said it was monitoring developments and was in close contact with the banks it supervises regarding their business continuity plans.
German and British financial regulators, meanwhile, said they were keeping a close eye on how prepared banks and other institutions were.
According to government projections, up to a fifth of the total workforce in the UK could miss work during the peak of an epidemic.
One of Europe's biggest insurance markets, Lloyd's of London, said it had ""emergency trading protocols"" to ensure business continues if access to its City of London tower is limited, including encouraging electronic placing rather than the traditional practice of brokering face-to-face deals.
In 2018, financial services accounted for almost 7% of Britain's total economic output, half of it generated in London.
ON YOUR BIKE
Natixis said its trading floor staff in Hong Kong were already equipped to work from home and it would be deploying the same measures to its staff in France shortly.
Smaller firms have been implementing their own measures.
""We've said for people to either travel outside of peak times or to take a taxi ... or to cycle,"" said James Walker, managing partner at London-based computer-driven hedge fund firm Solaise Capital Management.
""Our next step would be for everyone to work from home if (the outbreak) gets materially worse,"" said Walker, whose 11 staff are now rotating shifts to avoid the whole team falling ill at the same time.
Whether the temporary measures lead to a longer-term change in working habits in an industry renowned for long hours spent in the office remains to be seen.
""Everyone in our Asian offices has been doing the home rotation thing and their markets didn't malfunction,"" said Mike Kelly of Pinebridge Investments. ""At the end of all this, a lot more people will learn they can telecommute.""
Others were more pessimistic.
""In extreme circumstances - like a ban on public transportation or the authorities' decision to shut down all offices we would really struggle to operate,"" said one bond trader at an Italian bank. 
""If that is the scenario, well, the market itself would vanish."""

MILAN/LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Venice hotelier Judith Boulbain has to go back almost two decades to the 9/11 attacks to recall a time when business was this bad.
Only a month before Easter, one of the busiest holidays in the European calendar, the owner of the Hotel San Samuele in the heart of Venice has seen more than 80% of reservations canceled, and future bookings have evaporated.
The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside.
Italy is the worst-hit country in Europe, preparing to close schools, cinemas and theaters after more than 100 people died and confirmed coronavirus cases rose above 3,000.
""People are scared, some left early, others didn't show up, others called to ask for a refund,"" says Boulbain, 46, originally from France, who has been running the Italian hotel since 2006 and has been in the business for almost 25 years.
Her problems illustrate the havoc across the global travel industry, as companies restrict employees' travel, major trade shows are axed and holidaymakers choose to stay at home or postpone plans to book a spring break or summer holiday.
BIG BUSINESS
The rapid spread of the virus has plunged the travel and tourism industry, which accounts for more than 10% of global economic growth, into one of its worst crises, according to interviews with more than a dozen industry experts, hotel owners and tour operators.
Travel and tourism accounted for about 319 million jobs, or 10% of total world employment in 2018, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). Leisure represents almost 80% of the total compared with 20% for business spend, it says.
Airlines have suffered the most since the outbreak began, but hotel groups like  Hyatt Hotels Corp  (N:H), cruise operators like Carnival Corp (N:CCL) (L:CCL) and holiday companies including TUI (DE:TUIGn) are also reeling.
""We don't know when this (epidemic) is going to end,"" says Boulbain. 
Graphic: Global travel rates seen falling this year amid virus spread - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2862/2827/travel.png
BLEAK OUTLOOK
Experts paint a bleak picture in the near term.
International travel is expected to fall by 1.5% this year, the first drop since 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis, according to consultancy Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics company. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, rates of travel fell just 0.3%.
With China at the center of this latest outbreak, Asia Pacific will be the hardest hit region, with a double-digit decline in visitor arrivals forecast for 2020 at 10.5%, according to Tourism Economics.
People have become more resilient to health crises over the past decade or so, on average returning to travel and holidays swiftly once an outbreak is contained, Tourism Economics' analysis shows.
But the coronavirus is unprecedented in its geographic spread. The consultancy is using SARS as its benchmark, which means they expect the virus to be contained by the end of the first half of the year.
Under that scenario, travel rates would start to recover from around July but it will take until 2021/22 before the industry has recovered completely, David Goodger, managing director of Europe and the Middle East at Tourism Economics, told Reuters.
""If the spread of the coronavirus continues, the impacts on tourism could last longer and be much more severe than SARS,"" the consultancy said in a report published this week.
KNOCK-ON EFFECT
It's having a knock-on effect beyond tourism. Businesses near a hotel on the Spanish island of Tenerife, which has been under lockdown with hundreds of tourists inside since Feb. 24, are struggling to deal with the lack of customers.
Beverley Veness, a hairdresser from England and owner of the 'Bamboo' hair salon for the past seven years, located in a shopping center in front of the H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel, said her business had been ""massively affected"" by the lockdown.
    ""Last week I probably did as many costumers in the whole week as I would do in maybe two hours,"" she told Reuters, holding an empty appointment book.
To woo customers into making bookings for later in the year, many hotel chains including Melia Hotels (MC:MEL), Pangea Group and B the Travel Brand in Spain said they are offering discounts and loosening their cancellation policies.
With almost no bookings for the coming months, Ca’ Pagan, a boutique hotel in Venice's city center, is offering a discount of up to 60% in March and up to 30% in April, owner Giacomo Busatto says.
""Only some Italians are coming, no foreign people,"" he said. 
Those measures may eventually lure back travelers but people are more likely to book last-minute as they wait and see how and where the virus spreads.
""We do not know for how long we can carry on like this. We are losing money. We already had an exceptionally high tide, what's next? A plague?"" says Boulbain.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 12:21PM ET</span>",Shortage of Chinese parts caused $50 billion fall in February's global exports: U.N.,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - China's exports of vital parts and components for products ranging from automobiles to cellphones are estimated to have shrunk by an annualized 2% in February, costing other countries and their industries $50 billion, a United Nations agency said on Wednesday.
The world's second-largest economy - and epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak that has spread to 75 nations - accounts for a fifth of global trade in intermediate products. Many countries rely on its manufacturing inputs, it said.
""There is a ripple effect throughout the global economy to the tune of a $50 billion fall in exports across the world,"" Pamela Coke-Hamilton, director of UNCTAD's division of international trade, told a Geneva news briefing.
The figure, which covers only the month of February, is preliminary and may be a ""conservative estimate"", she said.
It was partly based on China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), issued on Saturday, showing factory activity in China contracted at the fastest pace ever in February, even worse than during the global financial crisis, highlighting the colossal damage from the coronavirus outbreak.
Countries or regions suffering the highest export losses due to the disruption are the European Union (EU), with nearly $15.6 billion, the United States ($5.8 billion), Japan ($5.2 billion), the Republic of Korea ($3.8 billion), Taiwan ($2.7 billion) and Vietnam ($2.3 billion), according to the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
Precision instruments, machinery, automotive and communication equipment are the hardest-hit sectors, it said in its report which does not cover agriculture or services.
Alessandro Nicita, an UNCTAD economist, said that carmakers Honda (T:7267) and Hyundai (KS:005380) and other industries are closing plants in Japan because of lack of Chinese parts and components.
""The impact on the automotive industry in the European Union is about $2.5 billion,"" he added.
Asked whether manufacturers might shift to diversify suppliers, Nicita said: ""In the short term, no. Because it takes a while to identify new suppliers. In the long term, probably yes.""
China has built a huge logistics transport network including ports, shipping lanes and airplanes to move its goods, he said.
Referring to a gradual resumption in China's industrial production, he said: ""If it rebounds it can probably make up for the loss in February. If it stays low those numbers are going to compound and the situation for the global value chain is going to deteriorate even further.""
India, the world's main supplier of generic drugs, has restricted the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them, including paracetamol, a common pain reliever also sold as acetaminophen, as the coronavirus outbreak plays havoc with supply chains.
Coke-Hamilton, asked whether such restrictions indicated the virus was having a 'strangulating' effect on the global supply chain, said: ""In short, yes. It would seem so.""
""Assuming that it is not mitigated in the short term, it is likely that the overall impact on the global economy is going to be significant in terms of a negative downturn,"" she said."

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) predicted on Wednesday that the coronavirus would wipe out a substantial chunk of industrial free cash flow in the first quarter, but stuck to full-year financial targets the company set in January.GE predicted that the outbreak would erase $300 million to $500 million from industrial free cash flow and cause a hit of $200 million to $300 million to its first-quarter operating profit. GE set a forecast for first-quarter earnings of about 10 cents a share on Wednesday, including the virus impact.
The company expects to generate $2 billion to $4 billion of industrial free cash flow in 2020, Chief Executive Larry Culp said. 
""We decidedly did not take a view and would not necessarily encourage any extrapolations from what we've said here in the first quarter simply because what we don't know outweighs what we do know at this point,"" Culp said on a conference call with analysts. ""It's a volatile, fluid situation, unpredictable in many respects.""
The Boston-based maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment employs thousands in China. It is considered vulnerable to economic weakness caused by the virus which has cooled the world's second-largest economy and disrupted global supply chains.
GE shares were up 1.1% at $11, after initially rising about 2% in line with broad market indexes. 
Culp affirmed the adjusted profit target of 50 cents to 60 cents per share for 2020, and the industrial free cash flow target of between $2 billion and $4 billion. Analysts have estimated this year's cash flow at a positive $2.77 billion.
""It's a very conservative outlook and accommodates a lot of headwinds... basically it sails through everything,” William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said.
The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday delivered a surprise early half-point cut in interest rates in a bid to shield the world's largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus.

GE shares have lost about 16% since the company's fourth-quarter earnings report in January.

Bigland, who has been with Fiat Chrysler for 22 years, sued the company last year, claiming it withheld 90% of his 2018 compensation because he cooperated with a regulatory probe into its sales practices.
Over a five-year period from 2012 to 2016, Fiat Chrysler's U.S. unit used a series of fraudulent moves to falsely report new vehicle sales and tout a ""streak"" of uninterrupted monthly year-over-year sales growth, when it had actually ended in September 2013. (https://reut.rs/2uT5c2h)
In July 2016, the company revised more than five years of monthly U.S. vehicle sales figures to reflect a new reporting method, amid an investigation by federal authorities including the U.S. Justice Department.
Bigland's departure comes amidst Fiat Chrysler's talks with France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) for a $50 billion merger that would create the world's fourth-largest automaker.
Fiat Chrysler has plans to meet tighter emissions regulations in Europe with new hybrid gasoline-electric versions of several Jeep models, with plans to shift eventually to more pure-electric models beyond 2025.

Bigland will leave the company on April 3, Fiat Chrysler said. (https://

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) has cut its flight capacity in a move equivalent to grounding almost a fifth of its fleet, it said on Wednesday, confirming what company sources told Reuters earlier about the German airline's response to the coronavirus epidemic. 
""We are dynamically adjusting our plans to reflect extraordinary circumstances,"" a Lufthansa spokesman said.
The company said the move was equivalent to grounding 150 aircraft, with around sixth of the capacity cuts related to long-haul flights. 
Lufthansa Group, which includes Swiss, Brussels and Austrian Airlines, has a total fleet of 770 aircraft. 
Last week, Lufthansa said it had slashed capacity equivalent to grounding 23 long-haul aircraft.
European airline bosses warned on Tuesday the worst is still to come for the airline industry in terms of economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak, but also predicted travel demand could stabilise in the coming weeks.
Lufthansa had already said on Friday it would reduce the number of short- and medium-haul flights by up to 25% in the coming weeks depending on how coronavirus spreads. 
On Monday, it said it was extending the suspension of flights to China until April 24, to Tehran until April 30 and reducing services to northern Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak there.

Lufthansa has said it was too early to assess the impact on its earnings, which are due to be published on March 19.

(Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) on Wednesday raised its fiscal full-year earnings forecast and posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales due to strong demand for soups and snacks, and its shares rose 5% in early trade.
The 150-year-old company has sought to revitalize its canned soup business, rolling out new recipes, eliminating preservatives and amping up marketing to lure back health-conscious customers who favor freshly-made salads and sandwiches.
Campbell's investments drove higher demand for condensed soups and broths in the quarter, boosting sales at its U.S. soup unit by 1%.
""We showed marked improvement and executed well in what was the most important quarter for soup,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Clouse said on a post-earnings call. Campbell's stock has gained about 24% since late 2018 when Clouse was hired to turn the company around in the wake of a prolonged proxy battle with hedge fund Third Point LLC.
Campbell, which makes Prego pasta sauces and Pepperidge Farm cookies and Goldfish crackers, has also boosted investments to address changing consumer tastes in its snacks business. Organic sales at its snacks division rose 2%, due to higher demand for Goldfish crackers, Kettle Brand and Cape Cod potato chips.
Campbell sold its fresh food and certain international snack brands last year so it could focus on growing its U.S. soup and snacks businesses. The company said the divestments helped it reduce debt and it now expects fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings of $2.55 to $2.60 per share because of lower adjusted net interest costs. Campbell's new forecast is 5 cents more than previous guidance.
Net earnings attributable to the company was $1.21 billion, compared to a loss of $59 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 72 cents per share, beating analysts' expectation of 66 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said net sales fell marginally to $2.16 billion in the second quarter ended Jan. 26, but beat analysts' expectations of $2.15 billion."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply higher on Wednesday, as the revival of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign limited the risk of a radical left-wing administration under Bernie Sanders after November.
Biden swept southern and eastern states in the Democrats’ Super Tuesday primaries, overtaking Sanders in the delegate count. Sanders’ only victory of note came in California. The two candidates are now the only ones with a realistic chance of winning the Democratic nomination.
The market took a more favorable view, on reflection, of the Federal Reserve’s emergency interest rate cut on Tuesday, seeming to accept that it was likely to reduce risks in the financial system and, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell claimed, provide a “meaningful boost” to the economy.
New data earlier showed the U.S. economy, or at least its labor market, still in decent health in February, as the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Payrolls report rose by a stronger-than-expected 183,000. While that was above expectations for private job gains of 170,000, it was down from January’s 209,000 – a figure that was itself revised down sharply from the initial estimate of 291,000.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 494 points or 1.9%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3%. All three indices had posted heavy losses on Tuesday on the perception that the Fed’s move was panicked and likely to be ineffective in limiting the economic losses from the spreading outbreak.
Among individual stocks,   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) rose 1.2% after upholding its forecast for 2020 cash flow, even though it said it expected Covid-19 impacts to shave between $300 million and $500 million off cash flow in the first quarter.
Elsewhere, retailer Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock fell 1.4% after missing forecasts for its holiday quarter profit, while the simplification of its top leadership structure, which will leave Erik Nordstrom as CEO, was met with a shrug.
Elsewhere, U.S. crude oil futures extended their rebound to $47.70 a barrel, up 1.1% on the day, amid reports that the OPEC+ alliance is under pressure from Saudi Arabia to cut over 1 million barrels a day more in output."

Investing.com -- Stocks in focus in premarket trade on Wednesday, March 4. Please refresh for updates.
  General Electric   (NYSE:GE) stock 1.8% after the company upheld its forecast for cash flow this year, despite an expected short-term hit from the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The company still said it expects the outbreak to cut its first-quarter cash flow by between $300 million and $500 million. 
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock fell 8.0% to a seven-month low after issuing disappointing guidance for the year ahead.
The retailer’s earnings per share also fell some 3% short of forecasts in the all-important holiday quarter, while revenue also disappointed slightly.
Also on Tuesday, the company had said Erik Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) will take over as sole CEO of the company, ending a period in which he shared that office with his brothers.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock fell 3.3% after missing consensus forecasts for sales and profit in the last quarter, a reflection of a sharp drop in demand for servers from its corporate client base.
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) stock fell 2.5% to its lowest since October after reporting a mixed fourth quarter. Earnings per share were some 3.5% ahead of expectations at $1.79, but revenue of $6.39 billion was $70 million shy.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 2.1% amid reports a gradual revival of economic activity in China, where its iPhones are manufactured, and where around 20% of them are bought.
Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) stock rose 4.8% after the apparel retailer issued a full-year outlook slightly brighter than Wall Street expected.
The company’s adjusted earnings per share also beat expectations by around 6% in the fourth quarter, even though they fell from a year earlier.
The retailer didn’t directly estimate the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak but noted that its dependence on China for manufacturing was in any case scheduled to fall from 36% to 22% in the current fiscal year.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 08:42AM ET</span>",Airlines rush to boost demand as coronavirus shreds playbook for crisis management,"By Tracy Rucinski and Jamie Freed
CHICAGO/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The rapid spread of coronavirus cases worldwide is complicating a standard strategy used by airlines when disease, disaster or conflict hit travel destinations: lower fares and redirect flights to trouble-free areas.
For now, some airlines have resorted to suspending change fees for new ticket reservations in the hope of winning over hesitant travelers until it becomes clearer where coronavirus outbreaks are localized and which routes could benefit from price drops. 
While lower fares have proven effective in the past in reviving demand, aviation consultant Samuel Engel said, ""The pocketbook only works so far against emotion."" 
The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside.
JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), which does not fly to Asia, was the first airline to launch free rebooking options last week, as it became clear that cases were not isolated to China. JetBlue pulled together and announced its plan in a matter of hours, President Joanna Geraghty told Reuters.
""We tried to put ourselves in the shoes of our customers and think about what we would want if we were, for example, booking a spring-break trip right now,"" Geraghty said. 
U.S. majors have since followed suit with varying waivers on change fees for new reservations to many destinations, a switch from a previous policy that covered only pre-booked flights to areas hardest-hit by the coronavirus.
In Latin America, Peruvian low-cost carrier Viva Air was holding a board meeting on Wednesday to discuss measures, Declan Ryan, executive chairman of the board of directors, told Reuters. 
But with none of the offers so far guaranteeing money-back refunds, travelers say the policies are not enough.
""I understand that there are a lot of question marks right now for the industry on how this will unfold, but I don't feel like there's a truly customer-friendly policy out here,"" said Amanda Elman-Kolb of Chicago, who has put on hold plans for a family trip to Europe in August.
Declining demand to fly abroad is not limited to U.S. travelers. International travel to the United States will fall 6% over the next three months amid coronavirus concerns, the largest decline since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Travel Association forecast on Tuesday.
With extra widebody jets on hand after suspending flights to China, South Korea, Japan and northern Italy, major U.S. airlines are deploying them on domestic routes, a process known as upgauging.  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), for example, is flying passengers from Chicago to San Francisco on a 787 Dreamliner, rather than just the usual narrowbody like a 737 or an A321.
DEFLATED BOOKINGS
Europe's biggest carriers warned on Tuesday that the epidemic was upsetting growth, with Ryanair (I:RYA) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary forecasting a ""very deflated booking environment"" for the next two to three weeks before recovering.
""After Easter if things have settled down, temperatures in Europe are rising, I think there will be a significant decline in the spread of the virus. Airlines will then respond with seat promotions, seat sales that will get people back traveling very quickly,"" he told Reuters.
In the Asia-Pacific region, offers are under way. 
Malaysian budget airline AirAsia X (KL:AIRX), which was struggling financially even before coronavirus, launched a 499 ringgit ($119.09) one-year pass for unlimited trips to Australia, Japan, Korea, China and India, excluding taxes and fees on each trip - a move that CEO Benyamin Ismail called ""unprecedented."" 
Fares are softening too on routes not directly affected by travel bans, with Australia to Los Angeles 25% lower in the three weeks ended Feb. 26 compared with the same period last year, data provided to Reuters by Skyscanner showed. 
In perhaps the most vivid example,  Vietnam Airlines  JSC (HM:HVN) last week said it would offer $0 round-trip fares from Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, excluding taxes and fees, to help stimulate tourism through the end of May. 

""Airlines have historically shown little hesitance to reduce prices to get volume,"" said Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay. ""One thing we know about leisure air travel demand, it can be very easily stimulated.""

443,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",Gold Is Back in Favor Thanks to Fed’s Emergency Cut,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are returning to gold as a store of value after the Federal Reserve’s emergency rate cut sparked a collapse in 10-year Treasury yields.
Spot gold extended gains Wednesday after jumping by the most since 2016. The metal is rebounding from a dramatic plunge on Friday, when investors sold bullion to cover losses in other asset classes.
“Gold rekindled its safe haven credentials yesterday after the Fed made the cut,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. Gold benefits from both uncertainty and deeply negative real yields, he said.
Speculation is mounting that the Bank of England will follow the Federal Reserve with an emergency interest-rate cut. The Group of Seven’s pledge to coordinate responses to the coronavirus outbreak, followed by the Federal Reserve’s move, has also set off a flurry of activity from policy makers across Asia-Pacific.
Investors are turning their focus to the Bank of Canada which may jump into action next, with a cut expected at its scheduled meeting later Wednesday.
Spot gold rose 0.4% to $1,647.30 an ounce by 12:49 p.m. in London. The metal rose 3.2% Tuesday, the most since June 2016, after Fed policy makers shaved 50 basis points off their benchmark, cutting rates outside the normal cycle of meetings for the first time since 2008. In other precious metals, silver edged higher, while palladium declined for a fourth day.
Holdings in gold-backed ETFs resumed their rise, setting a fresh record. Tuesday’s inflow of 15.6 tons was the largest since mid-January, according to a preliminary tally compiled by Bloomberg News.
“The precious metal has proven an effective way of hedging portfolios against coronavirus risks, and we think key drivers are still in place,” UBS Group AG strategists led by global chief investment officer Mark Haefele wrote in a note. “U.S. real rates are now lower, reducing the opportunity cost of holding gold.”"

Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to strong gains at the open on Wednesday as former Vice President Joe Biden surged ahead in Super Tuesday voting and markets digested the U.S. Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut aimed at offsetting economic fallout from the coronavirus.
By around 07:15 AM ET (1215 GMT) Dow futures surged 671 points, or around 2.6%. S&P 500 futures were up 2.3% while Nasdaq 100 futures rose a similar amount.
The gains in premarket trade came after all three major U.S. stock market indices dropped more than 3% in Tuesday as the Fed rate cut fanned fears over about the scale of the coronavirus' impact on the economy.
Market sentiment was boosted by a strong performance from Joe Biden in the U.S. Democratic Party primaries.
Biden, a moderate considered less likely to raise taxes and impose new financial regulations, won primaries in at least eight states. That set up a head-to-head battle for the Democratic presidential nomination with democratic socialist Bernie Sanders.
Investors were also reevaluating Tuesday’s dramatic 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed which came two weeks ahead of a regularly scheduled policy meeting. The last time the Fed made a rate cut between scheduled meetings was in October 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis.
Initially the move failed to quell fears over the economic impact of the rapidly spreading virus, with the Fed acknowledging scale of the challenge and the limits of monetary policy to deal with a public health crisis.
More than 3,000 people have been killed by the coronavirus, about 3.4% of those infected and it continues to spread quickly beyond the epicentre in China.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, which falls when prices rise, held below 1% - not far over the overnight low of 0.9060%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bonds held onto gains on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve's surprise 50 basis point interest rate cut, part of global efforts to contain economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak.
The Fed's first off-schedule move since the 2008 financial crisis came with comments highlighting both the scale of the challenge and the limits of monetary policy.
In response, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield (US10YT=RR), which falls when prices rise, held below 1% - not far over the overnight low of 0.9060%. The yield has fallen for ten straight days, its longest slide in at least a generation.
Euro zone bond yields also held near record lows on Wednesday, with Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield (DE10YT=RR) around -0.64%, near six-month lows set on Monday.
Some saw the Fed's extraordinary move as a decision to move hard and early because it expected further economic damage from the spread of the coronavirus.
""They have signalled willingness to take further action, which is why we are seeing a further rally in bonds,"" said Tim Drayson, head of economics at Legal & General Investment management. ""Some argue that monetary policy can't fight the supply shock - but it will support demand and confidence."" 
With safe-haven currencies in demand, the dollar clawed back some ground from near five-month lows versus the yen  and fell to its lowest against the Swiss franc  in almost two years. It was flat against a basket of six major currencies (=USD).
Global stock markets edged up as investors weighed prospects for further central bank support, while a strong performance by Joe Biden in the Democratic Party primaries in the United States also emboldened bets.
The Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 1.5%, on course for a third straight days of gains. Markets in Frankfurt (GDAXI), London (FTSE) and Paris (FCHI) gained a similar amount.
""After the action from the Fed the market is very, very watchful now for potential moves from other central banks,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC. 
On Wall Street, S&P 500 futures (ESc1) climbed 1.8% on Biden's showing, after falling overnight despite the Fed's rate cut. 
Biden, a moderate seen as less likely to raise taxes and impose new financial regulations, won primaries in nine states. That set up a one-on-one battle for the Democratic presidential nomination with democratic socialist Bernie Sanders.
The European moves built on gains in Asia, where MSCI's broadest index of shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.3%. 
Korean stocks (KS11) gained 2% on a $9.8 billion government stimulus package to mitigate the coronavirus impact. 
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, gained 0.2%. It is still down around 10% falling a brutal sell-off last week as fears over economic damage from the coronavirus gripped markets.

CUTS NOT ENOUGH?
The Fed's surprise move followed a shift in money market pricing late last week. <0#FF:> Futures swung rapidly to anticipate such a cut at the Fed's March meeting. 
Now, they imply another 50 basis points of easing by July, even though investors and the Fed itself raised doubts that easing will help deal with a public health crisis. 
""If you're in China and you can direct liquidity exactly where you need to, and have rate cuts where you want them to be, monetary policy is very effective,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
""In the West, in a democracy, monetary policy is less effective - you need to incentivise banks to do what is in to the benefit of the whole."" 
Investors were also watching the Bank of England for signs it would follow the Fed. Money markets have moved to fully price in a BoE rate cut of 25 basis points at its next meeting, up from a chance of 80% before the Fed move.
Sterling dipped 0.1% against the U.S. dollar , and slipped 0.3% against the euro before clawing back some ground (EURGBP=D3). 
The coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 people, about 3.4% of those infected - far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%. It continues to spread beyond China, with Italy reporting a jump in deaths to 79 and South Korea reporting more than 500 new cases on Wednesday. 

""The question here is whether a conventional interest rate response is sufficient,"" said Sameer Goel, chief strategist, Asia macro, at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in Singapore.

447,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 06:01AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Virus Derails Intu's Rescue Plan,"By Geoff Smith 
Investing.com - The coronavirus appears to have claimed its latest victim in U.K. shopping mall operator Intu.
The company, which counts owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Braehead Centre in Glasgow, said on Wednesday it has abandoned plans to raise up to 1.5 billion pounds in new equity, unable to find backers willing to punt on a sector whose long-term problems have been compounded by the near-term public health scare.
The news leaves current shareholders on the edge of the abyss. Without more cash, the company risks breaching its debt covenants. Chief executive Matthew Roberts said “a number of alternative options have presented themselves during the (capital raising) process which we will now explore further.”
Intu shares fell 29% to a new low of 7.67 pounds - only 3% of what they were worth at the end of 2017.
Shopping malls, like mass transport, exhibitions, movie theaters and soccer matches, all provide abundant possibilities for broad and rapid transmission of the coronavirus.
As such, mall operators are exposed to any changes in consumer behavior driven by fear, as well as the virus itself. That has already manifested itself in increased demand for online shopping – witness Amazon’s warning earlier in the week of capacity constraints for deliveries to Prime customers.
The blow could not be more cruelly timed: animal spirits in the U.K. had just started to revive after three years of a Brexit-themed national slanging match that kept a firm lid on consumer confidence. Intu reported that in the first eight weeks of the year – i.e. before the virus had a noticeable effect in the U.K. - footfall in its U.K. centers had increased 0.9% from a year ago, a comparatively strong performance within a weak sector. Despite having to slash rents for a number of distressed retail tenants, the rental agreements it signed last year on average, were 1% above previous rental levels.
Unfortunately, with the virus now spreading fast in the British public’s consciousness, if not through Britain itself, the light at the end of the tunnel was neither big enough nor bright enough. Despite its best efforts, Intu can still only promise that this year’s revenue decline won’t be as sharp as the 9.1% it suffered last year.
As we argued last week with Norwegian Air Shuttle, when it comes to Covid-19, companies are like people: it’s the weakest, and those with pre-existing problems, that are suffering most."

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday as investors hoped the European Central Bank and euro zone governments would green light stimulus measures after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates in an emergency move.
The Fed's 50 basis points cut on Tuesday caught Wall Street off guard as it magnified the economic impact of the coronavirus and prompted questions over the efficacy of monetary easing. 
However, traders now see a 90% chance the ECB will cut rates next week too, though a central bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau on Tuesday called on governments for more fiscal help.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Model fire stations and garbage trucks helped Lego defy a shrinking toy market with a rise in sales last year, as the plastic brick maker outpaced rivals with the latest versions of its classic kits, as well as new stores and a revamped website.
After a decade of double-digit sales growth skidded to a halt in 2017, family-owned Lego has returned to form since chief executive Niels Christiansen took the helm that year.
The company, which fights for market share in the global toy industry with the likes of Barbie maker Mattel (O:MAT) and Hasbro (O:HAS), said on Wednesday sales rose 6% last year to 38.5 billion Danish crowns ($5.7 billion), up from 3% growth in 2018.
""It was a strong year where we outperformed the toy industry,"" Christiansen said in a statement.
In February, Mattel reported flat annual net sales, while Hasbro, the firm behind My Little Pony, saw net revenue rise 3%.
Lego estimates the global toy market contracted 3% last year. But it grew sales in all its major markets, including ""strong"" double-digit growth in China, it said.
The firm, which has 570 stores worldwide, more than doubled its number of stores in China last year to 140. It sees that number rising to 220 this year.
Christiansen told Reuters he would aim for single-digit revenue growth again in 2020, to allow for further investments into IT, new stores and production innovation.
Net profit in 2019 rose just 2.8% to 8.3 billion crowns, partly due to higher expenses, which increased 8.2%.
Despite strong sales from popular licensed Lego products such as ""Harry Potter"" and Marvel's ""Avengers"", the top-selling products were from ranges such as Lego City, Lego Classic and Lego Technic that have been around for decades.
""Of course, those are older themes, but as you know, we replace 60% of our products each year,"" Christiansen said.
""We actually consider these themes 'evergreen', which constantly need to be relevant,"" he said, adding they gave ""play experiences like the one you would get outside your door.""
But Lego, an abbreviation of ""leg godt"" meaning ""play well"" in Danish, is also banking on technology to stay up to date with new generations.
It saw 27% more traffic on its recently transformed website, and launched ""Hidden Side"" last year, which combines regular building sets with augmented reality."

Japan has been preparing for years and has invested some $12 billion in the Olympics, which start on July 24.
The government has said it will go ahead in preparing to host the Olympics as planned even as the number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Japan hit 1,000 on Wednesday.
The government has asked schools to close, companies are encouraging employees to work from home and sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, heightening concerns the Games will also be cancelled.
Crowds will be smaller and receptions have been scrapped at the Tokyo 2020 torch lighting ceremony at the site of the ancient Olympic Games in Greece next week.

Since the start of this year, analysts have slashed their forward 12-month earnings estimates on Asics Corp and Dentsu Group by 24% and 6%, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of Japan's top two security firms also felt the pinch, with  Sohgo Security Services  Ltd (T:2331) down 12%, while industry leader Secom Co Ltd (T:9735) lost 11% in the past month.
Consumer retail firms, transportation infrastructure, hotels and restaurants were the hardest hit, the data showed.

The Hang Seng Index hasn’t seen a move exceeding 3% in either direction in six months, while the S&P 500 Index has posted moves of that magnitude in four out of its past seven sessions. Equity traders aren’t really rushing to hedge against further swings either: an index of expected volatility has remained below its U.S. counterpart for seven consecutive days, the longest stretch since late 2018. The VHSI Index is also about 10 percentage points lower than Europe’s VStoxx volatility gauge.
Cheaper valuations, a currency peg that limits foreign exchange risks and optimism that the city has the virus situation under control are cited as factors that may make its stock market an attractive investment. Trading near the lowest versus the rest of the world in 16 years, Hong Kong’s beaten-down stocks may be poised to benefit from a rising tide of foreign cash.
“If we have a global easing environment, foreign investors would come to Hong Kong,” said Louis Tse, managing director at VC Asset Management Ltd. “We are talking about 10 times price-to-earnings here, which is a good entry point.”
The Hang Seng Index rose 0.1% by the midday break Wednesday, after the S&P 500 index tumbled almost 3% in the wake of a 50 basis-point interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which failed to ease concerns about an economic downturn. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority cut its benchmark interest rate in line with the Fed. As the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the greenback, the city essentially imports U.S. monetary policy.
Hong Kong Dollar Carry Trade Hoping for Fed Revival
According to Tse, rate cuts will further lower the return from the risk-free assets and encourage yield-hungry investors to look elsewhere to generate income. Along with the Fed, Group of Seven finance chiefs have also said they’re ready to act to shelter their economies from the spreading coronavirus.
Hong Kong stocks are cheaper for a reason. Months of political unrest over China’s role in the city pushed it last year into its first annual recession in a decade, with economists forecasting a second annual contraction in 2020 as disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak further depress output. The double whammy of the protests and the virus has led to a wave of retail closures and layoffs.
ECB Joins Central Banks Pledging Coronavirus Action If Needed
Flows from the mainland have already turned stronger, with traders having snapped up HK$61 billion of the city’s shares last month, the most since January 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That came as foreign traders dumped mainland shares at a record pace to lock in China’s recent rally.
Hong Kong’s shares have recently lagged those in China by the most in more than three years. On Wednesday property-related stocks such as China Overseas Land and Investment Ltd. and Link REIT led gains on the Hang Seng Index.
“Chinese A shares are driven by domestic liquidity, while the Hong Kong market is driven by both domestic and global funds. So aggressive rates cuts by global central banks would be helpful for Hong Kong stocks in the near term,” said Michael Liang, chief investment officer at Foundation Asset Management (HK) Ltd.
“But over the mid-to-longer term, it depends on whether the virus will go away.”"

458,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 01:16AM ET</span>",Huawei Finds 5G Heaven in Switzerland With ‘Fitbits’ for Cows,"(Bloomberg) -- A quiet Huawei Technologies Co.-led 5G revolution is unfolding at the heart of Europe -- in the bucolic Swiss hamlet of Taenikon.
Far from President Donald Trump’s campaign to stop the world from using the Chinese company’s technology, cows in this northern Swiss village -- with its white-washed cottages and manicured fields -- wear Huawei’s 5G-connected neck-straps instead of traditional flat bells. And in the village’s Cistercian abbey, converted into a test farm, Switzerland’s second-biggest telecommunications operator, Sunrise Communications Group AG, and Huawei test the next-generation 5G wireless network.
“You could call it a Fitbit for cows,” said Alexander Lehrmann, Sunrise’s chief of new business development and internet of things, referring to Fitbit Inc.’s fitness device. “It allows farmers to get complete control and insight into their health conditions at any time and from any place.”
While countries in Europe are grappling with U.S. claims that Huawei’s gear could open them up to Chinese spying, Switzerland is quietly building a network with the company. Flying under the radar, the Swiss have become world leaders in the rollout of 5G technology with the early sprouting of private and public networks. Entities from the Zurich airport, the national mail service and railways to food giant Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and Zurich Insurance Group AG either have or envisage private networks with Sunrise, whose exclusive supplier is Huawei.
“The Swiss government has done a very neutral and objective evaluation of Huawei and they have come to the conclusion that there is no significant other risks included in the technology and in Huawei as a company,” Sunrise Chief Executive Officer Andre Krause said in an interview. “(But) if the reputation of Huawei is continuously under pressure, that could also have an impact on us at some stage.”
The stakes are high as networks move toward the new-generation technology that promises faster connections, enabling uses such as autonomous vehicles, remote surgery and the transfer of data over a network without human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
For now, much of what’s happening with Huawei in Switzerland is the industrial use of 5G, or private networks, that draw less attention. But Switzerland is also the first country in Europe to start using a commercial 5G network for individuals in a limited way, amid opposition from environmental and health activists fighting antenna emissions.
Read: Health Scares Slow the Rollout of 5G Cell Towers in Europe
The U.S. has been frustrated by Europe’s refusal to accede to Trump’s demands to keep Chinese tech companies out of advanced 5G networks. The U.K., France, and Germany are all looking to keep the door open to the Chinese telecom giant in some way, snubbing the U.S. view that Huawei could be a security risk. Italy, Croatia and Hungary, like Switzerland, have signed partnerships with Huawei.
The Chinese company in February touted as many as 47 commercial contracts for 5G in Europe, more than in Asia. It claims to have 91 contracts, but did not respond to queries seeking details.
Still, the European Union may force member states to eventually change some of the deals after the bloc published a series of security recommendations in its “5G toolbox” that could keep non-European gear makers out of the network core, towers and towers bases.
Switzerland, which is not a member of the European Union, doesn’t face those constraints. Swiss insurers and pharmaceutical companies are testing Huawei’s 5G networks. Huawei has also built a partnership with the Swiss engineering company ABB Ltd., which is seeking to offer industrial partners competitive 5G platforms.
Sunrise’s Lehrmann said banks haven’t yet signed up. He said Sunrise is present in Swiss hospitals, where “the use case is what can you do in order to improve the patient experience by connecting data.”
Swisscom, the former monopoly is also testing the industrial technology but won’t disclose its gear maker. Salt, the Iliad SA-owned Swiss operator, is working with Nokia (HE:NOKIA).
“Radio Network Antennas (the technical name for private networks) are inside offices, factory, hospitals, whatever it is,” Duncan Stewart, Deloitte’s director of research in telecommunications, told reporters in Paris Feb. 4. “The machinery in your factory, the robots, the sensors, the cameras, the turbines, all these IoT devices, will only work on the private 5G networks.”
Stewart forecast that by 2030 almost all companies with more than 10,000 employees may have private 5G networks.
Some other European countries are also testing private networks.
The Port of Rotterdam, Europe’s biggest, has tested the technology starting 2018 with the national telecom operator KPN in partnership with Huawei, according to KPN’s website. Germany has prioritized the expansion of its industrial 5G application too, allowing companies to apply for private networks with gear makers, without necessarily going through a telecom operator. Companies including Bosh in partnership with Nokia, Siemens with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) are building such networks.
To Sunrise’s Lehrmann, the situation is simple.
Customers “are looking at 5G as a technology that allows them to drive new uses and new business cases,” he said.
On the test farm in Taenikon, meanwhile, cows eat, sleep and stroll under surveillance cameras. Their milk production, health and other data are transmitted at speeds about 100 times faster than current networks and processed in real-time. The test is meant to see how remote farms can function, information Sunrise and Huawei can use for other applications to boost factory output, enable big data usage in the finance sector or take health care in hospitals to a newer level.
“The Swiss population and economy depend on high-performance mobile communications,” Sunrise’s Chief Administrative officer Marcel Huber said on his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) account in February."
459,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 01:16AM ET</span>",How an ill-timed bet on a U.S. oil refinery cost ICBCS millions,"By Laila Kearney and Florence Tan
NEW YORK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A team of ICBC Standard bankers celebrated in London last June after closing its first major U.S. refinery deal and gaining a foothold in the biggest energy market in the world.
Just days later, the deal with refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions went up in flames.
A critical unit at the Philadelphia refinery exploded, trapping roughly 3 million barrels of ICBCS-owned oil, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, at the plant. The refinery swiftly declared bankruptcy and shut permanently.
London-based ICBCS sold most of the oil at a sharp discount, and the losses pushed it into the red for 2019, according to a source familiar with the bank's finances.
The source told Reuters the bank is expected to disclose in its annual earnings report in March that after selling most of its PES oil inventory at a big discount, it lost around $200 million, far exceeding the $130 million provision for losses in the first-half earnings report published in August.
ICBCS declined to comment for this story.
Independent refiners commonly use what are known as intermediation agreements, where a bank agrees to supply a refinery with crude oil and then buys and resells the refined products. This was ICBCS's first such agreement with a U.S. refinery, and it involved extending credit to PES, whose financial struggles in recent years had limited its access to funding.
ICBCS - a joint venture between Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's biggest-listed lender by assets, and South Africa's Standard Bank, Africa's biggest lender, is still trying to recoup losses from the deal.
ICBCS cut staffing. In December, it merged its base metals desk with its precious metals team.
""The energy business remained intact despite the losses,"" the source said, adding that the bank could still work on similar deals to finance refiners, but expects to be more cautious when selecting customers.
As of Feb. 3, ICBCS said it was owed $334 million by PES in connection with the deal.
ICBCS had about 3.3 million barrels of crude oil, gasoline and other refined products in or near the 335,000-barrel-per-day refinery when its alkylation unit exploded on June 21, and financed $1.5 billion in the total intermediation deal, according to court filings by ICBCS attorneys in July.
""That's something that would make a bank quite nervous,"" said Kurt Barrow, an IHS Markit consultancy vice president. ""That collateral is king to them,"" he said, referring to the fuels.
ICBCS started talks with PES in 2018, when the Philadelphia refiner was working through a previous bankruptcy. PES had been working with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), but switched to ICBCS as BofA wanted to raise its borrowing rates, according to two sources familiar with the plan. Bank of America did not respond to a request for comment.
PES intended to sign with ICBCS by January 2019, but the deal took six months longer as the refinery struggled to separate from the systems established with BofA, the sources said. PES was not available for comment.
Independent refiners commonly use intermediation, or supply-and-offtake, agreements, Barrow said, but U.S. banks have participated in fewer of these arrangements following the passage of the Volcker Rule, which restricts a bank's ability to bet its own funds in financial markets.
Even though ICBCS had charged rates to account for the riskiness of working with PES over the life of its contract, it did not factor in an almost immediate default.
It was also difficult and costly to extract the oil and products from the shut refinery. PES workers had to remove the crude and products stuck at the bottom of tanks using vacuum systems in a process that could not start for roughly five months after the closure, according to two sources familiar with the work.
Some of the products were not processed through to completion, and were sold off-spec, or not meeting the quality set by a contract or regulation, which reduces the value. The inventory removal process is expected to run through March, a source familiar with the plan said."

Investing.com - Asian markets were mixed on Wednesday morning as the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rates as expected. 
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.1% by 11:34 PM ET (03:34 GMT), but the Shenzhen Component fell 0.5%. The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers’ Index plunged to 26.5 in February, its worst month on record, from 51.8 in January.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed. 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.4%.
South Korea’s KOSPI surged 2.1% after the country’s government said it’s seeking a 11.7 trillion won ($9.8 billion) extra budget to help businesses hit by the world’s second-largest coronavirus outbreak.
The Bank of Korea called an emergency meeting for early Wednesday, but no outcome has been announced yet.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 1.8%. Wednesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the Australian economy accelerated by 0.5% last quarter. Meanwhile, the previous quarter’s GDP was revised upwards to show 0.6% increase from 0.4% earlier.
Economists had predicted a quarterly rate of 0.3%.
Overnight, U.S. stocks ended lower amid an ongoing spread of the coronavirus in the country. 
The S&P 500 slumped 2.8%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.95%, or 789 points.
Washington state authorities now report nine deaths from Covid-19, while North Carolina reported its first case and New York reported its second.
The Fed cut its benchmark rate by half a point to a 1%-to-1.25% range. The move was the first such cut since December 2008, during the financial crisis. The news failed to lift U.S. equities, however, as the Fed rate cut was already largely priced in markets and overshadowed by the coronavirus news. 
“A move of this size, at or before the committee's next meeting on March 18, was already fully priced in financial markets after a statement from Chair Powell late last week suggested the Fed was ready and willing to take action,"" RBC said.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank had to take action as the coronavirus was having a material impact on the economic outlook. 
“The magnitude and persistence of the overall effect on the U.S. economy remain highly uncertain and the situation remains a fluid one,” he told reporters. “Against this background, the committee judged that the risks to the U.S. outlook have changed materially. In response, we have eased the stance of monetary policy to provide some more support to the economy.”
Despite the central bank’s action, President Donald Trump said in a tweet that the cut is not enough. "

It also canceled its investor day that had been due to be held on March 5.
With investors firmly focused on how the company is managing the near-term impact of the coronavirus, United said it was not ""practical to expect that it can have a productive conversation focused on its long-term strategy next week.""
The event will be rescheduled for September.
Chicago-based United already withdrew its 2020 guidance this week due to uncertainty over the duration and spread of the virus. It warned that near-term demand to China has almost disappeared, with demand for the rest of its trans-Pacific routes down by 75%.
As a result, the company is temporarily reducing flights from the U.S. mainland to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and Seoul and extending the suspension of U.S. flights to mainland China and Hong Kong through April 30, it said on Friday.
The airline is cutting about two thirds of its flights to Seoul, nearly a third of flights to Japan and 40% of flights to Singapore. It is also flying smaller planes on some routes.
Among U.S. airlines, United has the biggest international exposure, drawing about 40% of its revenues from overseas flights.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son held his first ""pre-IPO summit"" for the Japanese conglomerate's portfolio companies on Tuesday, introducing them to Wall Street investors who could be backing their stock market debuts.
The event, which was closed to the media and described by a source in attendance, illustrates how SoftBank is keen to prepare the ground for the initial public offerings of many of its holdings, after some of its portfolio companies performed poorly last year following their listings.
The gathering hosted institutional investors and was chaired by Son and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink. It included nine SoftBank-backed companies, including data storage company Cohesity, British financial technology firm OakNorth and financing group Greensill Capital, the source said.
The event was held at Manhattan's three-Michelin-star Le Bernardin restaurant.
SoftBank declined to comment.
Son, under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management to rein in his mercurial investment style, is spending the week meeting Wall Street contacts in New York. He is having to defend his track record after several of its expensive bets on startups, including office space-sharing firm WeWork, soured.
SoftBank was aiming to raise $108 billion in funds for a second Vision Fund. However, Son said last month its launch had been delayed due to investor concerns about the performance of SoftBank's first $100 billion Vision Fund.
As a result, Son has said SoftBank may spend up to two years investing its own money in a bridge fund, to build a portfolio that will give investors enough confidence to participate in a second Vision Fund.
Two of the first Vision Fund's most high-profile investments, ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and workplace message app Slack Technologies Inc, are trading well below the prices at which they went public last year.
WeWork saw its potential valuation tumble by tens of billions of dollars before cancelling its IPO plans last year and being bailed out by SoftBank in a close to $10 billion rescue financing deal.
There have also been some IPO successes from the Vision fund, such and life science technology company 10x Genomics Inc and Vir Biotechnology Inc, which specializes in clinical-stage immunology."
465,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 07:07PM ET</span>",GM to tout its electric vehicles to investors swooning over Tesla,"By Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) executives on Wednesday will tackle one of their toughest tasks: Persuading investors that a Detroit automaker can catch up with Elon Musk and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) as vehicles go electric.
Even as global markets reel from coronavirus fears, Tesla's valuation is outpacing that of GM and most other legacy automakers. On Tuesday, Tesla's market cap hovered around $144 billion, more than three times GM's $45 billion.
GM is by far the larger manufacturer by volume, and generates more cash and profits. But in the electric vehicle market, Tesla is the leader.
Last year, Tesla sold 367,500 electric vehicles globally, including 223,000 in the United States. GM sold just 16,400 Chevrolet Bolt EVs to U.S. buyers, and 60,000 Baojun E-Series models in China with joint venture partner SAIC Motor (SS:600104).
GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss have ramped up electric vehicle development over the past three years, focusing on a proprietary battery, a low-cost flexible vehicle design and a blueprint for high-volume production, mainly in China.
The company has revealed its electric vehicle strategy in incremental steps - announcing the Hummer brand will be reborn as an electric pickup and partnering with Korean battery maker LG Chem (KS:051910) to build a $2.3 billion battery plant near a shuttered GM car plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM is now trying to put the broader picture into focus for investors.
GM has said it aims to reduce the cost of battery cells - the single greatest expense in electric vehicles - to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour. That in turn could slash the cost of battery packs for electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt EV by up to 45%, experts say.
GM is also developing an advanced battery, in partnership with LG Chem and Japan's Honda Motor Co (T:7267), that will be smaller than current EV batteries, can be charged more quickly and will provide more energy.
Musk has told investors that Tesla has battery cost and range breakthroughs in the works that it will describe at a ""Battery Day"" in April.
Barra has said GM plans to spend more on electric vehicles than on gasoline-powered cars over the next five years. But it has not put a figure on how much it will invest in its efforts to rival Tesla and traditional competitors such as Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) or  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) as the electric vehicle market develops.
Barra has, however, promised that GM will make money on electric cars by 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stepped up preparations to deal with the impact of the coronavirus on Tuesday, testing backup plans and asking employees to work from home, as a New Yorker tested positive for the virus, bringing the prospect of the spread of the infection closer to home.
A man in his 50s who lives in a New York City suburb and works at a small law firm in midtown Manhattan tested positive for the virus, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the state to two, New York officials said.
Officials said they were trying to trace the movements of the man and his family, and that seven people at his law firm had been designated by the city's health department as requiring monitoring. One of the man's sons who attends a university in city was also showing symptoms of the virus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.
Several banks and other financial services firms in the city were testing secondary offices and systems to ensure they could continue to operate if the situation worsened.
Sources familiar with JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (N:JPM) plans said the largest U.S. bank by assets was asking thousands of U.S. employees to spend a day working from home in the coming weeks to test its contingency plans.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) has secondary offices in nearby Greenwich, Connecticut, and Jersey City, New Jersey, and the bank has said it is continuously testing that systems work and could support employees, including traders, if there is a need.
JPMorgan,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and Goldman Sachs have restricted all non-essential international travel for employees, starting with JPMorgan late last week.
Goldman postponed its annual housing and consumer finance conference, scheduled for Wednesday, in the city.
“We know that many of you cannot take time to be away from the office as you prioritize the continuity of your business,” it said in an email seen by Reuters. “With that in mind, and as travel restrictions that could affect our speakers and guests continue to evolve, we have decided to postpone our conference.”
The response from Wall Street comes as the virus has spread across the globe, with some 80 nations hit with the flu-like illness that can lead to pneumonia. About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, according to the World Health Organization.
Some experts warned that the virus could pose unprecedented challenges for the financial industry.
One central bank official in Asia said in their experience the scale of impact from the coronavirus had been larger than they expected and the business continuity plans that banks and other financial services firms had fell short.
""So I think this is something that financial institutions in every place should get ready for,” the official said.
While traders can theoretically work from home, it is harder when considering factors such as network speeds, software and basic hardware such as the number of screens and computer memory.
""So much electronic trading requires great computer power you can’t do it from your iPad from your bed at home,” said Michael Purves, chief executive Of Tallbacken Capital Advisors, New York.
Still, others said systems are likely to hold up.
Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, which has about eight people, said much trading is now computerized. “It's all systematic and passive,” Saluzzi said. “A lot would still go on."""

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Companies took advantage of a window of opportunity on Tuesday to launch debt sales on both sides of the Atlantic, after coronavirus concerns chilled deal markets last week.
Some worried the chance could be a fleeting one, after risk appetite appeared to sour as stocks and bond yields fell on the heels of Tuesday's emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
Issuers sold 5.25 billion euros on Europe's debt capital markets on Tuesday, a day after stocks rallied strongly on hopes of central bank support.
UK analytics company Relx (L:REL) raised 2 billion euros of four, eight and 12-year bonds, while U.S. industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (N:HON), which recently saw a surge in demand for its protective face masks, priced 1 billion euros of four and 12-year bonds.
U.S. issuers, including Sherwin-Williams (N:SHW), Texas Instruments (O:TXN), McDonald's (N:MCD), Entergy (NYSE:ETR) Louisiana (N:ELJ) and  American Electric  Power (N:AEP), as well as Canada's  Canadian Pacific Railway  (TO:CP), raised $7.2 billion through bond sales on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv IFR data.
The borrowers, who had to put their deals on hold after investor meetings in late February, had to pay 10-15 basis points on top of what they would have paid prior to the coronavirus volatility, bankers said.
The German states of Hessen and Lower Saxony also sold bonds on Monday, alongside a covered bond - the safest type of bank bond - from German lender Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""Low beta and low exposure names to the [virus] outbreak in Europe and around the world are ideal candidates to come like this and if we see a further stabilization, potentially also on the back of increasing visibility on what the central banks’ reactions will be, it should continue,"" said Cem Keltek, credit strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. 
""The question we were trying to analyze is whether this is a single-day or multiple-day window. We obviously don't know right now,"" said Andrew Menzies, global co-head of corporate origination at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London, citing hopes for central bank stimulus.
Last week, a mere six deals raised just short of 10 billion euros on Europe's debt capital markets, according to data from Refinitiv IFR, as markets reacted to an acceleration of coronavirus cases outside China.
That was down from an average of 45 billion euros every week this year, according to a Reuters analysis of data from Refinitiv IFR. The U.S. market ground to a similar halt, with no high-yield or investment-grade corporate deals inked in the primary market last week.
RISK OFF?
While debt market participants are optimistic for the right credits, the situation is more challenging for virus-hit sectors as well as riskier, sub-investment grade and emerging market credits.
""The big test will be some sectors - for example for frequent borrowers, something like autos,"" said Rupert Lewis, head of European syndicate at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in London, citing the equity market's reaction to the sector and supply chains reliant on China.
U.S. miner  Cleveland Cliffs  (N:CLF) has been the only deal to price in U.S. high yield market since Feb. 24. It raised $750 million on Monday after the deal - initially marketed last week for $950 million - was restructured and resized. It is a similar story in Europe, where the last junk issuer to sell a bond was Catalent Pharma Solutions on Feb. 20.
High-yield debt issuers on both sides of the Atlantic had to postpone financings last week.
U.S. research contractor Pharmaceutical Product Development (O:PPD), which went public last month, Canadian eye care company Bausch + Lomb and several energy-linked names, including Canadian gas firm NorthRiver Midstream, held back deals in the last week, according to multiple sources with knowledge of those transactions.
In Europe, marine survey company  Fugro  (AS:FUGRc) suspended a 500 million euro bond sale last week.
Compared with the investment-grade market, high-yield issuance ""will be a lot slower to return because the equity market isn't giving them any back boost,"" said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities.
A number of emerging market deals have also been put on hold, according to capital markets sources, as debt sales from the sector shrank by more than a half in February compared with the previous month, according to Dealogic.
""Issuers still can place deals but they need to pay some new-issue premium, and in this environment maybe 15-20 basis points on top to place a deal successfully,"" said Sergey Dergechev, a fund manager at UBP."

HPE now expects 2020 free cash flow between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, down from its prior outlook of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund investor William Ackman on Tuesday said he has moved to protect the firm's $6.6 billion portfolio, which includes restaurant chain and hotel stocks, as the spread of the coronavirus has sparked prolonged panic selling in markets.
Ackman said he expects the outbreak, which has been detected in roughly 80 countries, to weigh on growth in the United States and abroad and affect both stock and credit markets.
Over the last 10 days, ""we have taken steps to protect the portfolio from downward market volatility,"" wrote Ackman, who oversees Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management. He declined to say exactly what steps he took.
Ackman spoke out on the same day that the Federal Reserve announced an emergency interest rate cut. Ackman's statement, an unusual move for someone who seldom discusses portfolio movements publicly, underscores investors' fears that the coronavirus will have serious implications for economic growth.
""We believe that efforts to contain the coronavirus are likely to have a substantial negative impact on the U.S. and global economies, and on equity and credit markets,"" the statement said.
Ackman said hedging was preferable to selling off his portfolio of companies whose businesses are otherwise strong and include Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG),  Hilton Worldwide  (N:HLT), home improvement chain Lowe's (N:LOW), Burger King operator Restaurant Brands International (TO:QSR) and Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa), among others. The hedge fund sold out of its position in Starbucks (O:SBUX) earlier in the year.
In the first two months of the year, the firm's Pershing Square Holdings portfolio fell 7.1%, after having gained 58.1% last year, which made it one of the industry's best-performing hedge funds. The market drop has taken a bite out of the size of Ackman's funds, according to a report which put assets under management at $6.6 billion at the end of February compared with $7.5 billion at the end of December."

In a statement posted on its website https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/meet01/2020AnnualMeetingSpecialAnnouncement.pdf, Berkshire said the meeting will take place as scheduled ""irrespective of conditions at that time.""
The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also said the scope of the meeting and related events ""may be modified by circumstances at the time,"" but it had no current plans to do so.
Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend, which Buffett refers to as Woodstock for Capitalists, is the largest gathering in corporate America.
It typically draws 40,000 or more people to Omaha for a three-day weekend that includes the meeting, discounts on products from Berkshire businesses, a picnic, a 5-kilometer run, and dinner for a select few at Gorat's steakhouse.
The meeting is scheduled to be live-streamed for a fifth year by Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance, letting people watch Buffett and longtime Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger answer five hours of shareholder questions without having to travel.
Many companies have restricted travel, including domestic travel, for employees in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which began in China and has spread to 80 nations.
Buffett told CNBC on Feb. 24 he expected that many of the several thousand visitors from China who typically visit Omaha for the Berkshire weekend will not attend this year.
The 89-year-old billionaire is widely popular in China, and prior meetings have been available through Yahoo Finance in Mandarin as well as English.

471,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 05:39PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 4,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Wall Street gave a thumbs down to the economic response to the effects of Covid-19 today, with stocks sinking again and bonds rallying sharply, pushing the 10-year yield below the 1% milestone.
There were hopes for global coordinated rate cuts, but the G7 statement only promised appropriate action.
Still, more easing could come from other central banks.
Then bond market will also have some economic data to react to, rather than just virus headlines, and oil traders get the latest U.S. inventory numbers.
Here are three things that could move markets tomorrow.
1 Bank of Canada Rate Cut Expected
The Bank of Canada will have its interest-rate meeting tomorrow, with expectations of it following the Federal Reserve growing.
The central bank’s decision will come at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
TD Securities said it expects a cut of 25 basis points tomorrow to 1.5% from 1.75%.
“We don't expect to see much in the way of forward guidance given the volatile backdrop,” it said.
“Data dependence will remain the bank's lodestar going forward, as they will tie the March rate cut to expected reductions in global growth,” it added. “We also expect they will cut by 25 bps in April, but the Bank won't want to signal anything until they have a better sense of COVID-19's growth implications and potential fiscal measures.”
2. ADP) Jobs, ISM Services on Tap
The bond market is jittery to say the least, although yields did end of lows today.
On the economic calendar for traders is the February private-sector jobs report from ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), which arrives at 8:15 AM ET (13:15 GMT).
Economists expect that ADP’s nonfarm employment measure showed a gain of 170,000 jobs last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
In all the excitement this week, investors would be forgiven for forgetting that the government’s jobs report arrives on Friday.
At 10:00 AM ET, the Institute of Supply Management will issues its measure of services activity.
The ISM non-manufacturing PMI is expected to have ticked down to 54.9 from 55.5.
And at 2:00 PM ET, the Fed will release its Beige Book report on regional economic conditions. Although given today’s intermeeting rate cut, its impact will be muted.
3. Oil Inventories Seen Rising
Oil prices jumped after the rate cut today, but ended mixed as the decline in equities accelerated and concerns about what OPEC might or might not do at its meeting this week persisted.
OPEC’s Vienna meeting starts on Thursday, with traders hoping Saudi Arabia and Russia (part of OPEC+) can agree on more production cuts.

The Seattle-based company has been struggling to attract shoppers at a time when they increasingly prefer retailers with a strong online presence such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT), as well as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Nordstrom expects to earn $3.25 to $3.50 per share in fiscal 2020, compared with analysts' estimates of $3.49 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said the forecast does not include any impact from the coronavirus outbreak.
Net earnings fell to $193 million, or $1.23 per share, in the three months ended Feb. 1, from $248 million, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier.
The reported quarter included a 19 cents per share charge related to the integration of Trunk Club stores and debt refinancing costs.
Total revenue rose to $4.54 billion from $4.48 billion, but fell short of estimates of $4.56 billion.

The company also said Erik Nordstrom would be its sole chief executive officer, as it moves away from its co-president structure.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co (TO:CNR) lost capacity equivalent to 10,000 carloads, or 1 million tonnes of grain exports, in February due to rail blockades by protesters opposed to a pipeline project, Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Ruest said on Tuesday.
Activists disrupted passenger and freight traffic last month to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en people, who are seeking to stop TC Energy Corp's (TO:TRP) Coastal GasLink pipeline from being built across their land. 
""In the case of CN we lost the equivalent of 10,000 carloads, or roughly 1 million tonnes,"" Ruest said in an interview. ""Of all the supply chains the one that will take the longest (to recover) is the grain export."" 
The lost capacity represents roughly 1% of Canada's total harvest during the 2019-20 marketing year, which runs from Aug. 1, 2019, through July 31, 2020.
Canada relies on CN, the country's largest railroad, and smaller rival  Canadian Pacific Railway  (TO:CP) to move crops, oil, potash, coal and manufactured goods to ports and the United States. 
The blockades, which shut some lines for weeks, hit “every commodity,"" creating backlogs of products sitting on CN railcars, along with product that ""has yet to enter our network,"" he said.
Ruest said CN did not move as much crude by rail as expected in February because of the blockades. He said he believes crude shipments will remain a driver of growth this year for CN, although weaker prices could impact output. 
Global crude price benchmarks have tumbled this year by more than one-fifth, due to fears that the coronavirus outbreak could sap global demand.
Earlier on Tuesday, CN said over 1,400 trains, including passenger trains, were delayed or canceled because of the blockades, causing shutdowns of parts of the company's network as freight is parked across the network, ready to be moved.
CN also confirmed a Reuters report from Friday that the company was calling back many of the 450 employees based in Eastern Canada who had been temporarily laid off because of the blockades.
Ruest said he hopes protesters will not target rail amid tensions over other pipeline projects. Along with Coastal GasLink, twinning is under way with the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain oil pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific coast near Vancouver, which also faces fierce opposition from environmental and some indigenous groups.
""It is a very costly way to resolve issues,"" Ruest said. ""I surely hope this is not the way of the future.”

Investing.com - Department store chain Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) fell on Tuesday as fourth-quarter earnings and sales fell short of analysts’ estimates. The company announced a board shakeup, scrapping its co-president structure to appoint Erik Nordstrom as a sole chief executive officer, and shrinking the maximum size of its board of directors to 10 people from 11. 
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) fell 7% in extended trading hours.
The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.42 a share on revenue of $4.54 billion, below consensus estimates for earnings of $1.47 a share on revenue of $4.56 billion. 
Growth was held back by higher costs from the growth of its loyalty program and planned occupancy costs related to the NYC flagship store, the company said.
Looking ahead, the company said it expected sales to increase by 1.5% to 2.5% in 2020, with earnings expected within a range of $3.25 to $3.50.

(Reuters) - The United States sued a unit of the drugmaker  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) Plc on Tuesday, accusing it of defrauding Medicaid out of hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of ""meteoric"" price increases for its biggest-selling drug, Acthar Gel.
Joining a civil whistleblower lawsuit filed in Boston federal court, the government said Mallinckrodt ARD LLC violated the federal False Claims Act by withholding Medicaid rebates related to Acthar, which now costs nearly $40,000 per vial.
The drug is used to treat spasms in infants as well as multiple sclerosis, and generated about 30% of Mallinckrodt's $3.16 billion of net sales in the Staines-upon-Thames, England-based company's latest fiscal year.
Mallinckrodt had sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last May over the calculation of Acthar rebates, and said the judge there has barred any enforcement action while the case was pending.
In a statement on Tuesday, Mallinckrodt accused the government of attempting an ""end-run"" around that case by filing ""an unnecessary, duplicative and wasteful lawsuit on the exact same issue.""
Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, drugmakers pay quarterly rebates to state Medicaid programs in exchange for Medicaid's coverage of their drugs.
The program shields Medicaid when drug prices rise faster than inflation, by calculating rebates based on a drug's price in 1990 or when the drug was first marketed, whichever is later.
But the government said that while Acthar was first marketed in 1952, Mallinckrodt and its predecessor Questcor calculated rebates as though marketing began in 2013, reflecting Acthar's then-recent regulatory approval to treat infantile spasms.
The government said Mallinckrodt's rebates did not reflect the increase in Acthar's price per vial to nearly $30,000 in 2013 from $50 in 2001, when Questcor acquired the drug, and that Mallinckrodt has defied government warnings to address this.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston: ""The government will always target this kind of exploitation of a program designed to provide health care to vulnerable members of our society.""
Mallinckrodt bought Questcor for about $5.8 billion in 2014.
The False Claims Act lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the government, and share in recoveries.
Mallinckrodt's whistleblower, Minnesota resident James Landolt, sued the company in September 2018.
In afternoon trading, Mallinckrodt shares were down 68 cents, or 16.1%, at $3.54. Their 52-week high is $25.33, set last March 4.

Investing.com – The S&P fell sharply on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve rate cut was largely shrugged off amid an ongoing spread of the coronavirus in the U.S.
The S&P 500 slumped 2.8%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.95%, or 789 points.
Washington state authorities now report nine deaths from Covid-19, while North Carolina reported its first case and New York reported its second.
The update on the spread of the virus in the U.S. arrived hours after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by half a point to a 1%-to-1.25% range.
But after brief rally, stocks reversed and followed Treasury yields lower.
""A move of this size, at or before the committee's next meeting on March 18, was already fully priced in financial markets after a statement from Chair Powell late last week suggested the Fed was ready and willing to take action,"" RBC said.
In afternoon trading, bonds saw a huge rallying, pushiing yields to unprecedented lows. The 10-Year Treasury yield fell below 1% for the first time ever to a low of 0.906% before paring some losses.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell sharply, with the latter down more than 5%.
Lower interest rates are typically a headwind for banks, weighing on net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
Technology stocks also led the move lower in the broader market, paced by a slump in chip stocks, which entered correction territory amid fears a slowdown in global growth could weigh on demand.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) ended the day in the red.
Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) canceled its annua Google developerl conference and also confirmed it has halted international employee travel amid concerns over the coronavirus impact.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, shrugged off a 1% rise in oil prices to close about 3% lower.
Homebuilders bucked the trend, however, as investors bet the Federal Reserve will continue to cut rates, pushing mortgage rates lower and boosting home demand.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 04:11PM ET</span>","Scared of Sanders presidency, Wall Street Dems double down on moderates","By Lawrence Delevingne, Mike Spector and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prominent Wall Street Democrats have been hatching strategies to ensure their presidential nominee will be a moderate, while also turning their attention to down-ticket candidates in congressional races as a ""hedge"" against that possibility, people involved with the efforts told Reuters.
At the center of discussions among those bankers, hedge-fund managers, private-equity bigwigs and prominent investors is this: making sure Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders does not get the nomination. Instead, they are primarily supporting former Vice President Joe Biden.
""He is the new hope of the moderates,"" said Mike Novogratz, a cryptocurrency investor and former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) partner and hedge fund manager. Novogratz said he's an ""anybody but Trump guy"" but would be pained to vote for Sanders.
Few of the 14 people Reuters spoke to wanted to be on the record for this story, but many said they are also happy to vote for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire with ties to Wall Street. Since he came into the race late, it is unclear how he will perform in ""Super Tuesday"" elections, where he will be a candidate for the first time across 14 U.S. states.
Some Wall Streeters are also putting money and energy behind Democrats who are challenging Republican incumbents in key congressional races. The candidates include Theresa Greenfield and Mark Kelly, who are attempting to flip GOP-held Senate seats in Iowa and Arizona, respectively.
A fundraising group called 2020 Senate Impact has attracted some of their support.
It is funneling money to races in Iowa, North Carolina, Texas and Arizona, among other states, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Major financial supporters include Political Action Committees (PACs) related to investment banks, private-equity and other investment firms.
The central watercooler debate among the Wall Street moneyed set has mostly been about whether they will have a presidential candidate they can stomach voting for.
Sanders has described himself as a socialist in the past, which rubs capitalists the wrong way. He supports progressive policies, like health insurance for all Americans, that would result in higher taxes for the rich and for corporations.
However, incumbent Republican President Donald Trump has rankled some of the establishment with conservative policies on immigration, trade and the environment, as well as his sometimes-uncouth demeanor.
On Sunday, Trump shrunk down behind a podium during a campaign event to make fun of Bloomberg's height. He has made offensive comments about women, Muslims and disabled people in the past.
While one major Democratic investor predicted his peers would ""sit out"" if it came to a Sanders-Trump contest, others said former Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein has represented the general Wall Street view in his public statements.
""I might find it harder to vote for Bernie than for Trump,"" Blankfein said in a recent Financial Times interview.
FEWER CHOICES
Democrats in finance are not alone in their feelings.
Americans across the board have struggled with which candidate to support, based on who represents their own interests as well as who is viewed as the most ""electable.""
It is also hard to tell how things will go ahead of Tuesday's primaries. Sanders has more delegates than any other candidate — six more than Biden — and polls have waffled, sometimes inaccurately, on which candidate is on top throughout the race.
The elimination of several other middle-of-the-road candidates in the presidential race — especially Pete Buttigieg, who dropped his bid on Sunday — has helped solidify Wall Street support behind Biden and Bloomberg, sources said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is another consideration. Although she has lost steam from the start of the primary contest, she has been able to raise substantial funds while also being a thorn in Bloomberg's side about his prior statements about women and sexual-harassment allegations at his company.
Florida-based hedge fund manager Michael Lewitt may have summed up the industry's view in his newsletter this week, asserting that Biden is the ""best candidate"" who could win battleground states, and that Bloomberg could also do a good job, but that Sanders would turn the country into mayhem with his policies on taxes, healthcare, banking and the like.
""I am proudly and publicly supporting Biden,"" Lewitt told Reuters. ""I am supporting Joe in every way possible."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields on Tuesday slid below 1% for the first time, after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by half a percentage point in an emergency move to ease the economic fallout from the fast-spreading coronavirus.
U.S. yields were down across the board after the Fed action, as investors grabbed safe-haven Treasuries amid the uncertainty.
In a statement, the central bank said it was cutting rates by 50 basis points to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. ""The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" it said.
Investors expected the U.S. rate cut after the Fed issued a statement late on Friday. But they did not expect the central bank to move so quickly ahead of a scheduled monetary policy meeting later this month.
""At first, it looked like it was positive, but now stocks are selling off and rates are rallying,"" said Paula Solanes, senior portfolio manager, at SVB Asset Management in San Francisco.
""Maybe part of this is the fact that it's sinking in that the coronavirus is very real and may have ramifications for the U.S. economy, aside from the global economy. And we don't yet understand the magnitude of it all,"" she added.
In late afternoon trading, U.S. 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) fell to 1%, from 1.088% late on Monday. Earlier in the session, 10-year yields hit a record low of 0.906%.
Yields on U.S. 30-year bonds (US30YT=RR) were at 1.622%, down from 1.645% on Monday. They touched an all-time trough of 1.507%.
On the short end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields fell to 0.712% from Monday's 0.878% (US2YT=RR). They touched 0.628%, the lowest in nearly four years.
The rates future market has raised bets for another cut at the April policy meeting.
""The Fed kind of botched the operation here. They didn't need to cut rates because it wouldn't do anything to prevent the virus from spreading,"" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco.
""Once again, the Fed gave into the market and I think this has unnerved investors. The whole thing appears ill-conceived,"" she added.
The yield curve steepened after the Fed announcement, with the spread between the two-year and 10-year widening to 28.8 basis points from 25.8 basis points on Monday.
John Herrmann, rates strategist at MUFG Securities in New York, said his firm's models continue to forecast another 25- basis-point cut by the policy meeting next month, and possibly another cut after that meeting."

(Reuters) - Wall Street tumbled in a volatile session on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve surprised investors with a half percentage-point cut in interest rates, amplifying fears about the magnitude of the coronavirus' impact on the economy.
All three major U.S. stock market indexes dropped more than 3% after the Fed's first emergency rate cut since the 2008 financial crisis. 
The rate reduction underscored the Fed's concern about the coronavirus that has spread around the world after emerging late last year in China. It came two weeks ahead of a scheduled policy meeting, where traders had fully priced in a 50 basis point cut.
Stocks had initially jumped more than 1%, but then dropped as traders worried whether pumping more money into financial markets would address the central problem - a drop in business activity as workers and consumers stay home.
""The rate cut underscores the magnitude of the problem that the global economy is facing,"" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny's Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York.
""Normally, markets would welcome a rate cut, and they were hoping for it. Now that we've got it, the question is, what's next?""
The 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1% for the first time ever as nervous investors moved money out of the stock market.
The S&P financials index tumbled 3.7%, reflecting banks' difficulty in making profits in low-interest rate environments.
Wall Street on Friday had its biggest weekly decline in more than a decade as growing cases of the flu-like virus outside China fanned fears of a global recession. 
Earlier on Tuesday, Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors pledged appropriate actions to support their economies.
""There is a real fear that things are going to get worse and there is no point in waiting for these fears to be realized,"" Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago, said of the Fed's rate cut. ""You can always undo the rate cut if it fails to materialize.""
At 2:28 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 3.35% at 25,810.05 points, while the S&P 500 lost 3.25% to 2,989.76.
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.54% to 8,635.25.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, with the information technology index slumping 4.6%. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell 5% and 4%, respectively.

484,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>","What Market Didn’t Like About Powell: Scant Tools, Short Answers","(Bloomberg) -- If for no other reason than he paused a seven-day plunge that erased $6 trillion, Jerome Powell deserves the thanks of stock bulls. The S&P 500 is up about 6% from when he first mulled rate cuts on Friday, and anyone who lived through last week is glad for the respite.
Going by the reaction today, however, it’s clear there is anxiety mixed with the gratitude.
Even as the Federal Reserve chief delivered additional stimulus, he acknowledged that this easing is insufficient to solve the myriad economic and health risks posed by the coronavirus. That’s self-evident, but a message neither businesses nor consumers were ever likely to take in stride.
Nor investors. The S&P 500 Index was up 0.5% before Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference at 11 a.m. New York time. By the time he was done taking questions, stocks were down about 1.8% at session lows.
“He’s cutting and he essentially undercuts his own decision, by noting that the Fed’s tools are inadequate,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research. “It’s important to state the obvious in times of market panic when it’s helpful to you, but it’s also important to know when not to do that.”
Powell was asked about what changed between last week, when a litany of Fed speakers indicated a no cut was imminent, and today. He cited the broader spread of the virus, including to the U.S., and the risk to the outlook for the economy.
What he didn’t mention was the shift in financial conditions from the stock market’s last all-time high on Feb. 19 to last Friday, a move akin to nearly 50 basis points of tightening. While he brought up “significant movement in financial markets,” hard-to-console equity investors may have wanted more acknowledgment of their plight.
Powell kept his answers brief, saying nothing to suggest any unorthodox or more creative remedies are being weighed. He indicated the central bank didn’t discuss any tools besides rate cuts as part of the policy response right now. That also may be worrying the markets.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, for instance, called for the Fed to “offer low-cost loans to companies that agree to support their workers and that need a little help to make it through the next several months.”
“I thought there were three problems,” tweeted Dominic White, chief economist at Absolute Strategy Research in London. “1. He might as well have said ‘nah, there’s no coordination going on here.’ 2. The stuff about the economic effects. 3. He practically ruled out anything other than rate cuts.”
Of course, not all take such a downbeat view of Powell’s performance. Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, called it his best yet.
“Very clear on many issues,” he wrote. “Are we seeing credit stress: not really. Is this coordinated G-7 action: we’re acting on our own, but more coordinated action may come. Honest about huge degree of uncertainty, which of course itself validates the cut.”"

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – Wall Street fell sharply Tuesday, paced by financials amid a plunge in U.S. Treasury yields to record lows on expectations for more Federal Reserve rate cuts and worries over the ongoing coronavirus spread in the U.S.

The S&P 500 sank 2.5%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.8%, or 740 points. 

A Westchester County man has tested positive for the coronavirus, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday, bringing the total of confirmed cases in the state to two and to more than 100 in the country overall. 
The number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. increased by 17 over 24 hours, with at least six deaths reported so far and as many as 108 infected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Against the backdrop of rising infections in the U.S., the Federal Reserve delivered a surprise half-a-point rate cut on Tuesday, taking its benchmark rate to 1% to 1.25%.

With the virus impact mainly on the supply side, many have questioned how much the Federal Reserve's move will support the economy. Still, the move has raised expectations for more cuts in the coming weeks, sending U.S. Treasury yields to record lows. 
The United States 10-Year yield fell below 1% for the first time ever, forcing banking stocks even deeper into the red. It set an all-time low of 0.906%.
 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell sharply, with the latter down more than 5%. 
Lower interest rates are typically a headwind for banks, weighing on net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders."

489,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>","Fed rate cut soothes, then spooks virus-weary investors","By Rodrigo Campos
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors had mixed reactions to Tuesday’s surprise 50 basis-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve, helping fuel a day of swings in stocks and other assets.
The U.S. central bank cut interest rates in a bid to shield the economy from the impact of the spreading coronavirus, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the threat to the economy would not soon abate.
While lower rates may stoke risk appetite and offer support to asset prices, some saw the Fed’s move as a signal that the accelerating coronavirus outbreak may deal a larger-than-anticipated blow to the U.S. economy.
""The rate cut underscores the magnitude of the problem that the global economy is facing,” said Peter Kenny, founder at Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York. ""Normally, markets would welcome a rate cut, and they were hoping for it. Now that we've got it, the question is what's next.""
The S&P 500 reversed losses and rose by as much as 1.5% after the move was announced Tuesday morning, before dropping back into the red. The index was recently down 2.7%.
The dollar, which becomes less attractive to yield-seeking investors when rates fall, was off 0.4% and yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note (US10YT=RR) hit a fresh low below 1%.
The Fed’s move, in theory, makes it cheaper to access loans that could help companies during economically uncertain times and buoy consumer spending. Lower rates also make it cheaper for market participants to borrow money for purchasing stocks and other assets.
At the same time, lower rates would do little to allay the concerns of travelers who are reluctant to book trips in the midst of a global outbreak, or boost economic activity in areas experiencing the kind of restrictions that shut down parts of China’s economy last month.
""If consumers slow down you're going to see some small business owners get into trouble. This can help and this is what the Fed can offer,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
However, with the containment of the virus nowhere in sight, ""the stock market has not discounted the possibility that the U.S. economy would stall to a lockdown,"" said Krosby.
The Fed's move was the first unscheduled rate cut since October 2008, when the central bank reacted to a contraction in the economy that had begun the previous year.
Similar moves from the Fed have tended to occur during moments of market stress, and have not always buoyed stock markets over the longer term.
On average, the S&P has fallen 5.26% in the two weeks prior to non-scheduled cuts, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. In the year after a non-scheduled cut, the index has averaged a decline of 8.87% with gains in just two out of seven instances.
Some market participants had been anticipating a move from the Fed. The Dow surged over 5% on Monday while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each jumped more than 4% in a major rebound sparked partly by expectations of coordinated action from the world’s central banks.
""I think it spooked investors after the strong rebound, because it was made right away and it was 50 basis points. So it was larger than people (were expecting), and some may be thinking, 'Ooh, are things worse than we think?'"" said Alan Lancz, president at Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio."

""The business obviously slowed,"" said UPS Chief Financial Officer Brian Newman while speaking at a Raymond James investors conference. Newman said although it was too early for UPS to quantify the impact of the disruption, the company was seeing a rebound in demand this week as fresh cases of infections slowed.
""Our planes are flying in and out of China right now...I think we're trying to position ourselves to take advantage of some pent-up demand,"" Newman said.
Smaller rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX) also said it continues to operate inbound and outbound flights to and from affected countries but work and travel restrictions could delay some shipments.
""We are taking recommended precautions in terms of pilot, team member and customer health and safety,"" FedEx told Reuters in an email.
There are almost 91,000 coronavirus cases globally of which more than 80,000 are in China. Infections have appeared in 77 other countries and territories, with Ukraine the latest to report its first case."

""We would rather have two healthy competitors,"" Lufthansa Group Chief Executive Carsten Spohr told an aviation conference on Tuesday.
The deal would see Embraer cede 80% of its commercial arm to Boeing, but has been slowed by a European Union competition probe expected to last until the end of April.
The EU is worried that whirlwind consolidation triggered first by Canadian Bombardier's decision to exit the market by selling a key program to Airbus (PA:AIR), and then the integration of rival Embraer into Boeing, would leave too little choice.
But several airlines have backed the Boeing-Embraer deal, suggesting Brazil's Embraer would not remain viable as a standalone competitor to a combination of Europe's Airbus and the Bombardier CSeries aircraft program, now renamed A220.
Spohr said Lufthansa, which was the launch customer for the CSeries, had supported its takeover by Airbus after Bombardier ran short of funds needed to bring the 110-130-seat jet to market, and was now ready to back the Boeing-Embraer deal."

The Green Party says it is in the interests of business to introduce sharp cuts to carbon emissions to avoid hugely costly disruption to global climate patterns. A key measure it is planning is the re-introduction of an Irish air passenger travel tax, which was scrapped in 2011.
With 12 of 160 parliamentary seats, the Green Party likely to be a kingmaker when it comes to forming a government and is expected to join two of the three big parties - centre-right Fine Gael and Fianna Fail or left-wing nationalist Sinn Fein - which each have just under a quarter of the seats.
But forming a government could take months. It took 70 days to form an administration after the last election in 2016.
O'Leary, whose airline Ryanair is one of the biggest carbon emitters in Europe, has in the past called environmentalists ""luddites"".
""By all means I think you put all the lunatics in government and let them deal with reality. It's a far better outcome than keeping them on opposition benches where they never have to confront reality,"" O'Leary told Reuters.
""I've never been concerned about the Greens entering government in any of the European countries.""
""In many respects it's good to have the Greens in government because you tend to have more sensible polices than the wish-lists they produce in opposition.""
O'Leary said he was similarly sanguine about Sinn Fein in government, whose economic policies he described as ""nuts"".
Sinn Fein stunned the establishment by beating the two centre-right parties that have led every government in Ireland's history, attracting a new generation of voters with promises on housing, childcare and insurance costs, alongside its historic goal of reunifying the British region of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland.
""I think by all means ... let them loose in government and say, right, now let's see how you do. I think they'll do particularly badly and they'll roll back on most of their policy initiatives,"" he said
""As they say, campaigning is poetry and governing is prose."""

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said on Tuesday that will launch new bank accounts to limit overdraft fees for customers.
One bank account will charge a $5 monthly fee, exclude checks, and limit spending to the amount available within the account. Customers who want to be able to write checks can opt for an account that limits overdraft fees to one per month for a $10 monthly fee.
The new accounts are expected to launch early next year.
Other Wells Fargo deposit accounts give customers the option to avoid a monthly fee so long as their account meets certain requirements like having a direct deposit or making a number of purchases per month.
Overdraft fees have drawn scrutiny from regulators and politicians for years since they are typically only paid by customers with the least money. In 2009 the Federal Reserve issued a rule that prevented banks from charging overdraft fees on ATM and one-time debit card transactions unless the customer opted into overdraft protection. The rule did not apple to recurring payments like subscriptions and auto-pay.
Since the beginning of 2020 Wells Fargo has received dozens of complaints related to overdraft fees, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau database.
Wells Fargo has taken a number of measures to help customers avoid overdraft fees. In 2017 the bank started provided real-time balance alerts to customers whenever their account fall to zero or less, stopped charging fees on accounts that were overdrawn by less than $5, and introduced a overdraft rewind feature that refunded fees charged when a covering direct deposit was received the next day. The moves have been a drag on fee income for the bank."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A big victory by Bernie Sanders in Tuesday's contests for the Democratic presidential nomination could add volatility to a market already consumed by the spread of the coronavirus and its economic fallout, analysts and investors said.
Some investors say the resurgence of former vice president Joe Biden in the race has been a positive factor for stocks, setting the stage for pressure should Sanders do better than expected on Super Tuesday, in which voters in 14 states are heading to the polls with delegate-rich California and Texas among those up for grabs.
To be sure, investor attention is more focused on the spread of the coronavirus, with stocks fluctuating wildly on Tuesday as Wall Street tried to digest the implications of the Federal Reserve's emergency rate cut.
But the election remained at least a background risk, as investors put it, with a strong showing by Sanders, a democratic socialist, seen as possibly wounding stocks.
“If Sanders is a big winner...I think the market will take it negatively come tomorrow,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
(Get all the Super Tuesday action: https://www.reuters.com/live-events/super-tuesday-id2923975) 
Sanders' favored policies, including Medicare for All legislation that would essentially abolish private insurance as well as regulation in areas such as the environment and banking, appear particularly negative for sectors such as healthcare, energy and financials, according to a note on Tuesday from Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
A presidential victory in the Nov. 3 election by Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is seen by analysts at RBC Capital Markets as a bearish or very bearish outcome for 79% of the industries they cover, Calvasina said.
By contrast, the election of Biden is seen as a neutral outcome by most investors surveyed by RBC, ""though the percent that have seen him as a bullish outcome was actually on the rise in our December survey,"" Calvasina said.
Betting odds have strengthened for Biden, according to online betting site PredictIt, after the former vice president's commanding win in the South Carolina primary over the weekend and endorsements from fellow moderates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar after they dropped out of the race.
As of midday Tuesday, ""Yes"" bets for Biden on the question of ""Who will win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination?"" were trading at 51 cents on PredictIt, compared to 40 cents for Sanders. 
Sanders still leads Biden in polls for the nomination, 27% to 21.3%, according to an average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.
""If Biden’s current momentum...carries him through Super Tuesday, political risk premium in the markets should fall,"" strategists at Natwest Markets said in a note.
Investors will be watching not only whether Sanders wins but how much support he gathers, given that some on Wall Street are skeptical he can gain enough backing to beat President Donald Trump in November, even if Sanders wins the nomination.

""Strong wins with expanding polling levels to 35+% would be indicative of being a stronger general election candidate,"" Lance Wilkes, a healthcare analyst at Bernstein, said in a note.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments said on Tuesday operating profit in 2019 climbed 10% to $6.9 billion as investors pushed their cash into money-market and passively managed products while pulling billions of dollars from actively managed stock funds.
FMR LLC, the owner of Boston-based Fidelity, said its collection of financial services and diversified businesses generated revenue of $20.9 billion, up from $20.4 billion in 2018. Fidelity is privately held and controlled by the family of Chairman Abigail Johnson.
As the stock market surged last year, Fidelity clients plowed $121 billion into money-market funds and $66 billion into index funds. By contrast, Fidelity's actively managed direct-to-investor stock products were hit with $65 billion in net redemptions, up from $51 billion in 2018.
Nevertheless, Fidelity's mutual funds produced relative returns that beat most of their peers over the short term and for the long haul.
""Our job was made easier by the fact, overall, 74% of their offerings beat their peers"" on a one-year basis, said John Bonnanzio, an editor of the Fidelity Monitor & Insight newsletter for retail investors.
Over a five-year performance period, Fidelity funds beat 78% of peers, the company said.
Overall, net asset flows to Fidelity's platform totaled $315 billion in 2019, a 2% increase from the previous year.

524,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 01:08PM ET</span>",Hudson's Bay Co Chairman Richard Baker to take over as CEO,"By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC) Chairman Richard Baker will take over as chief executive officer, the company said on Tuesday, after his bid to take the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue private was approved by shareholders.
Reuters reported earlier on Tuesday that Baker would take over from current CEO Helena Foulkes, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Foulkes, who has been at the helm since 2018, will step down effective March 13, Hudson's Bay said in a statement. 
""The company and I are grateful for Helena's leadership and significant accomplishments over the last two years,"" Baker said in the statement. ""We are confident in our go-forward leadership team and our ability to drive HBC forward.""
The move comes just days after shareholders approved the Canadian department store operator's move to go private in a C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) deal.
Baker and his partners were in a tussle with the company's top shareholders over the deal.
The retail mogul had previously fallen short of necessary votes to win approval for his take-private quest, Reuters reported last year. He later won the support of a significant shareholder after raising the offer price to C$11 per share.
The privatization deal was completed on Tuesday, the company said, and its common shares are expected to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange at the close of trading on March 4.
""This is a great outcome for HBC and all of its stakeholders... It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC's potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,"" said Baker.
Hudson's Bay has been shutting stores and selling assets as it sharpens its focus on luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue and its namesake stores in Canada.

Last year, the company announced the sale of its Lord + Taylor department store business to fashion rental service company Le Tote for about $100 million. It also sold its remaining stake in its German real estate venture last year for C$1.5 billion.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 12:49PM ET</span>",Thermo Fisher agrees to buy genetic tester Qiagen in $11.5 billion deal,"By Christoph Steitz, Ludwig Burger and Rebecca Spalding
FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (N:TMO) said on Tuesday it agreed to acquire German genetic testing company  Qiagen  NV (DE:QIA) (N:QGEN) in an $11.5 billion deal as the U.S.-based company looks to bolster its health diagnostic business.
Qiagen, which has its main operations in Germany but is headquartered in the neighbouring Netherlands, is one of the world's largest suppliers of products to prepare tissue and blood samples for advanced testing.
These genetic tests play a major role in research and treatment of cancer, infectious diseases and genetic disorders.
Last month it also began shipping a new rapid testing kit for the coronavirus to hospitals in China. The outbreak has claimed more than 3,000 lives and infected more than 90,000 people globally, after spreading from China to 77 other countries and territories
At 39 euros per share, Thermo Fisher's cash offer was accepted at a 23% premium to Qiagen's closing price on Monday, Qiagen said, adding that the bid valued the company at 10.4 billion euros ($11.5 billion), including 1.26 billion euros in net debt.
Qiagen shares rose 18% on the news to 37.5 euros, on track for their best daily gain in two decades.Thermo Fisher, which has a market valuation of around $120 billion, is the leading maker of instruments, software and other services for scientific research, including the vaccines and diagnostic tests now under development to combat coronavirus.
Thermo Fisher fist approached Qiagen about a potential takeover last year, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the details are confidential. 
In December, Qiagen ended the talks because it was not satisfied with the price offered and harbored concerns about the deal getting past antitrust regulators, one of the sources added. 
Marc Casper, Thermo Fisher's chief executive officer, said that the instrumentation giant had long considered Qiagen a potential strategic partner. Qiagen's coronavirus testing capabilities were not a significant part of the deal's rationale, he added.""Deals happen when they happen,"" Casper said in an interview. ""When we got into the last few weeks, things really accelerated here. We were able to come to a price and deal terms that both companies felt are compelling.""
Shares in Thermo Fisher rose 3.5% to $315.50 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The deal was the second to be announced this week in the healthcare sector, illustrating how some companies are braving the current market volatility to pursue deals. On Monday,  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) said it would buy smaller biotechnology company  Forty Seven  Inc (O:FTSV) for its research in immuno-oncology in a $4.9 billion deal. 
QIAGEN'S TOUGH YEAR
The acquisition of Qiagen, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021, will immediately add to Thermo Fisher's earnings after the deal closes, the companies said.
Thermo Fisher said the deal would generate $200 million in savings by three years after the deal's close.
Jefferies analysts said they had long viewed Qiagen's strong position in research labs, plus front-end prep for molecular diagnostics as attractive to larger life science conglomerates.
For Qiagen, the deal comes after a tumultuous few months. The company's long-serving CEO Peer Schatz resigned in October when it announced a reversal of its strategy, saying it would stop developing its next-generation genome sequencing machines and instead collaborate with industry leader Illumina (O:ILMN).
JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) served as financial advisers to Thermo Fisher, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz provided legal counsel.
For Qiagen, Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is lead financial advisor and  Barclays  (L:BARC) is serving as financial adviser, while De Brauw Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Westbroek NV, Linklaters LLP and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo P.C. are serving as legal counsel.

Investing.com - Wall Street lost its enthusiasm for the Federal Reserve fairly quickly Tuesday and stocks slumped in morning trading after a short press conference from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell ended.
The major indexes were slightly in the red when Powell started speaking and selling began in earnest when he suggest the FOMC was now in wait-and-see mode.
The S&P 500 fell 1.75%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5%.
Shortly before the press conference President Donald Trump tweeted that the Fed needed to do more than its emergency half-point cut today to pull rates down in line with other countries.
But Powell again dismissed politics playing any consideration in Fed action and also opened the door to a possible rate hike if Covid-19 is contained, saying the Fed would act if the situation were appropriate to change policy.
While acknowledging the Fed move will have no impact on the transmission of the virus or impact on supply chains, he said the cut will have a meaningful impact to the economy.
“The Fed panicked which they're very good at doing and it was a mistake,"" said Michael O'Rourke, a strategist with Jones Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
""The Fed cutting rates by 50 basis points now is not going to get people to go to the movies or to conferences, sporting events or any large gatherings.""
The U.S. central bank cut rates three times in 2019 and has since held the fire amid signs of improving growth after the striking of a ""Phase One"" trade deal between the United States and China.
The main U.S. stock indexes had closed more than 4% higher on Monday after their worst week since 2008, as central banks in Japan and the European Union joined the Federal Reserve in signaling further monetary easing.

The S&P 500 turned lower after spiking as much as 1.50% following the central bank’s 50 basis point cut of its benchmark rate. The two-year Treasury yield tumbled to 0.78%, while the 10-year plunged below 1.08%. Banks led losses on benchmarks.
“Does a 50 basis point cut change things? That’s a tough one to answer,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). “It could perhaps help the credit markets, especially primary markets that are currently somewhat frozen. But Fed cuts tend be less effective in situations like this when there is a supply and demand shock.”
Investors had piled out of risk assets last week as the spreading virus threatened to derail global growth, only to pour back in Monday in anticipation of concerted action from Group of Seven officials. Oil continued its rebound Tuesday, approaching $48 a barrel, while gold also rose. The yen was higher versus the dollar.
The OECD warned that growth will sink to levels not seen in more than a decade and ever more businesses are warning about the impact of the illness. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the Federal Reserve “should ease and cut rate big.”
The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said it would take all necessary steps to help the economy. Australia lowered its benchmark by a quarter percentage point. Its currency rose, however, underscoring how traders’ expectations have rapidly shifted in recent days.

Coronavirus has brought some cities in China and Europe to a standstill, disrupting supply chain and denting travel demand, and prompting companies to withdraw their financial outlook while they assess the damage from the virus.
That has reduced expectations for an end to corporate earnings recession in 2020.
Companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) are now expected to report a 1.4% drop in profits in the Jan-March quarter, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv. That is a sharp reversal from a 5% jump expected in early February.
""Expectation of an inflection in earnings growth are dampened with the likely negative economic impact from the coronavirus,"" said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at TFS Derivatives in London.
There were numerous warnings from companies in the ongoing reporting season, Ekolo added.
With the December quarter earnings season nearly over, the data showed profits are set to decline 2.6%, a further deterioration from the 1.2% expected last week.

After their worst slump since the financial crisis, U.S. shares surged on Monday as central banks signaled a unified response to any impact from the spreading coronavirus that threatens to tip the global economy into recession. But Quadriga Asset Managers’s Diego Parrilla says buyers should beware.
“This could become a textbook bull trap: the market rallies, you think it’s over, mommy and daddy are going to intervene,” said Parrilla, referring to central banks and governments. “If this doesn’t really play out, it’s game over.” His $250 million Quadriga Igneo fund surged about 10% last month.
Buying the dip has been one of the most profitable trades over the past decade as central banks have repeatedly intervened and eased monetary policy. That’s kept the longest bull-market rally on record humming and investors counting on even more stimulus should the virus threaten economic growth. Indeed, the Reserve Bank of Australia kicked off the expected global response on Tuesday with a quarter-point rate cut.
This time around, the stimulus could prove impotent. Haidar Capital Management’s Said Haidar expects the spread of the virus, which has so far infected more than 90,000 people and killed over 3,100, to drag out. Efforts to contain it are having a serious negative effect on economies around the globe and central banks’ easing won’t turn them around, he says.
Investors have been “trained like monkeys to buy the dip,” said New York-based Haidar, whose Jupiter Fund gained 7.8% in February. “If you look back far enough, there were periods when buying the dips were a disaster and could be again this time.”
Haidar and Parrilla aren’t alone in their warnings. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said last week that investors should look to protect their portfolios and resist the urge to buy the dip, while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists Zach Pandl and Kamakshya Trivedi said the drawdown in risky assets has further to go.
Not everyone is taking heed: many hedge funds piled in last week as the market plunged into a correction. Their purchases got more frenetic than any time in more than two years on Thursday, when the S&P 500 dropped 4.4%, according to data compiled by Morgan Stanley’s unit that lends money and settles trades for hedge funds.
Haidar’s $650 million hedge fund is now up almost 23% this year after a 31% gain in 2019, according to a letter to investors seen by Bloomberg. Madrid-based Parrilla’s fund is up almost 20% in the first two months, he said.
The two are emerging as some of the biggest winners in the old-fashioned macro trading world. Such traders shift through trends in global economies and geopolitics to bet on everything from currencies to interest rates to stock indexes. Their strategies are rebounding from years of mediocre returns amid unprecedented monetary easing and depressed volatility.
Last week’s sell off sent Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, soaring.
‘Something Bigger’
“I fear this could be the beginning of something bigger,” Parrilla said. “It happened to be the coronavirus, but to be honest, it could have been anything.”
Parrilla made money last month through options trades that benefited from rising gold, U.S. dollars and treasuries and declines in the S&P 500 index and emerging market currencies. He expects gold to continue its surge and a devaluation in China’s currency as the country is forced to stimulate its economy. Shorting yuan “is the biggest macro trade in generations,” he said.
Haidar had been betting on haven assets such as gold, swiss francs, yen and bonds. He said investors should be long bond markets globally because they’ll rally regardless of whether central banks cut rates.
“Will stocks rally if they cut rates? I am actually skeptical,” he said."

The largest U.S. oil company laid out the guidelines it follows - some of which have been rolled back by the Trump administration - at a time when the industry faces growing pressure from investors to reduce its environmental footprint.
The world’s top oil and gas companies are under heavy pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.
Exxon and U.S. rival  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) have been far less ambitious with their greenhouse gas reduction targets than their European rivals.
 BP  (LON:BP) Plc in February set one of the oil sector’s most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions, including getting emissions from its operations and barrels produced to net zero.
Exxon will hold its annual investor meeting on Thursday and is expected to detail its climate goals.
Exxon started its methane reduction program in 2017 in its shale fields and has been able to reduce emissions by 20%. It has since started rolling out the methane guidelines to the rest of the company, which ""demonstrate what’s practicable and achievable,” said Chief Executive Darren Woods.
The program includes leak detection and repair, having companies report their total methane emissions and minimizing venting, the release of unburned methane, which is far more environmentally harmful than flaring it.
Exxon's announcement came early Tuesday during the annual investor day presentation for its chief U.S. rival, Chevron Corp, which has tied compensation to the reduction of methane emissions.
Last year, the rivals rolled out ambitious production plans for the Permian Basin on the same day, setting up a showdown in the top U.S. shale field."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) on Tuesday said it would keep its spending in check and return up to $80 billion to shareholders over the next five years, with Chief Executive Mike Wirth making the case that his company is the oil major best able to produce oil and generate profits at the lowest cost.
The No. 2 U.S. oil producer laid out its plan to weather what is turning into one of the most challenging markets in years, as coronavirus concerns dent short-term demand and environmental and investor pressures cloud the longer-term outlook for the industry.
Oil prices are down 20% this year and natural gas prices have fallen to their lowest since the 1990s. Industry returns have lagged the broader market for a decade, souring investors. European majors like  BP  Plc (L:BP) have set significant commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their operations.
Chevron's Wirth, however, laid out a long-term case for growing global demand for oil and gas.
“The world will need more of what we produce, not less,” Wirth said. Chevron currently produces about 3 million barrels of oil daily.
Chevron will stick to its previously announced capital spending plan of $19 billion to $22 billion annually through 2024, setting it apart from chief U.S. rival  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), which is spending heavily to boost production.
But the company has based its plans on a $60 international oil price, about $7 higher than current prices, and is working toward “increased growth in a world which looks to not need it,” analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said.
Returning cash to shareholders is the ""number one priority,"" Wirth said in a meeting with analysts and investors in New York.

The top U.S. shale field will continue to drive Chevron’s oil growth, and the company expects ""sustained production over 1 million barrels per day in the Permian Basin through 2040 at relatively flat activity levels,"" said Jay Johnson, executive vice president. Chevron reached 514,000 barrels per day of output in the field at the end of 2019, up 36% in a year.
Chevron and Exxon are racing to boost Permian output, but Chevron has owned land in the Permian for decades, which gave it a zero cost of entry into that shale boom.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned lower again on Tuesday, after the disappointment of a G7 conference call that stopped short of announcing concrete measures to support the global economy as it struggles with the spreading coronavirus outbreak.
The G7 statement was strong on principle but short on detail, saying: “finance ministers are ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy during this phase. G7 central banks will continue to fulfil their mandates, thus supporting price stability and economic growth while maintaining the resilience of the financial system.”
Markets had entertained – arguably unrealistic – hopes of immediate measures to deal with what is a shock to both supply and demand across the world economy.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 225 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 contract was down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%.
Among individual companies, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 0.6%, reversing an early gain after its biggest manufacturing contractor Hon Hai Precision said it expected its Chinese factories to be working roughly as normal by the end of March.

  Target   (NYSE:TGT) stock was up 1.0% after the retailer reported adjusted earnings per share up 10.6% from a year earlier in the final quarter of 2019 – some 2.5% ahead of expectations. 
For 2020,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) said it expects a low-single digit increase in comparable sales and a mid-single digit increase in operating income.
The company made no mention of any potential impact from the Covid-19 outbreak. Earlier in the day, German consumer group Beiersdorf – the maker of Nivea hand cream – had said it was impossible to quantify the virus’ impact on the outlook for this year and refused to factor it into its forecasts for the year."

581,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 08:46AM ET</span>","BMW, Daimler aim to cut emissions 20% this year with new electric models","By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - New electric models will help BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) cut emissions from the cars they sell by an average of 20% this year, the German automakers predicted on Tuesday, as they strive to meet tough new European pollution rules.
In a live-streamed event, following the cancellation of this week's Geneva motor show due to the coronavirus epidemic, BMW presented the i4 four-door coupe with a driving range of up to 600 kilometers, one of a number of new electric models it hopes will stimulate demand for battery-driven cars.
In a separate webcast, Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler was also bullish about prospects for its growing range of electric cars.
The European Union set automakers a target to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 40% between 2007 and 2021, and has demanded a further 37.5% reduction by 2030.
But pollution levels from cars have been rising as customers increasingly chose to buy gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles (SUV), meaning automakers need to ramp up sales of electric cars if they are to avoid hefty fines from 2021.
They have a mountain to climb. Average fleet emissions for cars in Europe rose for the third year in a row in 2019, with electric vehicles making up only 6% of overall registrations, analysts at JATO Dynamics said on Tuesday.
BMW already has 500,000 electric and hybrid cars on the road and plans to double that number by the end of next year, including through the launch of the i4 and an iX3 SUV as well as an electric version of its Mini.
Sales of battery electric and hybrid vehicles are already up by 43% so far this year, BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse said.
""We believe that we can keep the impact on profits under control,"" he added, pledging that every car sold would be profitable.
Electric cars are generally more expensive to build than petrol or diesel-powered vehicles. But BMW said it was saving money, including by delaying the development of a next-generation Mini, to free up resources for the electric campaign.
""If a vehicle architecture does not need to be renewed, then we do not do it,"" Zipse said, adding the Mini was being renewed constantly by updating the powertrain and infotainment options. Around 7,000 electric Mini's have been ordered so far, he added.
Daimler, meanwhile, is promoting hybrid cars including a new CLA Shooting Brake, as well as the Mercedes-Benz EQC electric SUV and an electric van, the V-class, as part of its drive to reduce emissions by 20% this year.
""We are within striking distance of meeting the target,"" Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius said. Mercedes-Benz plans to build 50,000 EQC vehicles this year.
Kaellenius declined to comment on the profitability of electric vehicles. ""We don't communicate individual margins. Electrification is a headwind,"" he said.
Separately, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) announced the launch of the ID4, a fully electric SUV with an operating range of up to 500 kilometers, which will go on sale in Europe, China and the United States, and start production this year."

Investing.com - Dow futures erased gains on Tuesday after G7 finance officials stopped short of committing to specific actions to offset fallout in the global economy from the coronavirus outbreak.
By around 07:45 AM ET (1245 GMT) Dow futures were down 9 points, erasing gains of more than 250 points earlier in the day. S&P 500 futures were 0.4% lower while Nasdaq 100 futures were almost unchanged for day.
The G-7 said in a statement they will use policy tools to curb an economic slowdown, but the group did not agree to any coordinated action.
The premarket losses came a day after the Dow surged over 5% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each jumped more than 4% in a major rebound following last week's steep sell-off sparked by fears about the coronavirus.
It was the strongest one-day gain for the Dow since 2009, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each had their strongest one-day rise since December 2018.
Markets had been boosted by hopes for a coordinated policy response from governments and central banks to deal with the risks to the global economy posed by the outbreak.
The decision to hold a G7 call came after the head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, on Monday joined the chorus of heavyweight central bank chiefs signalling a readiness to deal with the threat from the outbreak.
The central banks of Japan, Britain and the United States have all signaled willingness to inject more cash into the system, and markets are now discounting a 50 basis-point cut in the target range for fed funds at the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting in two weeks' time. Outside the G7, the central banks of Australia and Malaysia both cut their key rates by 25 basis points at their respective meetings on Tuesday. The RBA also left the door open to further easing.

(Reuters) - European shares jumped on Tuesday as investors bet on more moves by major central banks and governments to counter the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak, helping major stock markets recover from a hammering in the past week.
Following a 5% jump for Wall Street indexes on Monday, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 2.4%, with growth-linked shares including airlines Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Air France (PA:AIRF) and EasyJet (L:EZJ) among the biggest gainers.
While a source at the Group of Seven said a midday conference call would not launch any immediate fiscal or coordinated monetary action to boost growth, a number of governments and central banks are gearing up to take action.
Australia's central bank was the first to move, cutting interest rates to a record low on Tuesday, while those in Japan, Britain, France and the United States have all signalled willingness to inject more cash into the system.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was also set to unveil an action plan to tackle a spread of the virus and possible measures to support the health service, businesses and the economy.
The index is still trading 11% below the February peak, reflecting the scale of the hit investors expect from a still expanding epidemic. After a decade of cash injections from central banks, analysts also question if monetary stimulus will be enough this time round. 
""We're seeing monetary stimulus in a more coordinated fashion, but the question is really (on) the fiscal side,"" said Edward Shing, global head of equity derivatives strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
""The problem is even if central banks lower rates or increases QE, that doesn't get people to go down to the shops.""
All of Europe's sub-sectors were up, and those that took a heavy hit over the past week such as miners (SXPP), technology (SX8P) chemical producers (SX4P) and travel & leisure index (SXTP) rebounding the most.
Spanish banks shone after the European Court of Justice ruled that it will be up to local judges to decide on a case by case basis if IRPH mortgage clauses were abusive.
 Caixabank SA  (MC:CABK),  Bankia  (MC:BKIA), BBVA (MC:BBVA) all rose between 3% and 6% over relief that the court did not decide a blanket rejection of the clause.
Among individual movers, German meal-kit delivery firm HelloFresh (DE:HFGG) jumped 7% after forecasting growth in 2020 revenue and core profit. 

 Qiagen  NV (DE:QIA) soared 19% to the top of STOXX 600 after U.S. firm Thermo Fisher Scientific (N:TMO) launched a 10.4 billion euro ($11.6 billion) bid for the German genetic testing company.

LONDON (Reuters) - A recovery in world stock markets and oil prices picked up pace on Tuesday, as global policymakers signalled a united front to address the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus.
Europe's main bourses surged nearly 3% in what looked set to be the region's best day since 2016 as dealers rediscovered their appetite for risk and jettisoned safe but low profit assets.. 
The reason? The cavalry. Finance ministers from the G7 and central bank governors will hold a conference call on Tuesday (1200 GMT) to discuss measures to deal with the outbreak. 
According to a source at the group, a statement it is crafting does not detail any firm fiscal or monetary stimulus plans, but for investors it was a reassuring signal. 
""The market is very much wanting a coordinated policy response, but the question here is whether a conventional interest-rate response is sufficient, or whether it requires also a fiscal response,"" said Sameer Goel at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""The problem is, the severity of the problem is not very clear.""
The mild selloff in super-safe government bonds came after yields on benchmark U.S. Treasuries hit record lows in recent days as worries mounted about a potential global recession.
The decision to hold a G7 call came after the head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, on Monday joined the chorus of heavyweight central bank chiefs signalling a readiness to deal with the threat from the outbreak.
Earlier messages from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it was prepared to act continued to weigh on the dollar, having fuelled expectations of a sizable rate cut at its meeting in two weeks.
Against the yen, the dollar lost 0.4% to 107.95 yen, slipping towards a five-month low of 107 set on Monday. 
Lagarde's comments meant the euro was a shade lower at $1.1111, having hit an eight-week peak of $1.1185 in the previous session after a string of other top ECB policymakers said the bank was still assessing the situation.
The Australian dollar, which is seen as a proxy bet on China due to the raw materials it sells there, sat above a recent 11-year trough largely on short covering after its central bank cut interest rates earlier in the day. 
Oil prices gained another 2% after a jump of more than 4% on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures went to $47.8 a barrel while Brent crude stood at $52.9. [O/R]
The improved sentiment helped U.S. S&P 500 futures climb as much as 1%. MSCI's world stocks index was up 0.6% having scored its best day since 2011 on Monday after a roaring Wall Street pushed it up just over 3%. 
Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended 0.8% higher, off earlier peaks but still marking the second straight session of rises.
""Barring any further deterioration of the coronavirus outbreak, we believe that the global cyclical recovery is likely to gain further momentum,"" Schroders' Asian multi-asset team said in a report. 
""This is likely to benefit stocks with higher leverage to global growth, as stronger earnings could support dividend growth.""
MONEY MARKETS 
Japan's Nikkei lost steam and closed 1.2% lower after short-covering ran its course and as the yen firmed on the dollar, but South Korea's Kospi rose 0.6%.
Australian shares ended up 0.7% after the central bank cut interest rates to a record low of 0.5%, the fourth reduction in less than a year. 
The rout in global stocks last week had already prompted Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to flag a readiness to move. 
""It is reasonable to expect a response that reflects a combination of fiscal measures and central bank initiatives,"" Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday.
Money markets are fully pricing in a cut of at least 0.25 percentage points to the current 1.50%-1.75% target rate at the Fed's March 17-18 meeting as well as a 0.10 percentage point cut to the ECB's minus 0.5% key rate at March 12 meeting. 
The frantic moves by policymakers reflected growing fears about the disruption to supply chains, factory output and global travel caused by the new epidemic just as the world economy was trying to recover from the effects of the U.S.-China trade war. 
Coronavirus, which has already claimed more than 3,000 lives, now appears to be spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country. That leads the world into uncharted territory, although the World Health Organization has so far stopped short of calling it a pandemic.
U.S. bond yields rolled back some of their sharp falls. 
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield moved to 1.15% from a record low of 1.030% marked on Monday. The two-year notes yield jumped back to 0.87% from a 3 1/2-year low of 0.710%, though yields on the most rate-sensitive short term notes continued to drop. 

April Fed funds rate futures still price in about 80% chance of a 0.50 percentage point cut this month and a total of almost 1 percentage point cuts by the end of year.

585,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 06:03AM ET</span>",Virus to dent Foxconn's consumer electronics revenue in first-quarter,"By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) warned revenue would drop 15% in businesses including consumer electronics and enterprise products in the first quarter, but that it would recover thereafter as production returns to normal in virus-hit China.
Foxconn is among manufacturers worldwide who are grappling with virus-related curbs that have upended supply chains and hurt demand. Apple, its top client, rescinded its March quarter sales guidance citing a slower ramp up of manufacturing in China amid travel restrictions and an extended Lunar New Year break. 
The Taiwanese firm, which assembles Apple's (O:AAPL) iPhones, said it does not expect to see any revenue growth in the first half and a ""mild downward revision"" from original guidance of ""slight growth"" for the year due to the coronavirus. 
While it did not give any details, Foxconn noted the virus' impact would be short term and that so far the effect on its supply chain was ""not that great"".
""Prevention of outbreak, resumption of work and production are our top priority,"" Chairman Liu Young-Way told an online investor conference on Tuesday.
Overall manufacturing activity has been hobbled in China by travel curbs and quarantine requirements aimed at containing the coronavirus which can be transmitted from person to person.
The flu-like virus, which originated in China, has spread to over 60 countries. It has infected more than 86,000 people and killed over 3,000 people, the majority in China.
Foxconn, however, sought to allay investor concerns about the virus' impact, saying it expects to resume normal production in China, its top manufacturing base, by the end of the March.
The company's ""long-term cooperation"" with suppliers will also help provide a cushion against the rise in prices of some components, Chairman Liu said.
APPLE OUTLOOK
Any disruption at Foxconn, formally called  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd, would cloud Apple's timeline for new phones.
Foxconn tends to handle the introduction of new iPhones as its capabilities are the most advanced, supply chain experts say, but the timeline could be threatened by travel curbs.
Apple engineers usually jet off to Asia in the first few months of the year to perfect the production of new models, former employees and supply chain experts said.
Liu said it has not seen ""great impact"" on clients' new product launches, pointing to its advanced assembly capacity.
Foxconn's Apple operations are housed under its consumer electronics business that accounts for more than half its revenue. Its enterprise products business includes servers and telecommunication products.

Foxconn shares have dropped more than 10% this year.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets leaped on Tuesday, in a relief rally inspired by the prospect of coordinated policy stimulus to support the world economy in the face of a coronavirus outbreak that continues to spread rapidly across the globe.
By 5:25 AM ET (1025 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 10.4 points or 2.8% at 386.46, still down over 10% from the all-time high it reached only two weeks ago. In Italy, the European country worst hit by the epidemic so far, the FTSE MIB rebounded 2.4%, while the trade-sensitive German DAX rose 2.8%. The U.K. FTSE 100 lagged with a rise of 2.3%, held back by gains in sterling on the foreign exchange markets.
Gains were broad-based across all sectors, with some of the most oversold rebounding most. Airlines Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and IAG (LON:ICAG) shares rose 8.4% and 7.4% respectively, while wind turbine maker   Vestas Wind   Systems (CSE:VWS) shares rose 4.4% and miner   Anglo American   (LON:AAL) shares rose 4.2%. However, defensive stocks also did well, with Nestle (SIX:NESN) stock rising 3.4% and supermarket chain J   Sainsbury   (LON:SBRY) rising 3.9%.
Among the few companies to report on Tuesday, Nivea maker   Beiersdorf   (DE:BEIG) underperformed after saying it was impossible to predict the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on this year’s sales, while U.K. restaurant chain   Greggs   PLC (LON:GRG) outperformed after delivering fourth-quarter results above expectations and promising another strong year ahead. Greggs shares rose 4.7%.
The day was dominated by the scheduling of a conference call at 7 AM ET (1200) between the finance ministers and central banks of the G7 industrialized countries.
Hopes were initially high that the call would result in the announcement of concrete and coordinated measures to address the economic impact of the virus. They were, however, disappointed by a Reuters report which said no such measures were contained in the draft communique that had been prepared in advance of the call.
Those expecting rescue from the world’s central banks took heart from Interest rate cuts during the Asian session from both Australia and Malaysia, while another Reuters report said the European Central Bank was working on a new refinancing operation to guarantee liquidity for small- and medium-sized enterprises hit by the virus.
That report was consistent with ECB President Christine Lagarde’s statement on Monday promising “appropriate and targeted measures” but contrasted with more ambitious market expectations of a further interest rate cut or additional bond purchases. The ECB is reluctant to cut rates further, fearful of the impact on banking profitability and consequently the stability of the euro zone’s financial system. In addition, public opinion in Germany and elsewhere remains opposed to more aggressive quantitative easing.
For some, though, it’s too early to sound the all-clear.
Luc Filip, head of discretionary portfolio management at SYZ Private Banking, said in e-mailed comments that last week’s declines are “only a first leg drop that might suggest a bigger one to come. We find it hard to believe the situation will get better quickly, especially with the threat of quarantines reaching Europe and the U.S.”
Filip voiced concern that it was difficult to estimate the damage to the Chinese economy in particular. “For investors wanting to reduce portfolio correlation to China, we would suggest exiting industrials – especially auto-related stocks – semi-conductors, oil companies and place some of the proceeds in healthcare, technology – excluding semis – and staples.”"

Swiss Re has nominated Ermotti, who is due to step down from Switzerland's biggest bank in November, for a board seat at next month's annual meeting. He would then replace Walter Kielholz as chairman from 2021, the company said.
The move, reported by Reuters on Monday, comes as Swiss Re faces challenges from climate change, ultra-low interest rates and increasingly large jury awards in the United States that risk upending its casualty business.
Ermotti may lack insurance expertise, but he understands asset management, regulators and complex global financial institutions, Kielholz told journalists.
""It's worthwhile taking this trade-off,"" he said.
Swiss Re shares were up 2.5% in mid-morning trade.
UBS (S:UBSG) last month named ING (AS:INGA) Chief Executive Ralph Hamers to succeed Ermotti as CEO of the world's largest wealth manager after a handover period starting in September.
Ermotti, who has led UBS since 2011, had been coy about his future career path. When news of Hamers' appointment emerged, he declined to speculate whether he would eventually replace UBS Chairman Axel Weber, who intends to stay in his post until 2022.
Swiss Re began approaching Ermotti last year - ""probably around October"", Kielholz said. Ermotti has agreed not to take the chair of any other companies, in line with Swiss Re policy, he added.
Ermotti is a former investment banker and stock trader who turns 60 in May. He earned plaudits for helping rebuild UBS after the financial crisis, with a focus on wealth management.
However, UBS missed its profit and cost targets for 2019 amid ultra-low interest rates in Europe and increased competition from U.S. rivals, forcing Ermotti to dial back some of the bank's financial goals.
Swiss Re, led by CEO Christian Mumenthaler, generated a smaller-than-expected 2019 profit amid claims for a series of man-made and natural disasters and expenses for its U.S. casualty business. Net profit was $727 million.
Kielholz has been chairman of Swiss Re since 2009.
Ermotti's switch to Swiss Re continues a changing of the guard in the Swiss financial elite.
 Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) last month named Thomas Gottstein as CEO to take over from Tidjane Thiam, who resigned following a spying scandal.
Former UBS investment banking head Andrea Orcel was supposed to become chief executive of  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), but the plan fell apart in a row over pay."

""There has been a significant impact in China,"" Chief Executive Oliver Zipse told journalists in a conference call.
The slowdown in sales will last until March, and it is too early to make predictions about whether BMW would fail to meet its global sales targets, he said.
""We see no impact outside China. We're sticking to our target of achieving slight growth in car sales,"" Zipse said.
BMW, which has factories in China, the United States and Europe, said its global supply chain had not been disrupted by travel bans and logistics bottlenecks caused by the coronavirus.
""We only have short-term visibility. Supplies have been secured for the next three weeks,"" Zipse added."

Kon, who is currently chief accounting officer, will take on the company's No. 2 position in April, the Japanese automaker said in a statement.
Under the new structure, Toyota said it would scrap its six EVP positions, first introduced at the company in 1982, with current EVP roles becoming chief operating officer responsibilities. Four of the six EVPs will largely keep their existing roles without the EVP title.
It is the latest in a series of structural changes at Toyota, one of the world's largest automakers, which is trying to simplify its operations to become more nimble to compete with rivals in developing electric vehicles, self-driving cars and other new technologies. 
""I have judged that it is necessary for me to directly communicate with the leaders of the next generation and to increase the amount of time for sharing our concerns, by further reducing the number of layers of management,"" President Akio Toyoda said. 
The automaker said EVPs Didier Leroy and Moritaka Yoshida would resign from their posts. Leroy will keep his position as Europe chairman, and stay on as a company director through June. 

Current CFO Koji Kobayashi will keep his role as chief risk officer.

The Federal Court of Australia awarded the three lead applicants in the class action lawsuit between A$555,555 and A$1.28 million, the company said.
Issues common to the group in the class action, which numbers more than 1,350 women, will be determined in the coming days, paving the way for damages for the other applicants to be determined.
""Today is a significant step forward, but there is still a way to go until all Australian women affected by these products receive compensation,"" Jan Saddler, head of class actions for Shine Lawyers, which represented the women, said in a statement.
In November, the court found J&J subsidiary Ethicon had sold the mesh implants, used to treat urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, without warning women about the ""gravity of the risks"" and was negligent in rushing the products to market before proper testing.
​Patients said they have suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse after having the mesh surgically implanted.
J&J has faced similar lawsuits in the United States, Canada and Europe. In October, it agreed to pay nearly $117 million to resolve claims in 41 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
""Ethicon emphasizes with those women who have experienced complications following pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence surgical procedures,"" J&J said in a statement after the compensation judgment was handed down.
However, it reiterated that ""Ethicon believes that the company acted ethically and responsibly in the research, development and supply of these products.""
A J&J spokeswoman said after the judge sets out the issues that will be used to determine who qualifies for compensation, the company has 28 days to decide whether to appeal the November verdict."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The stock market rout last week over fears the coronavirus could trigger a recession was the worst since the 2008 financial crisis, but market experts said on Monday trade was mostly orderly thanks to a robust market infrastructure.
The S&P 500 (SPX) tumbled 11.5% last week before staging a partial rebound on Monday on hopes central banks will seek to ease the economic impact of the epidemic through rate cuts.
On Friday alone the market turned over 19.35 billion shares, the second highest amount on record behind 19.76 billion on Oct. 10, 2008, said Larry Tabb, founder of research and consultancy firm Tabb Group. In terms of value, just under $1 trillion traded hands, a record total for a single day, he said.
Despite the volatility, buyers and sellers had a relatively easy time connecting, Tabb said.
""I'm not sure you can argue that many people felt prices were reasonable, but generally, things went smoothly,"" he said.
On the retail side, TD Ameritrade said trading volume last week by its 11 million clients was 1.5 times higher than earlier in February, with above-normal activity registered on both the buying and selling sides.
""People may not have liked what happened, but the way in which it happened was actually pretty impressive,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at the online brokerage.
The U.S. markets are highly automated, with millions of messages processed each second, and much of last week's move was likely computer-driven, led by professional traders, said Ben Carlson, director of institutional asset management at Ritholtz Wealth Management.
He said he did not notice any major flash crash-type price spikes or major discrepancies between exchange-traded fund prices and the prices of their underlying constituents.
Kinahan noted two instances of possible panic selling at the market close on Thursday or Friday, but those may have been due in part to large derivatives positions being unwound.
TMX Group (TO:X), Canada's largest exchange operator, shut down its venues two hours earlier than normal on Friday due to capacity issues.
And Robinhood, the free trading app popular with young investors, experienced a system-wide outage on Monday as stock prices rebounded, according to CNBC.
Markets should expect to see more sharp selling if the coronavirus spreads in New York but markets would likely continue to function even if the floor of the New York Stock Exchange had to close.
One case of the virus has been confirmed in New York, of a health care worker who was traveling in Iran.
""Volatility doesn't just die after things like this,"" said Kinahan. ""It takes a while to work through the system."""
594,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 03:12AM ET</span>","Stocks - Europe Markets Open Higher, G7 Call Eyed","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, but with less vigor than U.S. markets showed on Monday, on hopes for coordinated policy action from governments and central banks to support the world economy.
Central banks from Japan to Europe followed the Federal Reserve on Monday in expressing their intention to ensure financial markets have enough liquidity and aren’t destabilized by panic-selling. However, fears remain that central bank action won’t be enough to stop the coronavirus hobbling the world economy.
Markets are likely to focus on the outcome of a teleconference call later Tuesday between G7 finance ministers and central bank governors to discuss the coronavirus and its implications. Reuters reported that there would be no announcement of concrete, coordinated stimulus measures to support the economy.
By 3:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 6.2 points or 1.7% at 382.30, while the German Dax was up 1.5% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 1.6%. In Italy, home to the worst outbreak of Covid-19 so far in Europe, the FTSE MIB rose 1.7%.
While President Donald Trump again criticized the Federal Reserve for not cutting rates overnight, many others warn that rate cuts alone won't stop the virus hitting the world economy. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development slashed its forecast for world growth this year to 2.4% on Monday, which would be the lowest since 2009. 
""The virus holds particular risks for the world economy because it creates both a demand and supply shock to goods and services,"" said Guy Monson, chief investment officer at Sarasin & Partners in e-mailed comments. ""A demand shock alone can be mitigated by interest rate cuts and central bank support. However, if labor is quarantined, critical supplies become unavailable and public gatherings are restricted, the impact of rate cuts will be muted at best.""
There was little in the way of major corporate news to report. Of the few companies to issue updates, German consumer group   Beiersdorf   (DE:BEIG), the maker of Nivea, warned that it was impossible to estimate what impact the virus would have on business in 2020 and consequently didn’t factor it into a forecast for 3%-5% organic sales growth."

Investing.com - Masayoshi Son, Chief Executive of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Corp (T:9434), said he will “start to be more careful and listen” after several of his expensive investments on startups failed.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 12:40AM ET</span>","Xerox, HP blame each other as takeover battle heats up","By Krystal Hu
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. printer maker Xerox (NYSE:XRX) Holdings Corp took its $35 billion bid for HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) to the U.S. personal computer maker's shareholders on Monday, with a formal tender offer and a rebuttal to HP's account of why they could not negotiate a deal.
HP adopted a ""poison pill"" last month to neutralize Xerox's tender offer. Unless the companies can reach a compromise, it will be Xerox's bid to replace HP's board of directors at the latter's annual shareholder meeting in the next few weeks, rather than the tender offer, that will determine the outcome of the takeover battle.
The printing industry is in decline as companies and consumers turn to digital documents to save money and help the environment. This has put pressure on companies in the sector to consolidate and reverse revenue decline through acquisitions that can boost market share.
However, after almost a year of on and off talks, HP and Xerox have been unable to avoid a confrontation.
HP accuses Xerox of refusing to provide it with enough information that would allow it to make an offer for Xerox. Xerox has said HP does not want to pursue a combination and that its bid for HP is the best way to combine the two companies and deliver a premium to HP shareholders.
Complicating the talks is billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a top Xerox shareholder who last year also acquired a stake in HP, and has been pushing the companies to combine under the leadership of Xerox CEO John Visentin.
Xerox's account of their talks published on Monday also differed in some key points from a version that HP reported to its shareholders last week.
For example, HP said last week that Xerox refused to address its questions about the trajectory of Xerox's business during their negotiations last year. Xerox, on the other hand, said on Monday that few, if any, questions that HP raised were about the revenue trajectory.
In another instance, HP said Visentin told its former CEO Dion Weisler that the debt an acquisition of HP would saddle Xerox with made it preferable for HP to buy Xerox. Xerox, however, said in its disclosures Visentin told Weisler that an acquisition of HP would be highly accretive for Xerox shareholders, despite the fact that a transaction in the opposite direction would be more straightforward.
Xerox, whose $7 billion market capitalization is one quarter the size of HP's, has said it expects a combination to yield approximately $2 billion in cost synergies, though HP has said this figure is too high. The two companies focus on complementary segments of the printing market."

(Reuters) - GFL Environmental Inc on Monday raised about $1.4 billion in its initial public offering, pricing it below the target range in a conservative step to ride out market volatility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Canadian waste management company priced its IPO at $19 per share, compared to the target range of $20 to $21 per share, giving it a market value of $6.08 billion.
The pricing of its IPO comes a day earlier than expected amid a sharp rebound in equity markets following last week's steep sell-off.
GFL's founder and chief executive officer, Patrick Dovigi, told Reuters the earlier-than-expected pricing was due to robust demand during book-building and that the company was able to market and price one of the largest IPOs in Canada.
The company had attempted to raise $1.83 billion in November last year, but that IPO was pulled after institutional investors pressed the Canadian firm to price its shares below the marketed range.
Separately, the company is also selling 14 million tangible equity units for $775 million in proceeds.
GFL is one of the largest waste haulers in North America, serving over 4 million households, more than 135,000 commercial customers in its solid waste management business, and over 13,000 customers in its liquid waste management business.
GFL, whose ""Green for Life"" slogan is seen across major Canadian cities, will list its shares on the NYSE and the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") under the symbol ""GFL"". GFL shares will start trading on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Krafcik described the outside investment as part of ""an evolutionary path that we had always imagined"" that could lead to ""more independence"" for Waymo.
He said Alphabet would continue to join other investors in funding Waymo.
In addition to Alphabet, initial investors include auto parts supplier  Magna International Inc  (TO:MG), with which Waymo has an assembly deal; U.S. dealership chain AutoNation Inc (N:AN), which services and maintains Waymo's vehicles; the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and three large investment firms: Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala Investment.
AutoNation said it invested $50 million as part of the initial funding round. Figures for other outside investors were not immediately available. 
Silver Lake partner Egon Durban is a nominee for Waymo's operating board. Andreessen said its partner David George led its investment but is not taking a board seat.
Alphabet CFO Porat said a more ""intense focus"" on ""metrics and milestones"" had already played out at Alphabet's Verily health care business, which raised $1 billion from Silver Lake and others in January 2019. 
""There's a valuable added governance discipline when you have additional voices at the table,"" she said. ""It's sort of somewhere between private-independent and public.""
Waymo did not provide a valuation.
Last September, investment bank Morgan Stanley slashed its projected valuation of Waymo to $105 billion from its earlier estimate of $175 billion, saying the commercialization of self-driving vehicles and technology was taking longer than expected.
Krafcik said Waymo plans to offer a range of self-driving transportation services, from its Waymo One ride hailing business in Phoenix through the new Waymo Via logistics business that would bundle local and long-haul delivery.

He said Waymo, which has partnered with  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) and Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL], is considering partnerships with other automakers and transportation service providers in various markets outside North America, but did not provide details.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>","United Airlines sharply cuts flights to Asia, cancels investor day","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said on Friday it was sharply cutting flights to Japan and South Korea, as travelers worried about the coronavirus outbreak slash ticket purchases for those destinations.
It also canceled its investor day that had been due to be held on March 5.
With investors firmly focused on how the company is managing the near-term impact of the coronavirus, United said it was not ""practical to expect that it can have a productive conversation focused on its long-term strategy next week.""
The event will be rescheduled for September.
Chicago-based United already withdrew its 2020 guidance this week due to uncertainty over the duration and spread of the virus. It warned that near-term demand to China has almost disappeared, with demand for the rest of its trans-Pacific routes down by 75%.
As a result, the company is temporarily reducing flights from the U.S. mainland to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and Seoul and extending the suspension of U.S. flights to mainland China and Hong Kong through April 30, it said on Friday.
The airline is cutting about two thirds of its flights to Seoul, nearly a third of flights to Japan and 40% of flights to Singapore. It is also flying smaller planes on some routes.
Among U.S. airlines, United has the biggest international exposure, drawing about 40% of its revenues from overseas flights.
Earlier this week, Delta cut South Korea flights in half, citing the outbreak.
United shares fell 5.2% on Friday, amid a widespread global share rout, and are down 21% over the last week."
606,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 07:21PM ET</span>",Chevron offering U.S. workers buyouts to trim staffing: sources,"By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) is offering buyouts to reduce its U.S. oil exploration and production workforce, three sources told Reuters, as the oil major moves to cut costs in the face of sharply lower oil and gas prices. 
The No. 2 U.S. oil producer decided to reduce staff after reviewing operations late last year as energy prices fell, the sources said. Chevron confirmed that it was offering buyouts to workers in its shale gas business in the eastern United States but did not comment on any other U.S. job cuts.
Other oil and gas producers and service companies have begun cutting workers as prices have dived on soaring production and tepid demand, which has been made worse by the coronavirus outbreak.
One of the sources said some employees who accept Chevron's buyout offer could remain until October. Another source said the company hopes to open spots for people who currently work for its shale gas operation in the Appalachian region of the United States, which is on the auction block.
Chevron notified Pennsylvania state officials last month that it planned to cut up to 320 jobs in the state, which includes the shale gas business. 
The company said in a statement it could not yet say how many employees in that business would be affected. ""We are taking active steps to reduce job loss,"" including moving employees to other operations, a spokeswoman said. 
Employees who ultimately lose their jobs will be offered severance pay and outplacement services, the spokeswoman said. The restructuring is part of a business review ""toward capturing efficiencies and directing resources where they will generate the most value,"" she said. 
Chevron overall employed 48,200 workers globally at the end of last year, down 7,000 from three years ago. About 53% of its workers, or 25,400 employees, are in the United States. 
Chevron's results swung to a loss last quarter on a $10.4 billion impairment charge, mostly from writing down the value of natural gas fields and projects.
The U.S. shale boom has led to a glut of crude oil and natural gas in world markets, especially since the coronavirus outbreak has slashed energy demand, with experts forecasting growth this year to be the lowest in a decade.
U.S. oil futures (CLc1) have fallen 24% since the year began to $46.69 a barrel and natural gas futures have collapsed 40% since hitting an eight-month high in November. [O/R]
This week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will consider a further output cut to prevent prices from falling further. About 16% of U.S. natural gas production comes as a byproduct of oil output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Shale gas has so overwhelmed demand that producers in West Texas are paying customers to take the fuel and some are burning it as waste. 

Chevron's rivals, including Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY),  Apache Corp  (N:APA) and  Gulfport Energy  Corp (O:GPOR), have already cut workers in response to the gas glut. Oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL.N) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) also have been furiously cutting as shale producers cut drilling to reduce the glut.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 06:16PM ET</span>","India retail banking a 'nice oasis' for foreign lenders Deutsche, HSBC, peers","By Nupur Anand and Sumeet Chatterjee
MUMBAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Outsized returns in India, besting local lenders for the first time in a decade, are emboldening banks such as  Citigroup  (N:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and HSBC (L:HSBA) to invest more in a market that has long held promise but tended to under-deliver.
Easing regulations and a surge in online banking are driving the change, with several overseas lenders increasing investment plans for the country to win affluent clients away from domestic rivals, senior bankers told Reuters.
Improved performance in India and its basis in the take-up of digital retail banking services could also offer hope for other large markets with potential far greater than the profit so far delivered, such as China.
""With transaction banking going very strong and retail banking picking up pace, a lot of foreign banks globally are now focusing on India and registering better performance,"" said Sanjoy Datta, Deloitte India financial services practice head.
""It may pose some challenges as banks plan to expand more into the tier-two towns but overall, foreign banks in India will continue to grow as there are no imminent (industry-specific) challenges,"" he said, pointing to technology as a key enabler.
Lured by a massive economy and rising middle-class income, more than three dozen foreign lenders in India have been vying for a bigger share of the market for decades - yet they account for just 6% of the banking assets.
Aiding the latest growth spurt is regulatory easing in support of technological financial services. For instance, the central bank in August allowed banks - under a ""regulatory sandbox"" framework - to launch products and services such as digital customer background checks and money transfer.
Moreover, services such as digital payment have been growing rapidly led by a government push to bring more cash-loving merchants and consumers into the formal economy.
Taking advantages of such developments, foreign banks' annualized return on equity (ROE) in India rose to 9.9% in the six months to September-end, from 6.9% a year earlier, central bank data showed. That beat the 6.1% of domestic private lenders for a second consecutive half-yearly period - for the first time since the global financial crisis.
At the same time, local private and state-backed banks are increasingly constrained by souring loans, low levels of capital and governance issues at the biggest players - all in a slowing economy.
""In the next five years foreign banks along with private lenders will have an opportunity to grow as state-owned banks are losing market share due to capital constraints and shift in focus to consolidation,"" said Ashvin Parekh, an independent financial services consultant.
TECH BOOM
The rapid adoption of technology - for processing payments, acquiring customers and selling products - is the real driver of foreign lenders' success, bankers and analysts said.
""It's become a little bit more of a level playing field and it's up to your digital strategies and your digital capabilities,"" said Ramakrishnan S., HSBC's India retail banking and wealth management head. ""Frankly speaking, there's no reason why we shouldn't grow as much as anybody else.""
HSBC's pre-tax profit from its India retail and wealth management unit more than doubled to a record $48 million last year. While small compared with the $6.6 billion it made in its home market of Hong Kong, the figure contrasted sharply with HSBC's $74 million loss in China.
The Asia-focused lender, which intends to double spending on technology and marketing in the coming three years, aims to double profit again over the next three to five years, Ramakrishnan said.
All this even after it cut its number of bricks-and-mortar branches to focus on its digital presence - and in the face of a new regulation giving foreign lenders greater freedom to expand branch networks if they convert them into local subsidiaries.
Previously, the central bank limited the number of branches foreign lenders could open, which Western bankers said was a major source of frustration.
U.S. rival Citi launched a wealth management app in January 2019 which allows clients to open investment accounts instantly and without having to visit a branch. Last year, it saw double-digit growth in affluent clients, its target market.
""Sometimes having limited brick-and-mortar presence can actually become an advantage because you start thinking about other ways for customer acquisition, engagement and service and you are not distracted by branch profitability,"" said Shinjini Kumar, Citi's India head of consumer businesses.
""NICE OASIS""
Even Deutsche Bank, which laid off 18,000 staff globally in July as part of broader restructuring, is enjoying a boom in India, home to its only retail business outside Europe.
Two years ago the bank considered selling the unit but now sees it as a ""nice oasis"", said Kaushik Shaparia, head of the German lender's India operations.
Deutsche injected nearly 500 million euros ($552.45 million) into those operations in early 2019, its single largest investment in the country. The bank aims to double India revenue from 560 million euros in 2018, Shaparia said, declining to give a time frame.
""Even when the bank is really looking to grow in a very, very efficient manner, we get investment also in terms of headcount and systems. We punch way above our weight compared to what the firm broadly does."""

609,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for March 3,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Stocks bounced back sharply Monday following last week’s plunge, with the major indexes boasting their biggest daily points gains ever.
Bond yields jumped in the last hour of stock market trading and oil settled up nearly 5%.
Much of the enthusiasm came in anticipation of moves by global central banks to lower rates and provide liquidity.
A conference call by the Group of Seven largest economies tomorrow will be carefully eyed, and there will be more Fed members speaking.
Retail earnings continue to come in as well, for those still keeping tabs on fundamentals.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Could G7’s Big Call Lead to Surprise Cuts?
Wall Street bet big on central bank stimulus to combat the economic damage caused by Covid-19.
And investors will be especially keen to see any headlines coming out of the Group of Seven teleconference Tuesday, where finance ministers and central bankers are expected to discuss potential action to stabilize the markets.
The call will start at 7 AM ET (1200 GMT) and will be led by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, CNBC reported.
Mnuchin and White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow are backing the idea of an intermeeting emergency cut by the FOMC, Bloomberg first reported. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said today he expects nine out of 10 major central banks to cut rates in and that it would make sense for the banks to make some kind of coordinated move to get even more bang for their rate-cut buck.
Meanwhile, the fed funds futures market is still pricing in a 100% chance of a half-point rate cut in March and a 75% chance for another quarter-point reduction in April.
2. Fed’s Mester, Evans to Speak
If the G7 doesn’t come through with a surprise move Tuesday, any Fed speakers are still going to be watched in hopes they’ll bolster hopes of anticipated cuts or give a slight hint of an emergency move.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester will be speaking in London tomorrow on the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Society of Professional Economists Annual Dinner.
Her remarks are expected at 2:50 PM ET (1950 GMT) and there will be questions.
At 6:30 PM ET, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will face a moderated Q&A session hosted by the University of Illinois.
3. Target on Tap for Earnings
Retailers remain the focus of earnings tomorrow, with discount chain   Target   (NYSE:TGT) reportiing before trading begins tomorrow.
Target is expected to report a fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $1.65 per share on sales of about $23.4 billion, according to analysts forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
In January the company warned that its holiday same-store sales rose just 1.4% in November and December, shy of what Wall Street was expecting. It blamed weakness in key categories like electronics, toys and home products.
Shares fell sharply after the warning and had not recovered to the level before the announcement, even before the declines seen in the carnage of last week.
Department store chain Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) will also issue results before the bell.
Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.88 per share and sales of about $6.5 billion."

611,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 04:56PM ET</span>","Americans keep buying cars, but coronavirus concerns loom over industry","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Customers streamed into auto showrooms from California to Florida over the weekend, car dealers across the United States said on Monday, shrugging off concerns that coronavirus worries might dampen sales.
Industry analysts cautioned that a growing number of virus infections could deter Americans in March, and automakers face difficult calls on pricing and production. But dealers and analysts said there was no discernable impact on February U.S. car sales, a strong month for dealerships.
Carmakers are expected to give dealerships details of their consumer discount offers in the coming days. Changes to pricing offers could reflect a drop in supply of some Asian vehicles hit by supply shortages. Automakers could also cut prices to lure worried U.S. shoppers.
Since the virus originated in China nine weeks ago, demand for cars has plunged in Asian countries as dealerships were closed and consumers stayed home. Korean carmaker  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) on Monday reported its lowest number of monthly sales in a decade.
To date 10 U.S. states, including California, have confirmed presumed infections. California is the country's biggest car market, accounting for more than 10% of all U.S. sales.
Larry Laskowski, executive director at the Independent Automobile Dealers Association of California, which represents the state's roughly 6,000 used car dealers, said the coronavirus has not been an issue for members.
In San Ramon, a city 35 miles east of San Francisco surrounded by counties that have reported coronavirus cases, dealership owner Greg Meier said his business was better than expected this weekend.
""Some people were joking about the virus when they came in this weekend, but no one was panicked or scared,"" Meier said.
His remarks were echoed by dealership groups in Texas, Florida and New York.
""The concern that you can catch coronavirus from walking into a dealership is not something we've seen,"" said Darren Whitehurst, president of the Texas Automobile Dealers Association.
A spokeswoman for the National Car Dealers Association said the group reached out to dealers in various regions over the weekend and received no reports of a fall-off in foot traffic or a drop in sales.
Total U.S. auto sales in February are projected to reach more than 1.3 million vehicles, according to JD Power, up 1.8% from last year. Tyson Jominy, the research firm's vice president of automotive data & analytics consulting, said there was no reason to back away from that projection due to the virus.
But he said analysts were closely watching changes to carmakers' incentives packages as an indicator for sales.
Of particular interest are popular Asian models, such as Hyundai's Palisade and Subaru Corp's (T:7270) Forester SUV. Moves to increase finance interest rates or upfront down payments could point to tight supply.
Hyundai did not respond to a request for comment. The company last month halted production at home due to a shortage of parts from China.
Richer discounts could point to a steady supply of cars and a desire to draw customers into showrooms.
""It all comes down to what dealers are doing in the coming days as news of the coronavirus spread in the U.S. picks up,"" Jominy said."

(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged over 5% on Monday while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each jumped more than 4% in a major rebound following last week's steep sell-off sparked by fears about the coronavirus.
After the stock market extended gains in the session's final minutes, the Dow wrapped up its strongest one-day gain since 2009, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each had their strongest one-day rise since December 2018.
That rally followed the U.S. stock market's worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, sinking into correction territory on Thursday due to fears of a recession resulting from the epidemic.
The S&P 500 remains down 8.7% from its Feb. 19 record high close. Many investors will consider the index to remain in a correction until it reclaims its high.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 9.3% in its largest one-session leap since 2008. The iPhone maker is still down nearly 9% from its record high close on Feb. 12.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that Japan's central bank would take necessary steps to stabilize financial markets. That followed a similar move by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last Friday.
""We can shrug off an economic downturn, but if it starts to spill into companies' capacity to pay their debts, then that creates deeper problems. But it seems to me like the central banks are linking arms to find a way to insulate the credit markets from economic uncertainty,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.
Traders see a 100% chance of a 50 basis point rate cut at the Fed's March meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 5.09% to end at 26,703.32 points, while the S&P 500 surged 4.60% to 3,090.23.
The Nasdaq Composite added 4.49% to 8,952.17.
Trading was very busy on U.S. exchanges, with 14 billion shares changing hands compared with a 9.5 billion-share average for the last 20 days.
The S&P 500 information technology index jumped 5.7% in its strongest session since December 2018.
The Institute for Supply Management said domestic manufacturing activity barely expanded last month due to supply issues stemming from the virus outbreak.
""The Fed can cut rates all it wants, that is not going to put a person in a factory producing a product if that person is quarantined,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
""I don't think (monetary policy) solves the problem ... This particular one is both supply and demand, it will help but it won't fix the problem.""

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle litigation accusing it of quietly slowing down older iPhones as it launched new models, to induce owners to buy replacement phones or batteries.
The preliminary proposed class-action settlement was disclosed on Friday night and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California.
It calls for Apple to pay consumers $25 per iPhone, which may be adjusted up or down depending on how many iPhones are eligible, with a minimum total payout of $310 million.
Apple denied wrongdoing and settled the nationwide case to avoid the burdens and costs of litigation, court papers show.
The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment.
Friday's settlement covers U.S. owners of the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7Plus or SE that ran the iOS 10.2.1 or later operating system. It also covers U.S. owners of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that ran iOS 11.2 or later before Dec. 21, 2017.
Consumers contended that their phones' performance suffered after they installed Apple software updates. They said this misled them into believing their phones were near the end of their lifecycles, requiring replacements or new batteries.
Apple attributed the problems mainly to temperature changes, high usage and other issues, and said its engineers worked quickly and successfully to address them. Analysts sometimes refer to the slowing of iPhones as ""throttling.""
Lawyers for the consumers described the settlement as ""fair, reasonable, and adequate.""
They called payments of $25 per iPhone ""considerable by any degree,"" saying their damages expert considered $46 per iPhone the maximum possible.
The lawyers plan to seek up to $93 million, equal to 30% of $310 million, in legal fees, plus up to $1.5 million for expenses.
Following an initial outcry over slow iPhones, Apple apologized and lowered the price for replacement batteries to $29 from $79.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you are close to retirement in the United States, chances are you do not have to worry about cashing out of the market as it gyrates wildly on coronavirus fears.
Many retirement savers own target-date funds, which are professionally managed to glide over time from stocks to bonds and other fixed income, starting about 20 years out from the projected date you will stop working. 
According to Morningstar, investors had more than $1.7 trillion in target-date funds at the end of 2018.
For those approaching retirement, it is likely that your portfolio is approaching a 50/50 mix, and it will systematically ratchet back even further away from stocks as you age. 
Vanguard's 2025 fund, for instance, is currently at 60 percent equities and 40 percent bonds and other fixed income; its 2020 fund is at 50/50. In February, while the MSCI U.S. index lost 7.43% for the month, the 2025 fund dropped 3.98%, and the 2020 fund fell 3.22%. 
Vanguard's senior investment strategist, Scott Donaldson, said 77% of the company's participants use target-date funds. Just over half of those participants are in a single target-date fund. 
Target-date usage will become even more prevalent over time because so many younger workers are automatically invested in target-date funds - to the tune of 90% of those under 25, compared with just 50% for those aged 55 to 64, according to Vanguard. 
Fidelity, another giant in the retirement market, says about 76% of its savers use target-date funds. 
By contrast, just 7.5% of Fidelity's do-it-yourself investors aged 60-64 are 100% allocated to equities, while 4.9% are totally out of stocks. The typical mix for that age group is 66% equities and 34% non-equities, as of the end of 2019, Fidelity said. 
""We do check-ins with people periodically,"" said Katie Taylor, vice president of thought leadership at Fidelity. ""Sometimes people just need to be reassured, especially if they don’t follow the markets day-to-day."" 
ON YOUR OWN
If you are managing your own allocations, with or without an adviser, the key to surviving market turmoil is to have a long-term plan and stick with it. You need to balance safety with the need for returns that beat inflation. 
For certified financial planner Tim Doehrmann, whose practice is in Morton, Illinois, that process starts as soon as he meets new clients and talks to them about their risk tolerance. When the conversation turns to asset allocation, Doehrmann prefers to talk about time rather than percentages. 
A key consideration is how much Doehrmann's clients are willing to withdraw from fixed income while waiting for the market to recover. 
Doehrmann gives the example of this client couple: Both are 70 and have $2 million in investable assets. For them to be able to draw $95,000 a year from investments, on top of approximately $45,000 in Social Security, he suggests setting aside about six years of a portfolio in fixed income like bonds, which is about $600,000, or about 30%. 
Lisa Kirchenbauer, a certified financial planner in Arlington, Virginia, takes more of a bucket and goals-based approach. A few years ahead of retirement, Kirchenbauer's clients will estimate their needs, especially the required minimum distributions they need to take from their accounts. Each year, they set that aside in cash so it is ready to go. 
""We don't have to sell in a down market that way,"" Kirchenbauer said. 

For a reality check, go ahead and take a peek at your accounts. ""Even if you are 60, I'm not so worried about that, because your full retirement age is 67,"" Kirchenbauer added. ""You have at least five years, and you can hang in there.""

636,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>","For signs that the stocks panic is over, watch bonds","By Karen Brettell
(Reuters) - Investors wanting to see if the worst is over for the dramatic selloff in stocks should look to U.S. Treasuries for clues, as an ebbing in the considerable demand for the safe-haven bonds needs to be seen first to show that risk appetite is improving.
The Treasury market has been flashing warning signs about global growth since the beginning of the year, even as stocks charged to record highs.
“The Treasury move has been bigger and it actually started much earlier,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.
The increasing spread of coronavirus that whacked stocks last week has also ignited a technical move in bonds that could feed upon itself and send yields dramatically lower still, further adding to demand for safe havens and hurting demand for stocks.
As yields fall investors increase their hedges on mortgages, a process known as convexity hedging.
“These convexity flow continue to hammer rates lower and only now are risk assets actually catching up, which is again threatening to create yet another leg lower in rates,” Goldberg said. This “could feed on itself and move everything even lower still…that’s the difficult part to predict.”
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) plunged to a record low of 1.05% on Monday. They have fallen from 1.58% a week and a half ago and are down from 1.95% at the beginning of the year.
The notes had a total return of 7.46% for the year as of Friday , according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), a huge move for a low risk asset.
Longer-dated bonds have returned even more. Thirty-year yields (US30YT=RR) dropped to a record low of 1.58% on Monday and are down from 2.42% at the beginning of the year. That is a total return of 17% for the year as of Friday , according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.
(GRAPHIC: Treasury yields show pessimism over global growth: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2719/2684/BondsSP500.png)
Treasuries are viewed as one of the world's safest investments and gain as investors flock to safety during times of uncertainty. A continued strong demand for these assets reflects that risk appetite remains low, which is negative for stocks.
Bank of America strategists Michael Hartnett and Tommy Ricketts said in a report sent on Friday to watch for a decline in Treasuries and gold “to signal panic (is) over.”
How investors react to any potential cut in interest rates will also be key for risk sentiment as the coronavirus throws into doubt that lower rates will be enough to offset a global economic slowdown.
Since the beginning of the year, “Treasuries were very skeptical that the global economy was on a sustained upward growth tract,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president in fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. For stocks, “I think it was the expectation that the Fed was going to have their back forever.”
Interest rate futures traders are fully pricing in a rate cut at this month’s Federal Reserve meeting, and see a 75% chance of an additional cut in April, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.
But the problems of spreading industrial shutdowns as countries seek to stem the spread of the virus may not be solved by lower rates.
“I don’t think that a Fed ease here is going to solve the problems that we’re seeing with the coronavirus,” Hurley said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amtrak said Monday it had tapped Atlas Air's chief executive to run the money-losing U.S. passenger railroad that has seen record traffic.
William J. Flynn will take over as president and chief executive on April 15, succeeding former Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) chief executive Richard Anderson who has run Amtrak since July 2017.
Anderson will remain a senior adviser through the end of the year. Flynn, who has been with  Atlas Air Worldwide  Holdings (O:AAWW), for 13 years, has also held senior roles with CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) Transportation, Sea-Land Services, Inc, and GeoLogistics Corp.
Amtrak said Monday it is on pace this year to achieve operational break-even for the first time in the company’s 49-year history eve as it invests billions in new high-speed Acela trains and other capital assets.
""Amtrak service is vital to millions of Americans across the nation and by improving the customer experience, driving safety, and strengthening our partnership with states and other stakeholders, we can do much more for the American people,"" Flynn said in a statement. 
This week Amtrak, following the practice of U.S. airlines, started limiting refunds and passengers' ability to make changes to most lowest-price train tickets.
Passengers can no longer be able to make changes or cancel tickets 24 hours after purchase as they can now for the lowest-cost ""Saver fares."" The company also imposed new restrictions on changing some higher priced tickets.
In November, Amtrak said it had set records for ridership, revenue and financial performance for the year ended Sept. 30, 2019, including 32.5 million customer trips, a year-over-year increase of 800,000 passengers.
Amtrak reported a loss of $29.8 million in its last fiscal year compared with a loss of $170.6 million in the prior fiscal year.
Last month, the White House proposed cutting U.S. funding for Amtrak by more than 50% over 2020 levels. Democrats who control the U.S. House of Representatives have said they will reject the proposal, which is similar to cuts that have been rebuffed in prior budgets proposed by President Donald Trump's administration.
Amtrak still is trying to win funding to complete major repairs and a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River in the heavily traveled northeast U.S. corridor.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 03:26PM ET</span>",Exclusive: CVC seeks up to 20 billion euros for new buyout fund - sources,"By Chibuike Oguh and Arno Schuetze
NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - CVC Capital Partners Ltd is looking to raise up to 20 billion euros ($22 billion) for its latest flagship buyout fund, in what would be the private equity firm's biggest pool of capital amassed to date, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The fund, CVC Capital Partners Fund VIII, will seek to invest in businesses mostly in Europe and North America. The size of the fund could end up between 17 billion euros and 20 billion euros, depending on investor appetite, the sources said.
The persons asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. CVC declined to comment.
Major buyout firms such as CVC have been raising bigger and bigger funds from institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds and corporate and public pensions, as demand for so-called alternative investments not directly correlated to stocks and bonds grows.
Last year, Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), the world's largest alternative asset manager, raised $26 billion for its eighth flagship buyout fund, while Vista Equity Partners Management LLC closed its seventh technology buyout fund after raising $16 billion from investors.
CVC's latest fund is expected to be the largest-ever fund raised in Europe, surpassing the firm's most recent fund that raised 16.4 billion euros in 2017.
In that fund, CVC Capital Fund VII, the firm secured 46% of commitments from investors in North America, 23% from Europe, 17% from Asia Pacific, and 11% from the Middle East, according to its website.
The fund before that, the 10.5 billion-euro CVC Capital Partners VI, was worth 1.4 times the value of its initial investor commitments as of the end of June 2019, according to the website of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). By comparison, the entire CalPERS private equity portfolio was worth 1.5 times its cost as of the end of June.
CVC has about $82 billion in assets under management. Its portfolio companies include SheerID, a Portland, Oregon-based identity marketing firm, and London-based online payments company Paysafe. CVC also owns a stake in Premier Rugby Limited, which manages the top English rugby championship, and Petco, a leading retailer of pet food in North America.
In addition to its private equity business, CVC also has a credit platform, CVC Credit Partners, which has about $26 billion in assets under management."
642,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 03:26PM ET</span>",Stock swoon hands investors fresh buying opportunities,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of the world’s biggest investment firms are betting that one of the worst sell-offs in years is an opportunity to buy on the cheap.
UBS Global Wealth Management and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management were among the firms adding to their portfolios or urging clients to buy in select areas during the market’s coronavirus-fueled sell-off, taking positions in everything from emerging market stocks to the shares of cruise companies.
Few said they are stepping in to bet on a sustained rebound in broader markets, even as stocks bounced Monday, after last week’s plunge knocked 11.5% off the S&P 500 in the index’s fastest correction in history. Yet some investors see the declines as an opportunity to stake out positions in assets whose valuations had become exceedingly stretched as markets marched higher in previous months.
""It’s a breath of fresh air to see a lot of the things that we would love to own getting to price points where we can actually start considering them,” said Michael Kon, director of research and portfolio manager at Summitry.
Summitry, which invests in businesses that trade at discounts to their intrinsic value, last week added to its position in shares of Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and initiated a new position in  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW), said Kon, whose San Mateo, California firm has $1.7 billion under management.
As the sell-off took hold last week, UBS Global Wealth Management highlighted to clients a chance to add stocks in the two of the firm's favored sectors - U.S. consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and U.S. communication services (SPLRCL) - calling the sectors oversold.
Some companies in those sectors could even benefit in certain respects from the virus fears as consumers spend more time shopping online and on their screens, said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""We still think having an overweight stance in these sectors is an attractive thing to do even if the virus concerns continue to weigh on the market,” Lefkowitz said.
Portfolio managers at Goldman Sachs Asset Management added to positions in the travel sector, including in hotels and cruises, and bought shares of Japanese cosmetics-maker Shiseido Co Ltd (T:4911) and events promoter Live Nation Entertainment (N:LYV).
“This is the time when active managers should be able to protect capital on the downside and look for opportunities,” said Katie Koch, Goldman Sachs’ global co-head of equities for its asset management business.
David Kotok, chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors, said he was buying stocks, particularly in the healthcare sector.
""It is the vehicle that we will fight the war against the virus with,"" Kotok said.
To be sure, even as investors sought select opportunities, the decline in stocks was proving to be a big challenge to investors' ""buy the dip"" mantra that has prevailed during the bull market that has lasted for over a decade.
Greenwood Capital, which has a three- to five-year investment horizon, was a net buyer of stocks last week during the pullback, but was not buying ""super aggressively"" as the firm sought to assess whether the coronavirus situation will push the economy into a recession, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with the South Carolina firm.
“If we ultimately end up in a recession two quarters from now, there’s a lot more work on the downside to be done,” Todd said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors targeting declines in U.S. stocks saw sizeable gains during last week's sell-off, as markets plunged on concerns that the spread of the coronavirus was accelerating beyond China.
Short sellers - who hope to profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later at a lower price - logged a one-week paper profit of $104.77 billion in the last week of February, according to data from financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners measuring bets against U.S.-listed stocks and American Depositary Receipts. That compares with $3.25 billion in paper profits in the prior week.
That upside came during a week marked by furious selling of everything from stocks to a broad range of currencies and eventually, some popular safe-haven assets like gold. All three major U.S. indexes registered their largest weekly declines since 2008, with the S&P 500 (SPX) falling 11.5%.
The tumble in stocks has marked a long-awaited reversal for bearish investors, many of whom had seen their portfolios bruised by the market' relentless march higher last year, when the S&P gained 29%. The S&P was up 2.7% on Monday.
Though few, if any, could have named the coronavirus as a major threat to markets going into 2020, short sellers have long railed against stock valuations they perceived as being out of line with fundamentals and other excesses that have cropped up during the more than decade-long bull market.
""The run-up in the last fall was ridiculous. And there was a lot of cheerleading going on,"" said Brad Lamensdorf, a portfolio manager at Ranger Alternative Management.
His fund's short position has dropped to about 85% after Lamensdorf took profits on various bets against stocks, from being short 99% of his portfolio going into the year, he said.
The week's declines afforded Andrew Left of Citron Capital the opportunity to profitably close a long-held bet against online retailer Wayfair (N:W) on Friday. It was a position he had maintained for four years.
Wayfair shares dropped 21% last week amid the broad market selloff.
The sell-off has also helped Left profit from a bet against Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) shares. The electric car company's shares, which had more than doubled in price this year through Feb 21, fell 26% last week.
Yet the markets have not entirely spared Left's portfolio, which also includes long positions, or bets on certain stocks to move higher.
""My shorts have gone down, which is nice. My longs have gone down, which is not so nice,"" Left said. ""What I am hoping is that when the market does stabilize, at whatever level, my longs will be more resilient.""
The market tumble is also likely to be a boon for ""black swan"" funds - hedge funds that position themselves for big market dislocations sparked by unforeseen events.
""Risk management is not about timing, it is about contingency planning. Our clients were extremely well prepared,"" Mark Spitznagel, the founder of Universa Investments, said in a statement.
Among its strategies, the firm uses far out-of-the-money ""put"" options on individual stocks and broader markets, designed to explode in value when markets experience a sharp fall.
The window for short-selling gains may be a small one. Historically, big market drops have more often been brief, violent events that have been followed by rebounds.
The S&P 500 has notched weekly declines of 10% or more only 14 times in its history, and those drops have been followed by an average weekly gain of 3.5%, data from Bespoke Investment showed.
It is a fact that's not lost on short sellers like Lamensdorf.
""We're getting a little cash as this thing gets overdone because when the bounce comes, it's pretty brutal for a short seller,"" he said."

Investing.com – Nio failed to partake in the broad-based rally on Monday after an analyst on Wall Street warned the Chinese electric automaker's recent funding deal could prove short-term relief but longer-term pain should sales weakness continue.
  Citigroup   (NYSE:C) cut its price target on Nio (NYSE:NIO) to neutral from buy and lowered its price target on the stock to $4.30 from $6.80, sending shares down 3%.
Nio last week secured a financial lifeline after clinching a funding deal with the city of Hefei in China. But the deal will require the company to invest in building a new headquarters, which could throw the company back into financial trouble if sales don’t pick up, Citi warned.
""While the deal will ease (near-term) cash flow pressure on Nio, the collaboration will require Nio to spend a portion of the cash injection on the headquarters move, which may put the company under more pressure in case of prolonged sales weakness."""

Italy's third-largest bank, born from the merger of Banca Popolare di Milano with Verona-based  Banco Popolare , has its core operations the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the areas hardest hit by one of the world's worst outbreak of the new coronavirus outside of China.
Authorities have identified as the epicenter of the contagion a cluster of towns located near Lodi, some 60 km (40 miles) southeast of Milan, as well as a smaller zone in neighboring Veneto where a total of 50,000 inhabitants have been placed under quarantine.
Banco BPM had one of its existing five ""disaster recovery"" rooms, also known as ""business contingency"" rooms, in its Lodi offices, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the information is confidential.
Banco BPM declined to comment. 
Underground rooms equipped with computers where a bank's IT systems can run are part of lenders' ""business continuity"" plans, aimed at ensuring they can continue to operate in a crisis situation.
While the Lodi facility has not been shut down, the bank is rushing to get similar facilities ready also in Novara, a town in Piedmont, and Bergamo, a city north of Milan, the people added.
One of the sources said the various rooms did not differ in terms of their functions and each one of them would allow the bank to manage all basic operations in case of an emergency.
Banco BPM will present a new business plan on Tuesday. Due to the virus outbreak, like other companies in Milan, it will hold only an online investor presentation. 
Since the contagion came to light on Feb. 20, Italy has registered more than 2,000 confirmed cases and 52 people have died, most in the Lombardy region around the financial capital Milan.
Authorities have implemented a general clampdown across much of the affluent north, where schools have closed down and companies, including banks, have encouraged staff to work from home.

While banking heavyweights  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI) can rely on sophisticated systems to allow staff to work remotely across all functions, for smaller banks having employees operate from home could be more challenging.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares in Apple (O:AAPL) surged 6.9% on Monday, helped by a broad Wall Street rebound and an upgraded rating from an analyst who said the iPhone maker's stock had become oversold following last week's rout related to fears about the new coronavirus.
Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on Apple to ""outperform"" from ""perform"", saying the Cupertino, California, company was more prepared than its competitors to absorb the impact of the global health crisis. Apple's stock tumbled over 16% from its record high on Feb. 12 through Friday.
Monday's bounce put Apple's stock on track for its largest one-day gain since December 2018. The company relies heavily on China, where the coronavirus has hit production at its factories and kept consumers away from retail shops.
""Our limited checks indicate Apple will prove more resilient than others as firms worldwide navigate changing supply chains and customer demand uncertainty,"" Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz wrote in a client note.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX), which includes the stocks of many of Apple's suppliers, rebounded 1.9%. U.S. semiconductor companies rely more than most other U.S. companies on China for their sales.
More broadly, the S&P 500 jumped 2.8% as investors bet that monetary stimulus from central banks would cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus.
Optimism about Apple's increasing focus on recurring revenues from services including music, videogames and video have pushed its stock up 66% over the past year, even after last week's selloff.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union regulators will in June set out proposals to tackle Chinese state-backed companies enjoying an unfair advantage versus their European counterparts, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday, following calls from Germany and France.
Germany and France have led calls to EU antitrust regulators to do more to secure a level playing field for European companies competing with Chinese firms.
Last month, the two countries together with Italy and Poland urged Vestager to come up with proposals to revamp EU antitrust rules by the end of June.
""We're working on new powers to protect fair competition – powers that would allow us to deal, for example, with the harm that foreign subsidies and state ownership can do to competition in Europe,"" Vestager said at a College of Europe conference.
""By the end of June, we plan to publish a White Paper, to get input on our ideas for how these new powers could work,"" she said. White papers are proposals for interested parties to comment on before a final draft is adopted as legislation.
Vestager also signaled a tougher line against dominant companies squeezing out smaller rivals, saying a cease and desist order in today's world was not enough and action might be needed on both sides of the Atlantic.
""If the market has already tipped, and it's no longer possible for others to compete, then we might have to order those companies to neutralize the effects that they've had on competition,"" she said.
""I expect this issue will be an important theme for us in April, when we meet our counterparts from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, for a workshop on remedies."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Commerce Department official who helped lead the administration's efforts to impose export restrictions on China's Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] is resigning effective Friday, officials said on Monday.
Earl Comstock, who has served for three years as director of Policy and Strategic Planning at the department, often clashed with other administration officials on a range of issues. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement he valued Comstock's ""wise counsel, his deep policy expertise, his innovative thinking and leadership."" Ross added that he thanked Comstock ""for his service to the American people.""
Comstock was also a key person at the department on trade issues, notably the Commerce Department's Section 232 investigations into the national security impacts of automotive, steel and aluminum imports, and the unsuccessful effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. Census. Comstock did not respond to a request for comment.
Comstock was a driving force behind an effort to put further restrictions on Huawei. Among these were possible rules changes aimed at curtailing foreign shipments of products with U.S. technology to the No. 2 smartphone vendor amid frustration that the company’s placement on a U.S. trade blacklist in May failed to cut off supplies. 
Comstock helped convince the Defense Department to go along with a draft rule that would broaden U.S. authority over items with some U.S. content shipped from overseas. The Defense Department initially opposed the rule.
The fate of those restrictions are uncertain after President Donald Trump expressed alarm that new curbs on sales to China could have blocked General Electric’s ability to get a license to continue supplying engines for a new Chinese passenger airplane that is expected to go into service next year.

657,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 01:07PM ET</span>","'Neutron' Jack Welch, who led GE's rapid expansion, dies at 84","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jack Welch, who brought celebrity and swagger to the  General Electric  Co (N:GE) executive suite in the 1980s and 1990s by transforming a conglomerate best-known for light bulbs into the most valuable U.S. public company, has died at 84, GE said on Monday.
Known as ""Neutron Jack"" for cutting thousands of jobs, Welch bought and sold scores of businesses, expanded the industrial giant into financial services and produced steadily rising profits. His success led other CEOs to begin using financial wizardry to improve earnings and wow Wall Street. 
In Welch's 20 years as CEO, GE's market value grew from $12 billion to $410 billion, making Welch one of the most iconic corporate leaders of his era.
But the outsized financing business Welch built later nearly toppled GE, requiring a bailout from legendary investor Warren Buffett during the 2008 financial crisis. Welch's successor sold most of GE Capital and GE now trades at a fraction of its peak value.
""When the book about business leaders in this century is written, Jack Welch will be near the very top,"" said Thomas Cooke, professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. ""What he did as the leader of GE was remarkable."" 
President Donald Trump tweeted: ""There was no corporate leader like “neutron” Jack,"" adding his warmest sympathies ""to his wonderful wife & family!""
John F. Welch, Jr., followed Reginald Jones as CEO in April 1981 and served in that role until he retired in September 2001, choosing Jeff Immelt as his successor.
Two of Welch's other top disciples - and Immelt rivals - left GE to head other major companies, helping spread Welch's management style: Jim McNerney at  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Bob Nardelli at Chrysler and  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD). 
""Today is a sad day for the entire GE family,"" current GE Chairman and CEO Larry Culp said in a statement. ""Jack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century. He reshaped the face of our company and the business world.""
Welch acquired new businesses and did not hesitate to use layoffs and outsourcing to streamline them, sometimes leaving shattered, embittered communities behind.
While his career at GE is mostly described as an upward trajectory, it included an early setback. In 1963, the plastics factory in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where he was a chemical engineer, had an explosion that tore off the roof, and he was nearly fired. In recent years, he touted the experience as part of what created his management approach, noting that a manager at the time talked him through what he could have done better.
However, Welch was best known for his aggressive, in-your-face style and edict that GE be number one or two in every major sector - a view embraced by management consultants and business schools, said Tim Hubbard, assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. 
""It's very difficult to predict how things would have worked out if Jack stayed on deck, but certainly what happened to General Electric after he left is not a very positive story,"" said Hubbard. ""The failure of subsequent CEOs underscores how important Welch's leadership was to GE.""
A DIMINISHED CONGLOMERATE
After hitting its peak under Welch, GE's scope narrowed and its market value fell under Immelt. The company spun off much of its insurance business into Genworth Financial Inc (N:GNW) in 2004. 
The transformation to industrials accelerated after the 2008 bailout. In 2015, activist investor Nelson Pelz’s Trian Partners bought a $2.5 billion stake in GE and pushed for further focus on core industrial businesses, prompting Immelt to sell of most of the remaining parts of GE Capital.
Welch often faced criticism - particularly after he retired from GE - for his cavalier attitude about offshoring jobs and shutting down U.S. plants, a theme that has grown especially potent since the election of President Donald Trump. 
The U.S. industrial belt is dotted with communities devastated by the downsizing of GE, which began under Welch and has continued in the years after. At its peak, for instance, GE employed 30,000 at a sprawling integrated industrial plant in Schenectady, New York, that now employs fewer than 3,000. 
Both Welch's style of management and the strategy he pursued to expand GE seem to have fallen out of favor. CEOs who order mass layoffs now get attacked in tweets from the Oval Office, and Wall Street has lost its appetite for conglomerates. 
In 2012 Welch, who co-wrote a column with his wife Suzy Welch for media outlets including Reuters, sparked an outcry with a tweet suggesting the Obama White House manipulated job numbers for political gain.

ENGINEER BY TRAINING
Born in 1935, Welch received his B.S. degree in chemical engineering from the University of Massachusetts, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois in 1960.
In 1960, Welch joined GE as a chemical engineer at its plastics division in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He was elected the company's youngest vice president in 1972 and became vice chairman in 1979. 
In 1980, the year before Welch became CEO, GE recorded revenues of $26.8 billion; in 2000, the year before he left, they were nearly $130 billion. In 2001, GE was one of the largest and most valuable companies in the world, up from America's tenth-largest by market cap in 1981.
Welch also made GE a training ground for business leaders. His tough grading system provided advancement only for those who showed the best results, and weeded out the rest.
After retirement, he briefly taught a leadership course at MIT's Sloan School of Management and, later, founded an online MBA program called the Jack Welch Management Institute, now part of Strayer University.
Books by Welch include ""Winning,"" from 2005, and ""Jack: Straight from the Gut,"" published in 2001.

“Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others,” Welch wrote in ""Winning.""

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) will cut capacity in and out of Italy, its largest market, by 25% for three weeks due to a significant drop off in bookings since a coronavirus outbreak, Europe's biggest low-cost airline said on Monday.
The Irish airline said it did not expect the cancellations to have a material impact in its current financial year, which ends on March 31, and said it was ""far too early to speculate"" on the impact of the virus on next year's results.
Rivals including British Airways (L:ICAG), easyJet (L:EZJ) and Wizz (L:WIZZ) have already announced cancellations in the wake of disruption from the outbreak, which emerged in China in late December and has spread to more than 50 countries.
""We will make sensible cuts to our schedules over the comings weeks to reflect weaker bookings and changing travel patterns,"" Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said. ""This is a time for calm.""
The virus is likely, however, to result in the failure of more European airlines in the coming weeks, he said.
There have been a string of European airline collapses since 2017 that have left thousands of passengers stranded and had a knock-on effect on related industries such as hospitality.
Ryanair said it had notified passengers that it was reducing capacity in Italy by up to 25% for a three-week period from March 17 to April 8, saying there had been a significant drop in bookings during the past week for that period and a ""significant step up"" passenger no-shows, particularly from and within Italy.
Ryanair's European shares ended trading on Monday down 5% at 11.4 euros, or a drop of 29% from their 2020 peak of 16.07 euros hit on Jan. 10.
Analysts said they expected Ryanair to hit its target for profit in the current financial year of between 950 million and 1.05 billion euros but all bets were off thereafter because of the coronavirus.
""I heard from another airline that January was very good so they (Ryanair) obviously have enough in the bank to make the range,"" for full-year profit, said Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson, who described the cuts as ""sensible.""
""Of course, its academic. No one knows how the spring will shape up for the next fiscal year."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House will hold meetings this week with top executives from U.S. airlines and the cruise industry amid the growing coronavirus outbreak, a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence confirmed Monday.
Pence, who is overseeing the administration's efforts, will attend a meeting on Wednesday with airline officials Wednesday. Administration and airline officials said those planning to attend include the chief executives of  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV),  Spirit Airlines  Inc (N:SAVE) and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU). 
Airline stocks have fallen sharply in recent weeks. American, which was down 3.6% on Monday, is off about 40% in the last two weeks. United, which fell 3.7% Monday, is down almost 30% since Feb. 13.
Pence's office said he will meet on Saturday with cruise line chief executives in Florida. He will also meet with 3M Co (N:MMM) executives in Minnesota, where 3M is based, on Thursday.
3M told CNBC last week it was ramping up production of its N95 respirator mask in the face of rising demand.
Shares in  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (N:NCLH) are both down about 40% since January. Major cruise lines have been canceling cruises, especially in Asia, amid sagging demand. Asia accounts for about 10% of the worldwide cruise industry, and at one point the highest number of cases outside of China were aboard the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship docked in Japan.
U.S. airlines report travel demand has fallen sharply. Airlines have cut flights to Asia and Italy amid the crisis and canceled all flights to China until late April. 

In response to falling demand, American Airlines said on Sunday it is waiving change fees for all tickets purchased through March 16 if changes are made within two weeks.

Investing.com - The major stock indexes rose to the highs of the day Monday, but trading was volatile as investors weighed hopes of monetary easing and liquidity from central banks against further economic impact from Covid-19.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 550 points, or 2.2%. The S&P 500 rose 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9%.
Sentiment was buoyed by global central bank action and other possible government moves to stabilize markets. The Group of Seven finance ministers plan to hold a teleconference to discuss action to address the novel coronavirus, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.
In addition, President Donald Trump called on the Federal Reserve to move faster with rate cuts and also told reporters he had directed drug companies to speed up work on a vaccine for Covid-19.
But stocks whipsawed through the trading session, with the S&P twice dipping into the red in late-morning trading.

The ""precautionary measures"" come as global businesses take more sweeping steps to help prevent the spread of coronavirus.
""Effective immediately, all non-essential international business travel should be postponed,"" the memo said.
Until now most companies had focused on restricting travel to areas particularly affected by the virus such as mainland China, South Korea and Northern Italy, rather than imposing wider restrictions. 
But as the number of cases grow in other countries, firms are looking at more blanket measures. Last Thursday JPMorgan (N:JPM) also said it was restricting all but essential international work travel.
Goldman Sachs added that any travel to and within all of Italy is now restricted. All of the firm's staff who have traveled to mainland China, South Korea, Iran and Italy, or have been in close contact with individuals who have been to these countries, are required to self-isolate.

The spread of coronavirus outside of China has gone up in recent days, with cases in 53 countries and more than 100 deaths.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and exchanges in Europe are readying out-of-town offices, splitting shifts and isolating some teams to ensure they can keep trading if coronavirus spreads in more major financial centers.
Echoing steps already taken in Shanghai and Hong Kong, financial firms in Europe are preparing for the risk that the illness could lay low their staff or stop them commuting into London or other major cities.
The spread of coronavirus outside of China has gone up in recent days, with cases in 53 countries and more than 100 deaths, putting firms on heightened alert.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said that it was in close touch with firms about their plans.
""We expect all firms to have contingency plans in place to deal with major events so that they are able to continue operating effectively,"" it said on Monday.
Keeping trading desks going is a challenge as regulation - along with complex technology and the need for high speed connections - means they cannot just be operated remotely.
""Traders can't work from home for regulatory reasons, they need to be at one of our sites and we have prepared back-up facilities both within and outside London,"" a source at one major international bank in Britain said.
""Traders and front office staff will be prioritized to use those sites so there will be no interruption to the service our clients receive,"" the source said.
For regulators, ensuring trading continues is critical in providing enough liquidity for markets to deal with the volatility which has been sparked by fears about the virus outbreak's economic impact.
""We are currently in discussions with members and regulators about what actions might need to be taken to ensure markets remain well-functioning,"" the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) said in a statement.
""There are regulatory oversight challenges associated with working from remote locations and firms will need to review their policies and procedures,"" it added.
BACK-UP OPTIONS
Most major financial firms have out-of-town hubs where smaller groups of traders could carry on business.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) for example has an office in Croydon on the southern fringe of London, while the London Metal Exchange has a back-up site in Essex, to the east of the capital.
Saxo Bank told Reuters it is implementing a number of plans including ""splitting departments in affected areas into smaller teams that are isolated from each other and working in 14 days shifts with one group working in the office and the other team from either another location or home.""
Five other major investment banks said they were doing similar things, but declined to give details due to sensitivity about the arrangements.
""All big banks will rely on a rota, and only have 50% of their traders working in the same room at any given time,"" said one executive at an American bank in London.
Trading venues said they were doing what they can to allow more flexibility in where people could trade from.
German derivatives exchange Eurex issued a notice saying trading participants could ""in case of an emergency situation, participate in trading at Eurex Deutschland from outside their notified and approved trading locations"".
For non-bank firms, requirements on location are less onerous. Several hedge funds said all their staff were able to work from home if needs be, and that they have been ensuring employees have the right equipment to do so.
The spread of coronavirus has already caused banks to curb business travel to China, South Korea and parts of Italy.
Several have stepped up their restrictions in recent days with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan (N:JPM) and Deutsche Bank (DE:DB1Gn) among those to stop all non-essential international business travel."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering measures to protect its economy against the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, top officials said on Monday, as health risks in Europe were raised to high after the virus spread to most countries in the bloc.
About 2,100 cases of coronavirus infections have been confirmed across 18 of the 27 EU states and 38 EU citizens have died, according to figures released on Monday by the European Commission, the EU's executive. 
The sudden outbreak of the disease in Europe since mid-February is pushing EU states to coordinate economic and health responses. It had previously been concentrated in China where emerged in December. 
""The EU is ready to use all the available policy options if and when needed to safeguard our growth,"" EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told a news conference, saying risks threatened by the outbreak had now materialized.
He listed transport, tourism and carmakers among the sectors most affected.
European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said the ECB is also ready to help but that governments should be the first line of defense. 
""Fiscal policy should be the main instrument that is used in response to this situation,"" de Guindos said. ""Our reaction has to be calm ... and prudent."" 
In an extraordinary conference call on Wednesday, EU finance ministers will discuss immediate actions taken at national level to reduce risks of an economic crisis, Gentiloni said, including public support for healthcare and short-term liquidity measures.
The teleconference will also prepare the ground for a possible ""coordinated fiscal response"" to be decided in March by European finance ministers. That could involve extraordinary measures similar to those adopted to combat the 2008 global financial crisis, Gentiloni said, without giving more details.
Then, the EU introduced temporary exceptions to rules on state subsidies which allowed member countries to support their economies more freely. 
In February, the EU's economic powerhouse Germany dropped its traditional opposition to more investments at euro zone level as concerns about a slowdown grew.
In a further sign that the EU is adopting a more lenient approach to fiscal policy, Gentiloni praised measures announced by the Italian government to help its economy withstand Europe's largest outbreak of coronavirus.
He described as ""proportionate"" the package of measures worth 3.6 billion euros ($3.5 billion) announced on Sunday by Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri, even though it will further inflate Italy's budget deficit. 
HEALTH, BORDERS
At the same news conference, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU's disease prevention agency ECDC had raised its assessment of coronavirus risks ""from moderate to high"" in the EU. 
""In other words, the virus continues to spread,"" she told reporters.
To coordinate the EU reaction to the outbreak, EU health ministers will gather in Brussels on Friday for an extraordinary meeting, the second this year to address the coronavirus crisis.
The health council could be held in parallel with an extraordinary meeting of EU migration ministers, an EU official said. 
EU experts have so far agreed that turning people potentially infected with the virus back at borders could help spread the disease, but this position is subject to weekly reviews.
Closing Schengen's internal borders on health grounds would be unprecedented.
Speaking in London, de Guindos said China's measures to combat the outbreak could affect euro area exports and may cause disruptions in global supply chains. Services could also be affected, particularly by travel disruptions, he added.
Asked about the potential for an ECB rate cut, he echoed other ECB rate setters who have said it is too early for the central bank to act.
""We should not get confused. We are not almighty, we do not have the philosopher's stone,"" De Guindos said.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 07:34AM ET</span>",Nokia replaces CEO with Fortum boss Lundmark to revive 5G business,"By Anne Kauranen
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia (HE:NOKIA) has rehired former executive Pekka Lundmark from energy group Fortum to lead the Finnish telecoms company's efforts to revive its faltering 5G business.
Lundmark, who will succeed Rajeev Suri as Nokia chief executive in September, will team up with Sari Baldauf, the incoming chairman, in a move that reunites two figures from the era when the Finnish company dominated the mobile handsets business.
Baldauf and Lundmark have also worked closely in recent years, as Baldauf chaired Fortum's board between 2011 and 2018.
The leadership change at Nokia comes as uncertainty mounts over the future of Europe's telecoms vendors, with speculation surfacing last week that the group could be set for a tie-up with more profitable Swedish peer Ericsson (BS:ERICAs).
China's Huawei Technologies dominates the European market for telecommunications gear but the United States wants a global ban on Huawei from 5G networks on fears that its equipment could be used for spying, allegations the group has strongly rejected.
In a highly unusual move, the U.S. Attorney General William Barr said last month that the United States and its allies should consider taking a controlling stake in one or both of Nokia and Ericsson to counter Huawei's dominance.
But Nokia's outgoing chairman Risto Siilasmaa told a news conference on Monday Nokia has no plans to assess its strategic options.
""The new CEO after coming in will do his normal review on our strategy and may then propose changes to the board. But at the moment, we have no such actions underway,"" Siilasmaa said.
Nokia's shares, which in October lost a third their value when the group admitted to some delays in its 5G development and issued a profit warning, were originally up 4% on the news, but had dropped back to nearly flat by 1140 GMT.
Lundmark, CEO at Fortum since 2015, held executive positions at Nokia between 1990 and 2000, including vice president of strategy and business development at Nokia Networks. By 1998 Nokia had grown into the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, a position it maintained for more than a decade.
His appointment will reunite him at the top of the company with Baldauf, another key executive from that period, who headed Nokia's networks unit - now the group's main business - between 1998 and 2005.
""This is clearly a choice of Mrs Baldauf due to their common history at both Nokia and Fortum,"" Nordea analysts said.
""A new era will start at Nokia and could include strategy and portfolio revisions announced in H2. We welcome this change and view Mr Lundmark as a good choice for the job given the situation,"" they said in a note to clients.
""NEED FOR REDIRECTION""
Lundmark led Fortum to embark on a bold attempt to gain control of its German rival Uniper, resulting in a power deadlock between the companies that has yet to be resolved.
Before his time at Fortum, Lundmark led Finnish cranemaker Konecranes for 10 years until 2015.
""We view the change of CEO positively due to the fact that in its current situation Nokia needs a greater redirection which embarks from changing the management,"" said analyst Mikael Rautanen of Inderes.
""At the same time, the news strengthens our earlier assessment that the company has more than just temporary problems,"" he added.
Nokia halted dividend payouts after the October profit warning. While Huawei has suffered from U.S. authorities' decision last May to blacklist the group, Nokia has struggled to capitalise on those restrictions.
One of the firm's main headaches has had to do with delays and additional investments in its 5G system-on-chip (SoC) development, which allows a single chip to carry an entire computer system and enables Nokia to produce its network technology more cheaply.
A Reuters report revealed last month that Europe's biggest telecoms operator Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) had dropped Nokia as a provider of radio gear from all but one of its dozen markets in the region, telling it to improve its products and service.
Nokia shares rose last week after Bloomberg News reported that the Finnish telecom network equipment maker was considering asset sales and mergers.
However, a source close to the company told Reuters there was no truth to the report. Nokia declined to comment at the time."
693,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Serious health care lapses found in U.S. detention center housing transgender migrants,"By Mica Rosenberg and Ted Hesson
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal inspections of the U.S. government's only dedicated detention unit for transgender immigrants last year found hundreds of unanswered requests for medical attention, poor quarantine procedures and deficient treatment for mental illnesses and other chronic diseases, Reuters has learned.
Details of the inspections of the transgender unit at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico, which have not been reported previously, were contained in internal reports from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) health corps and a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) civil rights office. 
The problems, which led to the transfer of all detainees to other facilities in January, were described to Reuters by congressional aides who were briefed on the documents and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The reports come to light as Democrats in Congress accuse ICE of not living up to the agency's own standards for caring for detained transgender immigrants.
April Grant, an ICE spokeswoman, did not comment directly on the specifics outlined by the congressional aides but confirmed that a December 2019 report by the ICE health corps found ""several health care-related deficiencies"" at the center, such as failing to complete laboratory orders or arrange for HIV patients to see infectious disease specialists within 30 days of arrival. 
Grant said many of those problems were addressed in December, for instance by speeding up backlogged lab orders and educating staff on detention standards and medication policies.
However, the concerns led to the transfer of all of the approximately two dozen detainees in the transgender unit, as well as other chronically ill detainees in the general population. About half were sent to a facility Aurora, Colorado, and the others to one in Tacoma, Washington, according to transgender detainees, former detainees and their advocates. 
At Cibola, some told Reuters, detainees had made desperate attempts to get adequate care.
""Every time we felt sick the first step was to raise a request, but they never answered,"" said Kelly Aguilar, a 23-year-old transgender woman from Honduras who said she had been detained at Cibola for two years before being transferred to Aurora. 
""When people had fevers, headaches, stomach problems, we just tried to help each other by giving sips of water or buying pills in the commissary, but a lot of times we didn't have money.""
ICE was not able to immediately comment on individual cases described in this story. 
Amanda Gilchrist, a spokeswoman for CoreCivic Inc (N:CXW), the private prison company that operates Cibola and holds immigrant detainees under an ICE contract, said the company was ""committed to providing a safe environment for transgender detainees"" including training staff about preventing abuse and harassment.
A DEBATE IN CONGRESS 
Revelations about the medical concerns at Cibola come as Democrats in Congress are scrutinizing care for the approximately 100 self-identified transgender detainees in U.S. facilities, a small portion of migrants in immigration custody. Many are awaiting resolution of asylum claims. 
Democratic lawmakers are pushing ICE to enforce the agency's existing detention standards for transgender immigrants laid out in a 2015 memo. The memo, signed by former ICE Director Thomas Homan during the Obama administration, offers such protections as allowing immigrants to be housed according to their gender identity (transgender women with other women, for instance), as well as to be given access to medically necessary hormone therapy and mental health care. 
Homan told Reuters it had proven difficult to find facilities willing to modify their contracts to adopt the transgender care standards. Currently none have done so. 
Some ICE facilities, like Cibola, are operated by private prison companies. Others are run by federal, state or local governments. In December, Democrats directed ICE, in legislative guidance that accompanied a spending package, to adhere to the memo - but ICE rebuffed the request at the end of January, according to a congressional aide. The legislative guidance from Democrats is ""not legally binding upon the agency,"" according to an ICE statement that was provided to Congress and seen by Reuters. 
Legislative guidance accompanying spending bills is commonly followed by government agencies, former federal officials and legal experts say. 
Grant said several of the country's more than 200 immigration detention centers have ""informally"" implemented aspects of the 2015 memo. She said ICE is continuing to look for facilities willing to run a dedicated transgender housing unit and ""remains optimistic that some locations will sign the formal contract modification."" 
Sharita Gruberg from the Washington D.C.-based liberal nonprofit Center for American Progress, one of the groups that filed complaints with ICE about the treatment of transgender detainees, said the transfers only shuffled the problems to other facilities. 
""Congress is asking ICE to adopt its own standards for care,"" she said. But ""instead of complying with their own standards and complying with congressional direction, they went with secret option number three of just transferring (detainees) to other private prisons."" 
Since taking office in 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump has rolled back protections for transgender people in the U.S. military, public schools and federal prisons. 
Trump also has made an immigration crackdown - including increased detention of unauthorized immigrants - an important part of his presidency and his 2020 re-election campaign. 
FROM HOPE TO DISAPPOINTMENT 
ICE opened the dedicated transgender unit at Cibola in 2017 after a similar facility in California ended its contract with the agency. 
Some detainees told Reuters that arriving at Cibola initially seemed a respite, allowing them to live among others like them, without the fear of abuse they had suffered in their home countries and other U.S. detention centers. 
Zsa Zsa, a 54-year-old Jamaican who asked that her last name be withheld, said that after stints at ICE facilities in the general population of male detainees in San Diego and El Paso, she felt safer at Cibola. But soon, she said, she came to believe that the medical care in Cibola was ""very poor."" She said she repeatedly tried and failed to get a specific medication to control her high blood pressure, becoming dizzy from lack of treatment. 
Honduran detainee Shantell Hernandez, 29, said she had asked repeatedly for hormones at Cibola, but to no avail. It took her transfer to detention in Washington to get the medication she said she needed. 
Before that, she said, ""They never gave them to me.""

Bonds extended a rally and oil advanced.
Contracts on the S&P 500 Index had earlier advanced as much as 2.4%, but the move gradually faded through the European morning as more virus cases were reported and the OECD cut its global growth forecast. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index also reversed a big early jump as the share gauge in Italy, the region’s epicenter for virus cases, tumbled.
The attempt at a bounce earlier followed a rare statement on Friday from the Federal Reserve that opened the door to a rate cut based on the “evolving risks” posed by the outbreak. Central banks in Japan and the U.K. followed suit with supportive messages. Money market traders expect the European Central Bank to ease rates by 10 basis points in April. Most core European bonds gained, tracking Treasuries as they rallied for an eighth day. The dollar slipped against the euro and most major currencies.
Investors are weighing the central bank comments against increasing pessimism from economists on global growth, with fears mounting that the virus will trigger more losses after the S&P 500 Index’s worst week since 2008. China’s CSI 300 Index jumped 3.2% on Monday, even after the nation saw a much deeper contraction in manufacturing than forecast.

Stocks reversed gains in the last hour of the session, with the benchmark index briefly nearing the correction zone, after the health ministry reported two new coronavirus cases on Monday.

The nation has so far only recorded three other cases -- all from Kerala in the far south -- who have all since recovered.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>","Coronavirus hits global factories, policy easing prospects rise","By Jonathan Cable and Leika Kihara
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global factories took a beating in February from the coronavirus outbreak with activity in China shrinking at a record pace, surveys showed on Monday, raising the prospect of a coordinated policy response by central banks to prevent a global recession.
Fears of a pandemic pushed markets off a precipice last week, wiping more than $5 trillion from global share values as stocks cratered, marking their steepest slump in more than a decade and stoking widespread expectations of monetary easing.
The outbreak is plunging the world economy into its worst downturn since the global financial crisis, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned on Monday, urging governments and central banks to fight back to avoid an even steeper slump.
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday the Bank of Japan would take necessary steps to stabilise financial markets. Futures now imply a full 50 basis point cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve in March , while Australian markets are pricing in a quarter-point cut at the RBA's Tuesday meeting.
Kuroda's comments, made in an emergency statement just days after a similar move by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, were welcomed by markets as a signal the world's biggest central banks were mustering a coordinated response to the crisis, and world stock markets regained a measure of calm on Monday. [MKTS/GLOB]
China, for its part, has injected large amounts of liquidity to shore up market confidence.
The central People's Bank of China (PBOC) has also told banks to help firms struggling with repayments by extending loans and not penalise them if they are late with payments.
""Policymakers and the credit rating agencies have taken a 'wait-and-see' approach to the situation, although – as usual – the relative order of willingness to act re: events with policy action was confirmed this past week,"" said Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit.
In Australia, financial regulators held an emergency meeting to discuss the economic impact of the outbreak, two sources told Reuters, as markets moved to price in a central bank rate cut as early as this week.
""A rate cut only helps a little bit, by easing debt service costs. But it does little if anything to solve the bigger problems of cash flow interruption,"" said Rob Carnell, Asia- Pacific chief economist at ING in Singapore.
""This is where the BoJ's special loans ... and the PBOC's suggested easing of banks' response to late or delinquent loans is closer to what is needed.""
CHINA BRAKES
China's factory activity suffered the sharpest contraction on record in February, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed, underlining the crippling effects of tough travel curbs and public health measures taken to contain the outbreak.
That followed the Chinese government's similarly dire PMI release at the weekend, which also showed a record pace of decline.
And while the manufacturing downturn in the euro zone eased last month the virus outbreak is starting to weigh on a post-election recovery in Britain's manufacturing sector, where factories reported a big jump in delays in their supply chains.
""Should disruptions continue in China and even spread to other economies, as is looking increasingly likely given the recent news flow, then we could see supply- and demand-side constraints come into effect and the decline in production accelerate anew,"" said IHS Markit economist Phil Smith.
The slump in China, the world's second-largest economy, dealt a severe blow to factories across Asia, including those in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, offering the clearest evidence yet of the epidemic's damaging effects on global growth and businesses.
""The slump in manufacturing activity looks to have had a significant impact on trade,"" Capital Economics wrote in a research note on the Caixin PMI.
""The PMIs also point to a major hit to employment, the effects of which will take longer to reverse. And with the jump in virus cases overseas, there is a growing risk of a protracted downturn in foreign demand.""
Japan's PMI showed its factory activity was hit by the sharpest contraction in nearly four years in February, reinforcing expectations the economy may have slipped into recession.
Separate data showed Japanese firms cut spending on plant and equipment in the quarter to December, casting doubt on the Bank of Japan's view that robust domestic demand will make up for some of the weakness in exports.
""Near-term prospects for Japan's industrial sector appear very bleak,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
South Korea's factory activity also shrank faster in February, as export orders contracted at the quickest pace in over six years in a shattering blow to production.
Activity in Vietnam and Taiwan, two key economies in the global technology supply chain, slipped into contraction from growth the month earlier.
Among Asian economies less reliant on global trade, growth in India's factory sector eased slightly from a near eight-year high in January while Indonesia's factory sector returned to growth."

Global airlines have warned of the toll on their business as passenger numbers fall due to the outbreak that first emerged in China in late December and has since spread to more than 50 countries.
Airlines have stopped flights to Iran, where the virus is rapidly spreading, and Saudi Arabia has temporarily banned tourists from 25 countries that have recorded cases the virus.
""The region depends on air connectivity, and support from governments will really help the airlines to get through this difficult period,"" the International Air Transport Association's Vice President for Africa and the Middle East Muhammad Ali Albakri told reporters. 
Albakri said IATA was not calling for state bailouts, but that governments could help airlines with their operating costs.
Governments control a number of costs incurred by airlines, such as taxes and landing and overflight fees. 
Most Middle East airlines are state-owned. In the past major Gulf carriers have come under scrutiny over allegations they unfairly benefited from state funds, a charge they deny. 
Albakri said he did not expect other jurisdictions to criticize support given to airlines due to the coronavirus, known as COVID-19. 
Emirates, the Middle East's biggest carrier, is asking its staff to take paid and unpaid leave to help it manage a ""measurable slowdown"" due to the virus, Reuters reported on Sunday.
Air ticket sales to, from, and within the Middle East are seen dropping over the next few weeks, and airlines in the region stand to lose around $100 million in revenue at this stage, AlBakri said. 
Middle Eastern carriers, most of which are unprofitable, have stopped most flights to China and cut or reduced flights on other Asian routes. 
""Significant additional revenue is at risk to the Middle East carriers if the travel restrictions spread further to the rear of Asia Pacific,"" Albakri said. 

Roughly 50% of all Middle East airline capacity is flown on services to and from Asia Pacific, he said, highlighting the considerable risk to their business.

Crude oil rebounded.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped, with 17 of 19 industry sectors in the green, and futures for all three main American indexes advanced in the wake of a rare statement from the Federal Reserve that opened the door to a rate cut based on the “evolving risks” posed by the outbreak. The The Bank of Japan hinted at easing, and the Bank of England pledged to “ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.”
Money market traders expect the European Central Bank to ease rates by 10 basis points in April as policy maker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said more could be done if needed. Most European bonds gained, tracking Treasuries as they rallied for an eighth day. The dollar slipped as the euro strengthened.
Investors appear to be encouraged that policy makers will act after fears about the spreading virus drove the S&P 500 Index to its worst week since 2008. China’s CSI 300 Index rose more than 3% even after the nation saw a much deeper contraction in manufacturing than economists had anticipated. Germany’s finance ministry is exploring ways to loosen deficit limits that may pave the way for higher spending to boost Europe’s biggest economy.
“We’ll start to see more rhetoric from governments to address the situation both from a fiscal and central bank easing standpoint,” said Damien Loh, chief investment officer at Ensemble Capital Pte in Singapore. “We might see one leg of risk-off but it feels to me most of the bad news has been priced in.”
The global death toll from the virus has surpassed 3,000, with the number of U.S. cases climbing over the weekend, including the first positive test for a person in New York State, while cases in Italy and South Korea jumped. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with pharmaceutical industry executives at 3 p.m. Washington time Monday.
Elsewhere, Australian and New Zealand 10-year bond yields hit fresh record lows. The Mexican peso tumbled about 1% after President Trump said he is considering increased controls on the border since Mexico reported its first coronavirus case.

The Indonesia Stock Exchange banned short selling in stocks after the coronavirus outbreak pushed the nation’s equities to the cusp of a bear market.
The Jakarta Composite Index dropped as much as 1.8% on Monday, sending the benchmark within a whisker of a 20% decline from a record high in 2018, after the Southeast Asian nation confirmed its first two coronavirus cases. It then pared losses to 0.9% as of 3:51 p.m. in Jakarta.
The bourse will not publish the list of stocks eligible for short selling until further notice to curb speculation and ensure market stability, it said in a statement on Monday. It also has other tools in the pipeline to ensure that the market gets stabilized, the statement added.
“We will be very careful when implementing additional tools and will partner with other authorities before implementing those tools,” the exchange’s President Director Inarno Djajadi told reporters in Jakarta. “We ask investors not to panic and to be reactive to the market slump.”
The ban on short selling is among a series of steps Indonesia is taking to counter the coronavirus impact in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy and its stock market. It’s “a good policy to reduce volatility, to avoid any inappropriate behavior of hedge funds,” said Amica Darmawan, a fund manager at PT First State Investments Indonesia.
In other measures on Monday, Bank Indonesia relaxed the amount of reserves banks need to hold and signaled more steps to stem a rout in the rupiah and the nation’s bonds. On Monday, the yield on benchmark 10-year notes spiked above 7% for the first time since early January, while the currency halted a losing streak of nine straight days.
The central bank’s steps to ease liquidity will help markets, but any moves on fiscal stimulus and a gradual depreciation of the rupiah will help more, Darmawan said."
702,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 04:38AM ET</span>","Virus Drives China Factories to Record Slump, Dragging on Asia","(Bloomberg) -- Asia’s manufacturing took a tumble in February under the weight of the rapidly spreading coronavirus, with a severe contraction in activity in China driving down output across the region.
China’s factory index from IHS Markit dropped to the lowest since the series began in 2004, according to figures released Monday. Reports in South Korea and Japan showed deeper slumps last month, while Taiwan also recorded weaker activity.
The numbers show how the outbreak is rippling through the region, disrupting supply chains and depressing demand. Travel restrictions are widespread, schools and businesses are shuttered in some countries and governments are scrambling to provide stimulus.
Global stock markets, which took a battering last week on concern about the virus, halted their slide on Monday. That was partly due to anticipation about central banks stepping in with monetary easing.
The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England pledged action aimed at stabilizing financial markets, days after the Federal Reserve issued its own statement that opened the door to interest rate cuts. Also on Monday, France said that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response to the virus.
In Europe, headline manufacturing numbers were better in February than the previous month, though there were clear signs of the virus hitting business, with widespread delivery delays and steep declines in foreign orders.
“The concern is that coronavirus-related delays in shipments threaten to constrain production in the coming months,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at IHS Markit. That could prolong “a downturn that already extends to over a year.”
Manufacturing in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam also shrank in February. Growth at India’s factories cooled from the fastest pace in almost eight years.
Indonesia was a lone bright spot in Asia, seeing manufacturing expand for the first time since June. Southeast Asia’s biggest economy on Monday confirmed its first two coronavirus cases.

China’s official PMI plunged in February to a record-low 35.7 from 50 at the start of the year, according to figures released Saturday. That signals a worse-than-expected first-quarter contraction, with Nomura Holdings Inc. projecting the economy will shrink 2.5% compared with the previous period.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“We expect China’s PMIs to see some improvement in the coming months. Yet the continued disruptions in the supply chain and weakness of the Chinese economy could put downward pressures on the regional economies for some time.”
-Chang Shu, chief Asia economist
China’s economy is gradually returning to work with activity likely running at 60%-70% capacity last week, according to a Bloomberg Economics report, up from about 50% two weeks ago.
“Evidence of factories re-starting -- albeit very unevenly and tentatively -- means that the recovery will be somewhat short of a resounding V-shaped rebound,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “The bigger picture of a tepid recovery from brutal seizures remains.”"

Oil giant Sinopec (SS:600028) - keen to get customers back in their cars and help farmers unable to deliver produce due to roadblocks - launched a new scheme last month called ""zero-touch"" vegetable sales at its 6,000 gas stations in 147 Chinese cities.
Consumers place and pay for orders on the Sinopec mobile app and when they drive up, gas station attendants put the vegetables into their car trunk, eliminating any need for human-to-human contact. 
""The coronavirus outbreak has made it difficult for people to shop as before,"" said Li Hong, vice president of Sinopec's convenience store sales division. ""Travel demand has been falling, but demand for food is pretty rigid."" 
Mengniu Dairy (HK:2319), China's second largest dairy producer, is racing to add more vending machines to the 10,000 it currently has, saying the epidemic has driven unexpectedly strong demand for the sales channel.
Its system allows customers to order products like milk and yoghurt online which can then be picked up from their local vending machine. 
""The virus outbreak has curbed consumption for dairy products as people are unwilling to go to the supermarket,"" said Meng Fanjie, head of the company's Communist Party committee.
The company has also introduced a 'community wholesale' initiative, making bulk deliveries to housing compounds and other communities so that the people living there do not need to venture too far out.
""The new retail measures...have helped to bring back some sales and given us bigger market share,"" he said, adding that sales as of Feb. 27 had returned to 80% of levels seen in January.
 Luckin Coffee  (O:LK), a domestic rival to Starbucks (O:SBUX), now also offers deliveries of alcohol-based sterilizers and antibiotic hand soap in addition to caffeinated beverages. It is also stocking its network of vending machines, launched this year, with the sanitizer products.
Liu Xingliang, an independent retail analyst, said, however, that he thought Luckin's strategy would have only a modest impact. ""At best some users will place an order when they buy coffee but nobody is deliberately choosing the Luckin app just to buy sanitizer.""

The epidemic, which began in China and has killed almost 3,000 people worldwide, is disrupting flight demand and many airlines have suspended or adjusted services in response.
""After a thorough assessment of all currently available information on the coronavirus, Lufthansa Group has decided to continue to extend the suspension of flights between Germany, Switzerland, Austria and mainland China by Lufthansa, SWISS and Austrian Airlines until 24 April,"" Lufthansa said.
It said it was also suspending flights between Munich and Hong Kong between March 6 and April 24, with passengers to be put onto flights via Frankfurt and Zurich where possible. It said it was cancelling some flights between Frankfurt and Munich to Seoul too.
Lufthansa Group airlines, which include Swiss and Austrian airlines, had already said on Friday that it would reduce the number of short- and medium-haul flights by up to 25% in the coming weeks depending on how coronavirus spreads.
On Monday Lufthansa gave details of its scheduling changes, including adjusting services to northern Italy, which has become a flashpoint in the coronavirus outbreak.
It said Austrian Airlines was slashing its flights to Italy in March and April by 40% while Lufthansa subsidiary Brussels Airlines is cutting flights to Rome, Milan, Venice and Bologna by 30% until March 14.
Swiss Airlines will probably also cut some services to parts of Italy until the end of April while Eurowings is reducing capacity to some Italian destinations until March 8.
Lufthansa said it was too early to assess the impact on its earnings, which are due to be published on March 19.

The airline has already said it would look into economic temporary measures such as a company-wide hiring freeze.

HNA directly owns or holds stakes in a number of local Chinese carriers, which have suffered in recent weeks from widespread flight cancellations and plummeting demand. 
Hainan Airlines Holding Co Ltd (SS:600221), the flagship of HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL], rose by over 3% by 0400 GMT, while HNA Technology Investments Holdings Ltd (HK:2086) surged nearly 40%. 
Other units such as  HNA Investment Group Co Ltd  (SZ:000616) and HNA Technology Co Ltd (SS:600751) also saw their prices climb. 
HNA Group said on Saturday it had asked the Hainan provincial government to lead a working group as it was not able to deal with the liquidity risk itself.
The group had acknowledged liquidity issues before the coronavirus outbreak started. In December, Chairman Chen Feng said HNA had faced cash flow shortage that forced it to delay salary payments.
Its Saturday announcement has driven heavy discussion in China on whether there will be a carving up of its assets.
Two weeks ago, HNA-related shares likewise rose on a media report that said China's government planned to take over the debt-laden conglomerate.
""The implementation of a government acquisition would be challenging as HNA's structure is complex,"" Warut Promboon, head of credit research at Bondcritic, said on Monday. ""Overall, it is credit positive. HNA has grown too fast and is too big that it needs to be broken down. The restructuring will be best under the state support.""
ACQUISITIVE
HNA Group was once one of China's most aggressive deal-makers, spending $50 billion in global acquisition spree featuring big names such as  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT).
It began selling many of its purchases two years ago to focus on its airlines and tourism businesses, after its massive spending drew scrutiny from China's central government and other overseas regulators.
Analysts said issues that have affected Hainan Airlines and other HNA subsidiaries largely persist and questioned the extent to which local government involvement will help them toward leaner books and stable profit. 
On the up side, there could be opportunity to streamline and gain market share as the industry recovers from the virus fallout, said transportation analyst Luya You at BOCOM International.
Data from Cirium showed the number of flights to, from and within China canceled or removed from schedules totaled 347,414 from Jan. 24 through Feb. 27.
Airlines have taken various cost-cutting measures to help alleviate pressure while the aviation regulator said it has asked the central government to introduce more subsidies for the industry.

""The coronavirus effects have hit the aviation market quite severely and will likely reshape the landscape for the latter half of 2020,"" You said.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 1.8% by 0818 GMT, after a 12% slump last week, with miners (SXPP) and oil & gas companies (SXEP) leading the gains.
Sentiment firmed as bleak factory activity data out of China fueled hopes of more stimulus, even as new infections in the country declined.
However, the virus continues to spread elsewhere. United States reported its second death, while the United Kingdom reported a total of 36 cases as of Sunday.
Italy, the worst-hit in Europe, saw death toll rise to 34, five more than a day earlier.
Investors are betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 50 basis points as early as March, while the European Central Bank is expected to cut rates by a 10 basis point (bps) at the April meeting.

Investing.com -- Europe's stock markets bounced sharply at opening on Monday, in the wake of statements from central banks around the world indicating they won't let panic selling push the world into a financial crisis. 
By 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 7.6 points or 2.0% at 381.64, while the German DAX index was up 1.6% and the FTSE 100 was up 2.5%.
The move was a response to a string of reassuring statements from central banks, even if the statements themselves didn't vary much from what markets already knew about central bank reaction functions. The Federal Reserve had started the ball rolling on Friday (after the European close) with a statement that it would act ""as appropriate"" to support the economy, while the Bank of Japan was somewhat more explicit on Monday in a statement that singled out further quantitative easing as a possibility for keeping markets orderly and liquidity ample.
The Bank of England, meanwhile, said it’s working with the U.K. government and others “to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.” 
“The bank continues to monitor developments and is assessing its potential impacts on the global and U.K. economies and financial systems,” a spokesperson said.

It turned in a preliminary sales figure of 275,044 vehicles for the month, 13% below 315,820 vehicles sold a year earlier. Hyundai last reported sales lower than this in February 2010.
South Korea's Hyundai, which with affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270) is the world's No.5 car maker, is the first major automaker to announce sales for the month. Chinese and U.S. players will turn in their numbers in the coming weeks. 
The flu-like virus, which originated in China, has killed nearly 3,000 and roiled global financial markets as investors and policymakers brace for a steep knock to world growth. 
South Korea has the most cases of infections outside the mainland, with the total at 4,212, affecting companies like Hyundai and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
""Inside South Korea is now more urgent than China,"" Korea Investment & Securities analyst Kim Jin-woo wrote in a note. 
""With sluggish consumption affecting demand on top of it all, means auto sales are certain to be hit in the first quarter, and the impact expected to continue until at least the beginning of the second quarter."" 
Hyundai was the first major automaker to flag a hit to its manufacturing outside China when it halted production at home, its biggest manufacturing base, in February due to a shortage of parts from China.
While the automaker has gradually resumed output, virus-related uncertainties remain. Just last week, a worker at its factory complex in the southeastern South Korean city of Ulsan tested positive for the virus, prompting it to shut a factory. 
The plant, which makes popular models such as the Palisade sport utility vehicle, resumed production on Monday, a Hyundai spokesman said. 

South Korean coronavirus cases are concentrated in the fourth-largest city of Daegu and the North Gyeongsang province, home to about 20% of auto parts suppliers in the country, Statistics Korea data shows.

The won jumped as much as 1.9% while the Thai baht strengthened and the Malaysian ringgit each advanced at least 0.5% after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the central bank would “act as appropriate” to combat the economic threat of the coronavirus.
Gains in the won also reflected the unexpected decision by the Bank of Korea on Thursday to refrain from a knee-jerk rate cut. The won appreciated to 1191.70 per dollar Monday in its biggest intraday increase since June 2016.
The nation’s sovereign bonds also rallied, sending the three-year yield to a record low 1.05%.
“The Fed’s comments are in effect soothing markets for now,” said So Jaeyong, economist at Shinhan Bank in Seoul. The won may strengthen to 1,190 per dollar this week, said So.
The won’s move comes even as the number of virus cases in South Korea rose past 4,200, while North Korea fired two unidentified projectiles in its first missile test of the year."

The S&P BSE Sensex advanced 1.6% to 38,895.17, as of 9:48 a.m. in Mumbai, while the NSE Nifty 50 Index also climbed 1.6%. The Sensex plunged 7% last week, its biggest five-day decline in a decade, as a surge in coronavirus cases roiled markets across the world. The relative strength index for the Sensex dropped below 30, a level that indicates the gauge is oversold to some analysts.

The government of Hainan appointed Gu Gang, Hainan Develoment Holdings Chairman, as the executive chairman for HNA. A working group of officials from the municipality, the civil aviation authority and China Development Bank was also being set up to contain the fallout for business from the coronavirus outbreak. 
 
Chen Feng will remain as the company chairman, according to a separate statement. 
 
State authorities will now go through HNA’s books to figure out how to sell off the group’s assets and pay off debt, according to Bloomberg that cited people familiar with the matter. 
 
“This is great news for bondholders, at least in the short term, as it’s a huge upgrade to the company’s credit risk,” said Warut Promboon, managing partner at credit research firm Bondcritic Ltd in the Bloomberg report. “What’s happening to HNA is just the tip of the iceberg of what’s coming for a lot of companies in China.”
 
The news came after Bloomberg reported last month that China was close to taking control of HNA and may sell off its airline assets amid the downturn.
 
The company owns several carriers, including its flagship Hainan Airlines Holdings. It is also a major shareholder of the Hong Kong Airlines Ltd, which struggled with financial sustainability in the past few years after a wave of senior executive departures in 2018, as well as a fight over control among several big shareholders this year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean budget carrier  Jeju Air Co Ltd  (KS:089590) said on Monday it would acquire a 51% stake in competitor Eastar Jet for 54.5 billion won ($45.49 million), a lower price than previously announced.
The acquisition is the latest case of restructuring in South Korea's aviation industry, which is suffering losses from low travel demand due the coronavirus epidemic and a diplomatic feud between South Korea and Japan last year.
South Korea has the most virus infections outside China, with 4,212 as of Monday.
The final acquisition price is lower than a preliminary deal price of about 69.5 billion won Jeju Air reported in a December regulatory filing, which was subject to change after due diligence.
A Jeju Air spokesman declined comment on whether the change in the price was affected by the coronavirus epidemic or South Korean airlines' current difficulties.
Jeju Air said last month it was instituting unpaid leave for all employees due to shrinking travel demand, while Eastar Jet has said it will only pay 40% of executives' and employees' salaries in February, with the remainder to be paid at a later date.
""The management is well aware that there is concern among our employees about the Eastar Jet acquisition,"" Jeju Air CEO Lee Seok-joo said in a message to employees on Monday.
""However, the domestic airline industry, which has a structural problem of oversupply, will soon have to restructure... If it's unavoidable, we believe it's best to make a preemptive move.""
Jeju Air shares jumped as much as 21% after the announcement."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian shares steadied from early losses on Monday as investors placed their hopes on a coordinated global monetary policy response to weather the damaging economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic.
Pandemic fears pushed markets off a precipice last week, wiping more than $5 trillion from global share value as stocks cratered to their steepest slump in more than a decade.
The sheer scale of losses prompted financial markets to price in policy responses from the U.S. Federal Reserve to the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of Australia.
Futures now imply a full 50 basis point cut by the Fed in March while Australian markets are pricing in a quarter-point cut at the RBA's Tuesday meeting.
Also helping calm market nerves, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday the central bank would take necessary steps to stabilise financial markets. [
In equities, Chinese shares opened higher with the blue-chip index (CSI300) up 1.5%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) advanced 0.4%, turning around from a loss of about 0.3% earlier in the day.
E-minis for the S&P500 (ESc1), which were down more than 1% at one point, were last up 0.3% while Japan's Nikkei (N225), which opened 1.3% lower at a six month trough, climbed 0.4%.
Australia's S&P ASX/200 (AXJO), which had tumbled 3%, was last off 1.8%.
Benchmark U.S. 10-Year Treasuries hit a fresh record low of 1.0750% (US10YT=RR).
Despite some stability in the market, analysts still expect volatility to persist.
""Any signs that new cases are beginning to taper could be seen as a positive catalyst for the market especially given that some of the market complacency has reduced with equity valuations much lower vs few weeks ago,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note.
""In the very near term until 1Q reporting results, we expect Asian equities may remain quite volatile,"" they added.
""However, on a medium term basis we believe the risk-reward is now getting favourable, assuming the virus does not take the form of a virulent global pandemic.""
Leaders in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas rolled out bans on big gatherings and stricter travel restrictions over the weekend as cases of the new coronavirus spread.
The epidemic, which began in China, has killed almost 3,000 people worldwide as authorities race to contain infections in Iran, Italy, South Korea and the United States.
Both official and private surveys, released on Saturday and Monday respectively, showed China's factory activity collapsing to its worst levels on record as the virus crippled broad areas of the economy.
""It is now highly probable that the coronavirus will spread globally,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
""Financial markets may over-react until they have visibility on the actual impact.""

Investing.com - Asian markets rebounded on Monday in Asia, with Chinese stocks surging 3% even after data showed the country’s manufacturing activity contracted in February. 
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both surged 3.0% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). 
The surge in prices came despite a private survey showed China’s manufacturing activities slowed last month. 
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index came in at 40.3 for February, which was its lowest reading since the survey was launched in early 2004.
“China’s manufacturing economy was impacted by the epidemic last month,” said Zhengsheng Zhong, chief economist at CEBM Group, a Caixin subsidiary. “The supply and demand sides both weakened, supply chains became stagnant, and there was a big backlog of previous orders,” he said in a press release.
Data on Saturday showed China’s official manufacturing PMI contracted at its fastest ever in February, even worse than during the global financial crisis of 2008.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.8%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 1.5% higher. 
While not a directional driver, the au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) received some attention as it slipped to a seasonally-adjusted 47.8 from a final 48.8 in the previous month. The February reading was its lowest since May 2016.
""Near-term prospects for Japan's industrial sector appear very bleak,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Weakness was driven by the demand-side in a broad-based fashion. Consumer, intermediate and capital goods producers recorded faster declines in demand and overall order books fell at the sharpest rate in over seven years.""

Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 0.8%. The Reserve Bank of Australia will set its policy on Tuesday.
In the U.S., the Federal Reserve on Friday signalled that it’s open to easing policy and some strategists expect action as soon as Monday.
Some believe the Fed might reduce interest rates this month after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell issued a rare statement on Friday pledging to “act as appropriate” to support the economy, although he admitted that monetary policy cannot completely shield a U.S. economy that is increasingly threatened by the coronavirus."
717,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 09:18PM ET</span>",U.S. judge rules naming official to temporarily head immigration agency unlawful,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Sunday ruled the Trump administration did not act lawfully when it named a former Virginia attorney general as the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and invalidated some new asylum directives.
U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss in Washington ruled Ken Cuccinelli's appointment violated a 1998 law governing how vacancies in senior government positions may be filled until the U.S. Senate confirms a new permanent choice.
Moss said Cuccinelli's appointment would relieve the president ""of responsibility and accountability for selecting acting officials"" and could essentially allow the executive brand to fill many senior jobs ""with nearly anyone"" by simply creating a new position after a vacancy.
Last year five Honduran asylum seekers and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services sued to challenge the lawfulness of asylum directives issued under Cuccinelli.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Heather Swift said in an e-mail ""we obviously disagree with the court’s opinion and are looking more closely at it."" The Justice Department did not immediately comment.
Moss' ruling said only the five asylum seekers who sued were entitled to new proceedings before USCIS and he declined to extend relief to others who had been denied asylum or ordered removed under Cuccinelli's directives.
Cuccinelli, who is performing the duties of deputy director of DHS, assumed the USCIS job as acting director through a series of moves.
After USCIS director L. Francis Cissna resigned in June 2019, his deputy director, Mark Koumans, assumed the post as director, as required under law, Moss said.
DHS's acting head Kevin McAleenan then appointed Cuccinelli to serve in the newly created position as principal deputy USCIS director.
McAleenan, who has since resigned, also revised the order of succession at USCIS to place Cuccinelli's job ahead of Koumans, allowing Cuccinelli to take over as acting director.
Three weeks after taking office, Cuccinelli issued a revised policy for scheduling credible-fear interviews in expedited removal proceedings.
Cuccinelli's directive reduced time for asylum seekers to consult with others before their credible-fear interviews from 48 or 72 hours to ""one full calendar day from the date of arrival at a detention facility"" and prohibited asylum officers from granting asylum seekers extensions to prepare ""except in the most extraordinary of circumstances.""
John Lewis, senior counsel at Washington-based advocacy group Democracy Forward, said the ""decision raises serious questions about the lawfulness of other actions Cuccinelli has undertaken - or may yet undertake - and we and others will be looking at them closely.""

Much of DHS is still being run by acting officials, including the top person, chief of staff, general counsel, as is the top official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures tumbled as trading reopened on Sunday night with investors still unnerved by the coronavirus and taking little solace from weekend comments by U.S. officials that aimed to soothe panic about a pandemic.
Senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration on Sunday tried to reduce concern about a global recession, saying the U.S. public had over-reacted after numerous cases were reported in the country and that stocks would rebound due to the economy's underlying strength.
S&P 500 e-mini futures (ESc1) were last down about 1%, indicating another bad day for the benchmark index on Monday after it fell more than 11% last week, its worst since the 2008 financial crisis.
The stampede away from risk last week drove investors into assets considered safer than stocks, like gold and government securities. The flight to quality looked set to continue as U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures (TYc1) jumped, pushing the implied yield below 1% for the first time.
That's a sign traders are worried about growth and expect the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to help restore confidence and cushion the hit from the virus to demand and the flow of goods and people around the world.
""We can expect, perhaps, if this continues through the night, a weaker open. The fact the 10-year yield looks like it may push down is not a good sign for the equity market,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU).
On Saturday, China, where the coronavirus first appeared, reported a record contraction in its manufacturing and service sectors because of the outbreak, illustrating the significant impact of the epidemic.
""We need to see more of a peak panic before investors are convinced it's time to go in,"" Krosby said, adding that a recovery in the 10-year yield would be a gauge of steadying sentiment. 
Speaking to NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration's response to the virus, said that the market ""will come back.""
""The fundamentals of this economy are strong. We just saw some new numbers come out in housing and consumer confidence and business optimism. Unemployment is at a 50-year low. More Americans are working than ever before,"" Pence said.
When asked on the ""Fox News Sunday"" program if the American people are over-reacting to the current threat, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar responded, ""Yes, absolutely.""
World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus likewise told CNBC on Sunday that the market panic was uncalled for, even after the organization on Friday raised its threat assessment for the virus to its highest level.
Their comments followed those of Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell who also sought to quell fears stoked by China's dire economic data, flagging that the central bank would take action if necessary to support the economy.
So far around 85,000 people in 53 countries have been infected. China, the world's second-largest economy, is home to the vast majority of cases. About 70 have been diagnosed in the United States.

A Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health conditions was the first American to die from the virus, officials said Saturday.

It also canceled its investor day that had been due to be held on March 5.
With investors firmly focused on how the company is managing the near-term impact of the coronavirus, United said it was not ""practical to expect that it can have a productive conversation focused on its long-term strategy next week.""
The event will be rescheduled for September.
Chicago-based United already withdrew its 2020 guidance this week due to uncertainty over the duration and spread of the virus. It warned that near-term demand to China has almost disappeared, with demand for the rest of its trans-Pacific routes down by 75%.

The airline is cutting about two thirds of its flights to Seoul, nearly a third of flights to Japan and 40% of flights to Singapore. It is also flying smaller planes on some routes.
Among U.S. airlines, United has the biggest international exposure, drawing about 40% of its revenues from overseas flights.

The largest U.S. airline said it would waive change fees up to 14 days before travel for customers who purchase tickets between Sunday and March 16.
JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) said last week it would suspend change and cancellation fees for new flight bookings between Feb. 27 and March 11.

In an email late on Saturday to employees, Munoz noted the carrier had cut flights to Asia and suspended service to mainland China and Hong Kong through April 30.
""We are strategically managing our Atlantic and domestic service, mindful of travel directives from the federal government, fluctuating demand and of course, the advice of public health experts. Based on current trends, it is likely that additional schedule reductions will be necessary,"" Munoz said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian authorities on Sunday reached a tentative deal with an indigenous group in the Pacific province of British Columbia that could end solidarity protests across Canada that have been blocking rail lines and roads for weeks.
Activists have disrupted passenger and freight traffic to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en people, who are seeking to stop TC Energy Corp's (TO:TRP) Coastal GasLink pipeline from being built across their land.
After three days of talks in which work on the pipeline had been stopped, Indigenous affairs ministers from British Columbia and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government said they reached an agreement that would address future land rights disputes, but said pipeline construction would continue.
After the deal was announced, Coastal GasLink President David Pfeiffer said construction would be restarted on Monday. 
The agreement will now be reviewed by the Wet'suwet'en people, British Columbia's Indigenous Relations Minister Scott Fraser said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live stream from the town of Smithers.
That consultations should take about two weeks, Wet'suwet'en hereditary leader Chief Woos said. 
The agreement will ""create certainty and clarity for the Wet'suwet'en and all British Columbians,"" Fraser said, without providing details. 
""They are permitted and allowed to go to work,"" Fraser said when asked about whether laborers building TC Energy's GasLink pipeline would be allowed to continue construction.
The proposed agreement includes establishing a permanent table to address legacy land rights and title issues, a senior federal government source said. 
Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister of crown-indigenous relations, called the agreement a ""milestone"" in indigenous relations. Bennett declined to reveal any of the deal's details, saying the Wet'suwet'en people should ""see it first"". 
Police in the eastern province of Ontario cleared protesters from a major Canadian National Railway Co (TO:CNR) line on Monday, allowing some shipments to resume.
Trudeau, who says improving relations with aboriginal groups is a priority, called for dialogue. But tensions built quickly as the blockades led to railroad layoffs and shortages of goods like propane and as business groups warned of further economic damage.
At least one rail line in Quebec, south of Montreal, remains blocked as some indigenous protesters were holding out.

Transport Minister Marc Garneau said last week that the effects of the disruptions would be felt for weeks and months to come.

723,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 01:43PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Norway wealth fund could blacklist four major climate culprits,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund will exclude four companies for their vast emissions of greenhouse gases, or at least put them on probation to force them to change, the chairman of its ethics watchdog told Reuters.
The fund's ethics body is, separately, opening a new front, said Johan H. Andresen: investigating whether technology companies' tools are being used for ""improper surveillance"", with their makers held to account regardless of their intent.
The world's largest sovereign wealth, which has massive market influence because it owns 1.5% of the world's listed shares, operates under ethical guidelines set by parliament.
Andresen, chairman of the fund's Council on Ethics, said it had recommended the fund divest shares in the four polluters, after probing the oil, steel and concrete industries. The four companies were ""worst in class"" compared with peers in the same sectors but also compared with other sectors, he said.
The Norwegian central bank, which manages the fund, should make announcements about the firms imminently, the 58-year-old added. Companies to be excluded are not named until the fund has sold the shares, to avoid the stock falling in value beforehand.
""All of them were recommendations to exclude because we felt it was needed: they were cases that stood out,"" Andresen said in an interview ahead of the publication of the council's annual report on Sunday.
The central bank typically follows the council's recommendations to censure companies but sometimes, rather than immediately excluding them, it puts them on a watch list to give them a set period of time to come up with a plan to significantly change their behavior, or face exclusion.
CARBON, NUKES, TOBACCO
The fund is forbidden by parliament from investing in companies that produce nuclear weapons, landmines, or tobacco, or violate human rights, among other criteria.
Emissions became a criterion for exclusion in 2016. In 2017 the Council on Ethics recommended a handful of companies be excluded but, since then, work had been suspended while the central bank asked for clarification from the finance ministry about the interpretation of the criterion. This has now happened, enabling the council to proceed.
To avoid blacklisting, companies should have a plan showing how they intend to adapt to climate change, with specifics crucial, Andresen said.
""We will look at speed, time, capital spend dedicated,"" he added. ""We want to see if they are walking the walk.""
A fifth company will now be assessed by the central bank for possible exclusion for using too much coal in its activities, Andresen said.
1984: BIG BROTHER'S WATCHING YOU
The council is also investigating a new area for possible human rights violations - whether tech products are used for ""improper surveillance"".
""We are not looking at intent but whether the products of companies are being used improperly,"" he said. ""Artificial intelligence can be used to find cancer but it can be used for other things ... We are looking for documentation as to whether companies know what their products are used for.""
Andresen, who also owns private investment vehicle Ferd, said he expected the fund to announce possible exclusion decisions in this area this year as the council had already concluded investigations in ""several cases"".
""We are looking at the sharper end, where the norm violations are the most visible and where it is easier to establish the facts,"" he added. ""George Orwell's 1984 is, to some extent, here. These are scary developments.""
Andresen said he also expected a decision to be published this year about a company that causes severe environmental damage, as well as several companies in the textile industry for labor condition violations that breached human rights.
Some 65 companies have been excluded by the fund, on various grounds, on recommendations from the Council on Ethics. Another 68 companies have been excluded directly by the central bank based on their dependence on coal.
The fund, created from the proceeds of Norway's oil industry, gradually sells shares in any company it wishes to drop. The main aim is to remove the ethical risk."

""The is no shortage of money for a global expansion,"" Ranjan Sen, managing partner with private equity firm Advent told the Handelsblatt business daily. ""This could by all means amount to single-digit billions.""
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) said on Thursday it had agreed to sell its elevators division to a consortium of Advent, Cinven and Germany's RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros ($18.96 billion).
Thyssenkrupp said it would reinvest about 1.25 billion euros to take a stake in the unit.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Steel, the world's No.3 steelmaker, is bracing for a downside risk as slower manufacturing activities in China in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak may further weigh on demand in industries such as auto and machineries, its executive said.
""We have not cut our crude steel output... but we need to be prepared for downside,"" Nippon Steel Executive Vice President Katsuhiro Miyamoto told Reuters in an interview last week.
In China, the world's top steel producer and seller, inventories of main steel products - including construction steel rebar and hot-rolled coil used in cars and home appliances - have surged since late January when the number of virus infections spiked dramatically in China, paralyzing transport links and dampening downstream demand.
Miyamoto also said inventories held at steelmills in China rose 30% in early February from a year ago, with stockpiles at Nippon Steel's steel joint venture in Shanghai also increasing due to transport disruptions.
""We may see wider impacts if industrial activity doesn't pick up quickly in China,"" he said, adding that steel demand in automobiles, industrial machineries and shipbuilding had been hit by softer global economy even before the outbreak.
Another worry is higher prices of raw materials, with coking coal prices being pressured by the border closure by Mongolia which supplies about 30% of the key steel-making ingredient to China, Miyamoto said.
""We can't tell how much impact we will have from the epidemic, but we expect a tough time through the first half (of the next financial year),"" he said, referring to April-September.
In February, Nippon Steel unveiled a plan to shut nearly 10% of its production capacity, an unprecedented move in the once-dominant Japanese steel industry hit by falling demand at home and competition from China.
It forecast a record loss of 440 billion yen ($4 billion) this financial year, due to massive impairment charges on its domestic plants.
But the company is expected to return to a profit next year thanks to lower depreciation expenses and one-off charges from natural disasters as well as cost cuts, Miyamoto said.
The planned closure of 4 blast furnaces will reduce its domestic annual crude steel output capacity by 5 million tonnes to 49 million tonnes.
Miyamoto said a series of giant steelworks have been built along the coast in China, which could mean higher export from China going forward.
""Then, it may be difficult for us to keep exporting 40% of our steel in the future... If the 5 million tonnes cut is not enough, we will need to consider further actions,"" he said."

In the southern city of Guangzhou - where Japanese automakers Toyota (T:7203), Honda (T:7267) and Nissan (T:7201) all have joint ventures with Chinese partners - the local government plans to reintroduce subsidies to encourage people to buy electric vehicles, it said last week. It did not provide more details. Previous local subsidies were scrapped last year.
Xiangtan, a city of 3 million people in the southern province of Hunan, will offer people 3,000 yuan ($429) in cash if they buy a car made locally by Geely (HK:0175), state media Hunan Daily reported on Sunday.
Car sales in China, the world's biggest car market, have been falling for the past two years.
In January they dropped 18.7% from a year earlier and the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) expects declines in car production and sales to be more significant in February due to the coronavirus outbreak.
According to China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), another industry body, China's auto sales dropped 89% in the first 23 days of February.
The coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people in China and forced the temporary shutdown of many factories last month.
Guangzhou's neighboring city of Foshan - where Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has a plant with FAW Group [SASACJ.UL] - announced last month that it would offer cash of 2,000 yuan for purchases of new cars and 3,000 yuan for replacement of existing cars.
Foshan's government said it will also offer subsidies to help offset the marketing expenses of auto companies.
CAAM expects China's auto sales will fall by more than 10% in the first half of the year due to the impact of the virus, a senior official told Reuters.
China's commerce ministry said last month that it would study rolling out measures to boost auto sales."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai Islamic Bank (DU:DISB) (DIB) has postponed a planned issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated sukuk due to market conditions resulting from the new coronavirus outbreak, three sources familiar with the matter said.
DIB, the largest Islamic bank in the United Arab Emirates, hired banks to arrange the Islamic bonds last month, a document showed on Feb. 20.
It was planning to raise the financing - likely to be $750 million - on Feb. 26, but decided to wait for better market conditions, said one of the sources.
DIB did not immediately return a request for comment.
The potential deal received a good response from investors while it was being marketed, but volatility in the debt markets as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies would have increased the sukuk profit rate, said the source.
DIB has hired a group of banks including Emirates NBD Capital, First Abu Dhabi Bank, HSBC and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) to arrange the deal.
Fund managers have said a rise in regional bond spreads since the beginning of the year suggests the impact of the virus outbreak on global economic growth may translate into higher funding costs for Middle East debt issuers, potentially curbing new borrowing.
The cost of insuring against sovereign debt defaults by Gulf Arab states has also recently risen.
All the Gulf countries except Saudi Arabia have reported cases of the new coronavirus, many in people who had been to Iran, where 54 people have died from the virus and 978 have been infected."

Citgo, a unit of Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela [PDVSA.UL], has been under the control of the South American country's opposition for more than a year after Washington slapped sanctions on PDVSA in a bid to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
That transition left the future of the 209,000 barrel-per-day refinery uncertain. Citgo and Aruba in 2016 reached a 25-year, $685 million deal to refurbish and reopen the facility, which had been idled since 2012, but little progress has been made.
Citgo in a statement said the transfer agreement was the first step in a process that would result in the Aruba government taking full control of the refinery by March 16, following approval by the island's parliament.
Aruba's government has said it is looking for outside candidates to take over the refinery.
Citgo Petroleum Corporation, a separate entity, would continue to supply fuel to the island's airport and gas stations, Citgo said."

That would encourage companies to buy treasury stocks, which are shares that companies buy back for a period of time and re-sell them later.

TORONTO - Small miners hoping to take advantage of demand for battery metals are struggling to convert electric vehicle aficionados into investors, compounding the sector's funding constraints even as analysts predict a long-term shortage of the raw materials used to make EVs.
The predicament has made it harder for already-strapped miners to raise money and could stall construction of new mines in the event the burgeoning EV industry faces a supply crunch for battery-grade lithium, graphite and other minerals.
""You need a mine for almost everything that we touch, and people still don't get that,"" said Eric Desaulniers, chief executive of Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc (V:NOU), which is developing a graphite mine in Quebec. ""They want the electric car to save the planet but no mining.""
Traditional mining investors are reluctant to put money in unproven markets while the most ardent EV backers seem loathe to invest in mining at all, even if the products support green technology, industry executives and analysts said.
Whether loss-wary investors will finally focus on EV minerals will be a key question at this week's annual Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) conference in Toronto.
""There's been this very weird hole in financing,"" said Mark Saxon, chief executive at Vancouver-based Leading Edge Materials Corp (V:LEM), which is developing a rare-earth deposit in Sweden.
Efforts by the industry to court new investors are set against rising opposition to mines. Protests have snarled lithium exploration in Portugal while automakers have stepped up scrutiny of production in Chile's environmentally fragile Atacama desert.
Indeed, top lithium producers  Albemarle  Corp (N:ALB) and Chile's SQM (SN:SQMA) have curbed expansions amid sinking prices for the white metal.
Nemaska Lithium (TO:NMX), which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), filed for bankruptcy last December. France's  Eramet  (PA:ERMT) postponed a lithium project in Argentina earlier this month, citing the country's uncertain economic outlook.
Others, including Argentina-focused Neo Lithium Corp (V:NLC), are looking for joint venture partners after unsuccessful financing campaigns.
""With the tens of billions (of dollars) that are going in downstream at the EV level, at the battery level, ultimately the raw materials will have to catch up,"" said Andrew Miller of metals pricing provider Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
To be sure, not all companies are strained.
Nouveau Monde Graphite, backed by mine financier Pallinghurst Group, is in talks to secure C$330 million in project financing, said CEO Desaulniers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines Inc (O:AAL) will suspend all U.S. flights to Milan, the airline said late on Saturday, just hours after the U.S. State Department said it was raising its travel warning for parts of Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Italy is experiencing Europe's worst outbreak of the infectious disease, with more than 1,100 confirmed cases and 29 deaths. The country's outbreak emerged last week about 40 miles (60 km) from Milan, Italy's financial capital in the country's north.
American said it will suspend flights to and from Milan, from New York-John F. Kennedy International Airport and Miami through April 24, citing a reduction in demand.
On Saturday, the Trump administration raised its travel advisory alert to ""Level 4 - Do Not Travel"" to Lombardy and Veneto in Italy ""due to the level of community transmission of the virus and imposition of local quarantine procedures.""
Milan is the capital of the Lombardy region. Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday that the U.S. State Department will work with Italy to coordinate medical screening of any individuals coming to the United States.
American said its final flight will return from Milan on Sunday.
American will continue to operate a single daily flight to Italy -- between Philadelphia and Rome in each direction. American is scheduled to resume seasonal service to Venice in May."

It also canceled its investor day that had been due to be held on March 5.
With investors firmly focused on how the company is managing the near-term impact of the coronavirus, United said it was not ""practical to expect that it can have a productive conversation focused on its long-term strategy next week.""
The event will be rescheduled for September.
Chicago-based United already withdrew its 2020 guidance this week due to uncertainty over the duration and spread of the virus. It warned that near-term demand to China has almost disappeared, with demand for the rest of its trans-Pacific routes down by 75%.
As a result, the company is temporarily reducing flights from the U.S. mainland to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and Seoul and extending the suspension of U.S. flights to mainland China and Hong Kong through April 30, it said on Friday.
The airline is cutting about two thirds of its flights to Seoul, nearly a third of flights to Japan and 40% of flights to Singapore. It is also flying smaller planes on some routes.
Among U.S. airlines, United has the biggest international exposure, drawing about 40% of its revenues from overseas flights.

BEIJING (Reuters) - HNA Group has asked the government of China's province of Hainan to lead a work group dedicated to resolving its increasing liquidity risks after a slowdown in business caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
HNA Group is not able to thoroughly deal with liquidity risks itself, the company said in a post on its official WeChat account on Saturday.
HNA directly owns or holds stakes in a number of local Chinese carriers, including Hainan Airlines (SS:600221), and is among many companies pressured by the coronavirus outbreak that has forced widespread flight cancellations.
The work group is being led by Gu Gang, chairman of Hainan Development Holdings Co., an investment arm of the government of the southern province, the WeChat post said.
Officials from the Hainan Yangpu Economic Development Zone, the Civil Aviation Administration of China's Central and Southern (NYSE:SO) Regional Administration and China Development Bank are also involved in the work team, HNA said.
There have been news reports that the Chinese government may take over HNA and sell off its airline assets because the coronavirus outbreak has reduced the conglomerate's ability to meet its financial obligations.
State carriers  Air China  (HK:0753) (SS:601111) and China Eastern Airlines (HK:0670) (SS:600115) are prepared to hold talks about HNA's assets, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Feb. 20. 
HNA Group was once one of China's most aggressive dealmaking firms, having spent $50 billion on global acquisition spree that once spread from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to Hilton Worldwide.
However, it began unwinding those purchases two years ago to shift focus to its airlines and tourism businesses, after drawing scrutiny from Beijing and other overseas regulators.
In December, before the coronavirus epidemic hit China, HNA Chairman Chen Feng admitted that the firm had faced cash flow shortages that forced it to delay some salary payments in 2019, but vowed to resolve its liquidity risks this year.
Since the outbreak, Hainan Airlines and other airlines have tried to cut their losses by putting foreign pilots on unpaid leave, but they still need to refund millions of passengers and face plummeting demand. 
In a separate statement on Saturday, HNA Group also said it will add two more seats to its existing five member board of directors, with Hainan Development's Gu becoming its executive chairman. Co-founder Chen Feng will remain the board's chairman.
Ren Qinghua, director of the Administrative Committee of Yangpu Economic Development Zone, was also appointed to the board and will become co-CEO alongside Tan Xiangdong, HNA Group's existing CEO, it said.

The court, which had ordered Vodafone Idea (NS:VODA) and Bharti Airtel (NS:BRTI) among others, to pay 920 billion rupees in overdue levies and interest by Jan. 23, rejected petitions last month to review its October order.
Airtel has deposited with the DoT 30.04 billion rupees and an additional 50 billion as an ad-hoc payment to cover differences, if any, it said.
""We have now complied,"" the company said in a statement, referring to the judgment and court directions of Oct 24, 2019.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 29, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>","Elliott targets Twitter, seeking CEO Dorsey's removal: sources","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has amassed a stake in  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) and is pushing for changes, including removal of the social media company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Twitter is one of the few U.S. technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about 2% of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott.
Twitter shares fell last year when the company disclosed that its platform experienced glitches that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners. The San Francisco-based company's reluctance to expand beyond its core platform has also left it with limited scale compared to its larger social media peers.
Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, will be seeking to install its own nominees to Twitter's eight-member board when three of the company's directors stand for election at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, the sources said.
It is not clear who Elliott would like Dorsey replaced with and how big its stake in Twitter is. The New York-based hedge fund has more than $40 billion in assets under management, and has targeted companies in recent months ranging from eBay Inc (O:EBAY) to SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Elliott declined to comment. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg News first reported on Friday on Elliott's position in Twitter.
Dorsey, 43, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent entrepreneurs, and also runs  Square Inc  (N:SQ), a mobile payments company he co-founded.
While investors have tolerated this arrangement since 2015, when Dorsey became Twitter's CEO for the second time, his announcement in November that he would like to move to Africa for up to six months raised questions among analysts about his management.
Dorsey, who helped conceive Twitter in 2006, first served as CEO until 2008, when he was replaced by one of his co-founders Ev Williams (NYSE:WMB). Williams had accused Dorsey of being a poor manager and not focusing enough on Twitter's profitability.
Dorsey returned as interim CEO after his predecessor Dick Costolo stepped down. Dorsey's knowledge of the company and quick launch of new products convinced Twitter's board to hand him the reins on a permanent basis a few months later.
Dorsey is not the first CEO to run two major companies. Steve Jobs led Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and animated movie studio Pixar for several years, while Elon Musk runs electric car pioneer  Tesla Motors  Inc (O:TSLA) and rocket maker SpaceX."

(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) on Friday named a board member hailed for turning around the Puma brand's near-bankrupt business as its interim chief as the motorcycle maker gropes for an effective strategy to woo young customers and revive sales.
Jochen Zeitz was asked to take over after Chief Executive Officer Matthew Levatich stepped down following the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company's worst sales performance in at least 16 years.
Harley-Davidson said Zeitz will serve as interim CEO until an external search firm helps find a new chief executive.
Michael Uhlarik, founder of consultancy Motorcycle Global, said Levatich's exit was expected. He said Harley was likely to give Zeitz a long run as he has ""proven turnaround"" skills.
Zeitz is well known for transforming the loss-making Puma in the 1990s into one of the world's top three sports brands.
""It is not about the next quarter or earnings per share,"" Uhlarik said. ""They will have to build a long-term, multi-year strategy.""
Harley has failed for years to increase sales in the United States, its top market, which accounts for more than half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-boomer consumer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is finding it challenging to attract new customers.
Levatich, who took the company's reins in May 2015, bet on new launches, including of battery-powered bikes, to turn around the company's fortunes in the domestic market.
The results, however, remained elusive.
Harley's 2019 U.S. bike sales were the lowest in at least 16 years. Falling sales in the past 12 quarters have forced the company to limit production of its bikes to prevent price discount pressure and protect profit.
In 2019, Harley's bike shipment volume in the United States was the lowest in at least two decades. Global shipments were the lowest since 2010.
With no sales revival in sight, investors were becoming restless.
Since Levatich took the helm, Harley's shares have fallen 46%. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) has gained 40%.
Falling sales have had made Wall Street speculate whether the company, which symbolized the counterculture movement of the 1960s, would seek refuge in a buyout or turn private to rework its product lines and branding without the pressure from shareholders to shield its profit margins.
Last month, Levatich tried to parry that question by expressing confidence in the current strategy. But he also acknowledged that the challenges facing Harley were ""significant"" as its heavy and expensive bikes were competing for ""people's scarce time, people's scarce funding and commitment.""
Levatich will assist with the transition through the end of March, the company said.

On Friday, Harley's shares closed down 2.2% at $30.47.

The rapid rise in market volatility has lifted the price of short term futures on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) above longer term ones - an event that has historically been followed by a 7% median gain for the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) within 30 days, according to research from market analytics firm Arbor Data Science.
The term structure inversion, as the pattern is known, has ""been a historically reliable indicator, but we've never had coronavirus before,"" said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives at Susquehanna Financial Group.
The VIX, known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" hit its highest level since February 2018 and ended at 40.11 on Friday. Just a week ago, it was trading at 17.08. The S&P 500 fell 11.5% on the week.
Uncertainty over the trajectory of the virus and its economic fallout will likely complicate the picture for investors looking to determine an entry point into stocks by trying to discern potential peaks in volatility, some strategists said.
Even so, some investment managers have begun to suggest that selling may be nearing a crescendo.
After their sharp decline this week, U.S. stocks are closer to fair value, said Arnim Holzer, macro and correlation defense strategist at EAB Investment Advisors.
""We're moving into the zone where the S&P has earned its keep,"" he said.
The S&P 500 has notched a weekly drop of 10% or more only 14 times in its history, and those declines have been followed by an average gain of 3.5%, data from Bespoke Investment showed. Gains over the next three months have averaged 5.6%, although the index has fallen more than it has risen in that time period, suggesting that the period after such big drops is usually volatile for markets.
Other corners of the options market demonstrated investor caution but not excessive fear, said RBC Capital Markets equity derivatives strategist Amy Wu Silverman. Trading, in her view, reflected investors moving to realize gains on their downside protection but often not replacing those hedges with positions guarding against a further fall.
At the same time, demand for put options used for downside protection in relation to call options used for upside participation has not skyrocketed.
Aside from a spike on Thursday, skew, which measures demand for puts versus calls, has remained near its average levels over the past six months for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (P:SPY), according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert.
That may be because investors saw more declines in stocks coming as the epidemic first unfolded in China before spreading outside the country, said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management.
While there is evidence some investors may not have hit the panic button, they don't appear to have let down their guard, either. Expectations for further gyrations in U.S. equities remain elevated in relation to actual stock moves, Holzer at EAB Investment Advisors said.
The 30-day implied volatility for SPY was at 44% on Friday, whereas its realized volatility was at 25.3%, according to Trade Alert. That gap suggests investors have lingering concerns about further selling.
Even though equities have sold off significantly, there still remains potential for moves in other asset classes, such as credit, to cause ripples across markets, Holzer said."
742,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 09:16PM ET</span>","Wall Street Weekahead: Main Street leans toward Sanders, but Wall Street says Trump","By April Joyner, Lewis Krauskopf and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders may be surging in the polls ahead of Super Tuesday, but some on Wall Street have made their own conclusions on what November will bring: four more years of President Donald Trump.
Ninety-five percent of participants in a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) survey of investors, economists and other market participants released earlier this month said Trump, a Republican, was either ""extremely likely"" or ""slightly likely"" to win the general election.
Those results contrast with some wider recent polls cited on RealClearPolitics, which show any Democrat beating Trump in a presidential contest, although top contenders have a bigger lead. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted Feb. 19-25, showed Sanders with a seven percentage-point lead over Trump in a hypothetical general election matchup. 
The sharp mismatch in expectations could stoke market volatility if Wall Streeters are wrong and a Democrat emerges victorious - especially if that winner is Sanders, whose promises to break up big banks, take on drug companies and essentially abolish private insurance in favor of a single government-run plan have unnerved some investors. Many on Wall Street were unprepared for Trump's win in 2016, which was followed by sharp swings in asset prices. 
""As an investor, I look at this and say the market's nightmare scenario is that Bernie or Elizabeth Warren wins the election,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, in New York. ""That's not our base case ... but it's a concern,"" he said. 
Warren's policy proposals, like Sanders', have also jangled nerves on Wall Street.
Investors will be looking ahead to next Tuesday, when 14 states will cast ballots and Sanders could build an overwhelming advantage if he captures the lion's share of the available delegates.
Those primaries come as the markets are gripped by concerns over the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus outbreak, with the number of cases beyond China accelerating rapidly. U.S. stocks were extending the week's losses on Friday and were on track for a 7th day in the red after the S&P 500 (SPX) on Thursday confirmed its fastest correction in history.
Orlando said Sanders' rise in the polls also contributed to the recent sell-off. Some investors noted that continued volatility in markets or an economic downturn could wear away at Trump's support. 
While the market gyrations are likely to drown out some of the potential impact from next week's voting results, some corners are already feeling the effects of Sanders' recent success. 
After Sanders' commanding victory in the Nevada caucuses in February, shares of insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) and  Centene  Corp (N:CNC) sold off on what some analysts said were concerns over the potential of a Sanders nomination.
""If Bernie runs the table and suddenly he becomes unstoppable, I think we're going to see the jitters again,"" said Teresa McRoberts, a portfolio manager focused on healthcare at Fred Alger Management in New York.
(Graphic: Sanders nomination odds vs health insurer shares- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R8DKC2J/eikon.png) 
The effects on the broader market of a big Sanders win on Tuesday are less clear. Only 13% of participants in Deutsche Bank's poll believed Sanders could beat Trump in the general election, compared with 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 45% for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas, has kept most of his attention on the coronavirus outbreak in recent days and is not eager to make any election-related portfolio moves yet. 
""I think most of my clients pretty much are like me, thinking Trump is going win,"" he said. 
Still, some investors believe the election can fuel market swings this year.
Volume on the October futures contract  for the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) hit 16,247 between Jan. 2 and Feb. 21, according to Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE). That dwarfs the 471 contracts that traded in 2016 from Jan. 4 to Feb. 19. VIX futures reflect expectations for volatility in the month following their expiration.
On Thursday, October VIX futures traded at 22.5, versus 19.57 for September futures  and 20.22 for November futures , indicating heightened expectations for volatility near election day. 
Cboe Global Markets listed October VIX futures a month earlier than usual in response to customers eager to place bets on election-induced volatility, said Kevin Davitt, senior instructor at the exchange's options institute. The exchange also listed September and November futures ahead of their usual schedule.
Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said the election will become a greater concern for investors once the Democratic party selects its nominee. 
""There are a number of places where the policy divides are incredibly wide,"" he said.

743,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 08:07PM ET</span>","Wall Street in coronavirus contingency mode with staff, visitors, regulators","By Michelle Price and Imani Moise
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks have been rolling out contingency plans to respond to the global coronavirus outbreak - requiring some staff to work from home, implementing travel restrictions, and talking to regulators about potential stresses.
The preparations come amid growing fears that the fast-spreading virus which has infected around 83,000 people in more than 50 countries could lead to a global recession. Stock markets have plunged, with the S&P 500 (SPX) index dropping 11.5% this week, the worst showing since the 2008 financial crisis. [MKTS/GLOB]
Banks are not the only companies affected by the spread of the disease, but their position as market intermediaries and custodians of critical infrastructure has put the health of their employees, operations, and balance sheets in the spotlight.
On Friday, U.S. presidential candidate and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to the five largest U.S. banks asking how they are preparing to mitigate the risks of the outbreak.
""As a globally systemic important bank, your institution and the customers it serves could be impacted either directly through exposures to areas where the virus has spread or indirectly through a change in market conditions,"" she wrote.
Financial firms started dusting off long-standing contingency playbooks several weeks ago when the virus was spreading through China, two industry officials told Reuters.
Big U.S. banks are in daily contact with federal, state and local regulators on a range of issues, sources said, but lately coronavirus preparations have taken center stage. Discussions have centered around how to keep markets, transactions and other banking functions operating smoothly, as well as handling employee quarantines.
One major bank brought an epidemiologist into its regular risk management gathering on Friday morning, a person who attended the meeting told Reuters.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, told employees on Thursday that it was restricting all but essential international work travel due to the continued spread of the virus.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) has restricted business travel in all Asian countries and Italy, and has asked employees who have visited affected areas to work from home for 14 days, a person familiar with the matter said. The bank has also imposed short-term restrictions on large meetings that require international travel.
Earlier this week,  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) asked attendees of several conferences they are hosting in the coming weeks to disclose if they or people they have close contact with have traveled to mainland China, South Korea, parts of Italy and Japan.
Goldman Sachs asked them to skip the conferences if so. In Goldman's New York headquarters, signs posted at check-in ask guests who recently traveled to China or had close contact with someone who did to reschedule their meetings.
Several major banks in Hong Kong and Singapore, including HSBC Group Plc (L:HSBA), Morgan Stanley, and DBS Bank, have also restricted travel and are allowing staff to work from home.
Citi has imposed tighter restrictions in affected countries, including temperature checks and home-working, the person familiar with the matter said.
Many are also preparing workforces to work from home and dishing out hygiene advice, urging staff to frequently wash their hands and use antiseptic wipes, sources said. LONG PREPARED
Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on in New York, Wall Street has developed extensive contingency plans for dealing with large scale disruptions, including pandemics.
They most recently deployed such plans during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and reviewed and updated them after that disaster, Kenneth Bentsen Jr., chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which leads industry continuity planning, told Reuters on Thursday.
If an outbreak of coronavirus hits New York, markets would likely continue to function even if the floor of the New York Stock Exchange had to close. Stock exchanges have said they have contingency plans.
Financial firms have back-up facilities in U.S. cities including Dallas, Tampa, Chicago, and Phoenix from which they can continue trading and perform other vital functions, although U.S. banks have yet to activate them, two sources said. Some banks in Asia are already using secondary sites, they said.
Lenders are also considering splitting up critical teams into rotating shifts and physically distancing staff from one another, the official said.
""It's something the industry regularly plans for,"" said Bentsen. ""We're prepared as we need to be."""
744,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 07:51PM ET</span>",Repatriation flow data indicates U.S. investors still catching up on coronavirus,"By Megan Davies
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers were behind on factoring in the impact of coronavirus and still have some catching up to do, according to a read of repatriation flows, which typically spike in times of caution, policy and risk analysis firm Exante Data said.
Exante tracks high frequency capital flows partly by looking at U.S. investor flows to and from international equity ETFs. Selling such instruments and bringing funds back into the United States and into the dollar currency causes such flows.
For the period of Monday to Thursday this week there were $3.3 billion in such repatriation flows by U.S. investors, according to Reuters calculations of data from Exante. While significant, that is less than the $3.6 billion seen in a four-day period when flows spiked in mid-August last year when investors were worried about the U.S.-China trade war.
""We think U.S. investors have been slow to recognize the significance of COVID relative to global peers, particularly to those located in Asia,"" said Grant Wilson, Head of Asia Pacific, Exante Data. ""We expected to see more repatriation flows here, as home bias tends to prevail in periods of market turmoil.""
Wilson said that instead, there had been a minor bout at the end of January when COVID first came on the scene, and similar flows again this week.
""It will pick up for sure. The collapse in gold today suggests investors are reducing gross notional exposures across the board and heading to cash.""
Coronavirus panic sent world stock markets tumbling again on Friday, with an index of global stocks setting its largest weekly fall since the 2008 global financial crisis, and more than $5 trillion wiped from global market value this week. Spot gold dropped 3.5% to $1,584.51 an ounce after touching a 7-year high on Thursday.
Wilson said Exante has seen different levels of awareness of coronavirus across its client base, with those proximate, such as hedge funds in Singapore and Hong Kong, early and responsive, while at the other end of spectrum is real money, particularly in the United States, also with private banks."
745,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>","United Airlines sharply cuts flights to Asia, cancels investor day","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said on Friday it was sharply cutting flights to Japan and South Korea, as travelers worried about the coronavirus outbreak slash ticket purchases for those destinations.
It also canceled its investor day that had been due to be held on March 5.
With investors firmly focused on how the company is managing the near-term impact of the coronavirus, United said it was not ""practical to expect that it can have a productive conversation focused on its long-term strategy next week.""
The event will be rescheduled for September.
Chicago-based United already withdrew its 2020 guidance this week due to uncertainty over the duration and spread of the virus. It warned that near-term demand to China has almost disappeared, with demand for the rest of its trans-Pacific routes down by 75%.
As a result, the company is temporarily reducing flights from the U.S. mainland to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and Seoul and extending the suspension of U.S. flights to mainland China and Hong Kong through April 30, it said on Friday.
The airline is cutting about two thirds of its flights to Seoul, nearly a third of flights to Japan and 40% of flights to Singapore. It is also flying smaller planes on some routes.
Among U.S. airlines, United has the biggest international exposure, drawing about 40% of its revenues from overseas flights.
Earlier this week, Delta cut South Korea flights in half, citing the outbreak.
United shares fell 5.2% on Friday, amid a widespread global share rout, and are down 21% over the last week."
746,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 05:52PM ET</span>",Coronavirus outbreak rains on dealmakers' M&A parade,"By Joshua Franklin and Krystal Hu
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The steep market drop triggered by the global coronavirus outbreak has led many companies to hit the 'pause' button on mergers and acquisitions (M&A), sabotaging the hopes of corporate advisers who expected a dealmaking bonanza this year.
While M&A volumes have not yet registered the effect of this week's market volatility, dealmakers say some clients are stepping back from signing deals after the S&P 500 Index dropped 11.5% from its all-time high in the last five days.
""Volatility is bad for dealmaking,"" said Alan Klein, co-head of M&A at New York-based law firm Simpson Thacher. ""It throws off your ability to appropriately gauge if it's a good time to buy or a time to sell.""
The global M&A market is already set for its slowest first two months of a year since 2005, according to data provider Dealogic. Some dealmakers had been looking to 2020 to beat 2019 as the fourth strongest year for M&A on record, even with the uncertainty of the presidential election in November.
""I was ready to make the bold prediction that the total dollar volume of U.S. tech M&A activity this year would exceed last year's total. But the spread of the coronavirus has changed my thinking,"" said Rick Climan, Silicon Valley-based M&A partner at law firm Hogan Lovells.
To be sure, a few deals are still being done, especially ones that have long been in train, such as a 17.2-billion-euro deal for Thyssenkrupp AG's (DE:TKAG) elevators division by a private equity consortium, and Intuit's (O:INTU) $7.1 billion acquisition of personal finance portal Credit Karma, both of which were announced this week.
In addition, once the volatility subsides, advisers to companies expect many potential acquirers to seize on targets' lower valuations and pursue their dream deals, particularly in sectors with frothy deal prices such as technology.
But for the moment many negotiations are under threat because acquisition targets are demanding that buyers value shares close to their 52-week highs, dealmakers say.
In the last 12 months, more than 60 percent of U.S. companies acquired at a valuation of more than $100 million agreed to deals that priced their shares above or at a discount of no more than 10% to their 52-week high, according to Refinitiv data.
""Companies' 52-week high highs weren't 50 weeks ago, it was last week. Ten days ago the market indices hit all-time highs. So to be down 10% from what was breathtaking levels has people understandably rattled,"" Simpson Thacher's Klein said.
Dealmakers declined to give specific examples of negotiations falling through, citing confidentiality agreements.
(GRAPHIC: Premiums that U.S. takeover targets accepted - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/CHINA-HEALTH-DEALS/0H001R8DVC3D/eikon.png )
Companies are also worried about the impact on earnings of the expected global economic slowdown due to the coronavirus outbreak, dealmakers said.
If market disruptions continue, major private equity firms, which have built up big distressed debt funds in recent years, are ready to snap up assets on the cheap, senior executives said at an industry gathering this week.
""We have a lot of clients that want to buy a number of companies, but they just can't get comfortable with where valuations are,"" said David King, co-head of technology M&A at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""The type of market volatility that we've had of late could help ease some of that tension, to the extent that you still have a universe of acquirers that retains the confidence to go out and do deals,"" King added."

New York (Reuters) - The S&P 500 fell for the seventh straight day on Friday and the benchmark index suffered its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis on growing fears the fast-spreading coronavirus could push the economy into recession, although stocks regained some ground right at the end of a volatile session.
The Dow and the Nasdaq also registered their deepest weekly percentage losses since October 2008. 
The Nasdaq managed to eke out an 0.01% gain after plunging as much as 3.5% during the session. After falling as much as 4.2% - more than 1,000 points - the Dow ended the day down 1.4%.
But, after the bell, S&P 500 e-mini futures  were up about 1% and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF was up 1.3% in extended trade.
On Thursday, all three indexes had confirmed corrections by finishing more than 10% below their closing record highs. 
Equities found some support after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the fundamentals of the American economy remained strong and that the central bank would act as appropriate to provide support.
But investors had spent most of the day dumping equities for the safety of U.S. Treasuries, pushing 10-year yields to their fourth record low this week. [US/]
The virus spread further on Friday, with cases reported for the first time in at least six countries across four continents, battering markets and leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to raise its impact risk alert to ""very high.""
Some investors voiced concerns about heading into a weekend where they could not trade on new reports about the virus. 
""To get an all-clear sign, the market needs evidence it's under control, no flaring up in new countries and that we don't get a significant outbreak in the United States,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, chief portfolio strategist for Natixis Investment Managers. 
Janasiewicz saw the spread of the virus China as a prompt to reduce exposure to riskier assets, and said the next milestone for further risk cuts would be a U.S. outbreak.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 357.28 points, or 1.39%, to 25,409.36; the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 24.54 points, or 0.82%, to 2,954.22; and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.89 point, or 0.01%, to 8,567.37.
The CBOE volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge ended the day near its session low, up 0.95 point at 40.11, after rising as high as 49.48.
Of the S&P's 11 major sectors, the rate-sensitive financial index (SPSY) weighed the most on the benchmark S&P 500 index, ending the day down 2.6%. The utilities sector (SPLRCU) was the S&P's biggest percentage loser with a 3.3% drop. Real estate <.SPLRCR> and consumer staples (SPLRCS) - also rate-sensitive sectors that are often seen as safe havens - both fell more than 2%.
Yet the energy (SPNY), technology (SPLRCT) and communications services index (SPLRCL) all showed gains for the day.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 129 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 538 new lows. 

Trading was brisk on U.S. exchanges with 19.31 billion shares changing hands compared with a 9.25 billion-share average for the last 20 days.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) has agreed to pay $11.85 million to resolve U.S. allegations that it used a charity that helps cover Medicare patients' out-of-pocket drug costs as a means to pay them kickbacks to use a high-priced multiple sclerosis drug.
The deal, announced by the U.S. Justice Department on Friday, was the latest to result from an industry-wide probe of drugmakers' financial support of patient assistance charities that has resulted in more than $865 million in settlements.
The government said Sanofi provided payments to one such charity, The Assistance Fund, not with a charitable purpose in mind but instead to use it as a means to cover the co-pay obligations of Medicare patients using the MS drug Lemtrada.
TAF like other charities in the probe provide assistance to patients seeking to pay out-of-pocket costs for medications. Sanofi, whose drug costs nearly $100,000 per year per patient, made payments to the charity from 2015 to 2016, the department said.
""Sanofi used a supposed charity as a conduit to funnel money to patients taking Sanofi’s very expensive drug, all at the expense of the Medicare program,"" U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston said in a statement.
Sanofi did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The drugmaker in a statement defended the practice of providing financial support to such charitable organizations, saying it ""believes these programs help patients lead healthier lives.""
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the government’s Medicare healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.
But the government has alleged that various drugmakers have used charities like Orlando, Florida-based TAF as means to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.
The investigation, led by the U.S. attorney’s office in Boston, came amid growing attention to soaring U.S. drug prices. Co-pays are partly meant to serve as a check on healthcare expenses by exposing patients to some of a medicine’s cost.

TAF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. It reached a separate $4 million settlement with the government in November resolving similar allegations involving three other pharmaceutical companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - This week's sharp stock sell-off helped activist short-seller Andrew Left profitably close a long-held bet against online retailer Wayfair (N:W) on Friday.
""I have been short Wayfair for four years and I actually covered it this morning,"" Left said in an interview. ""It felt like I was having a baby,"" he said.
Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price.
Wayfair shares closed down 10.2% on Friday after the company posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss. The shares have dropped 21% this week amid a broad market sell-off.
The S&P 500 fell 0.8% on Friday, its seventh straight day of declines. The benchmark index suffered its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis on growing fears the fast-spreading coronavirus could lead to a recession, although stocks cut losses at the end of the day's session.

The Modelo Especial beer maker also said all units supporting its beer business are seeing positive sales trends for the brand thus far in 2020 despite claims about the impact of the coronavirus on its business.
There have been a few media reports inaccurately claiming sales of the beer were being impacted by the virus, a Constellation spokesman said.
""We've seen no impact to our people, facilities or operations and our business continues to perform very well,"" Chief Executive Officer Bill Newlands said in a statement.
Newlands added the company does not have much exposure to international markets such as China that have been most impacted by the outbreak.

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com - Wall Street capped off Friday with its biggest weekly loss since the financial crisis. But the Federal Reserve's pledge to support the economy in wake of a growing coronavirus epidemic helped at the end of the day, with buyers coming in.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.38%. The S&P 500 slipped 0.83% and Nasdaq Composite ended flat.

Federal Reserve Chairman Powell on Friday, in an unscheduled statement, stoked rate-cut hopes, saying the central bank would act to support the economy after he conceded that the coronavirus was a threat to the economy. 

The World Health Organization on Friday raised its risk assessment of the Covid-19 to a ""very high"" global level from ""high"" in late January but stopped short of declaring a coming pandemic.
In mainland China, however, infections are slowing and authorities are ramping up efforts to open factories in a bid to alleviate supply chain disruptions.
“It feels to me that China isok getting the coronavirus under control. You look at the numbers, they’re coming down day by day by day.” Apple CEO Tim Cook said after claiming that Apple’s factories in China were nearing full production.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended lower for the day, but the broader tech market was underpinned by rally in chip stocks, with bargain-hunting investors seemingly eager to snap up beaten-down semis like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). 
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index ended the day 2% higher. 

Energy stocks shrugged off a steep selloff in oil prices to end the day in positive, helping to spark a rebound in the broader market.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors had to contend with mixed quarterly reports. 
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) (NASDAQ:BYND) slumped 15% after the company reported a surprise quarterly loss, which offset better-than-expected revenue.
Wayfair (NYSE:W) fell 10% after its quarterly earnings  fell short of Wall Street estimates as costs continue to rise amid a recent ramp-up in hiring."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street's worst week since 2008, sparked by fears about the fast-spreading coronavirus, has left almost half of the S&P 500's stocks in bear market territory, just nine days after the leading benchmark closed at a record high.
With the world preparing for a pandemic and investors increasingly fearing that the coronavirus could lead to a recession, the S&P 500 (SPX) is on track to end the week down 13%, its worst week since 2008. 
After closing at a record high on Feb. 19, the index has slumped 14%, now in a correction, but most of its individual components are in far worse shape.
""As severe as the decline has been, and even if most of the damage has been done, it's hard to believe it will be over in a week,"" Wellington Shields & Co market analyst Frank Gretz warned in a client note on Friday. 
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 components plummet from 52-week highs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2662/2627/Correction%20and%20bear.jpg) 
Forty-seven percent of the S&P 500's components have fallen more than 20% from their 52-week highs, while another 51% have fallen more than 10%. Only about 10 S&P 500 stocks are down less than 10% from their highs, including healthcare companies Allergan (N:AGN) and Quest Diagnostics (N:DGX), as well as Clorox (N:CLX), which has benefited from expectations of increased demand for its disinfectant cleaning products.
Investors consider securities or market indexes that have fallen 20% or more from their highs, and that maintain those declines for a sustained amount of time, to be in a bear market.
A drop of 10% is widely viewed as correction in a larger, ongoing rally, or bull market.
All of the S&P 500's 11 sectors have tumbled 10% or more from their year-highs, with energy's (SPNY) 33% drop the worst among them, and the consumer staples' (SPLRCS) sector's 11% decline the least.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investor Clifton S. Robbins told clients on Friday that he is shuttering his Blue Harbour Group not because investors want their money back or because returns have lagged, but because he wants to do something different.
""Our investors are very happy, and my energy and productive years ahead still amply match my desire not only to identify and embark on new opportunities, but also, importantly, to see them through to significant milestones of accomplishment,"" Robbins wrote in a letter, seen by Reuters.
Robbins, who recently turned 62, said Blue Harbour invests $2 billion in assets for clients and returned 33% after fees last year. The fund has returned an average 14.4% a year after fees over the last decade. He plans to shut the firm in the second half of the year and has already liquidated some positions.
The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Robbins joins a number of well-known managers who have been overseeing funds for years and recently stepped back from the day-to-day business of running a hedge fund, including Glenn Dubin and Louis Bacon.
Although Robbins was officially an activist investor who tried push management into making positive changes to improve performance, he preferred to work behind the scenes instead of waging noisy proxy contests, pursuing what he long called ""friendly activism.""
Roughly a year ago, two former Blue Harbour colleagues, Lauren Taylor Wolfe and Christian Asmar, set up a hedge fund called Impactive Capital."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - This week's stock market plunge on coronavirus worries has given hedge fund managers a rare opportunity to brag that they are performing better than traditional stock market funds during a time of market stress.
Analyst reports on Friday showed global long-short equity hedge funds lost less money than traditional stock market portfolios, a change in fortune compared with the past several years. Investors in hedge funds pointed to the value of the strategies as markets plummeted on fears of the coronavirus hurting more people, supply chains and economies.
""Overall we've been pleased with how funds have performed so far,"" said Darren Wolf, who leads alternative strategies for Aberdeen Standard Investments.
The firm's stable of around 150 managers was performing well against the market volatility, he said, while cautioning that the situation was ""very fluid.""
A report from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Friday showed long-short managers losing 4.2%, on average, over the five prior days, compared with a global stock benchmark plunge of around 10%.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) data showed a 4.7% week-to-date drop for a similar suite of Americas equity hedge funds, versus 8.8% for the MSCI World Index. The report added that a broader group of hedge funds fell just 2.9%.
It was a welcome development for hedge funds, which over the past decade have suffered reputational damage, prominent closures and asset outflows over poor performance and high fees. Enviable returns of low-cost index funds and brokerages moving to zero-commission structures have only underlined the pain. 
Last year, stock-focused hedge funds gained 13.7%, on average, while the S&P 500 stock index climbed 29%, according to Hedge Fund Research. The gap has been fairly consistent since the financial crisis, with hedge funds have underperformed soaring equity markets.
In response, hedge-fund managers have said their funds are not intended to track the market, but to be a hedge — literally — against and diversified from market risks. The coronavirus is a good example, so far, of how that can play out, some industry sources said.
For instance, hedge fund portfolios at a prominent European pension fund are up modestly in February with strong returns at commodity trading advisors, global macro funds and quant funds whose investments come from computer models, one source said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pessimism about the performance of stock prices over the next six months jumped in the latest American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey, but may not have hit levels needed to lend some optimism for a longer-term rebound.
In the latest survey, bearish sentiment, defined as expectations stocks will fall over the next six months, spiked 10.5 percentage points to 39.1%, its highest reading since Oct. 9, 2019.
At the same time, bullish sentiment, or expectations stocks will rise over the next six months, tumbled 10.1 percentage points to 30.4%, its lowest level since Oct. 9, 2019 and below the historical average of 38%.
(GRAPHIC: AAII survey - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2665/2630/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Excessive bearishness relative to bullishness can be a signal that the market could be oversold and is poised to move higher.
AAII attributed the bearish sentiment jump to the drop in equities to start the week on news of the spread of the coronavirus.
As a result of this sharp shift in sentiment, the spread between bulls and bears dropped to a negative 8.70 from the positive 11.89 in the prior week.
While the spread is now negative and at its lowest level in almost five months, it may need to slide further into negative territory in order to be a contrarian indicator. Extremely bearish sentiment has often resulted in gains for the S&P 500 (SPX) a year later.

Apple counts major Korean display makers Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and LG Electronics Inc among its suppliers. It also sources chips from a factory in Italy run by Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics , according to its most recent supplier list.
Cook told Fox Business Networks that Apple had re-opened 80 percent of its stores in China. He also said that iPhone factories in China had restarted and were in ""phase three of the ramp mode.""
""It will take some time, but by in large I think this is a temporary condition, not a long-term kind of thing,"" Cook said.
Asked if Apple would move manufacturing out of China to countries such as Vietnam or Cambodia, Cook said the company's supply chain was global and that the company considered speed to markets and engineering skills in addition to cost. He also said Apple's supply chain managers were examining how resilient to the coronavirus shock the company's supply chains were.
""And so the question for us after we get on the other side will be, was the resilience there or not and do we need to make some changes,"" he said. ""My perspective sitting here today is that if there are changes, you’re talking about adjusting some knobs, not some sort of wholesale fundamental change.""
Apple last week said it would not meet its guidance for the quarter ending in March and that it would experience supply chain shortages. Cook said he did not know whether the coronavirus would affect the quarter ending in June.

By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – Wall Street selling was stemmed Friday, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a rate cut after flagging the coronavirus as ""evolving risk"" to the economy.
 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 615 points, though had been down more than 1,000 points at the open. The S&P 500 slipped 1.07% and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.22%.
For weeks, Wall Street has been upping bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut, with some pricing in three consecutive cuts starting as soon as March. Powell on Friday, in an unscheduled statement, stoked rate-cut hopes, saying the central bank would act to support the economy after he conceded that the coronavirus was a threat to the economy. 
 

Goldman Sachs said today it estimates the Fed will cut rates by 75 basis points by June, indicating as many as three cuts, with the first cut expected to be delivered at its meeting next month.
The impromptu update from the Fed comes in the wake of a sharp uptick in cases in South Korea, as well as maiden infections reported in New Zealand and Nigeria. The World Health Organization on Friday raised its risk assessment of Covid-19 to a ""very high"" global level from ""high"" in late January, but stopped short of declaring a coming pandemic.
 

But inside of China, however, the pace of infections is slowing and authorities in the country have stepped up efforts to restore operations as factories reopen.
Apple’s factories in China are nearing full production, said Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Time Cook, adding that he was “very optimistic” that China was getting a handle on the outbreak.

“It feels to me that China is getting the coronavirus under control. You look at the numbers, they’re coming down day by day by day.” Cook said.

After a brief foray into positive territory, Apple fell nearly 2%, triggering a u-turn in tech, with gains in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) cut short. 

Energy stocks were also on the backfoot, amid a steep selloff in oil prices amid fears of weaker oil demand as the virus outbreak has hurt travel and tourism activity. 

Elsewhere, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) slumped 17% after the company reported a surprise quarterly loss, which offset better-than-expected revenue.

Wayfair (NYSE:W) fell 13% after its quarterly earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates as costs continue to rise amid a recent ramp-up in hiring."
768,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 03:01PM ET</span>",Ex-Barclays bankers cleared over 2008 Qatar fees in blow to UK fraud office,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Three former  Barclays  (LON:BARC) executives were unanimously acquitted on Friday of charges they helped funnel 322 million pounds ($418 million) in secret fees to Qatar in return for rescue financing during the credit crisis.
A jury at London's Old Bailey criminal court cleared Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath of fraud after just five hours of deliberation in what lawyers said was a crushing blow to the UK's taxpayer-funded Serious Fraud Office (SFO).
The men, aged between 61 and 64, had all denied wrongdoing.
Jenkins, a rainmaker described as the ""gatekeeper"" to the Qataris, said he had ""lived under a cloud"" since the investigation began around eight years ago.
""This has taken an enormous toll on me both economically and personally, and I look forward now to rebuilding my life,"" he said in a statement.
Boath, the bank's former financial institutions boss, told reporters waiting in the rain outside the court that the case had been a ""complete invention"" and that a regulatory probe had cleared him years ago. 
Asked about his plans, he said: ""I'm going for lunch.""
END OF THE ROAD
The verdict draws a line under an ambitious inquiry that led to the first British criminal charges against senior financiers at a major bank over conduct during the credit crisis.
It also marks the likely end of efforts by prosecutors to hold top bankers to account for decisions taken when a global financial meltdown triggered vast taxpayer bailouts of banks.
The SFO, which filed charges a month after the ruling Conservative Party pledged to abolish the agency and roll it into a national crime-fighting force in 2017, said it remained determined to pursue perpetrators of serious financial crime.
But the case, which the SFO estimated has cost around 10 million pounds, was tricky. 
The most senior defendant, former CEO John Varley, was acquitted last June for lack of evidence and the case against Barclays, which centered on alleged unlawful financial assistance to Qatar through a $3 billion loan, was dismissed in 2018.
Zoe Osborne, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson, said it had been ""absolutely the wrong case to pursue"". 
""It is a crushing loss that should be seen by the SFO as a painful lesson that it needs to heed,"" said Aziz Rahman, a lawyer at Rahman Ravelli.
SECRET PAYMENTS
Qatar Holding, part of the $300 billion Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani's investment vehicle, ploughed about 4 billion pounds into Barclays in June and October 2008.
The SFO alleged Jenkins, Kalaris and Boath conspired with ex-finance director Chris Lucas to disguise an extra 42 million pound payment with a bogus, three-year advisory services agreement (ASA) after the Gulf state demanded more than twice the fees Barclays was paying other investors in June 2008.
Jenkins was also charged over the bank's subsequent, 280 million pound, five-year ASA struck with Qatar four months later, as the bank tapped investors for a second time in a two-part, 11 billion pound fundraising.
The men said the ASAs were intended as genuine mechanisms to pay Qatar what it wanted while extracting lucrative, commercial business from Qatar, that such side deals were common in banking, that senior directors had authorized the parameters of negotiations and, along with lawyers, had approved the deals.
Qatar's QIA, which said in a statement it remains a ""committed shareholder, investor and partner to Barclays"", was neither investigated nor accused of wrongdoing.
""Our investments in Barclays created a strategic partnership with the bank and were part of our plan to build a global financial portfolio,"" a spokesperson said.
A statement issued on behalf of Sheikh Hamad said that the ASAs were genuine and had provided for potential substantial transactions.
A lawyer for Lucas, who was not charged because he was too ill to stand trial, declined to comment.
NERVOUS NELLIE
Much of the case was built on recorded conversations on the telephone line of Boath, nicknamed ""Nervous Nellie"" by his counsel.
Boath fretted the June ASA looked ""dodgy"", that it could be seen as a ""bung"" and said he felt sick at the thought of having to demonstrate to authorities that Qatar had provided services, transcripts of conversations and SFO interviews showed.
But Boath also said he had been reassured after seniors approved the deal and had confidence that Jenkins would get the value back from Qatar. ""He is a very impressive individual,"" he told the SFO in 2014, transcripts shown to the court showed.
Defense lawyers said Boath had not fully grasped that Sheikh Hamad could provide Barclays with lucrative, commercial business opportunities by just opening his rolodex.
Jenkins, who was recommended a 25 million pound bonus for his work in 2008, told the jury that Sheikh Hamad would have been insulted if he had been asked to spell out his promises, but that he had believed ""with a passion"" in the ASAs.
After a heart attack in early August 2008, Jenkins said he was ordered back to work a month later to help save Barclays.
The case does not end legal action over the way Barclays behaved during the financial crisis.
The bank is still contesting a 1 billion pound-plus civil lawsuit from businesswoman Amanda Staveley, who arranged an investment from Abu Dhabi investors.
And the Financial Conduct Authority markets regulator in 2013 proposed a 50 million pound fine over how Barclays made disclosures about its dealings with Qatar. That investigation has been on hold pending the outcome of the criminal case.

LONDON (Reuters) - European airlines stepped up their warnings over the coronavirus outbreak on Friday, with British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and Finnair flagging a hit to profits and easyJet reporting a big drop in demand into and out of a virus-affected region in Italy. 
All three airlines also joined rivals in announcing cost cuts to help weather a storm of unknown severity and duration. 
A new coronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has sent demand for travel tumbling in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread around the world, raising fears of a pandemic that could plunge the global economy into recession. 
The crisis is exacerbating deep rooted problems in an airline industry grappling with overcapacity, environmental pressures and the grounding of Boeing's (N:BA) top-selling jet.
IAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year, but said the uncertainty over the impact and duration of the coronavirus outbreak meant it could not give accurate guidance at this stage.
However, it warned: ""We are currently experiencing demand weakness on Asian and European routes and a weakening of business travel across our network resulting from the cancellation of industry events and corporate travel restrictions."" 
British Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.
To deal with the drop in business, IAG said it was cutting costs, without giving details - joining the likes of Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Amsterdam-based KLM (PA:AIRF) which have announced similar moves.
It also said flight cancellations would reduce capacity growth this year, although CEO Willie Walsh said the group could start to add capacity if other airlines failed.
Lower air traffic growth projections prompted Spanish travel technology firm  Amadeus  (MC:AMA) to forecast slower 2020 core profit growth on Friday, but it stressed the outlook did not yet account for the uncertain impact of the virus outbreak.

CASUALTIES
Airline stocks have been among the biggest casualties of a stock market rout this week as coronavirus fears have gripped investors. 
Shares in European carriers have been hit particularly hard as the illness spread across the region, with the death toll in Italy, Europe's worst-hit country, rising to 17 and hundreds of holidaymakers on Spain's Canary Islands quarantined after four cases were detected there. 
""If we were doing this last Friday, we would have given you (profit) guidance,"" IAG's Walsh said on a call with investors, explaining that at that time the situation in Asia had stabilized. But since then, the outbreak in Italy has caused ""a big change,"" making forecasting difficult, he added. 
At 1020 GMT, IAG shares were down 7.8% at 475.1 pence, while easyJet (L:EZJ) stock was down 3.7% at 1,069.5 pence and Finnair (HE:FIA1S) was off 3.3% at 4.926 euros. 
Budget carrier EasyJet reported a ""significant"" softening of demand into and out of its bases in northern Italy and a reduction across its other European markets.
It also said it would be cancelling some flights, particularly into and out of Italy, and that it would make cost savings across its business, without giving details. 
""We continue to monitor the situation carefully and will update the market in due course,"" it said, adding it was too early to determine the impact on its results.
Lufthansa subsidiary Brussels Airlines also said on Friday it would cut its flights to northern Italy by 30% from March 2 to 14 due to the virus outbreak there. 
Finnair, meanwhile, warned of a ""significant"" fall in operating profit this year due to virus-related disruption. 

Finland's national airline said its was scrapping its 2020 capacity growth target, and would look into cutting costs by 40-50 million euros ($44-54 million), with measures under consideration including temporary layoffs.

NEW YORK (LPC) - American Express’ Global Business Travel (GBT) unit was forced to improve lenders’ protections on US$1.13bn in loans to lure investors into a transaction that teetered as fears of a coronavirus pandemic mounted.
Loan investors in the US grew wary of committing to the deal, slated to reduce borrowing costs and pay a dividend to its stockholders, during its marketing phase due to the company’s exposure to softening demand for travel while fears of the virus keeps potential passengers grounded.
Amex GBT, which provides corporate travel services and facilitates company meetings, faces a stern test as corporations across the globe contemplate grounding their staff and determine alternatives for cross-border business encounters. Companies such as Nestle, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have canceled either conferences or asked its staff to halt international travel for business purposes this week amid the outbreak.
Companies have warned that the virus, which has spread from its original point of Wuhan, China to Europe, Asia and the Middle East, could hurt business operations and put negative pressure on corporate earnings.
In the loan market last week, the uncertainty of the outbreak left at least three Asian borrowers from Indonesia, Vietnam and China with little choice but to scrap travel for planned lender meetings in favor of dial-in teleconferences.
“The timing was off, and it’s a shame for Amex because it’s a business with a durable long-term view, but they had to make (the terms of the loan) sweeter to make it work,” said one investor that looked at the deal.
RISK-OFF
On Thursday, Amex GBT reduced its loan by US$90m, with the financing now comprising a US$615m funded tranche and a US$515m delayed-draw term loan. While the delayed-draw feature gives the company some flexibility to borrow the money when needed, Amex GBT will pay ticking fees from day one of the loan agreement at 100% of the interest plus Libor, a rate more aggressive than usual.
The ticking fees, typically paid to lenders for their commitment to lend until a loan funds, were initially pitched at the lower rate of 50% of the margin during days 46-90 of the delayed-draw loan, before increasing to 100% from day 91 onwards.
Amex GBT will also cough up an extra 50bp in interest than it initially intended on the seven-year facility, which finalized at an interest rate of 400bp over Libor. Call protection was also extended to 12 months from the originally proposed six, banking sources said.
Proceeds will fund a US$484m shareholder dividend, refinance existing debt and support the acquisition of corporate travel assets, according to a February 11 report from Moody’s Investors Service.
“It’s hard to (accurately) price in the risk of the virus right now, but any travel-related loans are going to face pressure because people are concerned (about the virus) and there is no way around that,” the investor said.
The adjusted debt to Ebitda ratio is roughly 4.5 times as of December 2019, according to Moody’s. Amex GBT is rated B2 by the ratings agency and B+ by peer S&P Global Ratings.
Last December, private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) agreed to buy a stake in Amex GBT. Credit card issuer Amex owned the corporate travel unit until 2014 when it sold half of the company to an investor group led by Certares.
Certares bought the 50% stake in Amex GBT alongside the Qatar Investment Authority, funds managed by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas.
Carlyle is investing in Amex GBT alongside Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, the University of California Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents and Kaiser Permanente.
Amex will still retain 50% of the corporate travel business.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) led the loan for Amex GBT.
The bank declined to comment. Amex and Certares were not immediately available for comment."

773,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 02:03PM ET</span>","U.S. regulators to rate new auto tech, but Europe leads in safety testing","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Autopilot, Super Cruise and Drive Pilot are different names given to technology that automates steering and braking in a growing number of vehicles, but none of it can safely ""pilot"" cars without regular human intervention. 
These systems and the potential for consumers to misunderstand and misuse them are putting pressure on regulators everywhere to overhaul safety testing and consumer rating systems that have not kept up with the pace of deployment of new semi-automated driving technology.
That may be especially true in the United States, where the National Transportation Safety Board chided regulators this week for lagging their European counterparts in efforts to ensure consumer and road safety.
The acting head of the U.S. vehicle safety regulator said on Wednesday that his agency would make changes this year to a testing program that assigns safety grades to new and future vehicles.
""We’re raising the bar for safety technologies in our new vehicles,"" said acting National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief James Owens. 
NHTSA in December 2015 issued proposed rulemaking for testing procedures that would be similar to more comprehensive testing done by European regulators.
No rules have been put forward since then, however, and Owens' comments came a day after the NTSB sharply criticized NHTSA for its hands off approach to overseeing semi-automated driving technology. The NTSB, an independent U.S. government agency, also compared NHTSA's testing and ratings unfavorably to consumer safety systems put in place by European agencies.[nL1N2AP0SD]
Surveys have shown that consumers overestimate the capabilities of semi-automated systems, as automakers race to deliver on the promise of truly driverless cars. Safety advocates also criticize manufacturers for using misleading terms to market those systems, including Autopilot, Pro Pilot Assist and Traffic Jam Pilot.
European regulators have been expanding their rules and ratings to evaluate new technology such as automatic braking and lane-keeping, while U.S. regulators have done little to change their traditional ""five star"" crash test grading system.
European safety ratings assess all advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) currently available and regulators have passed some laws on the technology.
In 2018, European Union regulators required the installation of acoustic and visual warning signals for lane-keeping systems every 15 seconds if drivers take their hands off the wheel.
As a result, Tesla (O:TSLA) had to issue a software update to its Autopilot system in the EU.
A regulatory body is currently working on rules for more advanced hands-off systems that can control braking, acceleration and lane changes at speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph).
Under draft EU rules, carmakers among other things need to show how the system safely hands control back to the driver, how the car monitors the road and how it reacts in emergency situations.
Pressure on automakers in Europe also comes from non-binding performance ratings by Europe's New Car Assessment Program, known in the industry as Euro NCAP.
Euro NCAP began rating automatic braking systems in 2014. It is testing the performance of advanced cruise control, lane-centering systems and blind spot detection since 2018 and beginning in May will also grade how well a car's system is keeping the driver engaged.
The group is a non-governmental body but funded by some EU countries and also receives money from national motor clubs and insurers. Matthew Avery, a Euro NCAP board member, said the group was sharing testing methods with NHTSA and the NTSB on a regular basis.
As regulation moves slowly, Euro NCAP plays a crucial role in holding carmakers accountable, Avery said.
""The manufacturers initially scream blue murder and say our targets are impossible to achieve, but then one of them does it and everyone follows,"" he said.
Carmakers in the United States are allowed to self-certify that their vehicles comply with existing rules, said University of South Carolina law professor Bryant Walker Smith, who focuses on automated driving. But there are currently no rules for ADAS.

NHTSA also publishes an annual New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which evaluates the crashworthiness of a vehicle and outlines what semi-automated features a car comes with. But the agency does not assess the safety of those systems despite nearly all modern cars being equipped with some features like automatic emergency braking.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 01:44PM ET</span>",SoftBank communications chief Gary Ginsberg takes leave to aid Bloomberg campaign: sources,"By Kenneth Li and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Gary Ginsberg, the global head of communications for SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), has taken an indefinite leave of absence to advise Michael Bloomberg's U.S. presidential campaign, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Ginsberg has been on unpaid leave from SoftBank since January, and it remains unclear when he will return, the sources said. His move comes as the Japanese conglomerate is battling to reset its image with the business community, so it can attract investors for the second $108 billion Vision Fund it has been struggling to raise.
Ginsberg is working as a senior adviser to the Bloomberg campaign, the sources said. He has advised on debate preparation, messaging and has helped make introductions in the political and media spheres, the sources added.
Ginsberg's deputy, Sarah Lubman, has taken over as acting head of communications at SoftBank, the sources said.
SoftBank and Ginsberg declined to comment, while Bloomberg's campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.
Ginsberg was a long-time top adviser to Rupert Murdoch, and was the top communications executive at Time Warner before AT&T Inc (N:T) acquired the media conglomerate in 2018.
A former lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, Ginsberg served in the Clinton administration at the White House Counsel's office and the Justice Department, according to his biography.
News of Ginsberg advising Bloomberg was first reported by CNN's Brian Stelter earlier this month. 
SoftBank is currently struggling to raise a successor to its $100 billion Vision Fund, the performance of which has suffered from big bets on start-ups such as WeWork and  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER). 
It is also facing pressure from Elliott Management Corp, an activist investor that has a $3 billion stake in the company.
Amid all this, a Wall Street Journal report this week found that Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisers, which oversees the Vision Fund, tried to smear other SoftBank executives and prevent them from getting top jobs.
Misra denies the allegations and says they contain a series of falsehoods. SoftBank said it has investigated a campaign of ""falsehoods"" against the company for several years and that it would review the inferences made by the Wall Street Journal.
Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York City, will be on ballots for the first time on Tuesday, when 14 U.S. states and one U.S. territory host primaries for the Democratic nomination to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump for the White House.

A billionaire businessman, Bloomberg skipped the early states and has spent more than $500 million running ads in these so-called ""Super Tuesday"" states, as he tries to surpass Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg as the front-runner among moderates. He faces an uphill battle in overtaking the favorite for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders.

781,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 11:32AM ET</span>","Virus Fear Upends Global Stocks, Fuels Bond Rally: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) -- Fear over the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus tightened its grip on global markets, sending U.S. equities to a seventh straight loss and sparking demand for safe assets from Treasuries to the yen.
The S&P 500 plunged more than 3% Friday and is now down over 15% from its record. The index is mired in its longest slump in over three years and careening toward its worst week since the financial crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has shed more than 4,000 points this week. Treasury yields sank to all-time lows, with the two-year tumbling through 1% and 30-year rates under 1.7%. Crude slid toward $44 a barrel, while gold tumbled the most intraday since June 2013. European shares hit August lows and Asian equities fell more than 2.5%.

U.S. equity markets shuddered as the World Health Organization raised its global risk level for the virus and a White House official suggested some schools could close. More majro companies warned that disruptions could upend sales and profit forecasts. Germany quarantined about 1,000 people and Switzerland banned large events, leading to the Geneva car show being canceled. Iran and South Korea revealed more infections while the first cases appeared in Mexico and Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.
“Investors are selling stocks first and asking questions later,” Keith Lerner, SunTrust’s chief market strategist, wrote in a note. “We are seeing signs of pure liquidation. ‘Get me out at any cost’ seems to be the prevailing mood. There is little doubt the coronavirus will continue to weigh on the global economy, and the U.S. will not be immune. There is much we do not know. However, it is also premature to suggest the base case for the U.S. economy is recession.”
Downgrades to the global outlook keep rolling in and money markets now see three Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond.
“Asset prices diverged significantly from growth in the past year, in part because of central bank policy, but also because passive investment’s main signal is price action,” reckons James McCormick (NYSE:MKC), global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets. “The COVID-19 escalation runs a real risk of virtuous cycle turning to a vicious one. Either way, given where growth estimates are heading for the next few months, I’d expect more downside.”
Amid the hunt for havens, the yen is on course for its biggest weekly gain since mid-2016, though gold was set for a decline after a multi-month rally.
Elsewhere, New Zealand’s dollar fell 1% Friday as the country reported its first case of the virus and investors bet on policy easing from the central bank. Turkish stocks plunged as tensions between Ankara and Moscow soared.

782,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 11:14AM ET</span>",Going viral: Six charts and the $6 trillion loss,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Capitulation? Perhaps.
The rapid worldwide spread of coronavirus and the economic implications of the outbreak have triggered the biggest weekly stock market rout since the 2008 financial crisis, wiping $6 trillion off global equities.
With travel plans and conferences canceled, airlines grounded and even the Tokyo Olympic Games in doubt, economists are busily slashing their forecasts for company earnings and economic growth.
Bond markets are certainly screaming warnings of recession, with U.S. and German 10-year yields falling 20 basis points on the week, the latter hitting record lows. Even gold, that ultimate safe-haven, fell as traders scrambled to meet margin calls triggered by the big stock market slide.
Below are a series of charts detailing the scale of the damage so far in financial markets.
1/ EVERYBODY HURT
Almost every single stock index in the world has spiraled lower but developed markets have borne the brunt. Winners of the week were high-grade government bonds that benefited from the safety bid and rate cut expectations.

2/ $6 TRILLION AND COUNTING...
A basket of nearly 7,000 stocks including developed, emerging and frontier markets have lost nearly $6 trillion or more than 10% of their value since Monday, according to Refinitiv DataStream.
(Graphic: Value loss this week - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/15/7933/7933/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
3/ BEARS PROWL
A 10% drop is deemed to bring a stock or index into correction territory while a 20% slump is a bear market. By that yardstick, almost 80% of South Korean shares, and more than half of Japanese and emerging market shares and a third of the German index have entered bear territory.

4/ OIL SLICK
Fears of a demand collapse caused by recession are weighing heavily on commodities. Oil prices are headed for their steepest weekly fall in four years, and having fallen nearly a third from 2020-highs, are in a bear market too. Meanwhile, gold hovered near 7-year highs.

5/ ATTENTION POWELL, LAGARDE & CO
Money markets are betting central banks will slash interest rates fast and frequently.
They now price a full 25 basis point U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut as soon as March, more than two rate reductions by June and more than three by September. The shift has halted the dollar's rise and its safe haven status (=USD).
The European Central Bank is forecast to reduce its minus 0.5% rate by 10 basis points as soon as June.

6/VOL SQUALL
Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX index's closing high has spiked to levels last seen 2011 at the height of euro zone debt crisis while long dormant currency volatility is also stirring. That's bad news for traders who have been shorting low-yield currencies such as euro and Japanese yen because any rise in volatility can quickly wipe out these trades. That can send panicked investors scrambling to buy back those currencies.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 11:01AM ET</span>",Coronavirus to cost Europe's retailers $4 billion in lost sales: study,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Supply disruptions caused by the coronavirus is expected to lead to 3.26 billion pounds ($4.24 billion) in missed sales for retailers in Europe in the six weeks to April 20, with China still struggling to resume full production, a study showed on Friday.
The rapid spread of coronavirus is raising fears of a pandemic, with five countries reporting their first cases on Friday, the World Health Organization warning it could go global and Switzerland cancelling the Geneva car show.
The epidemic that started in China late last year has already hit container shipping flows - the main transporter of retail goods from China to buyers in Europe and around the world, with goods stuck and costs mounting.
Research carried out by UK headquartered digital freight forwarder Zencargo estimated the cumulative impact of lost sales for retailers from March 9 to April 20 in Germany would be over 728 million pounds, in France over 445 million pounds and 253 million pounds in Britain, with an overall loss in the UK and the EU seen at 3.264 billion pounds.
Electronics, clothing and furniture are the top three categories of goods most affected by supply chain issues, Zencargo said.
""The chief limiting factors so far has been diminished production capacity (in China) as factories struggle with worker shortages and new regulation. However, as regions approach 85% production capacity, we’re now seeing the knock on effects of transportation disruption,"" Zencargo's chief commercial officer Richard Fattal told Reuters.
""Due to the lack of manpower in warehousing and transportation, containers are now backing up on the docks all over the country, both inbound and outbound. Until shipping lines return to normal rotation and clear dockside exports, we foresee further disruption over coming months."" 
Zencargo based its estimates on the expected loss from out-of-stock items caused by production and transport shortages.
Ratings agency Moody's said a pandemic - usually taken to mean a disease spreading quickly in different places - would trigger global and U.S. recessions in the first half of the year.
The world's biggest container line Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) warned last week the coronavirus outbreak would weigh on earnings this year, adding to pressure on a sector already hit by trade wars and an economic slowdown."
785,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>","After Two-Hour Trading Halt, Toronto Exchanges Open With Plunge","(Bloomberg) -- Canadian stocks plunged, playing catchup to the rout in global markets after a technical glitch closed the main exchange two hours early in the midst of Thursday’s meltdown.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell as much as 4.8% Friday to 15,813.03, the biggest intraday drop in almost five years. The materials index took the biggest hit with a 5% drop as companies linked to the global economy slumped and gold tumbled on profit taking.
Canadian stocks had been holding up fairly well at the start of the cornavirus outbreak but with the economic impact of the virus spreading, the nation’s market has crumpled.
“Our concern is that the disruption of the supply chain doesn’t just get switched on again,” Jay Jacobs, head of research and strategy at Global X Management said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office. It can take weeks to get back on track and that’s why the coronavirus is especially detrimental to the miners and resource companies that populate Canadian exchanges.
Toronto followed other global markets down with U.S. equities posting their seventh straight loss and investors rushing into the safety of government bond markets.
The Toronto Stock Exchange said Thursday’s interruption was caused by a system capacity issue within the messaging technology component of TMX Group Ltd.’s trading engine. The high volume of messages received — such as buy and sell orders, and requests to modify orders were at the root of the issue, the company said in an emailed statement. The bourse said it has undertaken necessary measures to mitigate the risk of recurrence and that the incident was not the result of a cyber-security attack.
“The moves were just incredible, but of course Canadian investors didn’t get to see the moves at the end of the day because once again the TMX Group disgraced our country,” said Andrew McCreath chief investment officer at Toronto-based Forge First Asset Management.
High Volume
The halt came in the midst of a week-long dive in global markets as anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus weighs on equities. Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem.
In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to Bloomberg data. That was 41% higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26.
TMX Group has been hit by outages before. In April 2018, the TSX and its derivatives market shut down for more than two hours on a Friday afternoon. TMX said that failure was the result of a defective storage module."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - If an outbreak of coronavirus hits New York, it could cause more sharp selling of stocks, but markets would likely continue to function even if the floor of the New York Stock Exchange had to close.
No case has been confirmed in the state, but dozens of people were being checked in the New York City area on Wednesday.
U.S. stock exchanges said they have contingency plans.
Here is how the markets would work if there were disruptions or panic selling of stocks.
HOW PREPARED ARE STOCK EXCHANGES?
Nearly all U.S. stock trading is done electronically, with only Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) NYSE still operating an open outcry trading floor. But even the Big Board can operate fully electronically if the floor needs to be shut.The exchanges said they are monitoring the situation.
""The NYSE is carefully monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and has robust contingency plans, tested regularly, to enable continuous operation of the NYSE exchanges should any facilities be impacted,"" a spokesman said in a statement.
""Cboe has business continuity plans in place for a wide variety of scenarios that could potentially impact operations,"" said a spokeswoman for rival exchange operator Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE). ""We are closely monitoring developments related to coronavirus.""
""The safety of Nasdaq employees, vendors, visitors is paramount. We continue to follow the updates and act and communicate accordingly,"" said a spokesman for Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ).
WHAT IF AN EXCHANGE GOES DOWN?
On July 8, 2015, a technical glitch forced the NYSE to suspend trading for several hours, but trading continued as normal on the other 10 U.S. stock exchanges operating at the time.
There are now 13 stock exchanges and another three expected to launch this year, as well as around 30 private stock trading venues run by broker dealers where trading can take place.
In August 2013, a technical problem froze trading in all Nasdaq-listed stocks for three hours, leading the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to call for a meeting of Wall Street executives to insure ""continuous and orderly"" functioning of the markets.
CAN THE ENTIRE MARKET BE SHUT DOWN?
On Oct. 29 and 30, 2012, markets were closed after Superstorm Sandy, the worst storm to hit New York City in nearly 75 years. The NYSE closed its trading floor due to unsafe conditions in lower Manhattan. The exchange had planned to go fully electronic, but with much of Wall Street unprepared for the transition and running on skeleton staffing, traders and regulators felt uncomfortable with the idea and it was shelved. There has been extensive testing since then.
The markets were also closed following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks until Sept. 17 to avoid panic selling.
HOW LIKELY IS A MAJOR STOCK MARKET CRASH?
On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 22.6%, after which the SEC mandated market-wide circuit breakers to ease big market declines.
To prevent another 1987-style crash, trading is paused for 15 minutes if the S&P 500 index falls more than 7% before 3:25 p.m. New York time. If the decline continues after trading resumes, before 3:25 p.m., the market is paused again at 13%. If the decline happens after 3:25 p.m., trading continues. But trading is suspended for the session if the decline reaches 20%.
HOW HAVE THINGS CHANGED SINCE PAST ISSUES?
Technology has made it easier for people to work from home, said Doug Clark, a Toronto-based electronic trading executive who has worked for Virtu Financial, ITG, and BMO Capital Markets. Toronto was one of the first places to experience an outbreak of the SARS virus after it spread from China in 2003.
""We were all scrambling,"" he said. Traders had difficulty accessing all of their trading tools from home, he said, as did exchange executives.
VPN technology has improved greatly since then and working from home is not such a big issue anymore, he said.
The SEC also introduced a rule called Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity in 2014 to hold exchanges to a higher level of emergency preparedness, and the bourses do regular testing of their backup facilities, said James Angel, a Georgetown University finance professor.
But testing has its limits.
""You can do all the testing you want, but you never know if it's really going to work until you run it for real,"" Angel said."
788,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 10:39AM ET</span>",Elliott presses SoftBank to identify $10 billion of investments it holds: sources,"By Clara Denina 
LONDON (Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp is pressing SoftBank Group Corp (T:9434) for details of nearly-$10 billion of investment securities on its balance sheet, as part of its campaign to improve the value of the Japanese conglomerate in which it holds a stake, sources said.
The $40 billion hedge fund, one of the most powerful activist investors, has a $3 billion stake in the company and is trying to push for changes after SoftBank's bet on start-ups such as space-sharing firm WeWork soured. 
SoftBank's stock trades at a deep discount to the value of its holdings, and analysts say there is a lack of clarity on its internal valuation calculations for private holdings in its flagship Vision Fund. Elliott has asked for improved disclosure on the valuation of assets in the fund, the sources said. 
Elliott is also pressing for details on $8.33 billion of investment securities sitting on SoftBank's balance sheet that appear outside of the Vision Fund with no detail as to what they are, the sources added. 
While items listed as investment securities on a balance sheet usually refer to tradable financial assets such as listed equities, analysts think SoftBank includes unlisted companies. 
Elliott is asking for information on this, the sources said.
Elliott declined to comment. 
A spokesman for SoftBank referred to filings showing that investments outside its fund include the ride-hailing portfolio like Uber (K:UBER), DiDi and Grab that had been warehoused by the group. SoftBank invested around $7.7 billion for a 15% stake in Uber in January 2018 and later sold it to the Vision Fund for the same price. 
Elliott's demand for clarity adds to its calls for improved governance of the group - the activist has asked for greater independence and diversity on its board. 
SoftBank's leadership has come under closer scrutiny this week after a report in the Wall Street Journal said Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank Investment Advisers which oversees the Vision Fund, tried to smear other executives and prevent them from getting top jobs at the fund.
Misra denies the allegations and says they contain a series of falsehoods. SoftBank said they have investigated a campaign of ""falsehoods"" against the company for several years and that they would review the inferences made by the WSJ. 
SoftBank's founder Masayoshi Son welcomed Elliott as a major investor during the company's results on February 12, and has said the two have held friendly discussions and are aligned on improving shareholder value and governance. 
As well as asking for SoftBank's all-male board to have more diversity, Elliott wants a new subcommittee at main board level, to oversee and aid the investment process of the Vision Fund, the sources said. Both should have at least one female member, they said. 
SoftBank already has an investment committee that carries out due diligence on investments.
The $100 billion Vision Fund's mixed track record has weighed on SoftBank's effort to raise a second fund of similar size.

793,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>","Stocks - Panic Selling Continues as Dow Tumbles Below 25,000","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Panic selling continued in the U.S. stock market on Friday, putting the market on course for its biggest weekly loss since 2008 amid growing signs that the coronavirus outbreak will ultimately cause an economic shock in Western economies as well as in China and its Asian trading partners. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened with another loss of 627 points, or 2.6%, taking it below the 25,000 mark. By 10:33 AM ET (1533 GMT), the DJIA was down 4%, or 1,034 points.
The S&P 500 was down 3.4%, at its lowest since October 2019. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, fell 2.7%. 
Overnight, another sharp jump in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Korea and Iran, coupled with new emergency virus containment measures in Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere, all contributed to keeping the mood negative. A better-than-expected monthly rise of 0.6% in U.S. personal income in January was of little consolation.
""The landscape remains very uncertain,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of BlueBay Asset Management in a weekly note. ""For now, there is a sense with the coronavirus that things will need to get worse before they can get better.""
He argued that the point of ""maximum bearishness"" could be another couple of weeks away. 
""This could coincide with the moment that Covid19 is officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization,"" something that could lay the groundwork for a coordinated response of policy stimulus, Dowding argued. Such hopes seem far away at the moment, with the U.S. and German governments both playing down the seriousness of the situation.
The bond market is now betting heavily on the Federal Reserve riding to the rescue. The2-Year Treasury bond yield dipped below 1% overnight and then roared lower to 0.91% after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard indicated that the Fed, if not fiscal policy, would react to a global pandemic. 
“Further policy rate cuts are a possibility if a global pandemic actually develops with health effects approaching the scale of ordinary influenza, but this is not the baseline case at this time,” Bullard, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said Friday in prepared remarks to be delivered in Fort Smith, Arkansas.
Hot money continued to flood out of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which lost another 7.1%, taking its losses for the week to over 30%.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) suffered similar problems following a surprise quarterly loss after the bell Thursday, losing 17.6%. It’s now down 25% for the week.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was also the subject of some heavy profit-taking, falling 5.1% to its lowest since December. None of the companies mentioned released any news of note.
One stock emphatically bucking the trend was   Zoom Video Communications   (NASDAQ:ZM), the maker of software for video conference calls. Zoom Video stock has been flying as participants price in a boom in such calls as Covid-19 spawns a global outbreak of working from home and restrictions on business travel.

Bullard said the Fed’s “base case” is still to keep rates steady. The market is pricing in a 100% of a rate cut in March presently, with a 40% of a 50-basis-point cut, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

The 10-Year Treasury yield sank to 1.168%. It hit a record low of 1.155% earlier.

Denis has been the head of Jimmy Choo since 2012. He was recruited by German conglomerate JAB Holding Co, Coty's (N:COTY) majority shareholder. The stiletto maker is now part of U.S. luxury fashion group Capri Holdings Ltd (N:CPRI), which also owns Versace and Michael Kors.
Sales at Coty's consumer beauty business, which includes brands Max Factor and Rimmel, have fallen for the last seven consecutive quarters, battered by competition from trendier, more Instagram-friendly brands.
The company has also struggled to integrate Procter & Gamble's (N:PG) beauty business, which it purchased in 2016 for over $12 billion, due to production and supply chain issues.
Denis, who has been on Coty's board since September 2019, is its third CEO since the P&G deal and has experience working with cosmetics and fragrances, having served as the Asia-Pacific head of Parfums Christian Dior (PA:LVMH).
""Denis' extensive sector experience will be invaluable to accelerating top-line growth across Coty's core categories: Fragrances, Cosmetics and Skin Care,"" the company said in a statement.
He will take over as Coty undergoes a series of changes, implemented by Laubies since he took over as CEO in November 2018, including a $600 million investment in reality star Kylie Jenner's beauty brands and an ambitious four-year turnaround plan.
""We can't help but view this as an incremental negative as a CEO transition in the midst of much so much organizational change brings additional uncertainty to the story,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts wrote.
Coty's better performing luxury business has also faced some recent speed bumps, with Gucci-owner Kering's (PA:PRTP) chairman Francois-Henri Pinault saying this month that the company was frustrated with the slow pace of progress in cosmetics development with Coty.
Denis will take over this summer, upon the conclusion of the company's strategic review of its professional beauty unit that houses brands such as Wella and OPI.
The company also said Pierre-André Térisseas would assume the role of chief operating officer in addition to his current role as finance chief."

LONDON (Reuters) - Coronavirus panic sent world share markets skidding again on Friday, putting them on course for their worst weekly fall since the 2008 global financial crisis, with almost $6 trillion wiped from their market value so far this week.
The rout showed no signs of slowing as Europe's main markets slumped 3-5% and the ongoing dive for safety sent yields on U.S. government bonds, widely seen as the world's most secure asset, to fresh record lows. [GVD/EUR]
Hopes that the epidemic which started in China would be over in months and that economic activity would quickly return to normal have been shattered this week as the number of international cases spiralled.
Bets are now that the Federal Reserve will cut U.S. interest rates as soon as next month and other major central banks will follow to try and nurse economies through the troubles and stave off a global recession.
""The volatility isn't as surprising as the fact that it took so long to rear its head. However, the recent swings indicate the complacency that appears to have settled over markets during the earlier stages of the outbreak has been dislodged,"" said Paras Anand, CIO, Asia Pacific at Fidelity International.
Disruptions to international travel and supply chains, school closures and cancellations of major events have all blackened the outlook for a world economy that was already struggling with the U.S.-China trade war fallout.
MSCI's all-country world index, which tracks almost 50 countries, was down more than 1% ahead of U.S. trading and almost 10% for the week - the worst since October 2008. 
Wall Street shares plunged 4.4% on Thursday alone, their largest fall since August 2011. Futures pointed to a modest 1% drop later, but the S&P 500 has lost 12% since hitting a record high just nine days ago, putting it in so-called correction territory. (N)
Europe's airlines and travel stocks have plunged 18% in their worst week since the 2001 9/11 attacks in the United States. (EU). The CBOE volatility index, often called the ""fear index"", jumped as high as 47, its highest in about two years, well out of the 11-20 range of recent months.
The index, which measures expected swings in U.S. shares in the next 30 days, typically shoots up to around 50 when bear market selling hits its heaviest, and approached almost 90 during the 2008-09 financial crisis.

PANDEMIC WARNING
In Asia, MSCI's regional index excluding Japan shed 2.6%. Japan's Nikkei slumped 3.7% on rising fears the July-August Tokyo Olympics in may be called off due to the coronavirus.
""The coronavirus now looks like a pandemic. Markets can cope even if there is big risk as long as we can see the end of the tunnel,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""But at the moment, no one can tell how long this will last and how severe it will get.""
World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the virus could become a pandemic as the outbreak spreads to major developed economies such as Germany and France. 
About 10 countries have reported their first virus cases over the past 24 hours, including Nigeria, the biggest economy in Africa.
The global rout knocked mainland Chinese shares, which have been relatively well supported this month, as new coronavirus cases in the country fell and Beijing doled out measures to shore up economic growth.
The CSI300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen shares dropped 3.5%, to bring its weekly loss to 5% and the worst since April.
Oil prices languished at their lowest in more than a year having plunged 12% this week - the worst since 2016 - while all the major industrial metals have dropped between 3% and 6%. [MET/L][O/R] 
The appeal of guaranteed income sent high-grade bonds rallying. U.S. yields - which move inversely to the price - plunged, with the benchmark 10-year note yield hitting a record low of 1.1550% in frenzied European trading. It last stood at 1.1847%.
That is well below the three-month bill yield of 1.43%, deepening the so-called inversion of the yield curve. Historically an inverted yield curve is one of the most reliable leading indicators of a U.S. recession.
Expectations the Fed will cut interest rates to cushion the blow are rising in money markets. Analysts say Fed funds futures <0#FF:> are now pricing in about a 75% chance of a 25 basis point cut at the central bank's March 17-18 meeting. 
The European Central Bank historically lags the Fed but it is now seen cutting by another 10 basis points by June.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 09:07AM ET</span>","Coronavirus outbreak 'getting bigger', says WHO, warning of spread worldwide","By Stephanie Nebehay and Ryan Woo
GENEVA/BEIJING (Reuters) - The rapid rise in coronavirus raised fears of a pandemic on Friday, with five countries reporting their first cases, the World Health Organization warning it could spread worldwide and Switzerland cancelling the giant Geneva car show.
World share markets crashed again, winding up their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis and bringing the global wipeout to $5 trillion. 
Hopes that the epidemic that started in China late last year would be over in months, and that economic activity would quickly return to normal, have been shattered as the number of international cases has spiraled.
""The outbreak is getting bigger,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva. 
""The scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while.""
Switzerland joined countries banning big events to try to curb the epidemic, forcing cancellation of next week's Geneva international car show, one of the industry's most important gatherings.
The United States asked its military in Saudi Arabia to avoid crowded venues including malls and cinemas. 
Mainland China reported 327 new cases, the lowest since Jan. 23, taking its tally to more than 78,800 cases with almost 2,800 deaths. 
China's three biggest airlines restored some international flights and the Shanghai fashion show, initially postponed, went ahead online.
TROOPS DEPLOYED
But as the outbreak eases in China, it is surging elsewhere.
Five more countries have reported their first case, all with travel history connected to Italy. They were Nigeria, Estonia, Denmark, Netherlands and Lithuania, Lindmeier said.
Countries other than China now account for about three-quarters of new infections.
Bulgaria said it was ready to deploy up to 1,000 troops and military equipment to the border with neighboring Turkey to prevent illegal migrant inflows. It said it would not allow massive inflows at a time when it is stepping up preventive measures against the coronavirus. It has not reported any cases.
Ratings agency Moody's said a pandemic - usually taken to mean a disease spreading quickly in different places - would trigger global and U.S. recessions in the first half of the year.
Mongolia, which has yet to confirm a case, placed its president, Battulga Khaltmaa, in quarantine as a precaution after he returned from a trip to China, state media reported.
A Chinese official called the epidemic the most difficult health crisis in the country's modern history. Another said some recovered patients had been found to be infectious, suggesting the epidemic may be even harder to eradicate than previously thought.
Lindmeier said the WHO was looking very carefully into reports of some people getting re-infected.
In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and canceled big gatherings to try to halt the flu-like disease.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was considering invoking special powers to expand production of protective gear.
In Europe, France's reported cases doubled, Germany warned of an impending epidemic and Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East, announced tighter border controls.
The death toll in Italy, Europe's worst-hit country, rose to 17 and those testing positive increased by more than 200 to 655. 
Germany has nearly 60 cases, France about 38 and Spain 23, according to a Reuters count.
Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a ""decisive point"" in efforts to prevent a wider outbreak, the WHO said.
OLYMPIC DOUBTS
South Korea has the most cases outside China. It reported 571 new infections on Friday, bringing the total to 2,337. The outbreak, which has killed 13 people in South Korea, has also dented President Moon Jae-in's popularity, a poll showed.
The head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr Mike Ryan, said Iran's outbreak may be worse than realized. It has reported the most deaths outside China - 34 from 388 reported cases.
U.S. intelligence agencies are monitoring the spread of coronavirus in Iran and India, where only a handful of cases have been reported, sources said.
Japan is scheduled to host the 2020 Olympics in July but Ryan said discussions were being held about whether to go ahead.
Organizers will decide next week on the ceremonial torch relay, due to arrive on March 20 for a 121-day journey past landmarks including Mount Fuji and Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park.
As of Friday, confirmed cases in Japan had risen above 200, with four deaths, excluding more than 700 cases on a quarantined cruise liner, Diamond Princess.
A British man who was infected on the ship had died, bringing the death toll among passenger to six, Kyodo newswire reported.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had called for schools to close and vowed to prevent a severe blow to an economy already teetering on the brink of recession.
Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, where the coronavirus has killed two people and infected more than 90, quarantined a pet dog of a coronavirus patient after its nasal and oral samples tested ""weak positive"", though authorities had no evidence the virus can be transmitted to pets.

820,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 09:04AM ET</span>","Stocks - Cisco, Exxon Fall in Premarket; Rolls-Royce Rises","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Stocks in focus in premarket trading on Friday, February 28th.
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock fell 2.6% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company is planning a new round of layoffs due to the high uncertainty over the economic outlook.
  Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) stock fell 0.9%, outperforming the broader market, after the retailer reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.63 rather than the $1.59 expected, and the positive surprise outweighed other negative lines such as falling gross margins and a miss on revenue.
Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) ADRs surged 6.2% after the aero engine maker said it was confident that the worst of the problems with its Trent 1000 engine was behind it.
Chief Executive Warren East said the roll-out of fixes was progressing and he had increased confidence in a new blade design due next year.
The number of aircraft on the ground for repair would fall to fewer than 10 by end of June, in line with forecasts, he said.
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 1.5% to its lowest since 2004 amid ongoing pressure on crude oil prices. U.S. crude futures fell over 3% at one stage on Friday and are on course for a weekly loss of 15%.
 Forty Seven  (NASDAQ:FTSV)stock rose 22% after Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) reportedly approached it about a takeover. The two drug companies haven’t confirmed the report.
Gilead stock, which has outperformed the market sharply this week on hopes that regulatory approval for its remdesivir drug can be accelerated, was down 3.0%.
Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock fell 2.8% after the Chinese search engine giant said its revenue may fall as much as 13% this quarter due to the coronavirus outbreak.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 08:23AM ET</span>",Insurers could lose billions if coronavirus prompts Olympics cancelation,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Global insurers face a hefty bill if the coronavirus forces the cancellation of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with estimates of the cost of insuring the sporting showpiece running into billions of dollars.
Japan has more than 200 cases of coronavirus, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and killed around 2,800, mostly in China. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has ordered numerous sporting events canceled as it tries to contain the epidemic, but has pledged the Olympics, in which Japan has invested some $12 billion, will go ahead as planned from July 24.
But fears persist that the Games may be postponed, moved or even called off, a decision International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Dick Pound was reported this week as saying would need to be taken by May.
Potential losses from cancelling an event will generally be higher the later a decision is made, said Adrian Thomas, a director at insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON).
""If they have to cancel 2-3 weeks before the event start-date, they have spent everything they have to spend. If you have three months to go before the event start-date, they have an opportunity to save some event costs,"" Thomas said.
IOC President Thomas Bach said on Thursday the Committee is ""fully committed"" to the Tokyo Games. 
The IOC takes out around $800 million of protection for each Summer Games, which covers most of the roughly $1 billion investment it makes in each host city. Insurance sources estimated it would pay a premium of about 2-3%, giving a bill of up to $24 million to insure the Tokyo event.
The policy will cover for setbacks ranging from war to natural disasters.
Easily spread diseases like coronavirus are often excluded from standard event cancellation insurance, but Alli MacLean of Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Corporate & Specialty in London said ""the majority of large event policyholders would purchase communicable disease coverage"". 
Allianz has agreed with the IOC to insure the Olympics from 2021 to 2028 but its CEO said last week the German insurance giant had no exposure to the Tokyo Games.
Local organizers, Olympics sponsors, merchandizers, hoteliers, car hire companies and travel firms also typically buy insurance, though it may not cover their full costs.
Munich Re board member Torsten Jeworrek said on Friday it was a provider of cancellation insurance for Tokyo, for an amount in the hundreds of millions of euros.
He would not say whether the figure was more or less than its 250 million euro exposure to the 2018 Winter Olympics or if the policy covered coronavirus, citing confidentiality.
Jefferies analysts estimate the insured cost of the 2020 Olympics at $2 billion, including TV rights and sponsorship, plus $600 million for hospitality.
Insurance sources say policies for most major sporting events are underwritten by Lloyd's of London or the broader London commercial insurance market.
Lloyd's insurer Beazley said in an infographic that event cancellation insurance for the 2014 and 2018 soccer World Cups covered potential losses of $1.25-1.5 billion.
Beazley and Tokio Marine Kiln (TMK) are among Lloyd's insurers to have insured or reinsured the Olympics in the past.

TMK declined to comment. Beazley did not respond to request for comment.

Coronavirus, which started in China and has since spread around the world, has killed almost 2,800 people and tens of thousands of people are infected. World share markets have crashed.
""In the past weeks, trade volumes have weakened, not only on the inbound and outbound China trade lanes but also in countries of Asia; constraints on industrial production are increasingly expected also outside of China,"" the company said in the statement.
Citing global economic uncertainties, Deutsche Post said it would no longer pursue exploratory talks on possible partners for Streetscooter, its electric van business.
It predicted that decision would lead to one-off charges of 300-400 million euros for this financial year.
Regarding its 2020 guidance for group EBIT of more than 5 billion euros, it said this was ""as of now excluding any still to be quantified effect induced by Corona implications, as well as the above mentioned charges related to the decision on StreetScooter.""
It said its forecast for group EBIT of a minimum of 5.3 billion euros in 2022 was not affected.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Retailers in Hong Kong have launched themselves into a rare battle with the city's notoriously unflinching landlords for deeper and longer-term rental cuts, as they reel from the double whammy of the coronavirus epidemic and months of political unrest.
Given the pressures, retailers are pushing to temporarily lower their rents in leases that are structured around a minimum fixed charge called base rent, or a percentage of store sales known as turnover rent, whichever is the higher amount.
Hong Kong's economy contracted for the first time in a decade in 2019 after anti-government protests scared tourists away and emptied shops and restaurants. Now, many retailers fear the coronavirus crisis is threatening their survival.
Last week, around 50 brands took part in an unprecedented strike, shutting 200 shops across prime shopping malls for a day to demand their landlords reduce rent. Now they're staging a second strike.
The striking retailers want base rent to be waived and only turnover rent to be charged, as foot traffic has dropped dramatically in recent weeks. Commercial leases vary across sectors and locations but these retailers are mostly on terms that pay either base rent or a percentage of turnover.
Mall landlords -- major property developers, such as Henderson Land (HK:0012) and Sun Hung Kai Properties (HK:0016) -- have slashed February base rents and some have extended the cuts to March. But retailers say this is still too much to bear.
""A 50% reduction is obviously nice to have...but when you're not taking in enough to cover salaries, our main interest is to look after our staff, and of course to look after the long-term viability of our business,"" said Ashley Micklewright, president & CEO of Bluebell Group.
He said shifting to turnover rent would go a long way to solving retailers' problems.
Bluebell, an Asia distributor of over 150 global brands, participated in last week's strike. Other participants included Italian fashion wear Patrizia Pepe and shoe wear GEOX, French sportswear Lacoste, as well as high-end childrenswear brands Bon Point, I Pinco Pallino and Nicholas & Bears.
More brands will join a second strike, retailers told Reuters, with the aim to get landlords to charge just turnover rent until health measures such as the school suspension and a partial mainland China border closure are revoked.
Another group of retailers took out a full-page newspaper ad on Valentine's Day, urging developers to exempt February rent and charge tenants turnover rent between March and June. Before the protests began in mid-2019, Hong Kong had the highest turnover per square foot in Asia.
Industry sources say food and beverage contracts pay around 8-15% of sales, fashion 15-20%, jewellery and watches 3-8% and supermarkets 6-8%.
But landlords are naturally resisting the proposal to charge turnover rent as retailers' sales plummet.
Micklewright said his shops make 15% of normal turnover, while some peers made no sales at all for more than two weeks.
DO BIG BRANDS NEED HELP? 
Many retailers have closed stores, cut staff and salaries to ride out the storm. Rental costs vary but can account for as much as half of a store's sales in some cases. 
Analysts say vacancy rates will rise this year, with Wharf REIC (HK:1997) and Hang Lung Properties (HK:0101) among the most affected due to heavier reliance on rental incomes. 
Hysan Development (HK:0014), whose retail and office businesses each make up for 46% of revenues, said its mall turnover fell 20% on-year in January and that it will take measures to retain tenants.
Three developer sources told Reuters they are reviewing rents and have so far offered concessions mainly to small- and medium-sized businesses.
Some developers, however, are adamant they don't need to help international brands.
""For the international big brands...it's like a billionaire asking a millionaire for help,"" said one developer representative, who did not want to be named as negotiations are private.
Louis Vuitton has agreed to renew its prime location lease in Times Square (NYSE:SQ), after weeks of negotiation with the landlord, two sources told Reuters. The luxury brand was reported in early January to likely close the store due to high rent. 
Times Square declined to comment while LVMH could not be immediately reached.
Prada and smaller shops have left nearby high-end Russell Street and new leases are expected to be 30-50% below the previous ones from three-to-five years ago, property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield told Reuters.
Micklewright said 90% of the brands are looking to reduce their presence in Hong Kong, but very few are looking to leave for good. 

""There's enough people in Hong Kong who have enough spending power to justify nearly all of the brands that we're talking to maintain a presence here. The only reason that they would move out would be because rents are too high,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - - The  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE) said on Friday it would complete its $27 billion takeover of analytics company Refinitiv on time this year as it reported a rise in annual income driven by a jump in clearing activity.
The exchange's chief executive David Schwimmer also said it was too early to assess the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on its global business, although like many companies it has imposed travel restrictions on some staff.
Constructive ""pre-notification"" discussions with European Union competition regulators regarding the purchase of Refinitiv are underway, with Schwimmer saying he expects to submit a formal application in March for approval.
There was nothing unexpected in the amount of time it was taking to obtain regulatory approval and detailed planning on integrating the two companies was underway, he added.
""We remain on track to close the transaction in the second half of this year,"" Schwimmer, the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) veteran who took the reins at the LSE in 2018, said.
Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), which owns Reuters News.
Schwimmer said it was premature to speculate whether the LSE may need to sell off parts of the group, such as the Milan Exchange, to win approval from Brussels. Rival Euronext has said it would be interested in bidding for it if so.
""With respect to Borsa Italiana, it has been an integral part of the business... and there is no expectation or intention that any of that should change,"" Schwimmer told reporters.
(Graphic: LSE Group grows as London keeps clearing crown - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/LSE-RESULTS/0H001R8DBC1S/eikon.png) 
The exchange said total income from continuing operations rose 8% to 2.314 billion pounds ($3.01 billion) in the year ended Dec. 31, narrowly beating the 2.308 billion pounds expected by 13 analysts in a company supplied estimate. Total revenue also rose 8% to 2.07 billion pounds. 
LSE shares were down 2.5% at 1003 GMT, but outperforming a 3.7% fall in the broader market (FTSE) on jitters about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy.
EURO CLEARING RESILENT
The exchange's post trade services unit, which includes clearer LCH and settlement and custody activities, reported a 15% rise in revenue.
Growth at LCH comes as rival Eurex in Frankfurt says uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union is helping it to attract more euro clearing from London.
LCH cleared swaps worth over a quadrillion dollars globally last year, though Schwimmer said he was aware there may be a ""modest amount"" of billions of euros moving to Frankfurt.
""We continue to see growth in volumes coming out of EU domiciled customers... and very strong market share in that business,"" Schwimmer said.
LCH will need EU permission to continue serving customers in the bloc from next January and Schwimmer said he expects to obtain this on a temporary or permanent basis this year.
Talks on a broader UK-EU free trade deal start next week amid recriminations from both sides.

Schwimmer also said the exchange expects its listings link to the Shanghai exchange ""to take a while to build"" up activity but it was in discussions with a number of companies.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (L:RR) has got to grips with a long-running engine problem and enjoyed a strong end to 2019, leaving it well placed to cope with any disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak, it said on Friday.
Shares in the British engines maker jumped as much as 6.6%, one of the few increases among European blue-chips, as the upbeat tone contrasted with the gloom gripping many other companies - including Rolls' airline customers - about the potential for coronavirus to trigger a global recession. 
Rolls has been battling to improve the durability of its Trent 1000 engine, which powers Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, with the blades in the TEN variant proving particularly problematic.
Airlines have had to ground the aircraft for repairs.
However, Chief Executive Warren East said on Friday the roll-out of fixes was progressing and he had increased confidence in a new blade design due next year. The number of aircraft on the ground for repair would fall to a single-digit by end of the second quarter, in line with forecasts, he said.
Rolls reported a 852 million pound ($1.1 billion) operating loss for 2019, largely due to a 1.4 billion pound charge for the Trent 1000. Excluding that charge, core underlying profit rose 25% to 810 million pounds.
Cash flow increased to 911 million pounds, led by higher profit and 173 million pounds worth of Trent 1000 insurance receipts.
East said Rolls delivered a record 510 widebody aircraft engines in the year and secured about two out of three orders for new widebody engines.
""Building on the strength of our performance into the end of 2019, we are looking forward to 2020 with some degree of conviction and confidence,"" he told reporters.
Shares in Rolls, which fell to a three-and-a-half year low on Thursday, were up 4% to 624.4 pence at 0945 GMT. 
'UNKNOWN UNKNOWN'
Rolls, which also has defense and power systems businesses, said the coronavirus outbreak was likely to hit air traffic growth, but long-term trends remained intact.
British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and Finnair said on Friday the virus would hurt their profits.
East said the situation was ""an unknown unknown"", and Rolls was not currently able to quantify any impact on its guidance.
However, he said all of the company's facilities were up and running, and its supply chain had not been disrupted, including from China, the source of the virus outbreak where suppliers were going back to work.
""Delivery of widebody engines continues as normal,"" he said, adding that in its power systems business trading in China was already returning to normal.
He said the disease would impact flying hours, noting that 20% of invoiced flying hours in 2019 touched greater China, but added the company would take measures such as cost controls to mitigate any hit.
""But we are confident given our performance in the second half of 2019, ... so we think we are better placed than ever to deal with a situation like this,"" East said.

Rolls currently expects core operating profit to grow by about 15% this year, with at least 1 billion pounds of free cash flow.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were in full-on capitulation mode in early trading on Friday amid growing fears that the coronavirus outbreak will develop into a full-blown pandemic that does lasting damage to the world economy.
By 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 600 index was down 14.9 points or 3.8% at 374.58 on course for its worst week since the financial crisis in 2008/9. In the last nine trading sessions since it peaked at 433.9, the Stoxx 600 has fallen nearly 14%.
The German DAX was down 4.3% and the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 3.7%, both following Wall Street’s extraordinary losses on Thursday but both also weighed down by warnings from index heavyweights about the impact of the virus on this year’s business.
International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways and Iberia, warned that it would cut capacity by as much as 2% this year in response to falling demand, while EasyJet warned that it faced a “significant softening of demand” on routes in and out of northern Italy, as well as other European countries. 
The news follows a spate of announcements from companies such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), L’Oreal (PA:OREP) and Nestle (SIX:NESN) all restricting business travel by staff.
IAG (LON:ICAG) stock fell 8.0%, while EasyJet stock fell sharply before recovering to be flat on the day. They’re on course for a weekly loss of 23% and 29%, respectively – although neither has been as hard hit as U.K. tour group Dart Group (LON:DTG), whose Jet2 customers have figured prominently in the lockdown of tourists in Tenerife. It’s down 40% this week.
In Germany, chemicals giant BASF (DE:BASFN), an important bellwether in that it sells a huge range of products to a diverse range of business sectors, warned that: “For 2020, we expect global economic uncertainty to be very high and that growth will be significantly depressed by the drop in demand and production outages in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.”
It added that it didn’t expect to earn its 9% cost of capital this year as a result.
“Basically, what matters now is whether consumer behavior is significantly affected,” said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Wealth Management, in a morning note. “We know that supply chains are disrupted, we know that Chinese domestic demand has been affected. What matters is whether U.S. and European consumers change demand as a result of the fear of the virus. The virus itself is not a concern, economically.”
Donovan noted that the virus is hitting the world economy at a time when the trade war between China and the U.S. had essentially neutered business investment as a source of growth, leaving private and government consumption as the only factors supporting expansion.
However, he observed that forecasts habitually underestimate “human resilience”, something that causes economic activity to rebound faster and more vigorously than expected."

FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Hyundai's (KS:005380) hydrogen-powered 18-tonne trucks are set to hit the roads in Switzerland next month as the South Korean automaker looks to establish a case for its zero-emissions technology in a low carbon world.
Invented nearly two centuries ago, hydrogen fuel cells first lost out to combustion engines and now trail electric batteries in the push for greener transport because they are expensive, hydrogen is hard to store, and most of it is extracted from natural gas in a process that produces carbon emissions.
But when it comes to trucks, Hyundai and its partners argue that electric batteries won't always do the job because the bigger the payload, the bigger - and heavier - the battery, and that's a problem for crawling up Swiss mountains.
And with more than half of Switzerland's energy coming from hydropower, the country has the potential to extract ""green"" hydrogen from water with electrolysis, an energy-intensive but carbon-free process if powered by renewable electricity.
""It is not enough to produce a truck. You have to take care of the entire ecosystem, find like-minded partners and show this all makes sense for the customer,"" said Mark Freymueller, chief executive of Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility (HHM). 
""It is possible to do this with a holistic approach and the right mindset,"" he told Reuters. To be sure, Switzerland's green hydrogen is far more expensive than diesel now but Hyundai hopes that as governments clamp down on carbon emissions and the cost of producing the clean fuel drops, the numbers could start to add up.
McKinsey & Co said in study in January that the cost of hydrogen made with renewable energy could drop to 2 euros/kg by 2030 from 3-4.5 euros now - achieving cost parity with diesel for heavy vehicles, once the relative efficiency of the power sources and the lifetime costs of a truck are factored in.
While hydrogen has long been vaunted as a potential alternative to fossil fuels, expectations that fuel cells will have a role to play as the world decarbonises has helped push hydrogen-linked stocks to their highest in over a decade.
NORWAY NEXT?
For now, Hyundai is relying on government tax breaks for fuel cell trucks and its own subsidizes to help make them economically viable for its partners: the end users, filling stations and green hydrogen suppliers.
Hyundai's H2 Xcient trucks have a 190 kilowatt fuel cell and seven high-pressure tanks holding nearly 35 kg of hydrogen, giving them a range of more than 400 km - far further than heavy goods vehicles powered by electric batteries on the market now.
Hyundai declined to say how much its subsidies will amount to. Globally, the company is betting heavily on hydrogen with plans to spend $6.7 billion on hydrogen technology by 2030 and to increase its annual capacity for fuel cells to 700,000.
It is starting out with 50 H2 Xcient trucks but plans to put 1,600 on Swiss roads by 2025 and is looking to launch similar projects in at least two more European countries this year, out of Austria, Germany, the Netherlands or Norway.
In Switzerland, HHM, the leasing unit set up by Hyundai and Swiss startup H2 energy, has partnered with Hydrospider, a joint venture of H2 Energy with industrial gas maker Linde (N:LIN) and Swiss power utility Alpiq (SG:ALP).
Hydrospider is about to start producing hydrogen for 40-50 Hyundai trucks at a 2 megawatt (MW) electrolysis plant at Goesgen. Stefan Linder, a member of Hydrospider's board of directors, said as more H2 trucks go into service it would have to boost capacity to 70 MW to 100 MW by 2023-2025.
In preparation for launching hydrogen trucks in Norway this year, H2 Energy has formed a partnership with Nel ASA (OL:NEL), Greenstat and Akershus Energi to supply green hydrogen. Hydropower provides Norway with nearly all its electricity.
SUBSIDISED MODEL
The Swiss H2 Mobility Association - a group of nearly 20 firms - will be the first users, including the country's biggest retailer Migros, dairy producer Emmi (S:EMMN), grocery chain Coop (S:BELL) and filling station operators SOCAR and Tamoil.
End users such as Migros have committed to leasing Hyundai's trucks on pay-per-use contracts which give them mileage, warranty, services, insurance and access to sufficient hydrogen. HHM says its contracts will ensure Hydrospider and filling stations get sensible margins from the start.
""We are not fooling ourselves, it is initially a subsidised business model,"" said HHM's Freymueller, adding that this would be the case for the introduction of any new technology. 
Over 10 years, an assumed investment of 1.3 million Swiss francs ($1.3 million) in a pump could be recovered if 15 trucks visited it exclusively for their annual fuelling needs, HHM estimates. Supermarket chain Migros is taking three Xcients and plans to measure their performance against a Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn) truck powered by an electric battery, three biogas-fuelled trucks from Italy's Iveco (MI:CNHI) - and diesel.
At the moment, Migros says it pays 50 million Swiss francs a year in heavy vehicle environmental duties (LSVA) levied on all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes using any roads in Switzerland. The Hyundai trucks will initially be exempt from LSVA. 
Rainer Deutschmann, director of corporate transportation logistics at Migros, which operates 900 trucks shuttling between 22 production sites and nearly 900 shops, told Reuters he expected several technologies to play a role in decarbonisation.
""We will see on each journey what the energy consumption will be depending on the geography and topology,"" he said.

""With an electric battery, instead of carrying merchandise around you are carrying around the battery. You have a 200 km range, which you can use for a city, but you cannot use it for the Alps,"" he said. ""H2 you can use for everything.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) said on Friday that coronavirus would hit its earnings this year but it wasn't sure by how much, becoming the latest airline to warn about the impact of the rapidly evolving outbreak.
Coronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has sent demand for travel plunging in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread around the world. Airlines are flying blind into a crisis of unknown severity and duration.
IAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year but said the uncertainty of the impact and duration of coronavirus meant it could not give accurate profit guidance at this stage.
""It's a rapidly changing situation,"" Chief Executive Willie Walsh told reporters on Friday. ""I wouldn't call it unprecedented. We have seen other challenges for the industry.""
British Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.
British budget airline easyJet (L:EZJ) also warned on Friday that it had seen ""significant"" softening of demand for travel to Italy and other European markets and would cancel flights and cut costs. Finland's Finnair (HE:FIA1S) also warned of a significant fall in profit.
STOCKS PLUNGE
The rapid spread of coronavirus has sent shockwaves through the global economy, hammering corporate supply chains, curbing travel, cancelling conferences and sporting events, and wiping tens of billions of pounds off financial markets.
Share prices were on track for their worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008 and IAG's is down 25% since the middle of January. On Friday it fell a further 8% to 474 pence.
The outbreak in Italy over the last week has brought new disruption to short-haul European travel but Walsh said IAG, with its strong balance sheet, was well-placed to withstand it.
""I'm very confident that we'll navigate our way through these challenges,"" said Walsh, overseeing his last quarterly results announcement before new boss Luis Gallego takes over on March 26.
Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska backed Walsh's thinking: ""We are also confident that a downturn would reveal the strength of the IAG model.""
IAG said it was cutting costs and implementing revenue initiatives, which included looking at all discretionary spending, to help it weather the storm. That's in line with moves by Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Amsterdam-based KLM which have both cut costs in recent days.
IAG said flight cancellations due to falling demand would hit its 2020 capacity growth though Walsh said it could start adding capacity if other airlines fail and that the group was in a strong position to benefit from any recovery.
The company also said its acquisition of Air Europa remained on track for completion later this year and was not affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
For 2019, IAG reported a 5.7% drop in operating profit to 3.285 billion euros, slightly ahead of a downgraded forecast of 3.27 billion euros it gave in September when it said a pilots strike would result in a 215 million euros hit."
833,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 04:22AM ET</span>",European Stocks Head for Worst Week Since 2008 on Virus Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- European equities tumbled on Friday and were poised for their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis as investors fretted about the potential hit to the global economy from the spreading coronavirus.
The STOXX 600 Index was down 3.5% by 8:04 a.m. London time. The travel and leisure sector slumped 5.3% as British Airways-owner IAG SA (LON:ICAG) said that the coronavirus made it impossible to predict earnings this year, and EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) said that it had seen a softening in demand and made plans to cancel flights. Elsewhere   Amadeus   IT Group SA (MC:AMA), which operates software for flight bookings, dropped 5% after saying that airline travel sales are slowing globally.
A sell-off across European equities has gathered pace this week as new cases of coronavirus infections continued outside of China, with California monitoring 8,400 people after they traveled to Asia. European stocks have fallen 12% since last week’s record high, and are set to post a 7.7% loss in February.
Chris Dyer, director of global equity at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance, said the sell-off has been broad-based and an unwinding of general risk, while at the same time individual companies are starting to quantify the virus.
“The next couple of weeks will be where analysts really start to try to get their head around what the impact is on shares and companies’ earnings for the course of this year,” Dyer said by phone. “That could, from our perspective, lead to some opportunities to add to some selected names.”"

A sudden jump in coronavirus cases outside China this week raised pandemic fears that led to panic-selling across global stock markets.
Global equities, which have lost nearly $6 trillion in value this week alone, were on track for their worst weekly loss since 2008.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",EasyJet to cancel flights as coronavirus hits demand,"LONDON (Reuters) - British budget airline easyJet (L:EZJ) said on Friday it would cancel flights and cut costs across its business after the coronavirus outbreak hit demand for travel to Italy and other European markets.
The short-haul airline, which operates predominantly in Europe, said it was too early to determine what the impact of the outbreak would be on its outlook for the current year nor its guidance for either the airline or its holidays business.
Its shares fell 4.6% in early trading, extending losses for the year to 26% and underperforming the broader market. 
EasyJet said it had seen a ""significant"" softening of demand into and out of its northern Italian bases and a reduction across its other European markets following the increased incidence of coronavirus.
As a result it will be cancelling some flights, particularly those into and out of Italy, while continuing to monitor the situation and adapting its flying program to support demand, the airline said.
Coronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has hit demand for travel around the world in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread.
Separately on Friday, British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) said coronavirus would hit earnings this year but the rapidly evolving nature of the outbreak meant it could not say by how much. Its shares were down 7%. 
EasyJet said it would look for cost savings across its business to help mitigate the impact of the virus.
""We continue to monitor the situation carefully and will update the market in due course,"" it said.
Budgets would be cut in administrative areas and discretionary spending while recruitment, promotion and pay would be frozen across its network.
All non-critical project and capital expenditure will be postponed, as will non-mandatory training, the airline said.

EasyJet also plans to work with suppliers to further reduce costs and will reallocate aircraft for summer 2020 to maximize revenue opportunities from any market recovery.

The pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) was on track to record its biggest weekly decline since the height of the global financial crisis in 2008.
The index entered correction levels on Thursday, a 10% decline from its recent peak, along with markets in the United States and Asia.
Four more countries reported the first cases of coronavirus, pushing the number of countries outside China, the source of the outbreak with infections, to 55.
The death toll in Italy, Europe's worst-hit country, rose to 17 and the number of people infected rose by more than 200 to 655.
Among the major sectors, miners (SXPP), travel & leisure stocks (SXTP) and technology (SX8P) were the biggest decliners, down between 3.8% and 4.1%"
838,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 03:37AM ET</span>",World Economy Faces Worst Year Since ‘09 as Virus Hopes Fade,"(Bloomberg) -- The world economy may be heading for its worst performance since the financial crisis more than a decade ago as the spread of the coronavirus increasingly dashes hopes of a swift rebound.
Just weeks since most economists bet the China-led slump would quickly reverse once the virus was contained, many are rethinking that optimism as swathes of Chinese factories stay shut and workers idled. Having already cut supply chains and undermined tourism and trade, outbreaks from Europe to the Americas threaten activity elsewhere too.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). economists warned clients on Thursday that they now expect 2.8% global growth this year, the weakest since 2009. They were already penciling in the softest growth in China since 1990, but now say the U.S. will expand the least in four years.“The risks are still skewed to the downside,” BofA economists led by Ethan Harris said in a report. “Our forecasts do not include a global pandemic that would basically shut down economic activity in many major cities.”
The outlook contrasts with that released by the International Monetary Fund just last Saturday, when it said it would likely knock only 0.1 percentage point from its global growth estimate of 3.3% for this year although it was studying more “dire” scenarios. Now the Washington-based fund is reconsidering the scale and scope of policy meetings it was scheduled to host in mid-April.As stocks plunge, companies are also sounding the alert.  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc on Thursday joined  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) in saying it would miss profit targets because of the virus.
“We remain sensitive to external conditions generally and recognize that these could as easily recover as worsen,” Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters said.
Eager for insight into China’s economy, investors are hotly anticipating the Saturday release of a key manufacturing gauge.The consensus in Bloomberg’s survey is for the official Purchasing Managers’ Index to slide to 45, the lowest since 2008, from January’s 50, with forecasts ranging from 50.1 to 33. That underscores the confusion surrounding the virus and how the reading could rock markets.
China still has a long recovery ahead. Bloomberg Economics calculates the economy ran at 60%-70% of normal this week, albeit up from 50%-60% a week ago. For now, key central banks are holding off cutting interest rates as they wait to see the full economic effect of the virus with rates already at or near record lows.
There’s also a debate over what further easing would achieve. If supply chains are broken, lower rates would likely do little to spur activity.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told the Financial Times on Thursday that it’s too soon to respond, echoing comments Tuesday from Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida.In a potential model for others, the Bank of Korea resisted demands to cut rates, preferring instead to target support for companies by making cheap loans easier to get.But economists are beginning to join investors in predicting the major central banks will eventually loosen policy. Those at Standard Chartered told clients on Wednesday that they now expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate in April and June having previously assumed no change this year.Money markets already see three Fed reductions this year -- starting in April -- and one by the ECB by October. In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh went as far as to suggest the Fed coordinate rate cuts with its counterparts in China, Europe and Japan.
“With global virus and related economic developments continuing to shift the baseline from a V-shaped to a U-shaped impact on activity with persistent impacts on both supply chains and global consumer demand we now update our base case to one in which the Fed will ease policy in response to the virus shock, and likely sooner rather than later,” Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI in Washington, wrote in a note.
Governments may also lend a hand. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. economists predict China, South Korea and Hong Kong will all ease fiscal policy.
Some economists aren’t ruling out a near-term rebound. Those at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a report on Friday that while the fallout may now run into the second quarter, they still predict that “the recovery is being delayed, but not derailed.”
Much ultimately depends on how the virus spreads and what economic pain it causes, reversing gains economists had hoped for after the interim U.S.-China trade deal. The economies of Japan, Italy and France already contracted in the fourth quarter, while U.S. government data on Thursday showed underlying demand in the economy was slower than initially reported in that period.A 2007 World Bank study estimated the cost of a mild flu pandemic at 0.7% of global gross domestic product, and 4.8% for a severe outbreak.“In 2020 money, that’s between $630 billion and $4.3 trillion -- or, to put it another way -- between painful but manageable and global recession,” Tom Orlik, chief economist at Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a note."
839,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>",California regulator proposes record $2.14 billion fine on PG&E over wildfires,"(Reuters) - California's utilities regulator has proposed an increased $2.14 billion fine on PG&E Corp for its role in causing the devastating 2017 and 2018 wildfires in Northern California.
The decision raises the penalty by $462 million and would be the largest ever imposed, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said. 
It would become final if PG&E agrees within 20 days, and will modify a multi-party settlement reached by the company with the CPUC and union representatives in December.
The new settlement also requires that potential tax savings in excess of $500 million be applied to the benefit of PG&E's customers, CPUC said.
PG&E did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment but told local outlet San Francisco Chronicle that it was ""disappointed"" by the decision. 
The San-Francisco based utility filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January last year, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from major wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018.
State fire investigators in May determined that PG&E transmission lines caused the deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record in California, the wind-driven Camp Fire that killed 85 people in and around the town of Paradise in 2018.
Earlier this month, the company proposed an updated reorganization plan, aimed at addressing concerns raised by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who criticized its previous plan for lacking major changes to governance and tougher safety enforcement mechanisms mandated under a recent state wildfire statute.
A U.S. bankruptcy judge in December approved PG&E's $13.5 billion settlement with victims of Californian wildfires.

The company needs to exit bankruptcy by June 30 to participate in a state-backed wildfire fund that would help reduce the threat to utilities from wildfires.

Shares of the automaker ended down more than 5% after the news, while the wider market (KS11) was down 3.3%. The closing dealt a fresh setback to Hyundai Motor, which has gradually resumed production at local plants hit by a Chinese parts shortage in the wake of the virus outbreak. 
South Korea has the most infected people outside China, affecting companies like Samsung and Hyundai. South Korea on Friday reported 256 new cases, bringing the total number of infected to 2,022, as the world prepared for a global recession. 
""The company has also placed colleagues who came in close contact with the infected employee in self-quarantine and taken steps to have them tested for possible infection,"" Hyundai Motor said in a news release.
The company added that it was disinfecting the factory. It did not say when production would resume.
Ulsan is less than an hour from Daegu, the epicenter of outbreak in Korea.
Hyundai operates five car factories in Ulsan, which has an annual production capacity of 1.4 million vehicles, or nearly 30% of Hyundai's global production. Hyundai employs 34,000 workers there in the world's biggest car complex. 
The factory that was shut down produces sport utility vehicles such as the Palisade, Tucson, Santa Fe and Genesis GV80.
A factory run by Hyundai supplier Seojin Industrial had been closed after the death of a virus-infected worker there. It reopened Wednesday. 
South Korea's tech giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) shut down a phone factory in the southeastern city of Gumi over the past weekend after one of its workers tested positive. It resumed production on Monday.
Meanwhile, South Korea's top carrier,  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490), said on Friday it would cut the number of flights to the United States in March, as part of a plan to cut its global capacity by 11% that month. 
It plans to check temperatures of passengers traveling to the United States before boarding and said it would not allow anyone with a temperature higher than 37.5 Celsius to fly.

One of its flight attendants who served the Incheon to LA route has tested positive for virus.

842,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 02:26AM ET</span>",China Makes Bad Loans Disappear as Virus Pummels Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese banks are taking extraordinary measures to avoid recognizing bad loans, seeking to shield themselves and cash-strapped borrowers from the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak.
Some of the measures, which include rolling over loans to companies at risk of missing payment deadlines and relaxing guidelines on how to categorize overdue debt, have the explicit approval of regulators in Beijing. Some lenders are also refraining from reporting delinquencies to the country’s centralized credit-scoring system and allowing borrowers to skip interest payments for as long as six months, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing internal decisions.
The moves will buy time for both Chinese companies and the nation’s $41 trillion banking industry, after the outbreak brought much of the world’s second-largest economy to a standstill. But they’re also fueling concern about a buildup of hidden risks on lenders’ balance sheets. Some analysts worry that China is reversing a multi-year push to increase the transparency of its financial system and undermining the long-term health of banks.
“This will provide breathing space,” said Harry Hu, a credit analyst at S&P Global Ratings. “It will also likely undermine standards, making some Chinese banks less creditworthy in the long run.”
Earlier this month, S&P said a prolonged health emergency could cause China’s non-performing loan ratio to more than triple to about 6.3%, amounting to an increase of 5.6 trillion yuan ($800 billion) in bad debt.
The push by banks and regulators to tamp down NPLs is part of a broader effort by President Xi Jinping’s government to shore up the Chinese economy, which some forecasters say may suffer a rare quarter-on-quarter contraction in the first three months of this year. In addition to pumping billions of yuan into the banking system to make it easier for lenders to extend credit, authorities have cut interest rates, reduced taxes and pledged to adopt more “proactive” fiscal policies.
Shares of Chinese banks continued to under-performer the benchmark index this year in Hong Kong. The four biggest state-owned banks are trading at an average 0.5 times their estimated book value for this year, near the record low.
The NPL measures mark an abrupt shift in China’s approach toward financial regulation. Authorities in Beijing have spent the past three years trying to instill more discipline in the banking system and develop credit markets that more accurately price risk. As part of that effort, they’ve encouraged banks to be more diligent when accounting for bad loans.
The outbreak has changed the government’s priorities. In a press conference this week, Ye Yanfei, an official at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said policy makers need to be more tolerant when it comes to bad loans. “Saving corporates now is saving banks themselves,” Ye said.
China isn’t the only country to have relaxed accounting standards for banks during a crisis. In April 2009, during the depths of the global recession, mark-to-market rules in the U.S. were eased after banks complained that they resulted in bigger-than-warranted writedowns on thinly traded mortgage securities. While critics of the decision said it reduced transparency, it arguably helped big American lenders recover more quickly from the crisis.
China’s ability to control the pace of NPLs during economic shocks is an advantage of its centralized financial system, according to Leland Miller, the chief executive officer of China Beige Book.
“When you have a party that controls all the counterparties in the economy -- you have state banks loaning to state enterprises and you have state banks loaning to small- and medium-sized enterprises -- you can tell them to lend,” Miller said in an interview on Money Undercover with Bloomberg TV’s Lisa Abramowicz. “You never have to freeze up liquidity in the same way that a commercial financial system would work.”
Yet even if China’s banks turn on the credit taps, lots of businesses may struggle to secure the funding they need to stay afloat.
A survey of small- and medium-sized Chinese companies conducted this month showed that a third of respondents only had enough cash to cover fixed expenses for a month, with another third running out within two months. About two-thirds of the country’s 80 million small businesses, including many mom-and-pop shops, lacked access to loans as of 2018, according to China’s National Institution for Finance & Development.
It remains to be seen whether the benefits of delaying NPLs will outweigh the costs. Much depends on how quickly Chinese authorities can contain the outbreak and get the country back to work. In the week to Feb. 21, the economy was likely running at 50%-60% capacity, according to Bloomberg Economics.
A sharp recovery in coming months would likely ease concerns that banks are obscuring the true health of their balance sheets. “If they can tide the virus over, then the delinquent loans will disappear,” said Zhang Shuaishuai, a banking analyst at China International Capital Corp.
But that’s far from a given. S&P analysts see scope for caution, saying last week that it may take years for the industry to revert to normal standards for recognizing NPLs and that some banks may see their long-term health suffer as a result."

Investing.com - China’s internet search leader Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) said its revenue may slide as much as 13% in the March quarter due to the uncertain impact of the coronavirus. 
 
Sales may drop to between 21 billion yuan ($3 billion) and 22.9 billion yuan, the company said overnight. That compared with the estimated projection of 23.4 billion yuan. 
“The novel coronavirus situation in China is evolving, and business visibility is very limited,” said Herman Yu, Baidu’s chief financial officer. “Most shops, restaurants and malls across China were closed down, and many remain closed down as we speak, so consequently the rebound for online marketing after the Chinese new year has been slow this year,” Yu said, but added that the situation in the country had improved in the past two weeks.
Founder and Chief Executive Officer Robin Li said it would take time for Baidu to recover. 
“The return of economic growth will be a long-term issue after the epidemic, but many new opportunities are emerging,” Li told employees in an internal memo that is cited by Bloomberg. 
Baidu’s share prices rallied earlier this year after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the December quarter. The gains were mostly wiped out, however, since the coronavirus outbreak triggered a broader selloff of Chinese stocks. "

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti cashed in less money in 2019 as the bank made pay concessions related to a French tax case and missed earnings goals during his last full year as CEO. 
Ermotti, who is due to be replaced by ING (AS:INGA) head Ralph Hamers in November, was awarded a total 12.5 million Swiss francs ($12.8 million) in salary and bonus for 2019, down from 14.1 million francs the year before, the Swiss bank's annual report showed on Friday.
UBS also unveiled an amended executive bonus system, incorporating metrics related to the French tax case which last year sparked shareholder ire, as well as shareholder and capital returns.
Performance awards for Ermotti and other executives were down 14% per head. New wealth management co-head Iqbal Khan got 8.2 million francs.
""In addition to underlying performance, the board of directors also considered other factors, including the impact of the French cross-border matter on the firm and the resulting share price development"" in determining Ermotti's pay, the bank said. 
UBS came under fire over a conviction in France for helping wealthy clients evade taxes, with shareholders refusing to endorse the performance of the bank's leadership and proxy advisers criticising management pay. 
UBS denies wrongdoing and is appealing against the ruling that it pay 4.5 billion euros in penalties. A retrial at an appellate court is set for June.
UBS on Friday said 1.5 million francs of Ermotti's 2019 bonus was ""entirely at risk and subject to forfeiture"" based on the final cost associated with resolving the French case.
It also said to achieve maximum payout of bonuses at senior levels, the group would need to achieve a three-year average return on CET1 capital of 18% and for total shareholder return to outperform a peer index by 25 percentage points over a three-year period.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Indonesia's Lion Air has deferred plans for an initial public offering (IPO) due to a sharp fall in global stock markets, people close to the matter said on Friday, as the spreading coronavirus sparks worries of a global pandemic.
A decision on the up to $500 million IPO of one of Asia's largest budget airlines was expected by the end of February after banks completed investor presentations in global financial centers earlier this month.
Two people said Lion Air, which was set to launch the IPO as early as March, would consider a float only when markets stabilized. The people declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
Lion Air had no immediate response to a Reuters request for comment. The carrier has toyed with an IPO for about five years.
This week, global share prices plunged on fears of sustained global economic impact as the coronavirus spreads beyond China, with about 12 countries reporting their first virus cases in the past 24 hours.
Airlines have slashed capacity due to weak demand as virus-related disruption to international travel batters the sector.
Lion Air is part of the Lion Air Group, which has airline joint ventures in Malaysia and Thailand, aircraft maintenance facilities and a freight business.
The pre-marketing for the IPO included a combination of face-to-face meetings and phone calls because travel was restricted owing to the coronavirus, the people said.  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), one of two international banks on the deal, declined comment. There was no immediate comment from the second bank,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
Reuters has reported that the spread of the coronavirus has put key meetings and roadshows on hold and several auctions of Asian assets were facing delays or reassessment.
Lion Air, which has 112 planes, planned to use proceeds from the IPO to fund longer-term leases more akin to owning planes, as well as general operations. It has large outstanding orders for new jets from both Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR).
The carrier, which vies with state-run airline PT Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA) for dominance in its home market, has been seeking to win over investors for more than a year since the fatal crash of one of its Boeing 737 MAX jets in 2018."

Trading was halted on the TSX as well as the TSX Alpha and TSX-Venture exchanges, after an issue caused problems with entering, modifying or canceling open orders on the former two, TMX said on Twitter.
""This is a black eye for Canadian capital markets again. ... Even if people could potentially still trade on our marketplace or another one in Canada, they have no visibility on prices,"" said Jos Schmitt, chief executive of smaller rival NEO Exchange. ""This feels like a capacity issue. We saw, over the last couple of days, flows going up dramatically.""
In a statement late on Thursday, the stock exchange operator blamed a system capacity issue within the messaging technology component of its trading engine for the outage, adding that the incident was not the result of a cyber attack.
The company said measures had been taken to mitigate the risk of recurrence and that all systems were ready for the start of business on Friday.
Concerns over the global spread of the coronavirus outbreak have led to a surge in market activity as many investors fled to safer assets. About 55.98 million shares changed hands on Thursday, compared with 33.89 million the same day last year.
Before Thursday's halt, the benchmark Toronto stock index (GSPTSE) was down about 2%, heading for its fifth day of losses, and on track for its lowest close since November.
More than an hour after the original tweet, TMX said the halt would remain in effect for the remainder of the day on all three platforms. It apologized to users for the inconvenience.
Last month, TMX said its chief financial officer, John McKenzie, would become interim chief executive while the company sought a permanent replacement to Lou Eccleston, who had been at the helm since November 2014.
A failure of data storage equipment linked to both primary and redundant systems caused an outage in April 2018, causing back-up measures to fail to engage. TMX said then https://reut.rs/3ccSRXq that it had taken steps to fix the problem.
""I said in 2018 we're living in the dark ages,"" NEO's Schmitt said. ""In 2020, we're still living in the dark ages."""
849,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 12:48AM ET</span>",Stocks plunge on coronavirus fears even as U.S. ramps up fight against spread,"By Sinéad Carew and Ted Hesson
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plummeted on Thursday as fears about the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on economic growth flared even as U.S. officials pledged that they were stepping up efforts to safeguard Americans from the virus' spread.
A day after President Donald Trump told Americans that the risk from coronavirus remained ""very low,"" the S&P 500 (SPX) logged its fastest drop of at least 10% in history in a sixth straight day of declines. The broad market average has lost 12% since hitting a record close on Feb. 19.
The Dow (DJI) has fallen as much as 12.9% and the Nasdaq (IXIC) has lost as much as 13%.
Two U.S. officials told Reuters the Trump administration was considering invoking special powers to rapidly expand domestic production of protective masks and clothing to help combat the coronavirus in the United States.
During an interagency call on Wednesday, officials from Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) discussed the possibility of invoking the Defense Production Act for the manufacture of ""personal protective equipment"" that can be worn by healthcare workers to prevent infection, according to a DHS official.
A White House official confirmed that the administration was exploring the use of the law to spur manufacturing of protective gear. Both officials requested anonymity to discuss the issue. 
Amid a flurry of sometimes contradictory messages from Washington, HHS Secretary Alex Azar late on Thursday proclaimed that ""everyday Americans don't need to be worried"" about coronavirus. He was quick to add, ""But that can change.""
During a White House ceremony celebrating Black History Month, Trump countered congressional Democrats' charges that administration preparations were lagging. ""Fortunately we made the early moves,"" Trump said. ""It's working out very professionally. We're doing a tremendous job.""
Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told lawmakers the agency revised its criteria for who should be tested for the coronavirus and was shipping more test kits to states.
Redfield also said CDC is investigating how long this virus can survive on surfaces, remaining infectious.
California only has about 200 test kits, an ""inadequate"" number, but has been in ""constant contact with federal agencies"" who have promised to send a fresh supply in coming days, Governor Gavin Newsom told a news briefing earlier. 
Quick confirmation of coronavirus cases is crucial to rapid response by local health authorities, and states previously reported that some test kits provided by CDC were producing inconclusive results.
Azar told a House of Representatives committee on Thursday that at least 40 public health labs should now be able to test specimens for coronavirus and that could more than double as soon as Friday. 
Some state and local public health workers have expressed doubts about how quickly the country will be able to scale up its testing capability, however.
Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), said his group had worked with the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration to develop a way to quickly increase testing capacity but these tests will still have to be validated by states, which could take several days. 
""If quality control goes well as expected by the end of next week, upwards of 40 labs will have testing capabilities in addition to the 12 we have,"" Becker told Reuters. 
The number of confirmed U.S. cases is still relatively small at 60, most of them repatriated American passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan.
POLITICS
Funding to combat the health crisis has become a political issue in an election year. Trump, a Republican, is seeking $2.5 billion from Congress to boost the government's response. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called for $8.5 billion.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said he hoped a bipartisan effort could produce a deal on funding within the next two weeks.
China, where the coronavirus started, has borne the brunt of the outbreak, recording nearly 80,000 infections and more than 2,700 deaths. The virus has spread to another 44 countries, where around 3,500 cases and 54 deaths have been reported. 
But with new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even rich nations should prepare for surprises.
""No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,"" Tedros said.
Various treatments are being tested for the virus, which can lead to pneumonia, but a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said.
Trump has been increasingly alarmed by market reaction, which he considers a barometer of the economy's health and sees as important to his re-election in November.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 12:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Aluminum smelter resurrected on Trump tariffs may close as losses mount,"By Tim McLaughlin
MARSTON, Missouri (Reuters) - A bankrupt aluminum smelter that re-opened in 2018, after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on imported metals, is losing money at such a rapid clip that it could close within 60 days, the top executive at the Missouri plant said on Thursday.
Trump's trade policies protect the generic aluminum product made by Magnitude 7 Metals LLC, a 50-year-old smelter on the banks of the Mississippi in southeastern Missouri. But the tariffs often do not cover the value-added aluminum products being shipped to the Unites States by foreign competitors, undercutting the company's position.
""The rest of the world has gamed the tariffs, in our opinion,"" Magnitude 7 Metals chief executive Charles Reali told Reuters in an interview. ""The Commerce Department tried to help, but missed the mark.""
The grim outlook for Magnitude 7 has been exacerbated by the coronavirus, which is reverberating around the globe while raising fears of a global recession. On Friday, the London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminum price fell to $1,676 per ton, the lowest since October 2016.
""We are in prayer"" mode, Reali said. ""If things don't turn around in the next 60 days, I don't know.""
Magnitude 7 Metals opened to great fanfare about two years ago in a ceremony attended by then-Missouri Governor Eric Greitens. Trump's 10% tariffs on imported aluminum helped restore more than 400 jobs in New Madrid County, where nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty. The plant shut down in 2016 when the previous owner, Noranda Aluminum, filed for bankruptcy.
But Reali describes the market for the plant's generic aluminum product, P1020, as ""absolutely terrible.""
""These prices are 1988 and 1989 prices, dollar for dollar. Obviously, the costs are a hell of a lot more today than they were then,"" Reali said.
Magnitude 7's aluminum fetches about $1,680 a ton on the metals market, down from about $2,100 a ton a year ago, Reali said. The original business plan, when former  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN) trader Matt Lucke bought the plant for about $14 million out of bankruptcy, factored in a price of $2,300 to $2,400 per ton.
""We can't sustain what we are doing at the current price,"" Reali said. ""Our costs are much higher. We're seeing red numbers every month.""
The plant employs 515 workers. In a settlement last year with the National Labor Relations Board, Magnitude 7 agreed to recognize union workers. But there's no collective bargaining agreement, and federal law prohibits the company from laying off hourly workers during contract negotiations, limiting the plant's flexibility, Reali said.
The last time the aluminum plant closed, it was a body blow to the economy and to the county's morale. Local police and ambulance budgets were cut. The county went into the red and the school district saw a 10% drop in enrollments as families left, local officials told Reuters.
""We're here today,"" Reali said. ""Can't speak for next week. It's a day-to-day thing."""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prudential and corporate regulators are checking the contingency plans of banks and other financial institutions to prepare for a potential coronavirus pandemic which could severely disrupt economic and financial systems.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday there was every sign the world was about to be gripped by a pandemic of coronavirus, and Canberra triggered emergency measures to restrain the spread of the disease.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) said it had contacted the banks, pension funds and insurers that it oversees to make sure they had adequate plans in place.
""APRA is also liaising with entities to gain a deeper understanding of current or potential future impacts on their businesses related to coronavirus, as we continue to monitor developments,"" the regulator said in a statement.
Banks have been in talks with APRA for much of February as outbreak spread around the world from China, two people familiar with the talks said.
A spokesman for Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia's second largest bank, said it had assured the regulator it had ""a pandemic plan that meets the expectations"", including ""business continuity plans and risk mitigation strategies"". The bank has barred travel to China for business purposes.
A spokesman for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) said the bank was planning to ""ensure the safety of ANZ staff and to enable banking services to be continued as far as is practicable.""
""In the regions ANZ operates that are most-impacted by COVID-19, such as China, that plan includes teams being split and working in alternate locations to prevent potential spread.""
ANZ also restricted travelling internationally to contain any potential spread of the virus, the spokesman added.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), the country's largest, said it had been following the advice from the government to help the country deal with the ongoing impact of the outbreak.
A National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) spokeswoman said the bank had plans in place ""to respond to coronavirus (COVID-19)"" without specifying what those plans were.
""NAB bankers are also providing assistance and advice to business customers who have been financially affected,"" she added in an emailed statement.
The chair of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) told a parliamentary committee ""significant market participants"" had been contacted to check on their business continuity plans, and the watchdog was monitoring market disclosures of listed firms.
Deloitte Access Economics estimated the coronavirus could cost the Australian economy up to A$5.9 billion ($3.9 billion) in the first half of the year as measures to combat the rapid global spread hit the major export sectors of education, tourism and mining."

The memo signed by Trump on Thursday said 94.4 percent of titanium sponge imported into the United States in 2018 came from Japan. The United States has ""an important security relationship with Japan,"" it added.
Trump agreed with a Commerce Department recommendation that rather than curbs, the United States would seek to open talks with Japan on measures to ensure access to titanium sponge in emergencies.
Trump also directed the defense secretary to take measures to increase access to the material and support domestic production to meet national defense requirements.
The Commerce Department launched its investigation of the national security implications of titanium sponge imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
The department has used the law to investigate, among other things, imports of steel and aluminum from Canada, the European Union and Mexico.
Titanium sponge is a porous form of titanium resulting from the first stage of processing the metal for use in aerospace, electronics, architecture and sports gear.
Titanium is also used in infrastructure and commercial products including civilian aircraft, chemical plants, oil and gas plants, electric power and desalination plants, building structures, automobile products and biomedical devices.

Imports accounted for 68 percent of U.S. titanium sponge consumption in 2018, the Commerce Department said.

Investing.com - Stocks in Asia plunged on Friday morning, with most major indices slumping around 3% amid fears about the spread of the coronavirus globally. 
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component plunged 3.4% and 4.4% respectively by 10:55 PM ET (03:55 GMT). 
The Hang Seng Index traded 2.4% lower after data showed Hong Kong’s private home prices fell for the second straight month in January.
Prices fell a revised 1.6% in December. January prices were 4.7% lower than the peak in May 2019, according to the data released today. 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 3.8%. While not a directional driver today, official data on Friday showed the country’s factory output rose 0.8% in January from the previous month, compared to the expected 0.2% gain and a downwardly revised 1.2% rise in the previous month.
South Korea’s KOSPI slid 2.8%. 
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 lost 3.0%. 
Global shares are now on course for the worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, down more than 10% this month’s peak after the World Health Organization said Thursday that the coronavirus outbreak has the potential to become a pandemic and is at a decisive stage.
Overnight, U.S. stocks closed lower again after California’s governor Gavin Newsom said the state is monitoring 8,400 people for signs of exposure.
Just a day earlier, the CDC confirmed the first infection to a patient in California who did not have “relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient,” stoking fears health authorities would struggle to contain the outbreak.
The S&P 500 closed down 4.4%, while the Dow Jones slumped 4.4% and Nasdaq plunged 4.6%.
Despite the news, President Donald Trump said his administration has done an “incredible job” preventing the spread of coronavirus, pointing out the U.S. has 15 people who contracted the virus “instead of thousands of people.”"

The former leader of the Renault (PA:REN)-Nissan automaking alliance made a sensational year-end escape from Japan, where he faces trial for financial crimes. He denies the charges.
Ghosn said he fled to his childhood home of Lebanon to clear his name. Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan.

Wells Fargo Clearing Services and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network failed to supervise investment advisers who recommended single-inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The advisers recommended the investments to customers with conservative or moderate risk tolerances, including senior citizens and retirees, the SEC said in a filing.
The order comes just a week after Wells Fargo & Co agreed to a $3 billion deal with the regulator and the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve criminal charges over its fake-accounts scandal.
Wells Fargo did not admit or deny the SEC's findings from Thursday's order. The $35 million will be distributed to certain people who received the recommendations and suffered losses, the SEC said. 
When asked to comment on the settlement or charges, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Advisors said the firm no longer sells the products in the full-service brokerage.
""Firms must maintain effective compliance and supervisory programs to ensure that the securities they recommend are suitable for their clients,"" Antonia Chion, associate director of the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement.
The firm's policies were not ""reasonably designed"" to prevent and detect unsuitable recommendations of single-inverse ETFs from April 2012 to September 2019, the SEC said. The recommendations came after Wells Fargo received notice from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority warning on sales practices for the risky products.

FINRA's 2009 notice said that single-inverse ETFs were ""not suitable for retail clients who plan to hold them for more than one trading session, particularly in volatile markets,"" according to the order.

857,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 08:16PM ET</span>","Global funds cut equity exposure in turbulent February, eye virus risk: Reuters poll","By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds changed course in February and recommended a cut to equity allocations in their model balanced portfolio after taking them to a two-year high in January, instead suggesting an increase in bond holdings, Reuters polls showed.
The findings come as major indexes on Wall Street look set for their steepest weekly plunge since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, as rising numbers of new coronavirus infections outside China increase fears of a pandemic.
""At present we feel it is appropriate to err on the side of caution until the scale and impact of the virus, and the longer-term economic implications, are slightly better understood and quantifiable than they are today,"" said Mark Robinson, chief investment officer at Bordier & Cie UK.
The monthly poll of 38 wealth managers and CIOs in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan, taken Feb. 11-27, showed equity exposure fell on average to 49.1% in a global balanced portfolio, from 49.7% in January, which was a two-year high.
Bond allocations were increased to 41.4% on average from 40.3%.
""Clearly, any further escalation and a rise in the fatality rates (from the coronavirus) will create further worries for the global authorities and the markets,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum in London.
U.S. Treasury yields fell to record lows this week, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note reaching an all-time low for the third consecutive day, on bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to help soften the expected blow to the world's largest economy from the virus' disruptions.
""With the likelihood that the Fed will cut interest rates further over the coming months if the coronavirus were to spread further, or worse still, become an epidemic, the security of the U.S. Treasury market remains appealing,"" added Lowman.
When asked what is the likely change to their portfolio over the next six months, a strong majority of fund managers said at best they would maintain the current risk positioning or they would reduce exposure to riskier assets.
That suggests fund managers are not confident about a significant lift-off in stocks over the coming months despite widespread expectations of monetary policy easing.
The economic hit from the virus is not going to help. A separate Reuters poll of economists showed major economies in Asia would slow down significantly, stall or shrink outright in the current quarter.
""The coronavirus outbreak remains our top near-term concern for global growth and the markets. The immediate impact appears to be concentrated in Asia, but all governments are taking the threats very seriously and are taking steps to contain the spread of the virus,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management.
""Our most likely scenario is that the virus will continue to weigh on the markets for the next several months, but that it will not induce a global recession.""
A separate Reuters poll of analysts, brokers and strategists on Thursday showed that while global stocks have further to run this year, the severity of the economic hit from the coronavirus outbreak was the biggest risk and gains would be much weaker than last year. [EPOLL/WRAP]

Investing.com - The market is reeling from the coronavirus headlines and that is expected to continue tomorrow.
Along with that, there will be consumer data, retail earnings and reaction from Thursday’s postmarket movers.
Here are three things that could move markets tomorrow.
1. Personal Income, Spending Seen Rising
Consumer data arrives from Commerce Department at 8:30 AM ET (13:50 GMT) tomorrow.
January personal spending is expected to have risen 0.3%, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Personal income is expected to have risen 0.3% as well.
Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which exclude food and energy, are forecast to have risen 0.2% in January to an annual rate of 1.7%. That’s the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge.
2.   Foot Locker   (NYSE:FL) at the Starting Line
As earnings season winds down, athleticwear retailer  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) will report quarterly results.
Analysts expect that  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) will report a profit of $1.59 per share and sales of $2.25 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Last month, Telsey Advisory Group downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform, also lowering the price target to $42 per share from $50.
“While the stock trades at a low P/E multiple of 7.3x 2020 consensus EPS -- a discount to the average of 9.1x in the past year -- it lacks a near-term catalyst to drive the shares materially higher,” the research firm said.
3. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Fails to Meet Expectations
While eyes will be on the overall futures, individual stocks look shaky in postmarket trading.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), up 40% so far this year, plunged after reporting an unexpected loss after the bell.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) reported a fourth-quarter loss of $0.01 per share, missing expectations for earnings of $0.01 per share, while revenue of $98.5 million topped Wall Street estimates for $81.5 million.

The government unexpectedly began relaxing foreign exchange and price controls in late 2018. That prompted a rise in transactions in dollars and euros that had been banned for more than 15 years, as Venezuelans increasingly lost faith in the local bolivar currency amid hyperinflation and recession.
Maduro himself has called those transactions an ""escape valve"" amid U.S. sanctions on state oil company PDVSA, the OPEC nation's cash cow.
The sanctions are aimed at cutting off cash flow to Maduro, whom Washington calls a corrupt dictator who is usurping power after rigging a 2018 election. Maduro has defended the legitimacy of the vote and argues that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to overthrow him to seize control of Venezuela's oil.
Over 50% of goods are now sold in hard currency in Venezuela's major cities, according to local consultancy Ecoanalitica.
The shifting policies and rhetoric from the government have prompted some companies, including rum distiller  Ron Santa Teresa  (CR:RST), to offer shares in local currency in the hopes of economic liberalization similar to that of China and the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Entrepreneurs have told Reuters they planned to lobby the government to allow share issues in hard currency.
The new rule by the National Securities Agency, which has not yet been published but was seen by Reuters on Thursday, said it would allow ""the public offer of securities issued by the private sector in foreign currency.""
Venezuela's Information Ministry, which handles media requests on behalf of the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The change provides an alternative for financing for Venezuela's beleaguered corporate sector, given sky-high interest rates from the country's banks amid hyperinflation.
Javier Riccobono, chief executive officer of soft drinks bottler Coca Cola Femsa de Venezuela, told reporters on Thursday said he was encouraged by the shift but that it would depend on the financing costs. He said the company was planning to issue debt in bolivars soon.
""Our focus is on having all the options open,"" Riccobono said. ""If we have access to an issuance in foreign currency, we would give it a good look."""

Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) reported a fourth-quarter loss of $0.01 per share, missing expectations for earnings of $0.01 per share, while revenue of $98.5 million topped Wall Street estimates for $81.5 million.
Shares fell 10% in postmarket trading.
The beat on the bottom line was supported by increased sales of its plant-based products to new partners secured during the year. 
""Growth in net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to an increase in volume sold in Beyond Meat’s 'Fresh' platform products across retail, and restaurant and foodservice channels,"" the company said. ""Growth in volume sold was driven by increased sales to international customers, expansion in the number of points of distribution, including new strategic customers, higher sales velocities at existing customers, and contribution from new products introduced in 2019.""
Looking ahead, the company said it anticipates 2020 revenue in the range of $490 million to $510 million, matching Wall Street forecasts of $498.9 million."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fears of a sustained global economic impact as the coronavirus rapidly spreads beyond China have sent investors scrambling to find safety less than 10 days after the U.S. stock market set record highs. 
The S&P 500 fell more than 4% on Thursday, extending a market rout that has now sliced more than 10% off of its closing peak on Feb. 19, which would confirm that the benchmark index has been in a correction since then. The broad Euro Stoxx 600 index dropped 3.8%, while Canada's TSX index fell 1.9%. 
Treasury bond yields, meanwhile, hit all-time lows for the third consecutive day while gold jumped more than 1%, a sign that investors were racing for safe havens. 
Investors and analysts said the market volatility will likely continue until there are signs that the virus, or COVID-19, has peaked in Europe or the United States. There have been 15 confirmed U.S. cases of the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control. 
“The concern is the outbreak is just getting started,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, who is moving away from sectors like industrials that benefit from global economic growth and focusing on companies with low leverage and high profitability.
The quick turnabout in investor sentiment comes on the heels of a more than 30% gain in the S&P 500 in 2019, bolstered by a combination of record-low unemployment and expectations that a U.S.-China trade deal would accelerate global economic growth. 
""The important thing to keep in mind is that so much of last year's rally in stocks was premised on the U.S. economy, global economy and corporate earnings improving dramatically,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird. With those expectations already baked into share prices, ""what we have right now is a valuation-inspired repricing,"" he added. 
The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500, for instance, now stands at 17.8, according to Refinitiv data. Earlier this month, the index traded at a forward P/E of 18.9, its most expensive valuation since 2002, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research. 
The uncertainty of how long the outbreak will last and how it will disrupt the economy makes this sell-off different from the nearly 20% decline in the S&P 500 in 2018, which was driven by concerns that the Federal Reserve would continue on its rate-hiking path despite slowing global growth, said Don Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies at Federated Hermes. 
Traders now see is a nearly 70% chance that the Fed moves to cut interest rates at its March 18 meeting, up from just an 8% chance last week. 
""You’re at a very delicate point relative to investor psychology right now. You won't necessarily trip into a panic today or tomorrow or next week but you easily could,"" said Charles Lemonides, portfolio manager of the ValueWorks LLC hedge fund. 
As a result, he is positioning his portfolio for more volatility. At the same time, Lemonides is increasing his positions in companies in the energy sector, whose shares have been ""decimated,"" he said. 
The sector has had ""a very extended sell-off and it's pretty close to capitalization levels,"" Lemonides said.
The energy sector of the S&P 500 is down nearly 23% for the year to date, compared with a 4.6% decline in the index as a whole. 
Troy Gayesk, co-chief investment officer of alternative investments firm SkyBridge, said he has been buying gold for the first time since 2011 while exiting equity call options that would profit from a continued rally in the S&P 500. 

""We are going into March certainly more conservative than we did coming into January and the question is, ""Do we get a clear signal to re-engage or not?'"" he said. The virus outbreak has created ""a much murkier environment where having further material upside in equity markets is much more questionable,"" Gayesk said.

(Reuters) - Investors pulled a net $18.5 billion out of U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the week ended Wednesday, the largest one-week retreat from the domestic equity market since December, according to Lipper data released Thursday.
The pullback from the U.S. market came amid a multiday stock sell-off due to fears of the spreading coronavirus, known as covid-19, that has pushed the S&P 500 index (SPX) into the 10% decline from recent highs that defines a correction. The S&P 500 tumbled another 4.4% on Thursday, putting the index on course for its largest weekly drop since the 2008 financial crisis.
Nearly $15.2 billion in outflows came from funds that hold large cap U.S. stocks, which hit record highs as recently as Feb. 19. International equity stocks lost nearly $3 billion in net outflows last week.
Funds that hold safe havens such as gold or provide dividend income were among the few equity categories to post inflows.
U.S.-based taxable bond funds, meanwhile, attracted $2.5 billion, the eighth straight weekly inflow. Money market funds shed $2.6 billion, Lipper data showed."
863,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 05:28PM ET</span>",Tellurian stock falls after company extends U.S. LNG sale negotiations with Petronet,"(Reuters) - Tellurian Inc (O:TELL) stock dropped on Thursday after the company said it extended the amount of time India's  Petronet LNG  Ltd (NS:PLNG) had to finalize an agreement to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Tellurian's Driftwood plant in Louisiana.
Tellurian announced the extension following a report that Petronet issued a request for information to buy about 1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG for 10 years starting from 2024.
Shares in Tellurian, which is developing the $27.5 billion Driftwood project, fell over 16% to $3.675, their lowest since August 2016.
Tellurian and Petronet signed a non-binding agreement in September, in which Petronet agreed to negotiate the purchase of up to five MTPA of LNG, concurrent with an equity investment in Driftwood.
That agreement, worth about $2.5 billion, was expected to be finalized by March 31. Tellurian said the companies extended the deadline to May 31 to support Petronet's review process.
After listening to a conference call with Tellurian, analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said that review is ""apparently a normal step in the process as Petronet needs to do a competitive assessment before committing to buying LNG.""
Tellurian said in its fourth-quarter earnings release earlier this week that Driftwood was ""shovel ready for 2020.""
""We plan to complete our financing in the coming months and begin construction on the ... project,"" Tellurian Chief Executive Meg Gentle said.
Tellurian has said it could make a final investment decision (FID) to build Driftwood in early 2020.
Analysts at Cowen, however, said, ""We continue to see it unlikely the project gets sanctioned until at least 2021.""
Officials at Tellurian were not immediately available for comment.
Tellurian was one of about a about dozen firms developing LNG export plants in North America that delayed their planned FID from 2019 to 2020.
The Cowen analysts noted Tellurian had about $80 million in cash and about $88 million in debt due May 23, presenting a potential liquidity issue unless the company secures equity interest in Driftwood.
Driftwood is designed to produce 27.6 MTPA of LNG or about 3.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas.

Tellurian said its partners in Driftwood include units of  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), Vitol, Petronet, Baker Hughes Co (N:BKR) and Bechtel, which has a contract to build the $15.4 billion liquefaction facility. Pipelines, reserves and other expenses make up the rest of the project's total cost.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is set to propose fining four major U.S. mobile phone companies at least $200 million in total for improperly disclosing some consumer real-time location data, two people briefed on the matter said on Thursday.
The FCC is expected to announce the proposed fines on AT&T Inc (N:T),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ), Sprint Corp (N:S) and T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) on Friday. The companies will be able to challenge the fines before they become final and the precise amount could change the sources said, but is expected to total just over $200 million.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai confirmed in January that ""one or more wireless carriers apparently violated federal law."" The FCC and the carriers did not immediately comment.
The FCC said in May 2018 it was investigating reports that a website flaw could have allowed the location of mobile phone customers to be tracked. That probe expanded into other uses of consumers' location data by third-party firms.
Carriers have allowed the use of location-data for programs like roadside assistance, logistics, medical emergency alert services, human trafficking alerts and fraud prevention. 
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in January it was a ""shame"" the FCC took so long to act on what she called reports that ""shady middlemen could sell your location within a few hundred meters based on your wireless phone data."" She added, ""It’s chilling to consider what a black market could do with this data.""
A trade group representing U.S. wireless carriers said in January that ""upon hearing allegations of misuse of the data, carriers quickly investigated, suspended access to the data and subsequently terminated those programs.""
Lawmakers last year expressed outrage that aggregators were able to buy user data from wireless carriers and sell ""location-based services to a wide variety of companies"" and others, including bounty hunters.
Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said Thursday that media reports of the fines suggested Pai ""failed to protect American consumers at every stage of the game – this issue only came to light after my office and dedicated journalists discovered how wireless companies shared Americans’ locations willy nilly.""
Wyden said the fines would be a significantly less than what the FCC could have imposed and said ""comically inadequate fines"" will not ""stop phone companies from abusing Americans’ privacy the next time they can make a quick buck."" 

T-Mobile, which it expected to face the largest fine, is working to close its merger with Sprint in the coming weeks.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 05:11PM ET</span>",Beyond Meat triples sales but shares fall after profit miss,"By Richa Naidu
(Reuters) -  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) said on Thursday that fourth-quarter sales tripled, but shares fell 7% in after-hours trading as the company missed earnings expectations and announced that Executive Chairman Seth Goldman will resign.
Goldman, a co-founder of beverage brand Honest Tea, will continue to serve as chairman, Beyond Meat said in a filing.
The El Segundo, California-based company said deals with retailers and restaurants substantially narrowed its loss and boosted sales. But Beyond Meat reported a 1 cent per share loss during the period, versus analyst expectations of a 1 cent profit, according to according to Refinitiv IBES data. Beyond Meat has never recorded a yearly profit due to spending on R&D, marketing and its fast-paced international expansion.
The company - whose Beyond Burgers and Sausages are driving a global craze for plant-based meat products - struck several high-profile deals last year with fast-food chains including McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN). As consumers grow increasingly health-conscious and concerned about the environmental impact of industrial animal farming, the plant-based meat market is expected to expand to $140 billion.
The company's share price has risen four-fold since its IPO in May, but short sellers and many investors view the stock as overvalued following its massive surge, now trading at 232.8 times expected earnings. This is well above the 19.1 earnings ratio of the broad S&P 500 index.
Beyond Meat's products are sold by grocers including Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Whole Foods. Its deals with restaurants include Starbucks Corp's (N:SBUX) recent announcement that it will soon sell a Beyond Meat breakfast sandwich across Canada.
But while Beyond Meat and its main rival Impossible Foods race to sign on major global restaurant chains, there have been some signs of issues including Canadian restaurant chain Tim Hortons dropping Beyond Meat's products from its menu, saying they were not ""embraced"" by customers during a trial. Last month, Burger King began cutting the price of its Impossible Burgers, adding them to its value menu.
Initial feedback on the Beyond Burger has been largely positive, based on checks with some Ontario-based McDonald's currently testing the plant-based burgers in Canada, Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard wrote last month in a note. Howard said, however, that it seemed the McDonald's trial had not yet been a blowout success that justified an immediate nationwide rollout across both Canada and the United States.
Beyond Meat was last year ranked the third-biggest meat alternative company by retail sales in the United States, according to Euromonitor, just behind traditional veggie-burger makers Morningstar, owned by Kellogg Co (N:K), and Conagra Brands Inc's (N:CAG) Gardein. Both of those companies are this year entering the plant-based meat category, where they lag Beyond Meat.

Net revenue grew to $98.5 million from $31.5 million a year ago, beating estimates of about $80 million, in the period ended Dec. 31. Beyond Meat said it expects net revenue of $490 million to $510 million this year, an increase of 64%-71% from 2019, about in line with expectations. Beyond Meat's net loss narrowed substantially to $0.5 million, or a loss of 1 cent per common share.
""We have a kind of cannibalistic approach to innovation where we're trying to take out our existing products and there's a lot of pride in doing that,"" Chief Executive Ethan Brown said in an interview on Thursday.
Boosted by rising sales the company's full-year loss has narrowed since 2017, even as it spends on a new facility in the Netherlands and is working to start production in Asia by the end of this year. In recent months, the coronavirus outbreak has slowed manufacturing in China. Beyond Meat said its goal remains to produce in the region by end of year, pending abatement of the coronavirus.
""We're looking, like everyone else, at when things are going to clear ... but it's not something we're wringing our hands about it here,"" Brown said."

By Yasin Ebrahim
 
Investing.com - Stocks plunged in late selling Thursday as fears of a global pandemic intensified. 
The S&P is on pace for its worst weekly loss since the Financial Crisis as investors feared a jump in coronavirus infections in the U.S. could derail economic growth. The S&P 500 closed down. 4.4%,
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 1,200 points, or 4.4% and Nasdaq Composite slumped 4.6%.
As the coronavirus epidemic widens globally, with new infections reported in Europe, U.S. and the Middle East, investor sentiment on stocks continues to sour, triggering a wave of selling on Wall Street.

In the U.S., California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state is monitoring at least 8,400 people for Covid-19, with 28 people confirmed to have contracted the virus.

Just a day earlier, the CDC confirmed the first infection to a patient in California who did not have “relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient,” stoking fears health authorities would struggle to contain the outbreak. In Italy, the cases continue to mount, surging to 650 from 520 cases reporting this morning.
With travel and tourism expected to be among the worst hit by the outbreak, traders upped bearish bets on jet fuel demand, and by extension, oil prices, keeping energy stocks firmly on the back foot. 
Tech also played an influential role in the broader sell-off, paced by chip stocks, which fell 4.6% on the day. 
Mega-cap FANG stocks also extended losses, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) unable to hold onto a bid earlier in the day despite expectations that prolonged periods of self- quarantine among the infected could boost user activity on the streaming platform.
Facebook, meanwhile, (NASDAQ:FB) canceled its annual F8 software developer conference, citing concerns about the outbreak.
A flight to safety, pushed Treasury yields to record lows and put banking stocks in the eye of the storm. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fell sharply as the 10-Year Treasury yield ended the day just above record intraday lows of 1.24%.
Falling bond yields tends to stifle net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders. 
But it wasn't all gloom as Etsy and Square (NYSE:SQ) rallied on better-than-expected earnings. 
Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) popped 14% higher following a beat on both the top and bottom lines. While Square (NYSE:SQ) pared gains to end 3% higher after it topped quarterly earnings estimates underpinned by a rise in its users.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.-based banks and brokers are in discussions with federal regulators about allowing staff to work from home and other business continuity arrangements amid the spread of the coronavirus, the head of a top financial trade group said on Thursday.
The industry is reviewing and updating contingency plans in order to minimize any potential disruption to the financial markets that could be caused by personnel being unable to work onsite, said Kenneth Bentsen Jr., said chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).
""We are communicating with the government, and obviously we will rely upon the appropriate officials, particularly both our regulatory officials and public health officials, to guide us "" he told Reuters on Thursday.
""But the firms are also going through what they would do in a pandemic situation that could impact market operations,"" he said, adding that most firms have playbooks for handling a range of business disruptions, including pandemics.
In addition to remote working arrangements, financial firms could potentially move staff to backup locations away from major cities, he said. Several major banks in Hong Kong and Singapore - including HSBC (L:HSBA),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and DBS Bank - have restricted travel to mainland China and are allowing staff to work from home.
On Tuesday,  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) asked about 300 British employees to work from home indefinitely after an employee in its London office reported a flu-like illness.
The financial industry is also discussing with regulators rules that may need to be temporarily waived if staff are unable to get to work, since some functions require personnel to be physically onsite. For example, processing trades and monitoring trading communications remain heavily manual processes, he said.
The Wall Street planning effort comes amid growing fears that countries are struggling to contain the flu-like virus, prompting governments from Iran to Australia to shut schools, cancel big public events and stock up on medical supplies.
On Thursday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission told Reuters it is closely monitoring trading as fears of a pandemic pummel markets, sinking global equities, pushing oil futures to their lowest in a year and roiling wheat and corn markets.
The Basel Committee of banking regulators, an international regulatory body, said banks and regulators should be ready to share information across borders as it tries to assess the financial stability implications of the outbreak.
Federal regulators published guidance in 2007 on how the financial industry should plan for a potential pandemic. That followed a 2007 exercise in which the government and financial industry tested the resilience of banks and other financial firms in the face of a hypothetical flu pandemic.
That three-week exercise found that while there would be a significant impact on the financial sector, markets would continue to operate. SIFMA typically coordinates the industry's continuity planning efforts, and carries out regular drills.
""Our job is to do as much preparedness as we can ... and to be as resilient as possible,"" said Bentsen. ""That's been up and running for several weeks now, and we're prepared."""

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has barred more than 1 million products from sale in recent weeks that had inaccurately claimed to cure or defend against the coronavirus, the company told Reuters on Thursday.
Amazon also removed tens of thousands of deals from merchants that it said attempted to price-gouge customers. The world's largest online retailer has faced scrutiny over the health-related offers on its platform, and earlier this week Italy launched a probe into surging prices around the internet for sanitizing gels and hygiene masks while it battled the biggest outbreak in Europe.
The coronavirus has caused at least 2,797 deaths globally. New reported infections around the world now exceed those from mainland China, where the flu-like disease arose two months ago out of an illegal wildlife market. Governments from Australia to Iran have closed schools, scrapped events and stockpiled medical supplies to contain the virus's spread.
One offer comparison site showed recent examples of higher-than-usual prices for masks on Amazon made by U.S. industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co.
A merchant Thursday offered a 10-pack of N95 masks for $128, a Reuters reporter saw when clicking through the buying options on Amazon. That was up from a recent seller average price of $41.24, according to the tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. The item was no longer available in a check later in the day.
A two-pack respirator was offered new at $24.99 earlier this week by a third-party seller, up from a recent average of $6.65 when sold by Amazon, the price-following site showed.
""There is no place for price gouging on Amazon,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement, citing the company's policy that product information must be accurate and that Amazon can take down offers that hurt customer trust, including when pricing ""is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon.""
It declined to specify the exact threshold at which an item is considered unfairly priced.
The company said it has monitored for price spikes and false claims through a mix of automated and manual review of listings.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) fell 4% on Thursday after the company warned of weakness in its PC business after a hit to its supply chain from the coronavirus outbreak, echoing similar statements from Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and HP (N:HPQ).
The selloff in shares wiped off nearly $50 billion from Microsoft's market value on a day broader markets tumbled about 2% on rising fears of a global pandemic.
The virus has infected about 80,000 people, killed nearly 2,800 and spread to 44 countries, and is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
Microsoft said on Wednesday its supply chain was taking longer to return to normal operations than expected, and its Windows and Surface computers had taken a bigger hit than feared.
The impact of the fast-spreading virus has taken a toll on companies across sectors, particularly technology companies as their supply chains in China come under strain.
Apple was the first big technology firm to say the epidemic was affecting its production and demand in China.  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) and Mastercard Inc (N:MA) have also warned of a possible hit. 
Several Wall Street analysts said they expect other technology companies with strong China presence to follow suit.
""Given there seems to be weakness in the PC supply chain, it would seem highly likely to me that we hear something from  Intel Corp  (O:INTC),"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said in a mail.
Andrew MacMillen, an analyst with Nucleus Research, said PC makers Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL) and Lenovo Group (HK:0992) could be seeing some difficulties.
Dell, the world's third-biggest PC maker after Lenovo Group (HK:0992) and HP, will report quarterly earnings after markets close on Thursday. It has a sizeable exposure to China.
Microsoft said it would miss its own third-quarter revenue forecast for the PC unit, which houses the Windows business.
J.P.Morgan analysts said Microsoft's outlook is a supply chain issue, not a demand issue, but it was possible that broad supply chain issues plus investors becoming increasingly averse to risk could metastasize into demand issues over time.
Research firm IDC on Thursday forecast 2020 PC shipments to fall 9% due to the outbreak. (https:// Apple warned earlier in February it was unlikely to meet its March quarter sales outlook due to the coronavirus impact. ""It feels to me that China is getting the coronavirus under control,"" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an interview with Fox Business Network, adding that iPhone components come from the United States as well as China. 
Cook told the network that iPhone factories in China have re-opened and are in ""phase three of the ramp mode"" of returning to normal operations.

Several big names in the U.S. consumer and tech sectors have already warned of a hit from the rapid spread of the epidemic that has disrupted supply chains, hurt global travel and led to temporary shutdowns of businesses.
Here's a list of some big names from Corporate America that have announced a financial impact from the outbreak.
** Apple Inc (O:AAPL) warned it was unlikely to meet its March-quarter sales forecast as the iPhone maker's manufacturing facilities in China were ramping up slower than expected.
** Microsoft Inc (O:MSFT) said it does not expect to meet its quarterly revenue forecast for its Windows and personal computing business due to a hit to its supply chain.
** PC maker HP Inc (N:HPQ) said it factored in an 8 cents per share impact into its second-quarter profit outlook as it expects coronavirus outbreak to hit its businesses and supplies.
**  Canada Goose Holdings  Inc (TO:GOOS) (N:GOOS) forecast an annual revenue hit of up to C$51.6 million.
** Versace owner Capri Holdings Ltd (N:CPRI) warned of a $100 million hit from the outbreak and cut its annual revenue forecast.
**  Estee Lauder  Cos Inc (N:EL) trimmed its fiscal 2020 per-share earnings forecast, in part due to the impact from the outbreak.
** Ralph Lauren Corp (N:RL) has closed about two-thirds of its 110 stores in China and expects a $55 million to $70 million hit to its fourth-quarter sales in Asia.
**  Coach  handbag maker Tapestry Inc (N:TPR) warned of its second-half financial results being dented by about $200 million to $250 million in sales and 35 cents to 45 cents in earnings per share."
893,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 03:19PM ET</span>",Opioid companies say lawyers' fee demand threatens settlement talks,"By Tom Hals and Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and other drug companies facing thousands of lawsuits over their role in the opioid epidemic have warned that settlement talks will be ""severely"" jeopardized if plaintiffs' lawyers are allowed to assess a fee payment worth billions of dollars.
Major distributors such as McKesson Corp (N:MCK) and drugmakers including Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) joined in the request that U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio, reject a request by a committee of plaintiffs' lawyers for a 7% fee assessed against any settlements. They filed their brief late Wednesday. 
The request could amount to $3.3 billion, based on a $48 billion settlement proposal that five companies have been negotiating with various state attorneys general. 
The drug companies noted that the attorneys would receive more money from the settlement than even some of the states they represent. Dozens of state attorneys general also opposed the request for the fee to the plaintiffs executive committee that is litigating thousands of lawsuits by towns, counties and tribal governments. 
The lawsuits, consolidated before Polster, accuse the companies of fueling a nationwide opioid crisis blamed for 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths since 1999.
Many local governments hired private attorneys and will have to carve out of any money received for a separate legal fee, which in some cases will be paid to the same attorneys who sit on the plaintiffs executive committee, or PEC.
""The scope of that demand is staggering,"" the companies said in Wednesday's joint filing. They said the 7% assessment would ""give the PEC more money than any city or county in the country, and more than many states.""
The PEC said members were engaged in negotiating a full and fair settlement with distributors and working to reach a broader settlement with opioid defendants.
""Common benefit fees are not a roadblock to resolution,"" the PEC said in a statement.
In court filings, PEC lawyers described the fee request as ""modest"" given the complex litigation. Such a fee, to compensate for lawyers' time and expenses, is a feature of complex nationwide litigation.
The fee request has also met opposition from state attorneys general, who brought their own opioid cases that are not before Polster.
In a letter to Polster on Monday, attorneys general from 36 states said plaintiffs' lawyers were wrongly seeking to tax any settlements the states achieve and that the fee request if approved could ""irreparably"" disrupt global settlement talks.
""Everyone understands these attorneys have done a lot of work,"" New Hampshire Associate Attorney General James Boffetti said. ""But it doesn't mean they get a disproportionate windfall.""

The parties are under pressure to resolve the lawsuits before the start of a March 20 trial in New York.

The outbreak could have an impact on the company's manufacturing, supply chain and clinical trial operations, Pfizer said under the risk factors section of a regulatory filing. (https:// ""The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence,"" the drugmaker added.

Merck & Co (N:MRK) on Wednesday said the outbreak has negatively affected some of its clinical trials and has seen a limited effect on its supply chain of drugs into and raw materials out of China. 
Merck, in its regulatory filing, also warned of a negative impact to its first quarter results, which it expects to not be material. The company added it was currently unable to determine whether the outbreak will have a further impact on its results in 2020.

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) on Thursday said it agreed to sell its elevators division to a consortium of Advent, Cinven (CINV.UL) and Germany's RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros ($18.7 billion) in what could be the world's largest buyout this year.
The bidding group prevailed against a rival consortium comprising Blackstone (N:BX), Carlyle (O:CG) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, Thyssenkrupp said.
The price, which makes the deal Europe's biggest buyout since 2007, beats the most optimistic estimates and roughly matches a bid that had been submitted earlier in the process by Finnish rival Kone (HE:KNEBV), which dropped out of the race earlier this month over expected antitrust risks.
Frankfurt-listed shares in the group (F:TKAG) were up 4.8% at 1920 GMT.
Thyssenkrupp said it would reinvest about 1.25 billion euros to take a stake in the unit, which, based on the purchase price, would result in a 7.3% share that would be used to partially fund its pension liabilities.
""With the sale, we are paving the way for Thyssenkrupp to become successful. Not only have we obtained a very good selling price, we will also be able to complete the transaction quickly,"" Thyssenkrupp CEO Martina Merz said in a statement.
""It is now crucial for us to find the best possible balance for the use of the funds.""
The decision followed a meeting of Thyssenkrupp's management and supervisory boards, ending the closely watched saga.
SAFE SITES
By far the German conglomerate's most profitable business, Thyssenkrupp Elevator is the world's fourth-largest lift manufacturer behind United Technologies Corp's (N:UTX) Otis, Switzerland's Schindler (S:SCHP) and Finnish rival Kone (HE:KNEBV).
The auction leaves Thyssenkrupp with a much-needed cash injection at a time when the once mighty group has accumulated roughly 16 billion euros in debt and pension liabilities, more than twice its current market value.
Pummelled by ill-fated investments, a downturn in the car market, multiple leadership changes and an overly complex group structure that was tackled too late, Thyssenkrupp's shares trade around 13-year lows.
As part of the deal, Thyssenkrupp Elevator will remain based in Germany and equal representation between shareholders and labour representatives will be safeguarded. Jobs and sites will be secure until at least March 31, 2027, union IG Metall said.
Thyssenkrupp will use the funds to cut debt, which will result in a significantly lower annual cash outflow for interest and pension payments, compensating for the loss of cash flow from the elevator business.
Funds will also be used to support Thyssenkrupp's other struggling divisions, including steel, plant building and car parts. The group will unveil exact plans for distribution in May.

""It is very clear that Santander's next candidate for ... CEO should be someone from within the bank and Rial is a clear frontrunner,"" one investment banker, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
Santander, the euro zone biggest bank in terms of market value, said on Thursday that it would not comment on ""mere speculation"" when asked about candidates for the post of CEO.
The Madrid-based bank also said that Rial would continue to report to its chief executive Jose Antonio Alvarez. Santander has said that it is sticking with Alvarez as CEO.
""Since joining Santander in 2015, Sergio has led Santander Brazil's transformation,"" Santander chairwoman Ana Botin said.
""I am certain that his vision will provide great value to the board,"" Botin added in a statement.
GROWTH DRIVER
Rial, who joined Santander in 2015, will maintain his position as country head for Brazil, head of South America and head of Global Trade Services (GTS), the platform the bank is developing to enable international trade for SMEs.
Brazil has been Santander's main earnings driver and has helped it cope with tough conditions for banks in Europe in the years since the financial crisis, where low interest rates and the clean-up from the credit crunch have crimped profits.
Santander Brazil, which accounts for 28% of group earnings, saw underlying profit rise 16% in 2019, while in Europe it fell 3% year-on-year due to higher provisions.
Once Rial's appointment is ratified, Santander will have three executive directors on its board: Botin, Alvarez as vice chairman and CEO, and Rial.

The rest of Santander's 15 board members, of whom 40% are women, are external directors.

Investing.com – The Dow moved out of correction territory Thursday, but remained in the red amid growing concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on business activity in the wake of a surge in infections across the globe.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 360 points, or 1.33%, after easing from a 960 point drop.
The S&P 500 fell 1.10% and Nasdaq Composite fell 1.34%
The bounce from session lows in the broader market comes even as coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreaks increased worldwide, with more infections reported in the Middle East, Asia and Europe.
Just hours after reporting 520 cases earlier in the day, Italy said infection rose to 650, with 3 more deaths.
The early-day selling was driven by fears infections in the U.S. could jumped after the CDC confirmed the first infection to a patient who did not have ""relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient.""
""As we’ve seen from recent countries with community spread, when it has hit those countries, it has moved quite rapidly. We want to make sure the American public is prepared,"" Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters.
""As more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder"" and “disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she added.
Travel and tourism, which earlier came under heavy selling pressure on concerns about softer demand, pared some losses and sparked a broader rebound as bargain-seeking investors piled into beaten-down.
  Expedia   (NASDAQ:EXPE),   Hilton Worldwide   (NYSE:HLT) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) turned positive for the session, rising more than 1%.
Banking stocks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) also cut some losses as Treasury yields eased from losses as the flight-to-safety trade lost some steam.
The 10-Year yield hit an all-time low of 1.24% earlier today.
Despite the bounce, investor sentiment remained fragile, especially on tech names amid further worries about virus-led disruption to growth.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) canceled its annual F8 software developer conference, citing concerns about the outbreak. Its shares were down 1.5%.
On the earnings front, investors cheered mostly bullish quarterly results.
Square (NYSE:SQ) surged 12% after it topped quarterly earnings estimates underpinned by a rise in its users.
Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) popped 16% higher following a beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Elsewhere, energy stocks continued to languish in the red amid an ongoing slump in oil prices. "

Data from LMC Automotive showed that 3,563 Tesla vehicles were registered in China in January, up from 853 vehicles a year earlier, but down from the 6,613 vehicles registered in December.
Tesla registrations fluctuate significantly from month to month, LMC data showed. The automaker typically delivers many more vehicles in the final month of a quarter than in the first month. In October 2019, Tesla owners registered just 763 vehicles, LMC data showed.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
The selloff in Tesla shares highlights the growing concern about the health of the Chinese auto market as the government and companies contend with the disruption of the coronavirus outbreak.
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers had earlier said https://in.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos/china-auto-sales-likely-tumbled-18-in-january-coronavirus-seen-taking-heavy-toll-idINKBN2070K3 that overall vehicle sales fell by almost a fifth in January, hurt by Lunar New Year holidays that started earlier than last year and by the coronavirus disruptions.
The electric-car maker said https://in.reuters.com/article/china-health-shanghai/shanghai-to-help-tesla-resume-production-amid-coronavirus-spread-idINKCN202060 earlier this month that the outbreak would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars in China.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Bayer cools prospect of imminent glyphosate settlement,"By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss
LEVERKUSEN, Germany (Reuters) - German drugs and pesticides company Bayer (DE:BAYGn) was at pains on Thursday to quell expectations it was nearing an out-of-court settlement laying to rest claims its glyphosate-based weedkillers cause cancer.
Bayer said after publishing its earnings outlook for 2020 it was in no rush to reach terms with plaintiffs' lawyers and was less inclined to set aside funds for any deal following recent U.S. decisions in its favor.
Shares in Bayer have shed a quarter of their value since mid-2018 when the company lost the first U.S. lawsuit claiming that glyphosate-based Roundup - acquired via Bayer's $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) that year - causes cancer.
""If we were to submit to the imperative of a deadline we would very likely not achieve the best outcome for our company and our shareholders,"" Chief Executive Werner Baumann told a news conference when asked if a settlement before Bayer's annual investor meeting on April 28 was on the cards.
While media reports have recently raised the prospect of a settlement, Bayer Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Nickl said recent endorsements underscored its decision not to make financial provisions for a deal beyond legal fees.
In December, the U.S. Justice Department said in a so-called amicus brief that a federal appeals court should reverse a lower court verdict finding Bayer liable in a Californian Roundup case. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also reaffirmed this year that glyphosate was safe.
""A significant likelihood and a measurability (of future payouts) has to be given and we, and also our auditors, have concluded this is not the case,"" Nickl said. ""The amicus brief and the EPA decision played a role here.""
Bayer also said on Thursday it was targeting growth in adjusted core profit of 7% to 9.6% this year, driven by sales of agriculture products and pharmaceuticals. That disappointed some who had been hoping for a more ambitious goal and Bayer's shares underperformed the broader German market on Thursday.
OUTLOOK DISAPPOINTS
Bayer has denied claims Roundup - or its active ingredient glyphosate - cause cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown it is safe for human use.
Major regulators, including those overseeing European and U.S pesticide markets, have deemed it safe but the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded in 2015 that glyphosate probably causes cancer.
Although Bayer would not be drawn on Thursday on the size of any likely settlement, Nickl said it had plenty of flexibility to fund any deal from future cash flow, 9.3 billion euros in gross proceeds from asset sales and, if necessary, bridge loans.
Nickl also said that based on average analyst predictions of a settlement worth about $10 billion, Bayer would not have to write down the value of the $63 billion Monsanto acquisition. 
Bayer said the increase in the number of plaintiffs blaming its glyphosate-based weedkillers for their cancer had slowed somewhat, reaching 48,600 as of Feb. 6. The total more than doubled within three months to reach 42,700 by October 2019.
Shares in Bayer were 3.9% lower at 67.15 euros by 1420 GMT, underperforming the broader German market (GDAXI) which was down 3.3% along with other bourses on continued concerns about the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
Analysts at brokerage Bryan, Garnier & Co said Bayer's outlook was not as upbeat as some market participants had hoped, even more so because it had not yet taken into account any impact from coronavirus.
Bayer said it was targeting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) adjusted for special items and currency swings of 12.3 billion to 12.6 billion euros, up from 11.5 billion euros ($12.5 billion) in 2019.
Analysts had been expecting a target of 12.6 billion euros, based on a consensus posted on the company's website, or about 12.5 billion according to Refinitiv data.

The company's fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA rose 26.4% to 2.48 billion euros, as expected by analysts.

LONDON (Reuters) - A coronavirus outbreak that may tip Italy into recession also threatens hefty losses for fund managers who have been overlooking a multitude of risks to invest in one of the few euro zone bond markets offering yields above zero.
For weeks, even with the coronavirus flare-up in China fuelling concerns about global growth, investors flocked to higher-yielding southern European debt -- attractive at a time when almost 70% of all euro zone government bonds yield less than 0%, according to Rabobank.
Roughly half of positive-yielding euro area debt is from Italy, so no surprise that Italian 10-year bond yields tumbled 50 basis points in January as the buyers rushed in.
That trend has now stalled. As Italy grapples with the worst outbreak of the virus in Europe, investors - for now at least - have woken up to the country risks they previously set aside.
Italy's 10-year borrowing costs have risen to a one-month high at 1.09% (IT10YT=RR), pushing the yield premium over top-rated German Bunds (DE10YT=RR) to 161 bps.
That spread, a closely-tracked measure of relative risks, has widened almost 30 bps this week, set for its biggest weekly jump in over six months.
Italian stocks have tumbled more than 5% this week .
(Graphic: Italian/German 10-year bond yield spread, weekly change - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2549/2517/IT2602.png)
""What this week's bond selloff in Italy shows is that the yield pick-up story is not supreme,"" said Wouter Sturkenboom, chief investment strategist for EMEA and APAC at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Asset Management.
Credit default swaps (CDS), reflecting the cost of insuring exposure to Italian risk, are at four-week highs and Italian bank CDS have also jumped.
Yields on safe-haven Bunds have tumbled (DE10YT=RR).
The coronavirus hit is hurting one of the euro zone's most vulnerable members -- with public debt totaling over 130% of gross domestic product, an economy that is barely growing and almost constant political infighting.
Earlier this month, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco flagged Rome's higher risk premiums versus Spain or Portugal, warning about the ""chronic vulnerability"" of public finances.
Now as the economy reels from measures taken to contain the virus outbreak, the debt trajectory will likely worsen.
The selloff could catch out swathes of investors who had expected the risk premium to gradually shrink.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) for instance told clients last month the Italy/Germany yield spread could tighten to 120 bps, levels last seen in May 2018 -- before a political crisis erupted.
(Graphic: Italian/German spread, Italian 5-year CDS - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2552/2520/IT2602dr.png)
Investors also flocked to Italy's sale of 15-year bonds earlier this month, putting in more than 50 billion euros ($55 billion) in orders. That topped even the record demand for an Italian 30-year bond in January.
David Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton, continues to hold Italian debt in the funds he manages and expects them to add value to the portfolios.
Italian bond holders encompass a range of investors -- latest data from EMAXX shows one sovereign issue maturing March 2020 was held by funds run by the likes of  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Invesco, Generali (MI:GASI), Deka and Amundi.
""The flow of late...has been very strong into (Italian) BTPs,"" said Tim Graf, chief macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets. ""I suspect it is as much a reversal of recent momentum as it is a significant repricing.""
Other southern European bonds, also in high demand in recent weeks, have come under pressure too.
Greek 10-year bond yields, up 23 bps this week (GR10YT=RR), are heading for their biggest weekly jump since October 2018. Spanish and Portuguese yield spreads over Germany are at their widest since September.
There are many who are prepared to look past the outbreak as the European Central Bank's backstop remains in place; money markets are pricing rate cuts again.
While 15-year Italian bonds, for instance, have shed almost 3% of their value in price terms in the past two weeks, they are still up almost 5% from where they traded a month ago. Equivalent German bonds have gained almost 2% in the last two weeks.
Some argue that the temptation to move back into positive yielding peripheral bonds may prove too strong to resist.
""Monetary stimulus will bring relief and recovery, enabling capital to continue to chase carry,"" said Mondher Bettaieb-Loriot, a senior portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management.

927,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 09:39AM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Falls Nearly 500 Points as Virus Fears Hits Wall St Again,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock market plunged again on Thursday as participants took fright at the prospect of the coronavirus outbreak disrupting U.S. economic life.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 437 points or 1.6% at 26,475 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.8%. All three indices were slightly paring initial losses which extended to as much as 2.4%.
One of the biggest losers was Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, which fell 3.9% after the software giant joined Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in saying that it would miss its first-quarter sales guidance. Microsoft said it expects weakness in its personal computing division, which covers Windows software and Xbox gaming consoles. That accounts for over one-third of group revenue.
Another big loser was Budweiser brewer Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI) stock, which fell 8.3% after forecasting a dismal first quarter due to the collapse of social drinking in China in January and February. The world’s biggest brewer also said in its quarterly report that it continued to lose market share in the U.S. to hard seltzers.
Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock fell 4.1% after the operator of travel websites warned of a “significant and negative impact” to earnings from the coronavirus, although its fourth-quarter results came in ahead of expectations.
The company said EBITDA in the first quarter would be around $575 million, some 20% below consensus forecasts.
Adding to the general virus-related concerns, U.S. initial jobless claims rose for the third week in a row, while durable goods orders in January also fell short of expectations.
Elsewhere, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock continued its plummet back to earth, falling 15.3% after Wednesday’s decline of 15.5%. While its down by one-third from its peak only one week ago, it has still more than doubled since listing late last year.
Oil and gas stocks continued to feel the pressure of falling crude prices, which is increasingly putting their debt-servicing capabilities into question. Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) stock plunged 28% to its lowest since the oil price collapse of 2015, after the company said late on Wednesday that its free cash flow will stagnate, while output growth this year will be less than half the group’s medium-term target.
U.S. crude futures fell 4.9% to $46.30. However, the dollar index, which has benefited from inflows from commodity currencies in recent weeks, fell 0.4% to 98.53 as participants factored in a weaker U.S. economic outlook."
928,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 09:33AM ET</span>",Goldman Sees Zero Profit Growth for U.S. Companies Amid Outbreak,"(Bloomberg) -- The rapid spread of the coronavirus has made equity strategists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). slash their outlook for U.S. companies’ profit growth to zero this year, as the epidemic erodes revenue and dents the global economy.
“Our reduced forecasts reflect the severe decline in Chinese economic activity in the first quarter, lower end-demand for U.S. exporters, supply chain disruption, a slowdown in U.S. economic activity, and elevated uncertainty,” the strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Thursday.
More and more companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). and United Airlines Holdings Inc., are starting to warn investors about the impact of the epidemic on their profit outlooks. The virus has reminded the world how exposed major U.S. corporations are to Chinese supplies and economic stability.
The Goldman strategists reduced their baseline earnings-per-share estimates by 5.2% to $165 for this year, representing zero growth, and cut the forecast for next year by 4.4% to $175, which indicates an increase of 6%. That compares with a prediction of a 7.9% advance in earnings in 2020 among companies in the S&P 500 Index, according to Bloomberg estimates, and 11% growth for 2021.
The U.S. stock market will fall another 7% from the Wednesday close in the near term as investor fears over the spreading coronavirus fuel a rush into U.S. Treasuries, sinking the yield to 1%, according to Goldman. However, by the end of the year, the S&P 500 will rebound to 3,400, which is about 9% above the current level, as lower bond yields will offset a reduction in earnings, they said.
The strategists recommended investors shift to more defensive U.S. sectors in light of slowing economic growth. They raised real estate to overweight and utilities to neutral, while cutting industrials to neutral and lowering financials to underweight.
The U.K., Switzerland and South Korea are among countries that reported new infections this week. The U.S. identified the first coronavirus case that doesn’t have ties to a known outbreak, as President Donald Trump assured Americans they face little risk."
929,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 09:23AM ET</span>",End of Decade-Long Rally? Some See Coronavirus Bear Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Not long ago, the idea of a 10% drop in the markets seemed remote -- much less anything more. But in a world struggling to deal with the fast-spreading coronavirus, talk of a 20% decline is starting to emerge.
The MSCI all-country global index has dropped more than 7% over a six-day run, and the VIX was above 30 as of 8 a.m. New York time Thursday as S&P 500 futures tumbled. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped below 1.30%, remaining in record-low territory.
A correction for the S&P 500, often defined as a 10% drop from a recent high, isn’t so far away. And a 20% drop to a bear market, which if measured from the Feb. 19 record would be about 2,709, is creeping into discussions from the likes of   Citigroup   Inc (NYSE:C). and RBC Capital Markets. At the same time, others don’t see things turning nearly that dire.
Here’s what some market observers are saying about the situation:
A 20% Drop
“On the coronavirus, we would not be surprised to see the S&P 500 fall to 3,050 (down 10% from its 2020 high, consistent with the early-2018/low volatility unwind),” said Lori Calvasina of RBC Capital Markets, in a note Thursday. “If that doesn’t hold, the index could fall to the 2,700–2,900 range for a total drop of 14%–20%, consistent with the growth scares of 2010, 2011, 2015–16, and 2H2018. Risk to 2020 S&P 500 EPS is tougher to gauge. Our updated coronavirus stress test is $170. Using $170, the S&P 500 would also become attractive again on P/E after falling below 2,900.”
Fair Value
“Using our forecast for rates, inflation and earnings, and our price-to-earnings model estimate, fair value on the S&P is closer to 2,450,” said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, in a note Wednesday. That would be a drop of more than 20% from the gauge’s close on Wednesday -- and a nearly 28% decline from its record. “Covid-19 could push earnings negative. The offset will be a Fed response, which will favorably impact sentiment. This is the reason our official S&P target of 2,880 remains above our model prediction.”
Technical Levels
Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Jeremy Hale cited a lack of clarity on both the virus outbreak and Fed monetary policy in issuing a recent caution. To illustrate where risky assets may become attractive, they pointed to the S&P 500 falling to 2,730, 10% below its 200-day moving average.

Further to Go
“Our best guess is that the drawdown in risky assets has further to go, although after a sizable pullback the short-term risks appear less asymmetric to the downside,” said  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists Zach Pandl and Kamakshya Trivedi, in a note Wednesday. “U.S. markets in particular will need to price not only a possible drag on activity from the virus, but election-related risks as well.”

Resist Urge to Buy
“The market is coming to the realization that any policy response will be insufficient to insulate it against supply-side concerns,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, in a note Thursday. “While further Fed cuts, and potentially an ECB cut, may be priced in, easier liquidity conditions may be insufficient to prop up equity markets if coronavirus concerns continue to escalate. Monetary policy is not optimized for addressing a shock such as this.”
“Market reaction until now has been overcomplacent, with equity markets reaching record highs as recent as last week. Given these overvaluations and market susceptibility to negative news flow surrounding the outbreak, investors should look to protect their portfolios and resist the urge to buy the dip.”
What Do Stocks Know?
“At a time when investors are worried because the virus is likely to bring global growth to a halt, why would foreign stocks, cyclical stocks, and raw industrial commodity prices be holding up so well?” asked Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, in a note Wednesday.
“Perhaps, the ongoing stock market collapse will soon correct this odd internal message,” he said. “Or, maybe, stocks are suggesting this event is not signaling a recovery-ending collapse but rather simply a correction that is lowering valuations, checking investor sentiment, reducing the excessive leadership and popularity of the technology sector, and maintaining full-out policy support which could ultimately extend this bull market?”
“Perhaps the question is, ‘what does the stock market know that the bond market doesn’t?’”
CTAs Will Buy
“We think Commodity Trading Advisor selling is now over, as 200-day (~3,045), six-month (2,900) and 12-month (2,800) signals are not likely being breached,” according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s Marko Kolanovic in a note Wednesday. “Given the decline of global indices, we think CTA exposure dropped from ~85th percentile last week to ~40th percentile now, and selling will likely stop here.”
“Option hedgers and CTAs are now more likely to buy than sell, and volatility targeters are still selling but at a lower pace, so we think a short term bounce-back is getting likely given month-end flows. Over the next two days, given the significant underperformance of equities vs bonds month to date, there should be buying of stocks and selling of bonds. Our estimates indicate the rebalancing move could produce upside pressure on equities of 1-2%, which could be enough to prompt additional buying from gamma hedgers and CTAs.”
Bonds Are Useful
“Even more than usual, a well-diversified portfolio is essential,” said market strategists Karen Ward and Tai Hui of JPMorgan Asset Management in a note Tuesday. “This includes diversification by region but also by asset class. Once again, we see the use of core government bonds in cushioning the value of a portfolio, despite those bonds starting from historically low, and seemingly unattractive, yields.”
Watching the Fed
“We see a strong case for front-loading easing” from the Federal Reserve, said Steven Englander, head of G-10 FX research and North American macro strategy at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), in a note Wednesday. “In Fed models, cutting now has more cumulative impact than cutting later. Combined with the issues raised by the zero bound and below-target inflation, we expect the Fed to move quickly to mitigate any zero bound risk that emerges. We think having an ‘itchy trigger finger’ is more likely than ‘keeping the powder dry.’ We expect cuts at the late April and June meetings, but see significant risk of a move in mid-March, if shaky global activity looks poised to affect U.S. growth.”
Expecting Volatility
“More volatility could be expected outside China,” said Prashant Bhayani, chief investment officer for Asia at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Wealth Management in Singapore, given warning signals evident during the past few weeks in global equities, such as the concentration for the gains in U.S. stocks in a handful of megacap names. He added that volatility of Chinese equities from here will depend on how the virus spreads as workers return to work in China.

930,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Tesla China Registrations Dropped Before Brunt of Virus Impact,"(Bloomberg) --
Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell after China registration data indicated a significant sequential slowdown in demand before the electric-car maker started feeling the brunt of any impact from the coronavirus.
Registrations of new Tesla cars plunged 46% to 3,563 in January from December, according to state-backed China Automotive Information Net, which gathers industry data based on insurance purchases. Of the January registrations, 2,605 were for cars built in China.
While Tesla had bucked the trend in China’s waning electric-car market in the previous two months, the January drop shows that the U.S. brand isn’t immune to challenges the broader industry is facing. China’s car market probably is headed for a third straight annual decline as the coronavirus outbreak exacerbates a slump started by an economic slowdown and trade tensions.
Tesla shares dropped as much as 6.3% before the start of regular trading. The stock had soared 86% this year through the close Wednesday, partly driven by optimism about the company starting to produce Model 3 sedans at a newly built plant near Shanghai.
In total, deliveries of new-energy vehicles in China from carmakers to dealerships tumbled 54% last month, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry body.
Tesla began delivering locally built Model 3s to customers in China last month, seeking to boost volumes amid rising competition from the likes of BMW AG and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), which are also bringing out new electric cars. The sedans assembled domestically qualify for tax exemptions and subsidies the company has missed out on in the past.
The locally manufactured models helped Tesla’s January registrations increase from just 853 a year earlier.
The timing of China’s Lunar New Year complicates year-over-year comparisons in the first months of 2020. The holiday fell in January this year and in February in 2019.
But business has ground to a halt this month due to the coronavirus, and automakers are expected to come up well short of last year’s sales levels in February. Deliveries to dealers this month are set to slide about 75%, resulting in about a 40% drop in the first two months of 2020, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>","Tata Motors, two group finance firms accused of antitrust violations in India: sources","By Aditi Shah and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's competition regulator is examining allegations that Tata Motors and two finance firms of its $100 billion parent group abused their market position while selling commercial vehicles, according to three sources and legal documents seen by Reuters. 
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is reviewing a complaint which alleges the country's biggest seller of trucks dictated terms around the quantity and type of vehicles its former dealer in northern India - Varanasi Auto Sales - should stock.
More than a dozen lawyers representing the three Tata companies attended a private hearing at the CCI in January and argued there was no malpractice by the group's firms, said the three sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter. 
The Tata Group has faced antitrust reviews in the past. A CCI investigation last year found units of  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) and other firms colluded on prices of bearings. A final ruling on that case is pending.
The latest complaint, filed last year by a family member of the dealer, alleged Tata Motors (NS:TAMO) broke rules by working in concert with Tata Motors Finance and Tata Capital Financial Services while advancing dealer credit.
The automaker would stop supplying vehicles to the dealer if repayment of loans advanced by the two finance firms was delayed, indicating they were colluding, said one of the sources privy to the complaint.
""(The) model of business adopted by Tata Group helped in sustaining and retaining the market share,"" the complaint document said. 
In response to Reuters queries, Tata Motors said it had made submissions to the CCI and would provide full support to the watchdog. It added the CCI was ""conducting a preliminary enquiry to determine if there are any merits to the case"".
Tata Capital Financial Services denied the allegations and said it would also support inquiries, adding it had separately taken legal action against the dealer, which it said had defaulted.
Tata Motors ended relations with the dealership in 2017 due to poor performance, the documents showed.
The CCI did not respond to Reuters queries, but a fourth source aware of the case said the watchdog would reach a decision within six weeks, which could see a wider probe into the allegations or a dismissal of the complaint. 
The details of the complaint and the ongoing proceedings are not public. 
The CCI has powers to impose a penalty of up to 10% of the relevant turnover of a company in the last three financial years if it is found to have abused a dominant position.

With an over 40% market share in India, Tata Motors is the biggest seller of commercial vehicles such as pickup trucks. It competes with firms such as  Ashok Leyland  (NS:ASOK) and Mahindra and Mahindra (NS:MAHM) and has over 3,750 sales and service points across India.

(Reuters) - Futures indicated that the Dow Jones Industrials index would shed more than 300 points at the open on Thursday after the rapid spread of the coronavirus outside China deepened worries about growth and corporate earnings.
The number of new infections in China, the source of the outbreak, was overtaken for the first time by fresh cases elsewhere on Wednesday, most notably in Italy and Iran.
Adding to worries, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed an infection in California in a person who reportedly did not have relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient.
""In the recent week, markets have come to realize that the outbreak is much worse and are now realistically pricing in the impact of the virus on the economy,"" said Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist at Rabobank.
""In that sense it's a bit of a catching up from the relative optimism that was there in the beginning when markets thought (the virus) will be contained to China with some minor outbreak outside.""
After hitting a record high last week, the S&P 500 (SPX) has declined for five straight sessions and has lost about $1.84 trillion in market capitalization this week alone.

9 AM ET: Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) stock fell 23% after the shale oil and gas driller forecast lower-than-expected free cash flow for the year, as low prices neutralize the benefits of tighter cost control. 
The company also slashed its forecast for production growth this year to a range between 4% and 6%, less than half its medium-term target of 12.5%.
8:54 AM ET:    Best Buy   (NYSE:BBY) stock fell 3.4%, caught up in the general market malaise despite reporting fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that were better than expectations.
Chief financial officer Matt Bilunas said that the company expects a hit of some degree from the Covid-19 virus but added that he expects it to be temporary.
“We view this as a relatively short-term disruption that does not impact our long-term strategy and initiatives,” Bilunas said in a statement.
8:49 AM ET: Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) stock was up 5.0% at its highest in five months after the pharma company announced the start of two phase-3 tests for its anti-retroviral drug Remdesivir. 
Last month, Chinese scientists announced that Remdesivir had helped treat patients with the Covid-19 virus, something that appears to have sped its route to market. The drug is still to receive authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.
8:43 AM ET: Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock fell 17%, after losing 15.5% already on Tuesday, as market participants took a more sober view of its outlook in the context of the global rout.
The stock has now lost one-third of its value since peaking a week ago, but has still more than doubled since listing late last year.
8:37 AM ET: Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) stock rose 9.0% to its highest in over three months after the online marketplace for handicraft work reported a 35% increase in revenue in the fourth quarter and earnings per share that were over 50% above consensus forecasts at 25c.
Etsy also said it expects revenue to grow another 27%-30% this year.

8:28 AM ET: Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI) (NYSE:BUD) stock fell 8.5% to an eight-year low after the company reported disappointing earnings for the last three months of 2019.

The brewer of Budweiser and Michelob said net income dropped 75% to $114 million while revenue slid 1.3% to $13.33 billion, despite an increase in sales volumes. ABI also said it expected EBITDA to fall some 10% in the first quarter, after the Covid-19 virus hit its operations in China particularly hard.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock fell 4.1% after the software giant joined Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in saying that it would miss its first-quarter sales guidance.

The company said it expected weakness in its personal computing division, which covers Windows software and Xbox gaming consoles. That accounts for over one-third of group revenue.
Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock fell 2.0% after the company warned of a “significant and negative impact” to earnings from the coronavirus, although its fourth-quarter results came in ahead of expectations.
The company said EBITDA in the first quarter would be around $575 million, some 20% below consensus forecasts."

Nestle, the world’s largest food and beverage company, told employees to avoid traveling for business until at least mid-March. A similar recommendation at L’Oreal, the cosmetics owner of global brands like Lancome and Maybelline, extends through March 31 as a “precautionary measure,” a spokeswoman said.
Nestle, which employs 291,000 people worldwide, was one of the first multinationals to take the decisive step as the virus seeded in new countries including Brazil, stoking concerns about a pandemic.
The virus has infected more than 82,000 people and killed at least 2,800 since emerging in central China at the end of last year. It has spread to over 40 countries in less than two months.
In the absence of global health guidelines, companies have to devise their own plans for keeping employees safe.  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) Plc, the maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes, said it reduced travel to the bare minimum. Others including Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co. opted to avoid affected countries.
The travel curbs are bound to hit industries from airlines to hotels that are already reeling from China’s drastic response. Air France-KLM last week warned that the outbreak will wipe as much as 200 million euros ($219 million) from earnings.
Nestle, the Swiss maker of KitKat snack bars and Nespresso capsules, said it “shares global concerns over the spread and impact on public health of coronavirus.” The virus spreads mainly through droplets contained in coughs and sneezes.
Companies in other sectors have also canceled events or encouraged working from home to minimize employees’ exposure. German power company RWE AG (DE:RWEG) said it’s canceling all large internal and external events that aren’t absolutely necessary.
Not so in the fashion industry. In Paris, most luxury goods makers declined to cancel or reschedule their spring fashion shows, which attract models, buyers, and press from around the world. Many participants at runway shows including Kering’s Saint Laurent or LVMH’s Christian Dior came directly from Milan Fashion Week, and, when questioned, appeared to be unaware of the recommendation from France’s health ministry that they wear a mask in public."

March contracts on the S&P 500 Index dropped as much as 1.6% after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the patient doesn’t appear to have traveled to China or been exposed to another known case of the virus. Contracts also dropped after a speech by President Donald Trump failed to assuage investors’ concerns of the novel coronavirus derailing global growth.
S&P 500 futures were down 0.7% at 05:21 a.m. in New York, while both Dow Jones futures and Nasdaq futures slid 0.6%. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index sank 1.8%, as more companies warned that the coronavirus would hit profits.
Trump sought to calm markets after one of the worst stretches for American stocks in almost five years. The underlying index is mired in a five-day losing streak that wiped out more than $2 trillion in value from American equities. The U.S. urged travelers to reconsider trips to South Korea as the country’s number of cases rose to more than 1,500. New infections were diagnosed in countries from Pakistan to Brazil. Saudi Arabia halted religious visits that include stops in Mecca and Medina.
More coronavirus cases were reported in other countries than in China for the first time, the World Health Organization said, a significant development highlighting the spread of the epidemic around the globe.

940,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Coronavirus Hits the Weakest Hardest - Ask Norwegian Air,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- A characteristic of the coronavirus is that it seems to hit people with pre-existing conditions. The same appears to be true of companies.
Airlines, for example, have been roundly savaged by the markets since the outbreak began, as investors priced in a sharp drop in travel first within China, then to and from China, and, finally, globally. The International Air Travel Association said last week that the global airline business could lose $29 billion in revenue this year as a result of the outbreak.
But the airline that has suffered most, both in a European and a broader global context, is one that was already ill.
Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) has fallen 46% in the last week as the Covid-19 outbreak has spread decisively beyond Asia. It fell 12.7% by 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT) on Thursday alone as its profit-making transatlantic routes came under serious threat for the first time, with the confirmation of the first case of locally-transmitted Covid-19 in the U.S. 
Norwegian’s well-documented problems with debt and grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft mean that it can’t afford to be flying half-empty planes across the Atlantic, but that is now the threat that it faces, given the increasing signs that the virus is spreading on both sides of the ocean.
The new blow comes just as the restructuring actions taken by new CEO Jacob Schram had appeared to be gaining traction: passenger load factor, a measure of available capacity use, rose to 80.9% in January from 76,1% a year earlier. The airline was able to target a profit for the coming year, even if it didn’t quite convince investors it could do that well (the stock fell over 8% on the day).
Schram outlined further cuts to the carrier’s network two weeks ago when he unveiled its fourth-quarter results, and the airline now intends to cut available seat kilometres by as much as 15% this year.
But part of that announcement was a decision to double-down on U.S. routes. While the relative strength of the U.S. economy made that appear quite logical, the timing has proved unfortunate.
Norwegian isn’t alone in its troubles. Short-haul specialists Ryanair (LON:RYA) and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) have both fallen 21% in the last week as the virus reached Europe, while EasyJet (LON:EZJ) has fallen 27%. But none of those has the same kind of profitability problems as Norwegian, which lost over 2 billion kroner ($213 million) before tax in the fourth quarter, and which is struggling to cut debt as quickly as it’s cutting the ability to generate revenue to service that debt.
So far this year, Norwegian has underperformed the two New York-listed Chinese airlines (China Eastern (NYSE:CEA) and China Southern (NYSE:SO)) by over 20%. The Chinese airlines, however, have shown signs of bottoming out in the last few days. Their European counterparts show no such trend."
941,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 05:08AM ET</span>",AB InBev sees 10% hit to first-quarter profit from coronavirus,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The world's largest brewer  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) forecast a 10% decline in first-quarter profit on Thursday after the coronavirus outbreak hit beer sales during the Chinese New Year, sending its shares skidding.
The maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois said the virus had led to a significant decline in demand in China - both at bars and drinking at home, notably during the Chinese New Year.
The outbreak, along with an expected weaker Brazilian market, could lead to a 10% drop in first-quarter core profit (EBITDA) on-year, AB InBev said, adding that it expected 2020 core profit growth of between 2% and 5%, with most expansion occurring in the second half. 
The Belgium-based company, which sells more Budweiser in China than in the lager's key U.S. market, said the disease shaved up to $285 million off its revenue in China in the first two months of this year, 2.3% of its first-quarter group revenue last year.
It is the latest drinks company to warn that the outbreak is taking a toll on business, following Diageo's (L:DGE) alert on Wednesday that the fast-spreading virus in greater China and the Asia Pacific region could knock up to $260 million off its profit in 2020.
Nightlife ground to a halt in China in the third quarter last year, with many bars and restaurants shutting down due to the COVID-19 virus, AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito said, echoing comments from the world's third largest brewer Carlsberg (CO:CARLb).
BRAZIL ALSO WEIGHS
""Our business is all about going to restaurants, to nightlife, going out with friends, it's really about to go back to normal, we're preparing for the surge when things return to normal,"" Brito told reporters on a call.
Shares in AB InBev were down 7.5% to 57.25 euros in morning trade, the second weakest performer in the FTSEurofirst index (FTEU3) of leading European stocks. Jefferies analysts said in a note that growth ""is challenged with no more synergies and weak pricing"". 
More than half of the company's 33 Chinese breweries have reopened with the exception of the one in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, Brito said. The virus that can lead to pneumonia is believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan late last year.
The company's fourth-quarter core profit declined 5.5% to $5.34 billion, worse than market expectations of a 1.9% drop.
""Our performance in 2019 was below our expectations, and we are not satisfied with the results,"" Brito said.
Profit from both key markets - the United States and Brazil - dropped after AB InBev had oversupplied wholesales to the former earlier in the year, while higher costs for commodities and a weaker Brazilian real dented sales in the Latin American country.

AB InBev said results in Brazil in the first quarter would not match the very strong figures of the first months of 2019, when an exceptionally late Carnival (NYSE:CCL) led to revenue growth of 16.7%.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Aston Martin  (L:AML) shares slumped to a record low on Thursday after the British luxury carmaker said its losses ballooned last year and its chief financial officer would leave by the end of April.
The firm, famed for being fictional agent James Bond's car of choice, posted a pretax loss of 104 million pounds ($135 million) last year compared with 68 million pounds in 2018 following a 9% decline in sales to dealers.
Aston Martin is in the midst of restructuring after announcing last month that a consortium led by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll would buy up to 20% of the company and existing shareholders would inject more cash.
Its shares, which were listed in October 2018, have been on a steady downward trajectory ever since and hit a record low of 328 pence following the announcements on Thursday, more than 80% lower than their flotation price.
""The big difference between last year and this year is the strength of the balance sheet,"" Chief Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters. ""We're in a very different place and have therefore an ability to properly ... destock and that means get the balance right between supply and demand."" 
Chief Finance Officer Mark Wilson will step down from his role no later than April 30 but had not been fired, said Palmer. 
CORONAVIRUS IMPACT
China, Aston's fastest growing market, was a rare bright spot last year with sales rising 28% but the company, like the rest of the industry, has seen demand drop due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
The virus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed about 2,800, the majority in China, confining millions to their homes, disrupting businesses and delaying the reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break. 
Aston has seen disruption to the arrival of certain parts but said it had not had to stop production at its factories, with components secured until at least the end of March because it has no direct suppliers in China. 
""Since almost the first weeks of the New Year we've had issues with those Tier 2 and Tier 3 (suppliers) which have meant that our supply chain guys have had to be on it constantly,"" said Palmer. 
""We're ironically benefitting from the fact that we built up a Brexit stock,"" he said, in a reference to extra components the firm held in case Britain's departure from the European Union led to additional delays in the movement of goods. 
The firm said deliveries of its crucial first sport utility vehicle, the DBX, were scheduled for the summer but subject to any impact from the outbreak on the supply chain. 

As part of several changes announced in the last few weeks, Aston Martin is delaying plans to electrify its range, taking a 39 million-pound charge, and focusing on hybrid vehicles for now, starting with the Valhalla model in 2022.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, made a 19.9% return on investment last year, earning a record 1.69 trillion Norwegian crowns ($180 billion) as stock markets rallied, it said on Thursday.
The $1.1 trillion fund's return for the year was stronger than that of its benchmark index, it added.
""2019 has been a very good year for the fund ... this is the greatest increase in value in a single year in the fund's history,"" said central bank Governor Oeystein Olsen, who chairs the fund's board.
Last year's return on investment amounted to almost $34,000 for each of the 5.3 million people living in Norway, and the overall value of the fund is now equivalent to about $207,000 for every man, woman and child.
The fund holds stakes in more than 9,000 companies globally, owning 1.5% of all listed stocks. It also invests in bonds and real estate.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) contributed the most to the fund's return in 2019, followed by Nestle SA (S:NESN), while the worst performers were Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA),  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and  Swedbank  AB (ST:SWEDa), it said.
The fund, which saves revenue from the oil and gas industry, is now worth three times Norway's annual gross domestic product, and its returns provide vital funding for the country's extensive welfare state.
The 2019 accounts were the final annual report of Chief Executive Yngve Slyngstad, who announced late last year he will soon step down after a dozen years in the job.
A successor to Slyngstad, yet to be appointed by the board of the central bank, is expected to take charge within the next few months.

Zalando now plans to double its premium and luxury product ranges by the end of 2023, noting it had recently added high-end brands like Moschino Couture and Alberta Ferretti.
Co-Chief Executive Rubin Ritter said selling more premium products should help the group to boost its average basket value, a metric which has been under pressure as consumers shop more frequently on their smartphones but spend less each time, pushing up logistic costs.
In 2019, Zalando already registered 20 million searches for luxury brands it does not currently carry, Ritter told reporters, noting that the luxury sector was shifting online even faster than the rest of the fashion industry.
Major online luxury fashion players include Farfetch (N:FTCH), which listed in New York in 2018, Richemont's (S:CFR) Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter, and MyTheresa, which plans to list in New York this year.
Zalando also wants to tap shoppers' growing appetite for second-hand or vintage clothes due to rising environmental consciousness. The retailer will offer curated pre-owned fashion from the third quarter of 2020, also buying fashion from its customers.
Ritter said some customers were telling the company they only wanted to buy pre-owned items in future. ""It can be an integral part of our business model,"" he said.
Zalando cancelled a news conference planned for Thursday as a precautionary measure due to the coronavirus but Ritter said on a call with reporters the business was not currently impacted, although that could change. 
Zalando forecast sales growth of 15-20% for 2020, down from 20.3% in 2019, but hopes gross merchandise volume (GMV) - sales made on its website by itself or its partners - will grow 20-25%.
It said the forecast did not include a potential negative impact from the spread of the new coronavirus.
Zalando's shares were down 8.45% by 0839 GMT, making them the biggest faller on the German mid-cap index.
Fourth-quarter sales rose 19.5% to 2 billion euros ($2.17 billion), while adjusted earnings before interest and taxation came in at 110.4 million euros, both ahead of average analyst forecasts after a strong ""cyber"" week around Black Friday.
Zalando has seen its profitability squeezed by heavy investment in logistics as Amazon (O:AMZN) ramps up in fashion. The company said on Thursday it planned to invest around 330 million euros in 2020, including on a new warehouse in Spain. 
It has predicted a longer-term recovery in margins as it becomes more of a platform for brands - offering them logistics and marketing services - rather than just being an online seller of clothes, accessories and cosmetics.

Zalando said its partner programme accounted for 15% of its GMV at the end of 2019. Around 40% of partner programme items were shipped by its logistics service in the fourth quarter, with finance chief David Schroeder saying he expected to reach more than 50% this year.

946,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 04:17AM ET</span>",European Stocks Come Closer to Correction as Virus Cases Mount,"(Bloomberg) -- The sell-off ripping through European equity markets intensified on Thursday as the cases of coronavirus outside China continued to rise.
The region’s benchmark is nearing a correction, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index now down 8.9% since last week’s record high. The measure slid 2.3% as of 8:12 a.m. in London, with basic resources and travel and leisure industry groups lower, after the U.S. reported its first case of coronavirus that doesn’t have ties to a known outbreak.
Equities are plunging as the spread of the epidemic fuels fears about the impact on global growth and corporate earnings. More coronavirus cases were reported in countries other than China for the first time, the World Health Organization said.
“Given the recent volatility, fear is the dominant factor,” said Guillermo Hernandez Sampere, head of trading at asset manager MPPM EK. “In a very short period, we went from all-time high celebrations to panic mode. It’s too early to ‘buy the dip’ in my view and I expect investors to stay on the sidelines or increase cash.”
European equities have now wiped out all the sharp gains made since late October. The Stoxx 600 is on track for its worst week since August 2011. Stocks in Italy, the heart of the outbreak in Europe, fell 2.2% on Thursday. Greek stocks, last year’s big winners, are heading for one of the worst performances among global equity benchmarks this month.
Travel stocks tumbled yet again, down 3.3%. The sector has plunged the most among industry groups since Feb. 19.
Anheuser Busch Inbev NV (NYSE:BUD)joined the chorus of companies warning about the impact of the epidemic, with the world’s largest brewer forecasting the steepest decline in quarterly profit in at least a decade due to the coronavirus. Its shares fell 5%.
“Investors should minimize their exposure to industrial commodities, luxury goods and European airlines,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “We also favor quality stocks, especially large companies. “Defensive sectors such as utilities, real estate and health care are likely to do well in the equity markets compared to the broader markets.”
Seven companies including AstraZeneca Plc (NYSE:AZN), Barclays Plc (NYSE:BCS) and   HSBC Holdings   Plc (LON:HSBA) traded without the right to dividends today, shaving about 0.4 point off the Stoxx 600 and almost 28 points off the FTSE 100 Index."

Yields on 10-year Treasuries sank four basis points to a new record low of 1.292% on Thursday after the U.S. warned of the possibility that the virus is circulating in the nation, while infection counts mounted in Europe and Asia. Australia’s benchmark yield also fell to a record 0.84%.
“Bond yields can fall to as low as they want until central banks ultimately meet the market’s demands -- and that is for more rate cuts, especially from the Fed,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group in Melbourne, Australia. “Markets are really struggling to count the future economic damage from the virus and we’re seeing this huge re-allocation of capital to safety.”
Investors are pricing in a 90% probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut in April, swaps data show, while bets for easing from Japan to Australia have also increased after the International Monetary Fund cut global growth forecasts.
The drop in yields reflected an anxiety in markets as American health authorities said they’ve identified the first case of an infected person with no known links to an existing outbreak. Cases in South Korea skyrocketed past 1,000 this week, while countries from Italy to Spain have reported more patients.
Japanese Fears
Japanese funds are likely exacerbating the decline in yields during Asian trading hours as a rush to havens gathers pace, said Naoya Oshikubo, a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.
“Japanese funds including pension funds are likely buying U.S. Treasuries without currency hedges, pushing down yields during Asian hours,” he said. “The drop in U.S. yields comes amid speculation that the probability for the Fed to cut rates is high.”
Yields fell as much as six basis points across the U.S. curve. Japan’s 10-year bond also declined 1.5 basis points to minus 0.11%, while in New Zealand, it fell 7 basis points.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the 10-year Treasury yield could slip to 1.25%, while ING sees 1% as the outlook for economic growth grows grimmer by the day.
Emergency Plan
The International Monetary Fund said last week that it was looking at “more dire scenarios” where the spread of the virus continues for longer than expected.
The Australian government on Thursday activated an emergency plan to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, with the prime minister extending a travel ban on people coming from mainland China.
Money markets are pricing in a 25 basis point interest-rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia in July, taking borrowing costs to a record low 0.50%. Yields on Australia’s three-year government debt declined 5 basis points to 0.56%.
“The fall in the bond yields corresponds with the rise in the RBA rate cut expectations and weak risk sentiment of late,” said Fiona Lim, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd in Singapore. “Border restrictions do not help in the least and investors are probably bracing for ugly data out of China due as soon as this weekend.”"
948,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 03:53AM ET</span>","StanChart posts strong results but coronavirus, economic headwinds to hamper profit growth","By Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) booked a robust 46% jump in annual profit but warned a key earnings target would take longer to meet as the coronavirus epidemic adds to headwinds in its main markets of China and Hong Kong.
The epidemic could lead to a rise in bad loans, it said but did not provide specific guidance on the potential impact. Rival  HSBC Holdings  (L:HSBA) said last week it could face loan losses of up to $600 million if the virus outbreak persists into the second half of the year.
""The outbreak of the novel coronavirus comes with unpredictable human and economic consequences,"" Chief Executive Bill Winters said in a statement.
Noting that lower interest rates were also putting pressure on net interest income, StanChart said it would take longer to achieve its goal of a 10% return on tangible equity (RoTE) previously targeted for 2021.
The bank, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, posted a pretax profit of $3.7 billion for 2019. Although that was slightly below an average forecast of $3.9 billion, it marked the steepest profit growth since 2017 when the bank posted a six-fold rise.
Hong Kong's economy has been hit hard, first by anti-government protests and now by the virus as tourist arrivals slump and residents steer clear of shops. Many employees, including those at StanChart, are working from home.
The bank said its provisions for expected losses from Hong Kong bad loans rose by $46 million in the second half of last year.
Analysts and bankers have warned that lenders which derive a large part of their earnings from Hong Kong face at least two quarters of worsening asset quality and slowing loan growth as the virus outbreak hits trade and consumer banking.
StanChart also said it had approved a buyback of up to $500 million worth of shares starting shortly and will review the potential for making a further capital return upon the completion of the sale of a stake in Indonesian lender Permata.
Its Hong Kong shares extended morning gains to be up 2.5% in the afternoon trade after the results.
Winters won plaudits from StanChart investors for his first three years at the helm when he patched up the lender's battered balance sheet and tackled an internal risk culture that had grown reckless.
The bank last year embarked on a new three-year plan to double its returns and dividends by cutting $700 million in costs and boosting income.

Winters' pay fell 6% to 5.93 million pounds, after he and Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford agreed to a reduction in their pension allowance following pressure from investors who criticized them for enjoying greater benefits than the wider workforce.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets plunged again at the opening on Thursday, as data showed new cases of the coronavirus outside of China exceeding those inside the country for the first time.
Sentiment was also depressed by more corporate warnings about the hit to earnings and revenue, with AB Inbev spin-off Budweiser APAC reporting a drop in sales and   Standard Chartered   (LON:STAN) saying it still couldn’t estimate the scale of the damage. Overnight, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) had joined Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in saying it would miss its guidance for the current quarter.
By 3:35 AM ET (8:35 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 10.1 points or 2.5%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 2.6% and the German DAX was down 2.3% and the French CAC 40 was down 2.4%.
“We’re now in a situation where fear rather than reality is the main economic threat,” said UBS Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan said in a morning podcast, with an eye on business confidence data due out later from the European Commission.
With a deluge of companies reporting, what stood out were negative updates even from companies with relatively little exposure to the virus. In the U.K., Reckitt Benckiser took a multibillion write-down on its acquisition of baby-food maker Mead Johnson, while NMC Health ousted its chief executive Prasanth Manghat and put its chief financial officer on extended leave after an internal investigation unearthed accounting discrepancies.
Overnight, however, Chinese stocks had risen amid further evidence that the virus outbreak is receding there. Even so, Zhang Nanshang, a noted Chinese virologist, said he didn’t expect the outbreak to be fully under control until April (he had earlier eyed mid-February).
In other markets, Brent crude extended its declines as markets priced in a wider drop in demand for fuel due to the outbreak, while gold futures kept above $1,651 an ounce. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield fell another 2 basis points to -0.52%.
The euro, however, rose 0.5% against the dollar to $1.0930, as the first locally-transmitted case of Covid-19 in the U.S. prompted traders to question the ability of the U.S. economy to avoid a hit from the virus. The euro also rose 0.4% against sterling."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - British retailer  Tesco  (L:TSCO) has asked bidders to submit binding offers for its Asian business by Friday, in a deal that will see Thai billionaires fight for an asset valued at up to $9 billion, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The bidding is shaping up as a battle between Dhanin Chearavanont's Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group, Central Group, controlled by the Chirathivat family, and beer-and-property magnate Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi's TCC Group, they said.
Tesco's Asian operations comprise some 2,000 supermarket outlets and convenience stores in Thailand, where it is one of the biggest retail players, and 74 stores in Malaysia.
""This is a very competitive process pursued by serious bidders. Looking at the deal size and financing perspective, most large banks are involved,"" said one banking source who did not want be identified as the information is confidential.
Antitrust concerns could pose a challenge to some bidders as Thailand's antitrust office said last month that the deal should not violate anti-monopoly laws.
Tesco will review the bids and is set take a decision next month, the sources said.
The three Thai groups did not immediately respond to a Reuters query. There was also no response from Tesco, outside office hours.
Britain's biggest retailer said in December it started a review of its Asian operations, made up mainly of the Thai and Malaysian operations, after receiving interest.
In the six months to Aug. 24, Tesco's Thai and Malaysian businesses together generated sales of 2.56 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) and operating profit of 171 million pounds.
The sources said that though the tycoons are taking a long-term view of Tesco's Thai business, their bids are likely to factor in the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, which has curbed near-term growth estimates for the country.
Regionally, Thailand is considered one of the most vulnerable economies to the virus outbreak due to its heavy reliance on Chinese tourists and China trade.
Still, Tesco's business offers bidders a chance to scale up their portfolio significantly. ""How often do you get these assets in Thailand? And financing is so cheap,"" said another source.
For Central Group, Tesco's stores would bulk up its supermarkets and convenience business, while offering CP Group a chance to buy back the supermarket chain it sold to Tesco during the Asian 1997/98 financial crisis.
CP owns cash-and-carry  Siam Makro  (BK:MAKRO), which operates some 130 stores and over 10,000 7-Eleven convenience stores under CP ALL (BK:CPALL).
Sirivadhanabhakdi's TCC Group, through  Berli Jucker  (BK:BJC), already owns the country's second-largest hypermarket operator Big C Supercenter.
Tesco completed this week its exit from China with the 275 million pound sale of its joint venture stake to state-run partner China Resources Holdings."

From the production of raw materials and products through to customers' use and disposal, emissions shrank 4.3% in the fiscal year to the end of August 2019 to 24.9 million tonnes CO2 equivalents, it said.
""This was driven by a large increase of renewable energy in the production of IKEA products plus significant increases in energy efficiency of the lighting and appliances range,"" it said in a statement.
The world's biggest furniture brand's retail sales grew 6.5% to 41 billion euros. 
IKEA is aiming for its value chain to be climate positive - where it cuts more greenhouse gas emissions than it emits - by 2030. 
That translates to a reduction by at least 15% to around 21 million tonnes CO2 equivalents, it said in its annual sustainability report. 
IKEA produces around 10% of its range itself, mainly wood-based products, and sources the rest from suppliers.
To speed things up, in November in earmarked 100 million euros for encouraging direct suppliers to switch to renewable energy and an additional 100 million euros for projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere through reforestation and forest protection.
Helping store carbon already committed, besides capping emissions, is necessary to reach the target. 
A growing number of large companies are now looking to do so. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in January pledged to vacuum up all its historical emissions in its 45-year history. 
Inter IKEA's head of sustainability, Lena Pripp-Kovac, said she was hopeful emissions in IKEA's value chain this year would shrink further. 

Inter IKEA is the franchisor to store owners, of which Ingka is the main one.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 03:06AM ET</span>",Is new Disney CEO Bob Chapek up to the task?,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - A global pandemic and the challenge of figuring out the future of entertainment greeted Bob Chapek on Wednesday as he took over as Chief Executive Officer of Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).
Is he up to the task?
Investors were not convinced and sent Disney shares down 3.7% by the end of the day, but sell-side analysts largely endorsed the succession plan.
Former colleagues said Chapek is well-cast in his new role, at least until former CEO Bob Iger's contract ends on Dec. 31, 2021. Until then, Iger will be executive chairman and direct the company's ""creative endeavors."" 
The company declined to comment.
Over his 27 years at Disney, Chapek ran the Theme Parks and Consumer Products divisions, and was head of distribution at Studio Entertainment.
People who have worked with Chapek, 60, describe a numbers-driven executive with a strong operational background and focus on delivering quarterly results.
Chapek does not seek publicity, these people said, which would allow Iger to maintain a public role until he leaves Disney. The dynamic between the two will be more like a COO/CEO relationship than CEO and chairman, according to former colleagues.
""Chapek is a decent option for complementing the things that Iger doesn't want to do,"" said a former colleague. ""Disney keeps him doing the stuff he does want to do and lets Chapek worry about the trains running on time."" 
Over the next 22 months, Chapek can rely on Iger's creative instincts to navigate big decisions in the content world, such as whether the company's new streaming service, Disney+, needs more original programming, while Chapek focuses on crises like managing the coronavirus fallout, which could include a material impact on Disney's parks, cruises and film business.
Less certain is Chapek's ability to take bold steps in new directions, such as Iger's $71 billion gamble that by buying 21st Century Fox, Disney could build a subscription video streaming service to compete against Netflix (O:NFLX).
That bet led to Disney+, which is viewed as an early success with close to 30 million sign-ups. Maintaining that momentum will be harder as Disney faces new rivals such as AT&T Inc's (N:T) HBO Max, which is why the media and Wall Street largely expected Kevin Mayer, chairman of Direct to Consumer and International who oversees Disney+, to succeed Iger.
But Mayer, who has been at the company since 1993, had a relatively short time in an operating role compared to Chapek. 
The big question for Disney, said one former colleague, is what happens when Iger leaves the company. ""That's when the rubber hits the road.""

March contracts on the S&P 500 Index were down 1.4% as of 2:35 p.m. in Tokyo, after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the patient doesn’t appear to have traveled to China or been exposed to another known case of the virus. Contracts also dropped after a speech by President Donald Trump failed to assuage investors’ concerns of the novel coronavirus derailing global growth. Euro Stoxx 50 futures declined 2.7%.
“President Trump’s press conference was certainly intended to be a confidence builder but I don’t believe it will have much impact on stocks,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “The drop in futures illustrates that words from politicians are meaningless. I believe it will take assurances from the Fed to send futures in the opposite direction.”
Trump sought to calm markets after one of the worst stretches for American stocks in almost five years. The underlying index is mired in a five-day losing streak that wiped out more than $2 trillion in value from American equities.
The U.S. urged travelers to reconsider trips to South Korea as the country’s number of cases rose to more than 1,500. New infections were diagnosed in countries from Pakistan to Brazil. Saudi Arabia halted religious visits that include stops in Mecca and Medina.
“Investors will be looking at today’s New York open very closely, and despite comments from President Trump I think the initial move will be to the downside,” said Nick Twidale, general manager of IC Markets in Sydney. “Then the focus will increase on mainland U.S.A. to see if more cases become apparent.”
On Wednesday, the S&P 500 plunged more than 7% from records set just a week ago, as investors grew concerned the virus will derail global economic growth. The number of companies warning the virus’s spread would impact sales and earnings jumped, with the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). and United Airlines Holdings Inc.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.4% in a turbulent session, failing to hold a gain that at one point topped 1.7%. Fresh warnings of a pandemic from German and American officials added to the gloom, while  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc and  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) said that the outbreak will hit sales in China. The first cases in Greece and in South America emerged, while Spain locked down a seaside resort hotel with about 1,000 guests and workers inside.
The president sought to ease the market sell-off after Monday brought the worst rout in two years, tweeting, “Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” While that failed to stanch the bleeding, it echoed a prior Trump attempt to juice the market. On Christmas Day 2018, he called the bottom of a near three-month sell-off in U.S. equities.
“Donald Trump, during the campaign, will do everything possible to be re-elected. That’s very important to him,” Byron Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone’s Private Wealth Solutions group, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television with Vonnie Quinn and Guy Johnson. “If the Fed doesn’t, he will. But even if the Fed does act, you could expect some action out of him that will ensure his re-election.”"

The Wendy's Co (O:WEN) is set to break into breakfast on March 2, prompting rivals including McDonald's Corp (N:MCD),  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN) to defend their turf with new products and deals.
Over at least the past year, privately held Panera, based outside of St. Louis, has overhauled breakfast, adding wraps and souffles and has boosted coffee quality.
But it is still known more for soups, salads and sandwiches and has not previously done as much as other chains to cater to breakfast customers or market its coffee products.
""We can significantly leverage this as an unexploited menu item that we haven't used so far appropriately,"" said Chaudhary, who took over as CEO in May 2019.
Chaudhary believes the rewards program - which currently has 38 million members - will gain another ""few million"" members this year because customers must first join MyPanera in order to sign up for the coffee subscription.
He wants to grow total membership to 50 million in the mid-term, he said.
There are nearly 2,200 cafes in the United States and Ontario, Canada operating as the Panera Bread or Saint Louis Bread Co brands.
Panera has been testing the coffee subscription for over three months at 150 cafes throughout the cities of Cleveland, Columbus, Raleigh and Nashville.
In tests, the frequency of visits increased by more than 200 percent. Almost 70 percent of orders also included food items, and the subscription renewal rate was 90% to 95%, Chaudhary said.
About 25% of coffee subscriptions in tests were for new rewards program members - the majority of them also new to dining at Panera, meaning the program pulled in brand new customers.
The company believes the nationwide roll out will become profitable within the first month, though Chaudhary would not share financial figures.
The subscription covers hot coffee, iced coffee and hot tea drinks."

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo and General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's Cruise are leading a backlash against a California reporting requirement on self-driving vehicle test data that the companies claim is not relevant or accurate in measuring performance or progress.
Data released Wednesday by California showed Waymo and Cruise once again had the greatest number of test miles between ""disengagements,"" when a human driver must intervene to take control from a self-driving system during testing on public roads.
The disengagement data is widely used as a yardstick to compare companies testing self-driving vehicles on California roads, and is often cited as evidence that Waymo leads the sector.
Waymo tweeted that the disengagement metric ""does not provide relevant insights"" nor does it distinguish Waymo's ""performance from others in the self-driving space.""
At an investor conference on Wednesday, Dan Ammann, chief executive officer of GM's Cruise subsidiary, sidestepped a question about the relevance of the California disengagement data, saying ""there is no really great way to track"" the company's progress, other than its own internal data.
Data provided to California showed Waymo had 13,219 miles between disengagements, compared with 11,017 miles in 2018. Cruise reported an even greater improvement, with 12,221 miles between disengagements in 2019, compared with 5,205 miles the previous year.
Waymo said its self-driving test vehicles logged 1.45 million miles on California roads last year, while Cruise vehicles tallied 831,000 miles, most of them on the streets of San Francisco.
Mark Rosekind, a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and now chief safety innovation officer for self-driving startup Zoox, addressed the discrepancy between testing on congested city streets and on freeways, saying ""we have found that not all miles are created equally.""
""Our focus has been on the quality of these miles, not the quantity,"" he said, noting that Zoox more than doubled the number of test miles in 2019.
Aurora co-founder Chris Urmson, who previously headed Waymo's self-driving program, wrote last month that ""these numbers mean little when there's no clear definition of what constitutes a disengagement.""
The larger self-driving companies want to incorporate more and different data when measuring performance and progress, including miles logged in computer simulations.
Waymo also noted that much of its real-world system validation data comes from Phoenix, where the company has been testing self-driving vehicles for several years and operates a small commercial ride sharing fleet.
The company's self-driving performance in Phoenix ""is largely unrelated to our California testing,"" which Waymo said is mainly for engineering development.
""We don't think (California) disengagement data should be used to compare performance, or judge readiness or competency,"" Waymo said.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 11:48PM ET</span>",Judge throws out bribery charges in U.S. trial of former Alstom executive,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday tossed all bribery charges on which a former executive at French industrial company  Alstom  SA (PA:ALSO) had been found guilty at trial, a setback for U.S. prosecutors in a case that has tested the scope of an anti-bribery law.
The judge let stand the jury conviction on four money laundering charges of the former executive, Lawrence Hoskins, in November.
Hoskins, a UK citizen who had worked for Alstom in Asia, was charged in 2012 with conspiring to bribe Indonesian officials to secure a power plant contract, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.S. anti-bribery law.
The case has been seen by critics of the Department of Justice (DOJ) as reflective of an overly aggressive interpretation of the law, which makes it illegal for U.S. companies, and foreign issuers of securities overseen by U.S. regulators, to bribe foreign officials.
A DOJ spokesman declined to comment.
U.S. District Judge Janet Arterton, who is overseeing the case, had raised the bar for prosecutors in 2015 by ruling that to be convicted Hoskins would need to be proven an ""agent"" of a domestic concern. The DOJ failed to overturn that decision on appeal, but it was still able to get a jury in Connecticut to convict Hoskins on all seven FCPA-related counts.
Mike Koehler, a professor at Southern (NYSE:SO) Illinois University School of Law who has been critical of prosecutors' interpretation of the FCPA, called Arterton's ruling a ""big setback"" for the DOJ.
""While the legal issue is highly factual, the judge's decision today, as well as her prior decision in the case, are rejections of overly expansive FCPA enforcement theories,"" said Koehler, who writes a closely watched blog on the bribery law.
In her ruling, Arterton said prosecutors failed to sufficiently show that Hoskins was an agent controlled by Alstom Power Inc (API), the Connecticut-based subsidiary involved in bidding for the Tarahan power project at the heart of the case.
Arterton wrote that she found ""no evidence upon which a rational jury could conclude that Mr. Hoskins agreed or understood that API would control his actions on the Tarahan Project, as would be required to create an agency relationship.""
Hoskins is due to be sentenced on March 6.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Google persuaded a federal appeals court on Wednesday to reject claims that YouTube illegally censors conservative content.
In a 3-0 decision that could apply to platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle found that YouTube was not a public forum subject to First Amendment scrutiny by judges.
It upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit against Google and YouTube by Prager University, a conservative nonprofit run by radio talk show host Dennis Prager.
PragerU claimed that YouTube's opposition to its political views led it to tag dozens of videos on such topics as abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism for its ""Restricted Mode"" setting, and block third parties from advertising on the videos.
Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said YouTube was a private forum despite its ""ubiquity"" and public accessibility, and hosting videos did not make it a ""state actor"" for purposes of the First Amendment.
McKeown also dismissed PragerU's false advertising claim, saying YouTube's ""braggadocio"" about its commitment to free speech --such as ""everyone deserves to have a voice, and (the) world is a better place when we listen, share and build community through our stories"" -- were merely opinions.
Peter Obstler, a lawyer for PragerU, in an interview called the decision ""very limited,"" and decided only ""based on the facts alleged in this case.""
He said the decision did not address possible state law claims in California, where PragerU is suing Google and YouTube in a related case.
Farshad Shadloo, a Google spokesman, said the company's products ""are not politically biased,"" and the decision ""vindicates important legal principles that allow us to provide different choices and settings to users.""
Google and YouTube are units of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Donald Verrilli, a U.S. solicitor general under President Barack Obama, in a legal brief said courts have consistently found private companies such as Google, YouTube and Facebook did not qualify as state actors for First Amendment purposes.
He said a contrary view would ""change the Internet"" by threatening to make websites ""chock-full of sexually explicit content, violent imagery, hate speech, and expression aimed at demeaning, disturbing, and distressing others.""
Verrilli wrote on behalf of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, in support of Google and YouTube.
Wednesday's decision upheld a March 2018 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio on Wednesday asked the Trump administration to review the national security implications of AT&T's Inc's planned sale of its majority stake in Central European Media Group Enterprises (CME) to the Czech-owned conglomerate PPF Group.
Rubio, a Republican who chairs the bipartisan and bicameral Congressional-Executive Commission on China, wrote that the Czech company has a record of acting as ""China's proxies inside the Czech Republic"" and added that PPF-owned telecommunications firms are working with Huawei Technologies Co to develop 5G networks.
The CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) operates in the Czech Republic as well as Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, reaching around 97 million people and owns some of most-watched news programming in Central and Eastern Europe, said Rubio, who is also a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees.
AT&T (NYSE:T) did not immediately comment.
PPF said in a statement it appeared Rubio was relying on ""false information"" from a Czech politician and disputed his characterization of CME's market. The company said it had only inherited Huawei's technology as part of its acquisition of the Norwegian telcom operator Telenor last year.
""PPF is buying CME as a complement to its telecommunications business, without any ulterior motives. As part of the process of acquiring CME, PPF Group is cooperating with all the relevant regulatory bodies, and we are providing them with all necessary information,"" the company said, adding it will reach out to Rubio.
Rubio said PPF's subsidiary, Home Credit, hired a public relations firm aimed at ""manipulating Czech public opinion favorably toward China. This work included spying on Czech politicians, pressuring media to withdraw news articles critical of China, and creating a new think-tank, Sinoskop, to employ biased analysts to influence public debate.""
He asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review the transaction because it ""undercuts U.S. national security interests related to Central and Eastern Europe, as well as to China.""
The Trump administration added Huawei to an economic blacklist in May, citing national security concerns, and has lobbied foreign governments not to let Huawei take part in building 5G networks.

In October, AT&T said it would sell its majority stake in CME and receive $1.1 billion in cash and be relieved of a $575 million debt guarantee. AT&T acquired its stake in CME with the acquisition of Time Warner, now WarnerMedia, in 2018.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 07:19PM ET</span>","Global stocks outlook still positive, but vulnerable to coronavirus: Reuters poll","By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global stocks have further to run this year, but the likelihood of a correction of 10% or more is high, according to Reuters polls of market strategists, with the severity of the economic hit from the coronavirus outbreak being the biggest risk.
Last year was a bumper year for stocks, with all 17 top global indexes polled by Reuters ending the year higher than where they started. Only one did not rise by a double-digit percentage.
However, all but one are in the red so far this year, with most losses sustained over the past five trading days amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak will become a pandemic, disrupting supply chains and dealing a major hit to the global economy.
Fears of severe economic damage, even a global recession, have sent the MSCI all-country equity index to a 2-1/2-month low, wiping almost $3 trillion off its value this week alone. It has pushed safe-haven gold back towards a seven-year high and benckmark U.S. Treasury bond yields near a record low.
""The S&P 500 dropped 3.4% (on Monday), which once upon a time was just a normal bad day in the office, but in our new normal of central banks tacitly and U.S. presidents openly targeting stock prices as the key driver of the global 'economy', that kind of decline in plutocratic wealth is both rare and a nasty shock,"" said Michael Every, head of financial markets research for Asia-Pacific at Rabobank.
Still, the bull run in global stocks was expected to extend for at least another six months, according to 74 of 100 analysts in response to an additional question. Nearly 60 of those said it would last more than a year.
The Feb. 13-25 poll of more than 250 analysts, brokers and strategists, taken largely before this week's massive sell-off, showed all 17 indexes were expected to rise over the rest of this year.
But gains will be much weaker than last year and London's FTSE will end 2020 below where it finished 2019, according to the poll.
What is notable in this survey is that ever-bullish equity strategists are slightly more pessimistic and less confident than in previous polls.
""Global equity markets finally got the memo...that the global economic impact of policy measures to contain China's coronavirus outbreak will be really, really big,"" noted Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.
""We have no way of forecasting where or when this crisis will end, how far down equity prices have to go to make sense relative to scaled-down expectations for corporate profits.""
(GRAPHIC: Reuters poll graphic on prospects for global stocks - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/684/674/Equity%20wrap.png)
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
More than half of over 100 analysts said the risk of a correction of 10% or more was high, despite growing bets on monetary policy easing, with money markets now pricing rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.
That suggests expectations for monetary policy to be deployed again to head off any economic downturn would not favour stock markets as it did last year.
Economic contagion from the coronavirus outbreak has spread beyond China, a separate Reuters poll on Wednesday showed, with most major Asia economies expected to either slow significantly, halt or shrink outright this quarter. The impact is also being felt globally.
""Our concern is not about any immediate change in economic impact of measures to contain the coronavirus,"" added High Frequency's Weinberg.
""Nothing has changed since last week. What we learned in 2008 - as well as in 1929, 1971, 1982 and 1998 - is that a highly leveraged financial system is vulnerable in many ways to an exogenous shock. The coronavirus and the policy response to it are exactly that kind of exogenous shock.""
Financial markets have reacted more violently, with the recent pace of selling on Wall Street and beyond severe, suggesting the economic blowout from the virus would drag on and have an impact on the first half of 2020 and probably longer.
But with easy policy from central banks set to continue, the increasing schism between the gains in stocks and a global economy likely near its weakest since the financial crisis may extend this year. [ECILT/WRAP]
Referring to that split, and falling valuations after the latest stocks rout, Rabobank's Every said: ""It is, after all, cheaper to buy, and our underlying asset-pumping infrastructure is still intact, even if global supply chains and the real economy aren't.""

967,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 07:16PM ET</span>","Goldman, Citi Strategists Say S&P 500 Rout Is Bound to Worsen","(Bloomberg) -- The biggest sell-off in U.S. stocks in two years is just getting started, strategists at two of Wall Street’s biggest banks are warning.
While the S&P 500’s average correction has lasted for four months, this pullback is likely to be longer because of the lingering uncertainty over the coronavirus and the constraint facing Federal Reserve policy makers, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann and Alessio Rizzi at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). That means the retreat that started last Thursday might not find a bottom until at least July.
At  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., strategists led by Jeremy Hale are also leery, citing a lack of clarity on both the virus outbreak and Fed monetary policy. To illustrate where risky assets may become attractive, they pointed to the S&P 500 falling to 2,730, 10% below its 200-day moving average. Reaching that level would require the index to drop an additional 12% from its current level. That would put it on the edge of a 20% bear market decline when measured from the Feb. 19 record.
“We are reluctant to buy the dip in risk assets just yet,” Hale wrote in a note to clients. “It will likely take a further tightening in financial conditions to force the Fed’s hand into acting,” he said. “We await signs of a policy response to pull the trigger on risk.”
Recent remarks from Fed policy makers showed a continued plan to taper Treasury purchases throughout the second quarter, a stance that Hale and his colleagues say has added to investors’ angst. The strategists pointed out that a measure of financial conditions has tightened less than half the magnitude seen amid the rout in late 2018, which ultimately forced the central bank to reverse its stance and cut interest rates. That indicates that the market stress has to worsen before the Fed takes action, they said.
Goldman’s strategists are similarly cautious.
“Without more clarity on a stabilization of global growth, it seems too early to add risk tactically,” Mueller-Glissmann and Rizzi wrote in a note to clients. “With global growth still weak, the shock from the coronavirus lingering and less scope for monetary and ﬁscal easing, the risk of a more prolonged drawdown remains.”
U.S. stocks erased earlier gains Wednesday amid a barrage of reports on the widening coronavirus outbreak. The S&P 500 fell for a fifth day, extending its loss over the stretch to 8%."

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Transport Canada is mulling a Canadian supplement to the Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX's U.S.-developed flight manual, as the regulator weighs going beyond steps taken by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to end a global grounding of the model after two fatal crashes.
Transport Canada is among a core group of regulators, including the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), that are evaluating needed changes for the 737 MAX to fly again after nearly a year.
Transport Canada told Reuters by email on Wednesday it would not hesitate to add ""Canadian-unique"" non-normal procedures as a supplement to the MAX's aircraft flight manual, although its goal is still a ""harmonized approach"" with the FAA for the steps pilots must take during events related to system failures or malfunctions.
Canada's remarks illustrate the challenges faced by the FAA in securing a common global blueprint with foreign regulators for the 737 MAX to fly again.
Boeing has acknowledged that the timing of decisions to remove the no-fly order could vary among different regulators around the world that have each pinpointed their own concerns over the 737 MAX jet.
""We are not bound exclusively with what the FAA comes out with,” said David Turnbull, director of national aircraft certification for Transport Canada, during government hearings on Tuesday.
The FAA declined comment.
Transport Canada did not specify which Canadian-unique procedures it was referring to.
Following the crash of a Lion Air MAX jet in 2018, Transport Canada added the requirement of a five-step memorized pilot checklist in the case of a runaway stabilizer.
Canada is holding hearings on aircraft certification to study how the 737 MAX jet was approved to fly in the country.
EASA is not currently holding hearings but said it would address such lessons after the MAX is set to fly.
Canada accepted the FAA’s March 2017 certification of the 737 MAX under a reciprocal deal in which such approvals by the FAA are accepted by Transport Canada and EASA and vice versa.
Some of Transport Canada's concerns, like the need for simulator training for MAX pilots, are now being reflected in recommendations by Boeing, which changed its position on the matter in January, Turnbull noted. [L1N2AP0F8]
""Fortunately, in some cases, as the time went along they started to adopt these ideas,"" he said.
""I guess they came to their own conclusions and validated our concerns. But we’re not done yet."""

“We could see a significant impact on Europe, which has been weak to start with, and it’s just conceivable that it could throw the United States into a recession,” Yellen said Wednesday at an event in Michigan. “If it doesn’t hit in a substantial way in the United States, that’s less likely. We had a pretty solid outlook before this happened -- and there is some risk, but basically I think the U.S. outlook looks pretty good.”
The global economy was weak but starting to recover before the virus hit, Yellen said. The shutdown of factories due to the outbreak in China will impact supply chains and cause a drop in consumer spending as people have been quarantined or cease traveling.
Yellen, who spoke about the economy at an event held by the Brookings Institution in Clinton Township, Michigan, also commented on the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield this week to historic lows. Yields have plunged as fears about the spreading coronavirus have rocked global financial markets.
“Market participants will look to the Fed to provide some support,” Yellen said. “In most developed countries, interest rates are really low -- and they are very low in the United States, but higher than they are in most other developed economies. And the Fed does have some scope -- it’s not a cure-all. But it will provide a little bit of support to consumer spending and to the U.S. economy and for financial markets. And, of course, if it becomes very serious, fiscal policy could play a more active role too.”"

Investing.com - Stocks looked like they could stage a comeback when trading started today, but coronavirus headlines showed again how fragile demand for shares is.
Tomorrow there will be data on consumer demand for durable goods and the latest numbers on homes expected to be sold.
 Best Buy  and Beyond Meat lead the earnings calendar.
And bulls will be hoping for any signs from Federal Reserve speakers that the FOMC is prepared to lend a hand.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Durable Goods, Pending Home Sales Arrive
The latest durable goods orders will arrive at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT) tomorrow.
Economists expect the Commerce Department to report that orders for long-lasting goods fell 1.5% in January, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are expected to have risen 0.2%.
At the same time the second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP will be released, with economists expecting it to stay at the initial measure of 2.1% annual growth.
And weekly initial jobless claims are seen edging up to 212,000 from 210,000 the week before.
At 10:00 AM ET, the National Association of Realtors will release its January data on homes under contract.
Pending home sales are expected to have risen 2.2% last month.
2. Will Earnings B Good?
 Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) will keep the retail earnings parade going tomorrow, with the big box electronics chain issuing results ahead of trading.
Analysts predict that Best Buy will report a profit of $2.75 per share and sales of about $15 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
After the bell Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) will weigh in.
It’s expected to report earnings of 1 cent per share and sales of about $81.2 million.
The stock has been one of the high flyers this year, rising about 49% so far. It’s been benefitting not just from its own good news, but any good headlines for rival Impossible Foods, with investors betting on plant-based meat alternatives as a whole.
Today, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) said it would launch a Beyond breakfast sandwich in Canada.
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is testing Beyond Burgers in certain markets and a full rollout would bring $227 million to $306 million in incremental sales to Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Bernstein said earlier this month.
3. Market Still Hoping for Fed Clues
In the face of constant selling pressure, many investors are hoping the Fed will ride to the rescue (inter-meeting rate cuts are possible), or at least do some jawboning to boost hopes of easing as early as March.
The bond market is indicating lower interest rates ahead, but so far Fed speakers have been preaching from the too-early-to-tell hymnal. But pressure is growing, so a veiled hint isn’t out of the realm of possibility.
Tomorrow, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak at 11:30 AM ET (16:30 GMT).
Evans will give the keynote address at the Global Interdependence Center Members Delegation Event in Mexico City.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester will speak twice at the Women in Economics Symposium at the Cleveland Fed on panels at 3:30 PM ET and 7:00 PM ET."
971,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 06:07PM ET</span>",A new calculator sheds light on high-flying U.S. unicorn price tags,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
(Reuters) - Common shares in many high-flying venture-backed startup companies are worth less than headlines lead some people to believe, and an online calculator that two finance professors debuted on Wednesday can now quantify that discrepancy.
Stanford Graduate School of Business Professor Ilya Strebulaev and University of British Columbia Assistant Professor of Finance Will Gornall previously showed that headline valuation numbers do not reflect how the favorable terms large investors negotiate can lessen the value of common shares.
They built a tool that calculates the fair value of those shares and options and launched it at https://valuation.vc.
For example food delivery startup DoorDash raised its latest round at $189.70 a share, and the calculator put the fair value of a common share at $169. Impossible Foods' last round was at $10.60 a share compared with its fair value share price of $9.24, according to the calculator.
Both companies declined to comment.
The discrepancy arises because big investors including venture capital funds are able to command favorable terms such as a guarantee on their return when the company goes public.
Common share investors, such as employees who are granted shares or options, rarely enjoy similar terms.
A record number of unicorns, startups valued at $1 billion or more, were formed in 2019, often using their high valuations to lure talent, grab attention or ink partnerships.
When venture funds invest in fast-growing companies like scooter company Bird or Airbnb, those headline numbers are derived with simple math: The most recent price paid for a slice of the company is applied to the company as a whole to come up with a total valuation.
The calculator's fair value data would be helpful for startup employees to decide whether to leave a company and abandon the stock options, or at what price to sell their shares on an opaque secondary market for unlisted shares.
To build the calculator, the professors scraped public documents on more than 130 startups including incorporation documents.
Strebulaev and Gornall developed models to calculate the impact on common shares of provisions such as those that guarantee a return on investment to certain investors or give investors veto rights over initial public offerings.
Strebulaev said his team would continue to update and expand the calculator with the aim of bringing more transparency to the startup world.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A surge in small-cap Chinese stocks, fueled by government stimulus measures to support the virus-hit economy, is triggering fears of a repeat of the boom that preceded the 2015 market crash.
China has injected massive funds into the banking system, cut interest rates and encouraged lenders to extend cheap loans to limit the financial fallout from the coronavirus epidemic, which has hit businesses hard, from retailers to manufacturers.
Shenzhen's tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext (CNT) has jumped 13.1% this month through Wednesday, far outpacing the 1.7% gain in China's blue-chip CSI 300 index (CSI300).
A broader index of tech shares including start-ups and more established names such as ZTE (SZ:000063) has gained 14%.
""This is already a bubble. It's a game of the greater fool,"" said Shen Shikai, an investor who has been managing money pooled from his friends for over a decade.
""The economy has stalled for two months, and companies' first-quarter earnings will be ugly. Why on earth are stocks trading at such a level?""
ChiNext is trading at 59 times last year's earnings, up from roughly 30 a year ago and 47 at end-2019. In New York, the Nasdaq is trading at 26.5 times trailing earnings, according to Refinitiv data. Fan Huang, head of wealth management at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) (China) Ltd, said the central bank's monetary easing was ""directly contributing to investors' speculative activities.""
In a Feb. 24 blog post, he urged investors not to forget the lessons of the 2015 market meltdown. That crash wiped more than $5 trillion in capitalisation off the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, with ChiNext losing half its value within months.
Li Shoushuang, a capital markets lawyer at Dentons, called on the government to cool the market by introducing capital gains tax on share trading - something Beijing has always avoided.
""China's stock market is not a barometer of economic health. Rather, it's a barometer of liquidity,"" he said.
TECH FEVER
Some investors, however, believe the rally has solid footing, based in large part on Beijing's drive to make China more technologically self-sufficient as it battles the United States over trade.
Others are also pointing to an expected innovation boom in 5G, the fifth-generation wireless technology.
""If you look through the lens of China's great economic transformation over the next 3-10 years, you'll realize we're just at the starting point of a big bull (market),"" said Wen Xunneng, a Shanghai-base hedge fund manager. ""Don't fight the trend."" Adding to the fervour, mutual fund managers have been aggressively pitching tech-focused products.
Hwabao WP Fund Management Co's flagship technology ETF (SS:515000) has seen its assets under management nearly double this year to over 14 billion yuan ($2 billion).
Huang Yue, fund manager at Guotai Fund Management Co, was promoting products via an online roadshow on Tuesday that invest in the semiconductor, telecommunication, and computer industries.
""It's true that valuation of chip stocks is near historic highs. But we also expect to see a big jump in earnings.""
FROTH Bubble believers have pointed to particular share jumps as signs that markets have grown too frothy.
Shares in  Jiangsu Xiuqiang Glasswork Co  (SZ:300160) have tripled this month on speculation that the glass maker will enter into a tie-up with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The company says it's unaware of any factors that pushed up its stock.
Last week, cleaning robot maker Beijing Roborock Technology jumped 85% in its STAR Market debut after an initial price offering (IPO) oversubscribed more than 3,000 times.
""With all the millions and millions of Chinese on lock-down, more people have more time to dabble in the stock markets,"" said Grizelda Lee, head of discretionary portfolio management, Asia, Indosuez Wealth Management, referring to strict public health measures to contain the virus.
Daily trading volume in Shenzhen (SZSC) - home to many smaller firms - hit an all-time high on Tuesday, surpassing that of blue-chip and large-cap heavy Shanghai market.
Rocky Fan, economist at Sealand Securities, said regulators appeared to be tolerating speculation as a booming market will help already-listed companies raise fresh funds.
He cautioned against calling it a bubble, however, saying lower interest rates were also making stocks more attractive.
""You only know it's a bubble after it bursts.""

The company said the remaining elements of its fiscal third-quarter outlook were unchanged.
""Although we see strong Windows demand in line with our expectations, the supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated,"" the company said in a statement. (https://prn.to/2VlmHTI)
Broad swaths of the Chinese economy have shut down or slowed because of the virus.
Microsoft is the second company in the trillion dollar club to withdraw outlook. Earlier this month, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said that it may not be able to meet its March-quarter sales forecast.
The software maker had previously expected the More Personal Computing unit, which houses Windows, to post third-quarter revenue between $10.75 billion and $11.15 billion.
Its Windows and Surface computers had been more negatively impacted than expected, Microsoft said in a statement.

The coronavirus outbreak, believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.

Investing.com - Travel company Booking on Wednesday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, but its guidance fell short of estimates amid concerns about the coronavirus' impact on travel demand.
Shares fell 2.3% postmarket. 
""While the outlook for global travel in the near term is uncertain due to the coronavirus, we will manage the business appropriately to enhance long-term value for our stakeholders,"" CEO Glenn Fogel said in a statement. ""The coronavirus has had a significant and negative impact across our business during the first quarter. It is not possible to predict where, and to what degree, outbreaks of the coronavirus will disrupt travel patterns."" 
Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) forecasts first-quarter revenue within a range of $2.64 billion to $2.75 billion, adjusted earnings (EBITDA) in a range of $560 million to $590 million, compared with consensus estimates for revenue of $2.98 billion and EBITDA of $722 million.

Booking announced earnings per share of $23.30 on revenue of $3.34 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $22.03 on revenue of $3.29 billion. That compared with EPS of $22.49 on revenue of $3.21 billion in the same period a year before. Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) had reported EPS of $45.36 on revenue of $5.04 billion in the previous quarter. 
Profit for the quarter was supported by better-than-expected room nights growth,

New York (Reuters) - The S&P 500 fell for a fifth straight day on Wednesday and while its decline was slower than the last few days, the session was volatile as investors reacted to headlines about coronavirus and sought to gauge its economic fallout.
After rising as much as 1.7% in the morning, the S&P 500 hit a session low after health officials in Nassau County, New York, said they were monitoring 83 people who visited China and may have come in contact with the virus. Still, Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state has had no confirmed cases. {nL2N2AQ192]
Adding to pressure was a warning from U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials that the outbreak was on a path to becoming a pandemic, according to a report.
Earlier, stocks lost ground after Germany said it was heading for a coronavirus epidemic and could no longer trace all cases, and Norway confirmed its first case of the virus. For the first time, the number of new infections outside China overtook those inside the country, the source of the outbreak. 
Trading volume was far more active than usual, yet some investors were relieved the slide was slower. The S&P ended down 0.38%, compared with its 6.3% of losses in the previous two sessions.
""The market's default reaction function is when in danger or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout. That's what we've seen in the past couple of days,"" said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, an independent broker-dealer in Waltham, Mass. 
""The real story today was that it stopped going down fast ... news came in and the market thought about it and acted appropriately by selling off a little but not too much,"" said McMillan who estimates that equity investors have priced in two quarters of global economic fallout from the virus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123.77 points, or 0.46%, to 26,957.59, the S&P 500 dropped 11.82 points to 3,116.39 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.16 points, or 0.17%, to end at 8,980.78.
Of the S&P's 11 major sectors energy was the biggest laggard with an almost 3% drop, while technology was its outperformer with a 0.4% gain.
Many investors were cautious about making any big bets without more clarity on the spread of the virus.
""We need to more information before markets have a further correction or get comfortable things won't escalate further,"" said Jason Draho, head of Americas asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth Management, New York.
""Markets will be very jumpy until there's increasing confidence the virus is abating and that it won't be a global pandemic,"" Draho said. 
President Donald Trump, scheduled to hold a news conference on the coronavirus at 630 P.M. ET (2330 GMT), accused cable TV news channels of presenting the danger from the coronavirus in as bad a light as possible and upsetting financial markets.
The Dow ended the day 8.8% below its recent record close, reached Feb. 12 while the S&P 500 was just under 8% off its record high reached last Wednesday. Nasdaq finished 8.5% below its recent record. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.73-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 50 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 237 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 11.86 billion shares changed hands, below Tuesday's 12.33 billion, but well above the 8.23 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) largely maintained its key profit goals for the medium term on Tuesday, signaling steady but slower growth, and raised its financial commitment for clean-energy initiatives after years of pressure from environmental activists.
The largest U.S. bank will target $200 billion in lending and other financial services for green and sustainable companies and projects, up from an earlier target of $175 billion set in 2017, according to a presentation ahead of its annual investor day.
The new target, however, failed to satisfy some climate-change activists who flocked outside JPMorgan's New York headquarters, partially blocking some entrances and demanding that the bank get rid of fossil-fuel clients. 
At the investor meet, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said she was confident that the bank's near to medium-term growth would be backed by a robust U.S. economy, despite some near-term headwinds.
""We can outperform on a relative basis regardless of the environment,"" Piepszak said. ""Although risks are more skewed to the down side given ... risks like coronavirus, we are confident that the strength of our operating model will continue to demonstrate strength.""
The bank projected that return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a key measure used to determine how well a bank is using its shareholders' money, will be the same as last year's target of 17%.
However, JPMorgan cut its outlook for net interest income (NII) to $57 billion for 2020 from $57.8 billion in 2019, blaming lower interest rates.
The bank forecast NII of $60 billion or more for 2021, which was above analysts' estimates.
The bank also forecast higher expenses of $67 billion, compared with $65.3 billion last year, despite a ""reduction in structural expenses.""
UNCHANGED PROFIT GOALS
The presentation showed that JPMorgan's outlook remained unchanged for profit at its corporate & investment bank (CIB), a disappointment for analysts who had expected the lender to push for higher growth at the unit that accounted for a third of total revenue in 2019.
It expects return on equity of 16%, unchanged from the target that was set a year ago.
Targeted return on equity stayed unchanged at 25%-plus for the consumer & community banking segment, and remained flat at 18% for the commercial banking segment.

JPMorgan also maintained the outlook for the asset and wealth management business and said it expected a 25%-plus return on equity in the medium term.

981,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 04:26PM ET</span>","Fed May Cut as Soon as March Based on Market History, BMO Says","(Bloomberg) -- Market pricing suggests that a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut could be in the cards as soon as March or April, even though the first quarter-point reduction isn’t being fully priced in until around June.
That’s the view of BMO Capital Markets’ Jon Hill and Ben Jeffery, who said that, since the 1980s, front-end markets have almost never priced in cuts to this extent without the Fed following through. And most of the time, that accommodation comes within two months, according to the firm.
Based on BMO’s analysis, “a move March or April is on the table in 2020,” the strategists wrote in a note Wednesday. The Fed likely won’t be able to “escape” cutting rates at some point in coming months so it may be “tactically prudent” for investors to take advantage of any occasions when front-end rates rise, they wrote.
Yields have plunged across the U.S. curve as fears about the spreading coronavirus have rocked global financial markets, with the 10-year Treasury rate on Wednesday dipping to a record low below 1.30%. Fed funds futures show the odds of easing at the Federal Open Market Committee’s March or April meeting have been rising, with a 25-basis-point shift completely priced in by mid-year.
In eurodollar options, additional demand emerged on Wednesday for protection against faster and deeper rate cuts.
The BMO strategists point to the implied rate on the one-year forward eurodollar futures contract, which has fallen to more than 60 basis points below the middle of the FOMC’s target range for fed funds. In past comparable episodes, the Fed has almost always delivered a cut within one to two months, they said. The only exception was the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.
“Our base case is not necessarily March or April, but April is certainly more likely than March because we’ll have seen more data releases on the economic impact of coronavirus,” Hill said by phone. While two months “is not a hard and fast rule,” March and April are “live possibilities” and the first rate cut would probably be 50 basis points instead of 25, according to Hill.
At this stage though, top policy makers have been downplaying such prospects. In remarks Tuesday, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida signaled that policy makers won’t be rushed to judgment on the need to cut rates. He said it’s “still too soon” to say whether the coronavirus outbreak will cause a material change in the U.S. outlook."

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar confirmed a new case of the coronavirus in the U.S., taking the total to 15 so far.
The update came on the heels of reports that Nassau County health officials placed 83 Americans in self-quarantine after they return to New York from China. So far, 27 people have tested negative out of the 83 in quarantine.
A rise in cases elsewhere also stoked concerns that the spread of the virus is intensifying, with Germany's health minister warning the country is at the beginning of a coronavirus epidemic.
The reports unnerved investors and triggered a sea of red across stocks, turning the broader market negative.
Energy stocks erased early-day gains, ending the day 3% lower, as fears about weaker oil demand offset data showing a smaller-than-expected build in weekly U.S. crude supplies.
Tech stocks also shed gains, but ended in positive territory overall, supported by a climb in shares of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Quarterly earnings also garnered investor attention but did little to influence direction.
Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) slipped 4.5% as traders weighed up the home-improvement retailer's weaker-than-expected revenue and comparable sales against better-than-expected earnings.
Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) fell 4.6% as weaker guidance offset earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.

There is no truth to the report, a source close to the company said, while Nokia declined to comment. (https://bloom.bg/3a1uMAW)
The company, which competes with Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Huawei [HWT.UL] for 5G network equipment, said in February it expects intense competition to continue in 2020, as rivals seek to grab market share.
5G networks are at the center of a brewing technology war between United States and China, as they are expected to host critical functions including driverless vehicles, smart electric grids and military communications.
Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the United States and its allies should consider investing in Nokia and Ericsson to counter Huawei's dominance in 5G technology.

Nokia's U.S.-listed shares were up about 9% in afternoon trading.

The Trump administration said it doesn’t plan to appoint a “czar” to take over response to the coronavirus, pushing back on a report in Politico that it was considering doing so.
White House spokesman Judd Deere said the talk of a czar being appointed wasn’t accurate:
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has been leading an administration task force on the virus, and has said U.S. containment efforts have been working well so far. “I don’t anticipate one, I think this is working extremely well,” he said Wednesday, responding to questions about the appointment of a czar from Congress. “That would be for the president to decide.”
Trump Administration Could Seek More Virus Funding (10:45 a.m. NY)
Azar suggested the Trump administration may seek more money for a virus response than the $2.5 billion announced on Tuesday. He told a House panel Wednesday that the administration is planning to spend “at least” that amount and would work with Congress on a final figure.“We’re trying to be flexible,” he said in response to questions.Azar on Tuesday faced critical questioning about the administration’s response from members of both parties at congressional hearings on Tuesday.

Abe introduced a new government plan on Tuesday to control the disease that called on employers to encourage telework and stagger working hours in an attempt to slow the spread of the disease.
One major concern facing Abe has been whether the virus will derail Tokyo’s plans to host the Summer Olympics later this year. Japanese and Olympic officials have said there is no change to holding the games as planned, but there is a lot at stake for Abe. Tokyo has been preparing for the games for about seven years, spending more than $26 billion to ready the city, according to some estimates.
Hong Kong Unveils $15 Billion Stimulus Package (11:49 a.m. HK)

987,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 02:12PM ET</span>",Aston Martin investor blazes green trail for buyout fund,"By Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - The top shareholder of carmaker Aston Martin is on a mission to turn investments from theme parks to high-end furniture brands ""carbon positive"" by the end of 2020, as buyout funds battle to woo investors increasingly focused on tackling global warming.
Investindustrial committed to a series of ambitious environmental, social and corporate (ESG) goals when raising its seventh 3.75 billion euro ($4.08 billion) fund last year.
Chairman Andrea Bonomi, one of Italy's most famous business magnates who set up the European buyout group in 1990, told Reuters the firm was on track to become carbon positive across all of its investments by the end of 2020 - meaning it will offset more than the carbon emissions of portfolio companies. 
The firm wants 75% of electricity consumption across its investment portfolio to be sourced from renewable energy by 2020 and aims to hit 100% by 2027.
""It has been a long journey. As a firm we became carbon neutral ten years ago but we didn't stop there,"" Bonomi said.
""The ultimate goal is to raise the sustainability bar and cut fuel emissions across all our investments while keeping returns high. It is a tough balancing act as investors are no longer willing to accept returns at any cost.""
While most buyout funds tend to showcase ESG credentials to their institutional investors - typically pension funds, insurers and family offices - there is no industry consensus on how to measure their progress.
Investindustrial, which has Nordic funds among key investors including Denmark's biggest pension provider ATP and Sweden's AP2, has been working with the NYU Stern School of Business since 2016 to pilot a new system to track the financial benefits of ESG policies known as Return on Sustainability Investment (ROSI).
""We have been very satisfied with Investindustrial's way of incorporating ESG in their investments and they are without any doubt one of the funds in our portfolio which are among the best in that area,"" managing partner at ATP Private Equity Partners, Torben Vangstrup, told Reuters.
Since 2016, Investindustrial has pressured its portfolio companies to comply with the targets of the Paris climate agreement, urging them to switch to renewable energy, cut plastic consumption and improve recycled waste.
For example, Spanish theme park operator Portaventura, which has been backed by Investindustrial for almost a decade, recently launched a 100,000 square meter photovoltaic site that provides about 40% of its overall electrical consumption.
Aston Martin, meanwhile, has stepped up recycling efforts and is due to launch an all-electric version in 2025. Its newly-launched factory in Wales is fully powered by renewable energy.
""Large buyout funds have been quick at building ESG teams but execution takes time. It took us five years to figure out how to bring down the carbon footprint across our funds,"" Bonomi said.
LEEWAY
Investindustrial, which is invested in 20 companies primarily in Italy and Spain and ranks as one of southern Europe's largest private equity groups, expects its offsetting measures to reach 2.6 million total carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) - a gauge of such activity - by the end of 2020.
Its carbon reduction strategy partly relies on the development of a portfolio of nature conservation projects in countries including Guatemala and Canada.
Bonomi has built a five-strong ESG team, led by sustainability head Serge Younes, to support Investindustrial in screening targets and oversee the implementation of eco-friendly policies.
""Without ESG approval deals are not going through the investment committee,"" the 55-year-old said.
The New York-born businessman said its smaller size made it easier for Investindustrial to control ESG policy at its portfolio companies compared with heavyweight U.S. buyout funds.
""Every time you invest in a company the CEO will tell you that he operates 'within the law.' But that's not the point. Most companies have basic environmental policies in place,"" said Bonomi.
""What really matters is to make ESG an integral part of your decision-making process and drive returns in a sustainable manner.""

Investing.com – Stocks turned negative in afternoon trading Wednesday, erasing strong early gains, as a fresh warning the coronavirus is on the ""cusp"" of becoming a global pandemic stoked worries.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 140 points, or 0.52%, after rising more than 400 points. The S&P 500 slipped 0.49% and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.07%
An FDA official warned the Covid-19 virus is on the ""cusp"" of being a pandemic, Bloomberg reported. Germany's health minister, meanwhile, said the country is at the beginning of a coronavirus epidemic.
The eerie update from global health authorities turned energy stocks sharply lower as oil prices gave up gains, which had followed data showing U.S. weekly crude supplies rose less than expected.
In a sign the spread of the virus is gathering pace, 83 people in Nassau County New York were reportedly being monitored for exposure to coronavirus, according to published reports.
The updates seemingly forced investors to reassess the risk that the Covid-19 outbreak could be worse than feared, potentially sinking a recovery in the global economy amid easing U.S.-China trade tensions.
But some have tempered those fears somewhat, and suggested the recovery will continue, albeit at a slower pace.
""The impact of the coronavirus on trade in advanced economies has been limited, but if activity in China remains at a standstill for much longer, the damage is likely to be felt much more widely around the world,"" said Capital Economics' Bethany Beckett.
""The recovery in global trade we had expected this year will be delayed, not derailed,"" Becket said.
The bid in tech stocks also cooled, with chip stocks paring gains. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) were up just 2% after boasting gains of more than 4% just before the midday retreat in the broader market.
Investors also digested the latest wave of quarterly earnings.
The Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) fell 3% as weaker guidance offset earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.
Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) slipped 4% as traders weighed up the home-improvement retailer's weaker-than-expected revenue and comparable sales against better-than-expected earnings.

The government has threatened to withdraw the license of infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) after a bridge in Genoa operated by its motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia collapsed in August 2018, killing 43 people.
Atlantia has always denied wrongdoing in the disaster and says it will challenge any revocation in the courts, opening the way for a potentially long and costly legal battle.
The decree presented by the coalition government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party was approved in a confidence motion by 154 votes to 96.
The legislation had already been passed in the Chamber of Deputies and so now becomes law.
Governments in Italy often use confidence votes to hasten approval of bills by truncating debate and amendments. If a confidence vote is lost, the government is obliged to resign."
992,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>","Utility to pay $53 million, plead guilty over Massachusetts gas explosions","By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A utility operator blamed for catastrophic gas explosions in Massachusetts in 2018 will pay a $53 million fine and plead guilty to violating a federal pipeline safety law as part of a deal in which its parent NiSource Inc (NYSE:NI) has agreed to sell the company and exit the state. 
Federal prosecutors in Boston on Wednesday said Columbia Gas of Massachusetts will plead guilty to violating the Pipeline Safety Act to resolve a probe into to the disaster, which killed one person, injured 22 others and destroyed multiple buildings.
NiSource, as part of a deferred prosecution deal, also agreed to sell Columbia and exit Massachusetts, a condition U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said was meant to ""vindicate"" the outrage of residents of Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, where the blasts occurred.
""Clearly what happened here is this particular company couldn't be bothered to maintain the safety of its customers,"" Lelling said.
Merrillville, Indiana-based NiSource, which serves nearly four million natural gas and electric customers across seven states, said in a statement it took full responsibility for the ""tragic events.""
Prosecutors said Columbia recklessly disregarded minimum federal safety standards, causing its gas pipelines to become over-pressurized, which led to the Sept. 13, 2018, explosions in the three communities northwest of Boston.
The blasts occurred while Columbia was replacing cast-iron pipes with plastic lines. They damaged about 131 homes and commercial buildings and prompted the evacuation of thousands of residents.
Prosecutors said Columbia failed to account for pressure detectors while workers replaced aging cast-iron pipes and failed to follow any plan to prevent the over-pressurization that resulted.
The allegations mirrored the findings of the National Transportation Safety Board, which in September said that ""weak engineering management"" did not adequately plan and oversee the project.
No individual employees will be charged, Lelling said, as the case was the result of not one person's actions but a ""complete organizational failure."" 
The deal is separate from a $143 million settlement the company reached in July to resolve lawsuits brought by residents and businesses affected by the explosions and an $80 million accord it struck with the three communities.

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's shareholders on Wednesday defeated a proposal critical of its removal of apps at the request of the Chinese government, but the proposal drew a much higher proportion of votes than similar proposals in previous years which had gained support only in single-digit percentages.
The proposal had called on the iPhone maker to report whether it has ""publicly committed to respect freedom of expression as a human right."" Shareholders defeated it, with 59.4% voting against and 40.6% voting in favor.
The proposal highlighted Apple's 2017 removal of virtual private network apps https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-apple-vpn/apple-says-it-is-removing-vpn-services-from-china-app-store-idUSKBN1AE0BQ from its App Store in China. Such apps allow users to bypass China’s so-called Great Firewall aimed at restricting access to overseas sites.
Apple shareholders have voted down human rights measures related to China in the past. They defeated a 2018 proposal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-shareholders/apple-ceo-downplays-special-dividend-at-shareholder-meeting-idUSKCN1FX2GA that urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China, with 94.4% of shareholders voting against it.
Apple opposed this year's proposal, saying the company already provides extensive information about when it takes down apps at the request of governments around the world and that it follows the laws in countries where it operates. 
"" (W)hile we may disagree with certain decisions at times, we do not believe it would be in the best interests of our users to simply abandon markets, which would leave consumers with fewer choices and fewer privacy protections,"" Apple said in its opposition.
Proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services both recommended votes in favor the measure, according to reports from them seen by Reuters.
The freedom of expression proposal was one of six to be voted upon at the company's annual shareholder meeting at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California.
By wide margins, shareholders approved Apple's executive pay, existing board of directors and the retention of Ernst & Young as its accounting firm, results that were widely expected.
Shareholders defeated a ""proxy access"" proposal to allow shareholders to nominate more than one director to Apple's board, with 68.9% voting against and 31.1% voting for. They also voted down a measure to tie executive compensation to environmental sustainability metrics, with 87.9% voting against and 12.1% for. 

Apple had opposed both proposals.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 01:13PM ET</span>",Walmart in talks with possible buyers for Asda stake,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Walmart (N:WMT), the world's largest retailer, is in talks with possible buyers of a stake in its British supermarket Asda, which it failed to combine with Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) last year.
Asda and Walmart said in a joint statement on Wednesday that discussions with ""a small number"" of suitors followed ""inbound interest"" but no decisions had been taken.
In common with its traditional big four British rivals - market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's and Morrisons (L:MRW) - Asda has been losing market share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are still opening lots of new stores.
That has put pressure on Asda, which said last week that budget-conscious British consumers were behind a fall in underlying sales in the key Christmas quarter.
""We are currently considering whether there is an opportunity for a third party to invest in Asda, alongside Walmart, in order to support and accelerate the delivery of Asda's strategy and position Asda for long term success,"" Walmart and Asda said in a joint statement.
The potential buyers share Walmart and Asda's commitment to growing the British business, they added.
Walmart would likely retain a significant minority stake in Asda in any deal, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Analysts said private equity firms are most likely to be interested in taking a stake in Asda, which Walmart bought for 6.7 billion pounds ($8.7 billion) in 1999.
Walmart said it was considering a separate stock market listing for Asda in April after Britain's competition regulator blocked Sainsbury's attempt to buy the firm for 7.3 billion pounds and become the country's biggest retailer, 
Asda Chief Executive Roger Burnley told Reuters in July an initial public offering could happen in two years.
In October, Asda agreed a 3.8 billion pound 'buy in' with Rothesay Life to secure the benefits for 12,300 members of one of its pension schemes, simplifying its balance sheet ahead of a possible standalone listing. 
Walmart said on Wednesday an IPO remains an attractive long-term objective for Asda.
""Asda is a great business with a clear strategy for the future and Walmart is committed to ensuring it has the resources and support it needs to deliver that strategy,"" it said. 
The U.S. retailer has focused on turning around its international business by targeting bigger and higher growth markets such as China and India and exiting or tying up with local players elsewhere. 
It sold a majority stake in its Brazilian business and acquired a majority interest in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart in its biggest-ever deal in 2018.

996,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 01:13PM ET</span>","Lloyds, Virgin Money cut jobs as UK bank customers shift online","By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and Virgin Money (L:VMUK) pressed ahead with hundreds of job cuts in the face of union opposition, as British banks try to keep up with customers moving online.
Lloyds is planning to axe 780 jobs as part of ongoing cost-cutting at Britain's biggest domestic bank, union Unite said on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Virgin Money said it would cut 500 jobs and close 52 branches, as it strips out costs after the takeover of Virgin Money by Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group in 2018.
Lloyds employed 63,000 people last year, while Virgin Money had 8,700 employees.
British banks have shrunk since the financial crisis and have continued to cut staff in recent years in response to squeezed profit margins and growing demand for digital services.
Unite said Lloyds had informed its workforce of the planned job cuts, describing the move as ""deeply alarming"".
A Lloyds spokeswoman said it was reducing the number of roles across its branch network but did not comment on numbers.
Lloyds reported a 26% drop in annual profit last week after being hit by bad debts and billions of pounds of customer compensation.
It has cut around 5,000 staff in the last two years, according to regulatory filings.
""The decision by Lloyds Banking Group to cut the equivalent of 780 staff from its branches is yet more evidence of the bank's profits over people culture,"" said Scott Doyle of Unite.
'DIFFICULT DECISIONS'
Lloyds issued guidelines last month on treating staff fairly after a rise in complaints to another union about working conditions across its dwindling retail network.
""As customers are using our branches less often, we are reducing the number of roles across our branch network,"" the Lloyds spokeswoman said.
""This means we can shape our service according to customer behavior and local demand. Change does mean difficult decisions and we are focused on supporting our colleagues at this time.""
Virgin Money said most of the latest job cuts would be at its head offices, adding it would redeploy staff where possible.
The cuts follow 330 job losses announced in September and are part of Virgin Money's overall plan to reduce its headcount by 16% following its takeover deal, which is equivalent to around 1,500 job losses in total."

999,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 12:58PM ET</span>",Eurex senses Brexit momentum in euro clearing battle with London,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit and other tailwinds will help Frankfurt build stronger momentum this year to attract more euro clearing from London without the need for extra customer sweeteners, a senior Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) Group official has said.
Even before Britain's departure from the European Union last month, EU policymakers have long bristled that LCH, part of the London Stock Exchange, clears the bulk of interest rate swaps (IRS) denominated in the euro.
""Emotionally, the Europeans are very committed to gaining control of the euro as a currency in all its forms like clearing house activity,"" Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, told parliament on Wednesday.
""I would expect them to push quite aggressively to re-shore that to the European Union and away from the United Kingdom."" 
The push began in 2017 when Eurex Clearing, an arm of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse, launched a profit-share to reward its 10 most active customers that increase clearing in euro-denominated interest rate products.
Matthias Graulich, a Eurex Clearing board member, said there are now 320 interest rate customers, up from 130 at the end of 2018.
""A third of our on-boarded clients were active towards the end of last year. The focus this year is to activate the ones not yet active.""
Many of these clients say they will start clearing at Eurex this year due to factors like the profit-share scheme and uncertainty over whether Britain will have access to the EU financial market from next January, Graulich said.
LCH, which declined to comment on its euro clearing strategy, will need EU permission known as equivalence to continue serving customers in the bloc after a ""standstill"" transition period ends on Dec. 31.
Eurex says it now has an 18% market share in terms of the notional value of outstanding contracts for euro-denominated interest rate products that are traded off an exchange.
""This is well on our way to our target of 25 percent, which we are set to achieve this year,"" Graulich said.
Eurex notional outstanding market share in clearing longer-dated euro swap contracts has risen fourfold since the start of the partnership program. It stood at just over 12% in January compared with just under 90% at LCH, Eurex said.
Other favorable tailwinds for Eurex include interest rates in the United States and the euro zone converging over the last six months.
Graulich said this means hedge funds are reviewing their portfolio efficiencies as offsets between dollar and euro swaps are reducing, and they could pool euro swaps with other euro products.
France's finance ministry and central bank has also begun putting more pressure on banks to voluntarily shift euro clearing from London to the EU.
""All these developments are going in the right direction to successfully establish an alternative liquidity pool for euro based OTC derivatives within the EU,"" Graulich said.
""There is no inflexion point where everything switches from one platform to another.""
With migration seen as more of a medium term project, Eurex said it has no plans to beef up sweeteners.

Although LCH has a subsidiary in Paris, it may not make economic sense to fight off Eurex by investing large sums of money on a swaps clearing operation in the French capital.
Clearing euro rate swap trades from EU customers was just 6% of LCH's total swaps clearing turnover of $576 trillion in the first half of 2018.
LCH has clung to its dominant market share so far by offering savings to banks from net positions across several currencies, not just the euro, a benefit industry officials say will be hard for Eurex to replicate anytime soon.
ISDA, a global swaps industry body, has estimated that fragmenting euro swaps clearing would result in a 16%‐24% increase in initial margin on house accounts, based on data from 12 large banks that dominate trading.
""It's a bit like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the more clients you have the more efficient it gets,"" said Ulrich Karl, head of clearing at ISDA.

LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (L:BP) will leave the main U.S. refining lobby and two other trade groups as new Chief Executive Bernard Looney spurs some of the oil sector's most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions. 
The decision follows a review of its membership in over 30 associations around the world, which Looney said in a post on Instagram was aimed at boosting people's trust in the oil and gas company. 
""BP will pursue opportunities to work with organisations who share our ambitious and progressive approach to the energy transition,"" Looney said in a statement.
BP said its view on carbon pricing, which it says is key in the energy transition, were ""at odds"" with those of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), which has around 300 members.
""Currently we have no areas of full alignment,"" BP said. 
It will also not renew its membership in the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) and Western Energy Alliance (WEA).
""AFPM is and has been committed to supporting policies that address climate change,"" said AFPM Chief Executive Chet Thompson. ""Because of that, it leads us to assume that this decision was made based on factors other than our actual positions on the issues."" 
Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at Federated Hermes, which has led talks with BP on shareholder climate resolutions in recent years, welcomed the move.
""Supportive public policy is vital to achieving BP’s bold vision to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner,"" Duguid said in a statement.
BP has called for placing a price on carbon emissions in order to push out the most polluting fossil fuel production including coal and encourage investment in renewable energy.
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) last year both said they would not renew their memberships in the AFPM. 
BP, one of the largest U.S. refiners and petrochemical producers and fuel retailers, will a member of the American Petroleum Institute, the country's largest energy association, drawing criticism from climate campaigners. 
""The industry’s response to climate change is the key question that will define their performance and viability,"" Ben Ratner, senior director at Environmental Defense Fund (EDF (PA:EDF)) told Reuters.
BP, Shell and others that in recent years have been investing in cleaner fuel technology have also opposed AFPM's efforts to oppose standards requiring refiners to blend or subsidise the blending of biofuels into the gasoline pool, saying it hurts independent refiners. 
The AFPM has around 300 U.S. and international members including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) which operate 110 refineries and 229 petrochemical plants, its 2018 annual report showed.
Exxon said it routinely evaluates trade group memberships on an annual basis. Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
BP operates three U.S. refineries including the 430,000 barrels per day Whiting, Indiana plant, its largest.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union will launch talks next Monday on a new post-Brexit partnership due to start in 2021, but the two sides are already trading barbs on the scale and scope of their trade cooperation.
Britain says it wants a simple free trade agreement such as the EU has with Canada or Japan, which would mean significantly more trade frictions than there are currently between the world's largest trading bloc and its fifth biggest economy.
But the EU's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said on Wednesday that was not on offer without solid ""level playing field"" guarantees of fair competition ahead.
Here are the EU's arguments for refusing to grant Britain a plain trade deal.
PROXIMITY
Unlike Japan, Canada, Chile, South Korea or Mexico, which sit thousands of kilometers away from EU's borders, the UK is the bloc's immediate neighbor and so its ability to impact the continent's cherished internal market is exponentially bigger.
""The UK says that it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada,"" Barnier said.
TRADE VOLUMES
Unlike with the more distant countries, the EU says the UK will be its third-largest trading partner when the current transition period - during which Britain remains bound by EU laws and regulations - ends on Dec. 31.
The EU's 2018 imports from the UK amounted to 197 billion euros, more than the 125 billion euros worth of combined imports from Canada, Japan and South Korea, according to the executive European Commission.
HISTORIC INTEGRATION
The EU highlights ""economic interconnectedness"" with Britain, which ceased being a member of the bloc on Jan. 31 after nearly half a century. That makes the situation entirely different to that of other countries on other continents.
""The EU isn't a prison – you can leave, but there are many different consequences for many different people,"" Barnier told the European Parliament.
""SINGAPORE ON THAMES""
That is why the EU demands strong guarantees of fair competition from Britain from 2021, especially given London's stated ambition to move away from EU rules on everything from environment and labor to competition, state aid and taxes.
The EU fears that a big, economically powerful close neighbor could adopt dumping practices and quickly become a ""Singapore on Thames"" that would undercut the bloc's own market.
Through closely monitoring the so-called rules of origin, the EU wants to make sure goods coming tariff- and quota-free from the UK are not just cheaper products from elsewhere in the world that get assembled in Britain.
WHAT IF NO DEAL BY END-2020?
Barnier said the EU would not seek a deal ""at any price"" but Brussels seems keen to keep Britain closer in the future than Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants.
Should the sides fail to seal a free trade deal or agree to extend the transition period, they would default to basic trading rules under the World Trade Organization, which would entail customs tariffs, quotas and cumbersome paperwork."

Novick, 59, will continue in her current role until her successor is chosen, after which, she will serve as a senior adviser to the company, according to the memo.
She will also assist in conducting internal and external searches to find her successor. 
""Much of the post-financial crisis policy work that Barbara led is largely implemented, and she has greatly enhanced our stewardship practices, including our commitment to transparency"", Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the memo. 
Less than half of BlackRock's original slate of eight co-founders will remain at the firm once Novick leaves. 
She has been vocal on issues, including CEOs serving on other companies' boards.
""It sounds fine to sit on multiple boards, but what happens when something goes wrong at a company?"" she said in an interview last year.

The news of Novick's departure comes months after BlackRock announced the exit of Mark Wiseman, global head of active equities, following a violation of the company's ""relationships at work policy"".

Chapek headed Disney's parks business, its largest, and oversaw the opening of the company's first theme park and resort in mainland China and the creation of the new Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge lands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
While Wall Street analysts were largely positive about the change, some were skeptical.
""Bob Chapek has less (content experience), having spent his Disney career in distribution of content and/or the physical world of parks, retail, and consumer products (ie, minimal storytelling, despite the fact that even he says that storytelling is at the center of Disney's value proposition),"" Needham analyst Laura Martin said.
Two former employees Reuters talked to expressed surprise that Kevin Mayer, chairman of Direct-to-Consumer and International, was not named to the top job, especially after the roll-out of the Disney+ streaming service, which attracted 10 million sign-ups in its first day.
Most analysts, however, agreed that the move ended years of speculation on who would take over Hollywood's most powerful studio, built up by Iger through acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox.
""The move takes CEO succession uncertainty off the table; we expect the markets to digest this news and ultimately give Chapek the benefit of the doubt as the new CEO,"" Cowen and Company analysts wrote in a note.
To be sure, Iger is still keeping a significant role at the company. He will assume the post of executive chairman and direct the company's ""creative endeavors"".
""The fact that Bob Iger believes it's a full time job to sort out the content assets over the next 2 years implies it's a bigger mess over at the Fox content assets than we thought,"" Martin said.
Chapek will face some immediate challenges including building on the early success of Disney+ and charting a strategy for Hulu to be profitable, Cowen analysts added.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets staged a modest bounce at the opening of trade on Wednesday, after President Donald Trump lashed out at mainstream media for “panicking markets” with reports about the coronavirus.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 237 points or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3%.
They’ve still all lost between 7% and 8% over the last week, however, as fears of the Covid-19 hurting economies outside China and the Far East have grown. Anecdotal evidence continued to show a gradual recovery in Chinese economic activity and a further slowdown in the incidence of new cases in the country on Wednesday.
“The market was overbought and was riding for a bit of a fall,” Charles Dumas, chief economist at TS Lombard in London, said on a call with clients. “We don’t think the market is excessively overpriced at this point.
Earlier, President Trump had tweeted that network news channels were “doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets.”
His comments came less than a day after the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the country’s lead scientific agency for fighting epidemics, said that Americans should prepare for the outbreak to spread to U.S. communities.
Trump said he would hold a press briefing on the subject at 6 PM ET in Washington.
Among individual stocks, Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) fell 1.1% after abruptly announcing on Tuesday evening that CEO Robert Iger will step down with immediate effect. His successor will be Bob Chapek, a long-serving company insider who currently runs the theme parks division.
Another decliner was Virgin Galactic, which fell 3.4% after reporting its net loss widened to $73 million in the fourth quarter from $46 million a year earlier.

“We are actually seeing some bullish sentiment, with traders getting longer or monetizing hedges they’ve had on,” Amy Wu Silverman, an equity-derivatives strategist at RBCCM, wrote in an email Tuesday. “The options market does not suggest all out panic.”
For one, while implied volatility for the U.S. stock market has surged, gauges tracking longer-term swings haven’t risen as much. That indicates that the concerns are mostly for the short term -- at least for now.
Outwardly, of course, it hasn’t been a good week for bulls as worries about the spread of the coronavirus outside of China increase. The Cboe Volatility Index closed Tuesday at 27.85, its highest level since December 2018, when turmoil in Washington and concerns that Federal Reserve policy might be too hawkish sent stocks tumbling, though it fell 5.9% to 26.21 as of 8:20 a.m. in New York on Wednesday. The S&P 500 Index itself has lost 7.2% in the past four days, its worst such performance since Christmas Eve that year.
Wu Silverman also notes that some investors have been selling near-the-money put options to fund levered multiples of tail puts.
The other big thing she is watching: factor performance, particularly in stocks with positive price momentum and those seen as having relatively low valuations. So far, she sees momentum continuing to do well -- which is consensus positioning -- but on Feb. 20 she recommended trades like buying call options on the iShares Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund to position for a potential change to value.
“If we start to see a rotation here, then it flags a major shift in the market’s concerns for growth,” she said Tuesday.

Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS)stock was down 1.5% at a 10-month low after the company abruptly announced that chief executive Robert Iger will step down with immediate effect (he’ll carry on as executive chairman for the rest of his contract, which ends in December 2021).


Iger’s successor is Bob Chapek, a long-term company insider who currently runs the theme park business. The outlook for that division has been badly clouded by the coronavirus outbreak, which has led to parks in China and Hong Kong being subject to extended shutdowns.


Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)stock fell 1.0% after the enterprise software company’s earnings per share fell to 66c from 70c in the fourth quarter of 2018. That was still some 20% above consensus forecasts.


Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE)stock fell 4.7% after the space tourism company’s quarterly results reminded exuberant investors how far it still is from commercializing its vision.


Virgin’s fourth-quarter net loss widened to $73 million from $46 million a year ago. The company said it will resume accepting deposits from prospective future customers, a move that will slightly reduce its cash burn but risks alienating customers with the reality of long wait times.


Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) stock rose 1.7% after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings ahead of expectations at 94 cents a share. However, its guidance for the coming year, at a midpoint of $6.55 a share, was fractionally below consensus forecasts.

Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN)stock fell 1.8% after the burger chain guided for lower sales in 2020 than the market was expecting. The company expects underlying earnings per share of around 61c this year, rather than the 65c expected by the Street.
SmileDirectClub (NASDAQ:SDC) stock fell 24%, wiping out all its gains for 2020 so far, after a sharp widening in its net loss in the fourth quarter alarmed investors.
The company has scaled down its growth forecasts for the next five years to between 20% and 30% from 40% previously, according to Jefferies analysts, who cut the stock to Hold from Buy on the results.

  Air Canada   (TSX:AC) lost C$3.9 billion ($3 billion) in market capitalization from its January peak, making it the worst-performing airline on the Bloomberg World Airlines Index this year. Its shares have slumped 28% on deepening fears that the spread of the coronavirus will hinder travel.
On Tuesday, the carrier extended the cancellation of all flights between Canada and China to April 10 over concerns about the virus known as Coved-19. It also stopped daily non-stop flights between Toronto and Hong Kong until April 30 due to reduced market demand.
New clusters of cases have emerged in Italy, Iran and South Korea. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans should prepare for significant disruptions to daily life if the coronavirus begins to spread locally in the U.S. Donald Trump’s administration was also considering whether to adopt more restrictions on air travel because of the outbreak, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said.
United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) -- the biggest U.S. airline to China before American carriers temporarily suspended flights -- withdrew its 2020 profit forecast late Monday, citing uncertainty from the virus.
Last year, Air Canada won the global equity crown among airlines after rising 87% with plans accelerate its global presence in leisure travel with the acquisition of tour operator Transat AT.
Revenue from outside Canada grew to 64% of total sales last year from 59% in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About one-fifth of the airline’s capacity is on Pacific routes.
In its fourth quarter results last week, Air Canada reported earnings per share that missed the lowest analyst estimate. The airline’s outlook for the year saw first quarter Ebitda come in about C$200 million lower from the prior year, assuming its mainland China and Hong Kong services will fully recover by the third quarter and that the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max aircraft will gradually return to services in that period.
Air Canada still has a positive longer-term outlook despite facing near-term pressure from coronavirus risk, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce analyst Kevin Chiang wrote in a report published Tuesday. He sees the recent sell-off as “further buying opportunity” for investors.
The stock has 14 buy recommendations, two hold ratings and none of the analysts covering the company believes investors should sell the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's (N:F) incoming chief operating officer outlined his priorities for the company's turnaround on Wednesday, including cost cuts and more efficient new-vehicle launches in a year in which it will introduce a redesigned F-150 full-sized pickup truck. 
Other key plans include speeding up Ford's push in vehicle connectivity and its commercial vehicle business, strategy chief Jim Farley, who begins his role as Ford COO on March 1 after being appointed earlier this month, said at a Wolfe Research conference in New York. 
""We have to fix a number of things,"" he told investors, citing a need to cut $5 billion in warranty costs, successfully launch 10 key global vehicles in the next two years, and slash material and logistics costs. 
Ford has acknowledged that mistakes proved costly in its introduction of the redesigned Explorer SUV. 
Electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has shown how connected vehicles and over-the-air updates can build customer loyalty, Farley said, and Ford could better profit from the data generated in vehicles and improve its customer service.
Ford also will focus more heavily on advantages in commercial vehicle sales. 
""This is the signature execution opportunity for Ford and growth opportunity for Ford,"" Farley said. 
He also cited a focus on growing the electric vehicle business of the No. 2 U.S. automaker. 
The Dearborn, Michigan-based company named Farley its COO on Feb. 7, and promised investors it would kick a slow-moving turnaround into higher gear. 
On Tuesday, shares hit their lowest in more than a decade as a rapidly escalating coronavirus epidemic that began in China threatened sales outside the United States.
Ford is restructuring globally and faces slumping demand in China, its second-largest market. Chief Executive Jim Hackett has said the No. 2 U.S. automaker needs to move with greater speed.
It has booked $3.7 billion of a projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year.
As part of its restructuring, Ford formed a wide-ranging alliance on commercial, electric and autonomous vehicles with Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and sold its money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by India's Mahindra & Mahindra. (NS:MAHN)

In China, Ford lost $771 million last year, about half the 2018 loss, and its market share there has shrunk. Ford has been struggling to revive sales since its business began slumping in late 2017, and prospects look more cloudy now that the world's largest market has been hit by a fast-spreading coronavirus.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 08:31AM ET</span>",City bosses see tough fish for finance trade-off in UK-EU talks,"By Huw Jones and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will likely secure only temporary access to the European Union financial market under a broader trade deal in which finance may take a back seat to sectors such as fishing, financial industry officials said on Wednesday.
Britain and the EU start talks next week on a trade deal that would come into effect next January after the ""standstill"" transition period that followed Brexit last month expires.
Europe is Britain's biggest market for financial services exports, worth about 26 billion pounds annually, and access to the bloc would be under the EU's ""equivalence"" system.
This refers to UK rules effectively staying largely aligned with those in the bloc. It offers much patchier access than at present, and can be canceled within 30 days in some cases.
Britain is already technically equivalent but this does not mean equivalence would be switched on and that there could be conditions and trade-offs with other economic sectors, Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, a banking industry body, told a House of Lords committee.
""If an equivalence designation can be granted, it is likely, I would suggest, to be temporary in almost every case, and it is likely to be capable theoretically of being withdrawn at short notice,"" Jones said.
""On that basis, businesses will then have to decide whether (that is) an adequate and robust basis on which to rely on.""
UNLOVED SECTOR
EU equivalence assessments are separate from the trade talks but will be taken into consideration, EU officials have said. The bloc wants access to UK fishing waters, raising the political temperature in Britain.
""Financial services are more important to us than them, there's a potential opportunity for them to extract other concessions from us,"" Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, told the lawmakers.
The financial sector was in a ""bad place"" due to the financial crisis, which makes it harder for politicians to defend it, Carnegie-Brown said.
""There is some risk that because of its complexity and the fact that it is hard to touch, that the much more tangible issues of things like fish and motor cars are more real for people in terms of Brexit impacts than financial services are.""
Banks that use London as a gateway to the EU have opened hubs in the bloc and the hit to UK tax revenues could be 3-5 billion pounds in the short term, Jones said.
Obtaining equivalence for wholesale financial markets should be a priority given that it would outweigh any benefits from diverging from the bloc's rules, Jones said.
""We don't aspire to strike out on our own unless we want to be isolated,"" Jones said."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks tumbled for the fifth straight day on Wednesday, while safe-haven gold rose back towards seven-year highs after health authorities warned of a possible coronavirus pandemic and markets stepped up bets on interest rate cuts.
U.S. Treasury yields nevertheless rose off record lows hit the previous day as equity futures turned around to signal a firmer Wall Street open following Tuesday's 3%-plus slide on news the coronavirus had spread to dozens of countries. 
Adding to alarm, the World Health Organization said the epidemic had peaked in China, but urged other countries to prepare for virus outbreaks.
In a change of tone, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also advised Americans to be ready for community spread of the virus.
(Graphic: Coronavirus spreads outside of China - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-MARKETS-VIRUS/0H001R8CZC0R/eikon.png)
Drastic travel restrictions in China, where coronavirus has claimed almost 3,000 lives, have slammed the brakes on mainland manufacturing and consumer spending, and there are worries other countries will face similar disruptions.
""China's template to contain the virus was to restrict economic activity and that's hitting home,"" Lombard Odier's chief strategist Salman Ahmed said.
""Markets are fearing there will be sequential shutdowns of economic systems to stop the spread."" 
Those fears of severe economic damage, even a recession, have sent MSCI's All-Country equity index to 2-1/2-month lows, wiping almost $3 trillion off its value this week alone. 
(GRAPHIC - Global stocks' performance vs. reported coronavirus cases: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2484/2452/cvirus_stocks1.png) 
Asian shares excluding Japan fell 1%. Tokyo lost 0.8% on concerns the virus could force the cancellation of the Olympics scheduled for July. That weighed on shares in firms such as Dentsu that are involved in the Games.
A pan-European equity index lost 1%, shrugging off slight gains on futures for the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq.
Economic growth worries are reflected in steep drop in bond yields -- 10-year U.S. yields are down 60 basis points since the start of 2020. Moreover, U.S. three-month T-bill yields remained some 18 basis points above 10-year rates -- the curve inversion that's considered a classic signal of recession.
Ten- and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields teetered just off record lows and another safe-haven, German bonds, also saw 10-year yields tumble to four-month lows below -0.5%.
(Graphic: U.S. 3-month, 10-year yield curve - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2497/2465/usyieldcurve.png) 
Analysts note growing market bets on interest rate cuts -- expectations that monetary policy will be deployed yet again to head off any downturn.
Money markets are now pricing in roughly two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and expect a 10 bps cut by the European Central Bank by December. A Bank of England rate cut is also fully priced for September. 
""Part of this selloff is a cry for help,"" Ahmed said, adding that Fed cuts were unlikely in the early part of the year unless ""we get an Italy-like situation in the United States"". 
An outbreak of coronavirus in northern Italy has raised additional fears for its perpetually sluggish economy.
The rate cut expectations weighed on the dollar which is now well off three-year highs reached against the euro on Feb. 20. Against the yen too, it has retreated from recent 10-month highs of 112.23 yen. and stood around 110 yen.
It traded just off 12-day lows against a basket of currencies.
Some reckon the greenback slump may not last, given the Fed's wariness of rushing into rate cuts.
""The significant dovish tilt being priced in by markets from the Fed may not materialize and that might cause the next leg of the dollar rally,"" said Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>","U.S. stocks to rise in 2020, but virus, presidential race pose risks: Reuters poll","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market is likely to rack up solid gains this year, but it's vulnerable to a correction if the effect of the coronavirus outbreak worsens or the U.S. presidential race rattles investors, according to strategists in a Reuters poll.
The S&P 500 index (SPX) will end 2020 at 3,400, according to the median forecast of over 50 stock market analysts, strategists and fund managers polled by Reuters in the past two weeks. That would represent about a 5.2% gain over 2019's close and an 8.7% gain from Tuesday's close of 3,128.21.
Many of the targets were taken before a dramatic tumble in world stocks early this week. A surge in coronavirus cases outside China and worries of a potential pandemic drove major U.S. stocks indexes down and left both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average in the red for the year.
The latest forecast for the S&P 500 is up from November, when strategists last surveyed by Reuters predicted the index would reach 3,260 by the end of the year. Professional investors' targets about stock market performance often miss the mark, but they are useful as an indication of market sentiment.
Worries have been mounting about the effect of the virus on the global economy and on earnings, especially after market heavyweight Apple (O:AAPL) last week said it would fall short of its quarterly sales target because of slower iPhone production and weaker demand in China.
Not all poll participants see a significant market correction this year, but many of those who expect one see the coronavirus's impact as the most likely trigger.
Investors have been worried about valuations following recent record highs in the market. The S&P 500 index is trading at 19 times forward earnings, well above the long-term average of roughly 15 times, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""We're at the upper end of valuations, and it will require material earnings growth to push us higher,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
""That earnings growth is only likely to materialize if there's decent economic growth. And right now economic data does not point to a strengthening economy.""
After a lackluster year of profit growth in 2019, some investors have been hoping corporate earnings this year will be strong enough to support further market gains. Analysts are estimating profit growth of 7.8% for S&P 500 companies in 2020, based on Refinitiv's data.
Many strategists take comfort in the view interest rates are low and the chances of the United States entering an economic recession this year also remain low.
""The risk of a recession right now is very well-contained, so unless something breaks down on the economic front or the coronavirus issue becomes more problematic than the market is currently discounting or something like that, then there's no reason to believe the market is not going to continue to grind higher,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities in New York. He sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 3,600.
As concerns over the spreading coronavirus outbreak hammer U.S. stocks, investors are also in the early stages of gauging another potential risk to the market later this year: the U.S. presidential election.
So far, the market impact has mostly shown up in healthcare shares. Insurers fell on Monday as Democrat Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator whose agenda includes a national ""Medicare for All"" health plan, scored a recent win in the Nevada caucuses.
The poll also showed the Dow (DJI) finishing 2020 at 30,342, which would represent a gain of 6.3% from the end of 2019. The Dow closed at 27,081.36 on Tuesday.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index tumbled as much as 2.9%, extending its weekly drop to 8.2% -- the biggest slump since the heat of the euro-area’s sovereign-debt crisis in August 2011 -- before trimming losses. The benchmark was down 0.9% as of 11:56 a.m. in London.
“Investors don’t like unpredictable things and the virus is very unpredictable,” Raphael Pitoun, an equities fund manager at CQS, said by phone. “If the virus doesn’t stop and there are new epicenters emerging that are critical to the world economy, I don’t think anyone is going to say that this was a healthy market correction.”
Italy reported 19 more coronavirus cases from the Lombardy region on Wednesday, France reported three new cases including a 60 year-old French man who died overnight in a Paris hospital, while 700 people were still confined to a hotel in Tenerife. The spread of the virus outside of China in the past week has revived worries over the potential impact on economic growth corporate earnings.
“The coronavirus outbreak is challenging as it is both a supply side and a demand side shock,” said Mark Phelps, chief investment officer of global concentrated equities at AllianceBernstein in London. “Clearly China is much more integrated into the global economy that during previous outbreaks, particularly in Europe. This means the virus is likely to have a greater impact on Europe than the U.S.”
Travel stocks plunged again on Wednesday, with Ryanair Holdings Plc (LON:RYA) falling 4.4% and InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (LON:IHG) dropping 2.3%. The Stoxx travel and leisure index has tumbled 12% since Feb. 19, the most among industry groups.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 07:02AM ET</span>",Bayer chairman quits as Roundup settlement talks progress,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn) Chairman Werner Wenning, one of the architects of a $63 billion takeover deal that has left the German crop protection company fighting costly lawsuits, will step down in April, it said on Wednesday. 
Bayer shares have plunged about a quarter in value since August 2018, when the company lost the first U.S. lawsuit claiming weedkiller Roundup - acquired via the takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) - causes cancer.
""We have made and continue to make progress in handling the legal issues in the U.S. That's why now is a good time to hand over to my successor,"" the 73-year-old Wenning said in a statement.
Norbert Winkeljohann, who was head of auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Europe SE until June 2018 and has been a member of Bayer's supervisory board since 2018, will succeed Wenning after the annual shareholders' meeting on April 28, the company added. 
Wenning, whose term as chairman of Bayer's non-executive supervisory board would have expired in 2022, said he had originally intended to step down last year after reaching the board's recommended age limit of 72, but was asked to stay on.
Bayer last year started negotiations with plaintiffs' lawyers to settle more U.S. lawsuits involving Roundup.
In October 2019, the number of plaintiffs more than doubled to 42,700 within just three months, and analysts have predicted it may cost they company up to $12 billion to lay the claims to rest.
In August 2018, a California state court jury awarded almost $300 million in damages to a groundskeeper in the initial Roundup lawsuit, though that was later reduced to $78 million.
In two subsequent cases other juries also found the company liable. Bayer is appealing all three verdicts.
Major shareholders have criticised Bayer for its handling of the issue and for underestimating the risks when it bought Monsanto, resulting in an unprecedented show of disapproval towards top management at last year's annual general meeting.
Bayer, which is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results on Thursday, has defended a deal that brought together companies commanding more than a quarter of the world market for seeds and pesticides.
Wenning, a Bayer veteran of more than 50 years, became CEO in 2002, taking control of a company plunged into crisis by the 2001 market withdrawal of cholesterol drug Baycol, or Lipobay, which had been linked to deadly side effects.
As CEO, he clinched major takeovers including that of Roche's (S:ROG) non-prescription drugs business for 2.4 billion euros ($3.2 billion) and of German healthcare rival Schering for 17 billion euros.
After an eight-year stint, he handed the CEO role to company outsider Marijn Dekkers in 2010 and became chairman two years later. Wenning's protégé Werner Baumann succeeded Dekkers as CEO in 2016 after serving as finance chief and head of strategy.
Within weeks of taking the helm, Baumann broke cover on Bayer’s interest in Monsanto, enjoying unwavering support from Wenning throughout the tortuous negotiations and also as Roundup lawsuits piled in later. 
Pesticide market regulators across the globe, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Food Safety Authority have concluded that Roundup is not likely carcinogenic to humans.

The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), however, stated in 2015 that glyphosate - which is used in Roundup - probably causes cancer.

Investing.com - Dow futures fluctuated between gains and losses on Wednesday as Wall Street attempted to struggle back after an epic two-day selloff on the back of concerns over the global economic impact of coronavirus.
By around 06:50 AM ET (1150 GMT) Dow futures were up 14 points, reversing course after dropping around 160 points earlier. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.
The Dow tumbled 3.1% on Tuesday, bringing its two-day loss to more than 1,900 points after finishing Monday down nearly 880 points.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also finished sharply lower Tuesday, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit a record low amid a broad-based flight to safety on concerns about the global economic impact of the outbreak.
Late on Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alerted Americans to begin preparing for a likely outbreak in the U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that he would give a briefing on the situation later Wednesday, having said on Tuesday that ""CDC and my administration are doing a GREAT job of handling coronavirus."" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said U.S. containment of the disease was ""nearly airtight.""
Fears of a pandemic escalated on Wednesday after Asia reported hundreds of new cases from South Korea (including the first U.S. soldier to be infected) to Kuwait, while outbreaks in Italy and Iran spread to other countries.
Although the disease is believed to have peaked in China, where it first originated late last year, the resulting hit to factory output and consumer spending have threatened global economic growth in 2020.
""The market's realizing that though the pace of the infections looked like it was slowing, it's still spreading globally,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.
While investors had hoped the economic impact of the virus would be contained to the first quarter, Cruz said many are now estimating that ""it's going to have an impact on the first half of 2020 and probably beyond.""
Elsewhere, U.S. crude oil futures fell 1.3% to $49.26, having earlier hit a 13-month low. Gold futures remained well bid above $1,650 an ounce, even though U.S. Treasury bond yields ticked up.

The automaker, which operates 16 vehicle and components sites in Japan, said that it would decide on how to continue operations at its domestic plants from the week of March 9, after keeping output normal through the week of March 2.
Plants may be affected by potential supply disruptions in China as some plants in the epicentre of the virus outbreak remain are unable to produce and transport goods, while some plants remain closed under orders by regional authorities. 
""We are receiving parts from China as normal for the moment, but we will assess the situation after the week of March 2,"" a Toyota spokeswoman told Reuters.
Japan is a major site of production for the company, accounting for nearly half of the 10.7 million cars its sold globally in 2019. 
The automaker also said it would cancel all non-essential travel for employees in Japan, the latest move by a global company to curb operations as the speed of the virus outbreak appears to gather pace.

TOKYO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp (T:6752) said it would exit solar cell production at Tesla Inc's New York plant, the latest sign of strain in a partnership where Panasonic's status as the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker's exclusive battery supplier is ending.
The move increases uncertainty over Tesla's (O:TSLA) solar business which is already under scrutiny, having been drastically scaled back since the U.S. firm bought it for $2.6 billion in 2016.
Tesla has informed New York that Panasonic's withdrawal ""has no bearing on Tesla's current operations"", the state said in a statement. The company employs over 1,500 jobs in the city of Buffalo, clearing its 1,460 commitment before April - and thereby avoiding a $41 million penalty - the state said.
Panasonic said in a statement on Wednesday that it would cease production by the end of May and exit the factory by the end of September.
The withdrawal comes as Panasonic scrambles to divest of unprofitable businesses as its strategic shift to components from consumer electronics struggles to drive profit growth.
It is also another sign of a fraying partnership with the U.S. EV maker, which is set to diversify its battery supplies to include South Korea's LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910) and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) (SZ:300750).
Panasonic said it would continue its automotive battery joint venture with Tesla in the U.S. state of Nevada, which just reported its first quarterly profit after years of production problems and delays.
In the solar business, low demand from Tesla has left Panasonic sending most of the cells it makes in Buffalo to overseas clients, instead of selling them to Tesla for its trademark Solar Roof - cells designed to resemble regular roof tiles - as initially intended.
When announcing the solar partnership in 2016, Panasonic said it would invest over 30 billion yen ($271.96 million) in the Buffalo plant. Tesla's long-term purchase commitment was part of the deal.
Panasonic, which employs about 380 workers at the plant, said that the U.S. partner ""hopes to hire as many qualified Panasonic applicants as possible to help fill job openings for its growing operations in Buffalo.""
The latest decision will have no significant impact on Panasonic's annual profit forecasts, according to a company spokeswoman.
Panasonic has already shrunk its own solar business elsewhere as it contends with competition from cheaper Asian rivals, selling its solar panel plant in Malaysia and research arm to China's GS-Solar for an undisclosed amount last year.
Shares of Panasonic closed down 0.9%, while the benchmark share price index (N225) ended down 0.8%."

""British higher education is globally renowned and we are delighted to invest meaningful capital to support iQ's further growth and continue to deliver the highest quality accommodation for students across the country,"" James Seppala, Head of Real Estate Europe at Blackstone, said.
Goldman and Wellcome said the deal would be the largest ever private real estate deal in Britain and was subject to regulatory approvals. 
iQ was established in 2006, with Wellcome as one of the founding investors, and merged with Goldman Sachs' student housing business in 2016. It owns and manages more than 28,000 beds across Britain, with a development pipeline in excess of 4,000 beds. 
Property firms have turned to Britain's budding build-to-rent sector, which caters to students and city dwellers seeking affordable accommodation, as traditional home building and selling falters.
Student housing provider Unite (L:UTG) last year said it would buy rival Liberty Living Group for 1.4 billion pounds.
The iQ deal follows media reports on Tuesday that Blackstone will use money from a $14 billion Saudi-backed infrastructure fund to invest in Britain.
iQ's portfolio is concentrated in London - where it is the largest owner of student accommodation - and also Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Birmingham.

Goldman Sachs,  Morgan Stanley  & Co (NYSE:MS). International and Eastdil Secured were as financial advisors to the sellers. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citi were financial advisors to Blackstone.

  Peugeot   maker PSA group (PA:PEUP) defied mounting pessimism in the car industry by raising its dividend and offering assurances to investors that it can withstand a deepening slump.
While the French carmaker that’s working to combine with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) expects the European auto market to shrink in 2020, it published better-than-expected profit for last year and said it has taken measures to protect the company from a decline.
The results confirm PSA’s “best-in-class” status, Oddo BHF analyst Michael Foundoukidis wrote in a note.
PSA earnings contrast with a general souring of the global car industry in recent weeks, with China grappling to contain the coronavirus epidemic that has shuttered factories and hobbled supply chains across continents. The company depends heavily on Europe for its sales, which fell 10% overall to 3.5 million vehicles last year.
Despite the drop, PSA’s profit margin widened to 8.5% amid Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares’ relentless lowering of costs and focus on selling expensive models. The 2019 adjusted operating income rose a better-than-expected 11% to 6.32 billion euros ($6.87 billion). Since arriving in 2014, Tavares has turned around the manufacturer by removing overhead and adding scale.
The shares rose as much as 2.4% and were trading 0.9% higher at 9:40 a.m. in Paris.
PSA kept a target for the 2019-2021 average automotive adjusted operating margin of more than 4.5%, a level Chief Financial Officer Philippe de Rovira called a “floor” and very conservative.
“Our internal target is always to improve performance, so let’s not be misled by this indicator,” he said on a call with reporters.
In the past, the margin has been boosted by excluding restructuring charges from operating profit, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts have said. The company has reported charges for cost cutting at Opel and Vauxhall, but also Peugeot, Citroen and DS. Last month it unveiled job reductions at Opel.
The French manufacturer sees the European car market shrinking 3% in 2020 and Russia declining 2%. That’s more than the 2% decline in Europe expected by the main lobby group, a forecast published before the extent of the virus epidemic became know.

Other European carmakers have so far signaled a mixed year at best. While  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) has forecast an earnings rebound following several profit warnings and a dividend cut, it has also warned of more possible regulatory costs in coming months and “significant adverse effects” from the virus outbreak in China.
German luxury-car rival BMW AG is sticking to its sales growth target for China, even as it acknowledged uncertainty about when the situation will return to normal. PSA’s French rival,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), earlier this month posted its first annual loss in a decade and indicated operating margins are set to shrink.

SHANGHAI/SEOUL (Reuters) - Asia reported hundreds of new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, including the first U.S. soldier to be infected, as the United States warned of an inevitable pandemic, and outbreaks in Italy and Iran spread to more countries.
Asian shares fell on Wednesday as the U.S. warning to Americans to prepare for a likely coronavirus pandemic jolted Wall Street again and pushed yields on safe-haven Treasuries to record lows.
Stock markets globally have wiped out $3.33 trillion of value in the past four trading sessions, as measured by the MSCI all-country index (MIWD00000PUS) that comprises stocks across 23 developed and 26 emerging markets.
The disease is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.
Adding to a growing sense that a rapid spread of the virus in more places is inevitable, a top World Health Organization (WHO) official urged that preparations be made now.
In the United States, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also urged Americans to prepare, saying that while the immediate risk there was low, the global situation suggested a pandemic was likely.
""It's not a question of if. It's a question of when and how many people will be infected,"" the CDC's principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, said on Tuesday.
The United States has reported 57 cases of the virus.
Dr Bruce Aylward, head of a joint WHO-Chinese mission on the outbreak, told reporters on his return to Geneva that preparations should not wait.
""Think the virus is going to show up tomorrow. If you don't think that way, you're not going to be ready,"" he said.
""This a rapidly escalating epidemic in different places that we have got to tackle super fast to prevent a pandemic.""
Aylward said China's ""extraordinary mobilization"" showed how an aggressive public health policy could curb its spread.
OLYMPIC WORRIES
The WHO says the outbreak peaked in China around Feb. 2, after authorities isolated Hubei province and imposed other containment measures.
China's National Health Commission reported another 406 new infections on Wednesday, down from 508 a day earlier and bringing the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 78,064. Its death toll rose by 52 to 2,715.
South Korea, which with 1,261 cases has the most outside China, reported 284 new ones including a U.S. soldier, as authorities readied an ambitious plan to test more than 200,000 members of a church at the center of the outbreak.
Of the new cases, 134 were from Daegu city, where the virus is believed to have been passed among members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The U.S. military said a 23-year-old soldier based in Camp Carroll, about 20 km (12.4 miles) from Daegu, had been infected and was in self-quarantine at home.
In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for sports and cultural events to be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks to stem the virus as concern mounted for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics even though officials have repeatedly denied the Games will be affected.
Japan has nearly 170 virus cases and 691 linked to a cruise ship that was quarantined this month. Six people have died in Japan, including four from the ship.
There have been nearly 50 deaths outside China, including 11 in Italy and 16 in Iran, the most outside China, according to a Reuters tally.
Iran's deputy health minister - seen mopping his brow at a televised news conference - was among the infected.
Cases linked to Iran have been reported across the region.
Kuwait said it had two new coronavirus cases, some among people returning from Iran, took its tally to 18, while Bahrain said its infections had risen to 26 after three new ones on a flight from Iran.
CHINESE STOCKS GAIN
In Europe, Italy has become a front line in the global outbreak with 322 cases. Italians or people who had recently visited the country, have tested positive in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Romania, Spain and Switzerland.
Two hotels, one in Austria and one in Spain's Canary Islands, were also locked down after cases emerged linked to Italy. Spain also reported its first three cases on the mainland.
China's containment efforts have hobbled the world's second-biggest economy, with growth set to fall further from a three-decade low of 6.1% last year.
But a growing number of Chinese regions are downgrading their emergency response level after assessing that risks have receded and authorities are urging a return to work.
The effects of the outbreak are reverberating through the region with most of its major economies expected to either slow or shrink this quarter, Reuters polls found.
Forecasts from economists collected by Reuters on Feb. 19-25 showed that Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand are all expected to put in their worst performance in years in this quarter."

PARIS (Reuters) -  Peugeot  maker PSA Group said its profitability reached a record high in 2019 but the French carmaker forecast falling industry sales in Europe this year as it pursues its merger with  Fiat  Chrysler, which is strong in North America.
PSA (PA:PEUP) has trimmed costs in areas such as the procurement of components as it has integrated its acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall, boosting operating margins to 8.5% last year. 
The group, which also produces cars under the Citroen and DS brands, offset a slump in vehicle sales by selling pricier SUV models, with launches including the Citroen C5 Aircross helping to lift revenues by a higher-than-expected 1% to 74.7 billion euros ($81.2 billion). 
That helped it stand out in a car market where some rivals including France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) have struggled with sliding revenues and profits, amid a broader downturn in demand. 
PSA's group net profit increased 13.2% to a record 3.2 billion euros, and the company increased its dividend against 2019 results to 1.23 euros per share, up 58% from 2018 levels.
The carmaker was ""once again very solid"", analysts at brokerage Oddo-BHF said in a note, adding the results confirmed the company's ""best-in-class status."" 
However PSA forecast a 3% contraction in Europe's car market this year, by far its biggest market. The tie-up with Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA) will help it gain exposure to that group's strong presence in North America with brands like Jeep. 
The two companies struck a deal in December to create the world's No.4 carmaker, to better cope with market turmoil and the cost of making less-polluting vehicles. Fiat also posted more upbeat results than most rivals this year. 
CORONAVIRUS WEIGHS
PSA boss Carlos Tavares told a news conference that the two groups were both in good shape and well placed to face market challenges together. 
He said he did not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the merger, adding it had so far submitted 14 approval requests to competition authorities out of the 24 it needs so far. There are no immediate plans to change anything in the large portfolio of brands within the combined group, he added.
However the companies still face problems this year, including the coronavirus outbreak which has paralyzed production in China and hits carmakers' supply chain.
PSA said the coronavirus impact was still difficult to assess. It factories in Wuhan, at the epicenter of the outbreak, are due to reopen in the second week of March. 
The carmaker suffered 700 million euros in losses and writedowns last year in China, where its car sales have tumbled, and where it is exiting a joint venture with China's Chongqing Changan Automobile (SZ:000625). 
Tavares said the carmaker had not succeeded in Asia yet and that the virus outbreak was likely to derail a slight improvement there in recent months. 
""In January, things were getting better until the coronavirus,"" Tavares told a news conference. He added that PSA planned an ""offensive"" in electric vehicles in China, without giving details. 
PSA shares were broadly flat at 0832 GMT, after opening up close to 2% and then briefly turning negative, in a volatile stock market affected by fears over the impact of the coronavirus health crisis.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) said on Wednesday its Canadian stores will start selling a  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) plant-based breakfast sandwich next week, the first time the world's biggest coffee chain will offer an imitation meat product.
The Seattle-based company said its Beyond Meat sandwich, which will be topped with cheddar cheese and egg on an artisanal bun, will be available at its nearly 1,200 coffee shops across Canada on March 3. 
The deal intensifies the already heated rivalry between Beyond Meat and other plant-based meat producers - including Impossible Foods, Kellogg Co's (N:K) Morningstar Farms, Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and Nestle SA's (S:NESN) Sweet Earth - which have been vying for shelf space at retailers and for deals with food service outlets.
In November, all-day breakfast provider Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN) expanded its Beyond Sausage Sandwich to all its U.S. stores.
McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) is testing its plant-based ""P.L.T."" burger, using Beyond Meat patties, in Ontario. 
The Starbucks deal also comes as restaurants vie for a share of the expanding morning food business, with burger chain Wendy's Co (O:WEN) shaking up the status quo by officially launching into the U.S. breakfast market on March 2.
Wendy's effort could strip some customers away from restaurant chains already prominent in the morning, including Starbucks, McDonald's and Dunkin'.
Starbucks has been working to build out its food business, which currently makes up at least 20% of revenue at company-operated stores, and to increase its plant-based offerings for more environmentally sustainable operations.

While it has long sold meatless menu items, this is the first time it will sell any faux meat patty made with plants instead of animal protein in any market.

(Reuters) - British travel-food company SSP (L:SSPG) warned of a 50% fall in February sales across the Asia Pacific region as the coronavirus outbreak drove a collapse in domestic and international air travel, sending its shares to a more than two-year low.
SSP, which serves 1.5 million customers daily in airports and train stations in 35 countries, said group revenue in February would fall by between 10 million pounds and 12 million pounds ($13 million to $15.6 million) due to the outbreak.
That would reduce operating profit by 4 million to 5 million pounds, it said. The company's pretax profit for the whole of last year was 197 million pounds on revenue of 2.79 billion pounds.
Shares in SSP fell as much as 7% in early trade to hit the bottom of London's midcap index (FTMC). 
""Clearly the duration of the COVID-19 virus and its impact on global travel is uncertain at this stage, as are its consequences for our financial performance for the full year,"" the company said in the statement. 
WH Smith (L:SMWH), which also operates a network of airport and train station kiosks, saw its shares tumble 9.6%. 
Airlines have suspended thousands of flights in response to the outbreak, and hundreds of new coronavirus cases were again reported on Wednesday, while the United States warned a pandemic was now likely.
SSP said domestic and international air passenger numbers in China were about 90% lower from a year earlier, while Hong Kong passenger numbers were about 70% lower.
Passenger numbers in other Asian markets, including Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines, were between 25% and 30% lower. 
It said it had also seen some impact on passenger numbers at its airports in Australia, as well as at major travel hubs in the Middle East and India. Put together, Asia Pacific, India and the Middle East account for 14% of overall group revenue.
SSP said it was working with its clients to maintain services in the face of the sharp fall in sales and was trying to cut costs, including the temporary closure of units and reduced operating hours. 
""Clearly the duration of the COVID-19 virus and its impact on global travel is uncertain at this stage, as are its consequences for our financial performance for the full year,"" SSP said.
SSP warned last year that some of its operations in North America were hit by flight cancellations following the grounding of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft.

The company last month reported a 1.2% rise in comparable first-quarter sales despite transport strikes across France during December and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

 Thai Airways  Pcl (BK:THAI) said senior management voluntarily reduced their salaries by 15% to 25% for six months beginning March in a bid to cut expenses amid reduction of passenger travel.
""Thai Airways has implemented measures such as reduction of operational expenses and delayed unnecessary investments,"" said the airline president, Sumeth Damrongchaitham.
Senior management, including the president and vice presidents, would also reduce their transport allowances by 20% to 30%.
Thai health officials urged the public to refrain from traveling abroad and asked airlines to tone down promotions after two more patients tested positive for the virus following a trip to Japan, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 40.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank 2.4% and hit its lowest level since late October, suffering its longest losing streak since July. Europe’s benchmark is now down 9% from its February peak, and falling below its 200-day moving average for the first time since October.
 Diageo  (LON:DGE) lost as much as 2.8% after warning that the coronavirus will reduce its sales by as much as 325 million pounds ($422 million) this year. Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) was down 2.9% and Ryanair Holdings plc (LON:RYA) slumped 4.7%. The FTSE 100 Index dropped below the level of 7,000, falling to its lowest point in more than a year.
European equities started this week with the worst two-day drop since the Brexit aftermath in June 2016 amid increasing concerns that the spreading virus in Europe and Asia will curb global growth and impact corporate earnings and supply chains. The stock market is coming down from a record high reached last week as some investors mull whether the rally has gone too far.
“The ‘buy the dip’ culture is fading as investors realize that it is possibly just a matter of time before an outbreak will happen in another large western country or city,” said Alberto Tocchio, chief investment officer at Colombo Wealth SA in Lugano, Switzerland. “We cannot rule out further downside if the virus continues to spread across the world as predicted by many experts.”"
1041,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",Ex-ABB CEO Spiesshofer to get $13.3 million payout,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB (S:ABBN) will pay its former Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer 13 million Swiss francs ($13.32 million) nearly a year after he left the engineering group following a tenure marked by poor stock returns and missed targets.
Speisshofer, who departed in April after nearly six years at the helm, will get 8.58 million francs for his notice period which runs to the end of April this year, ABB said on Wednesday.
He will also get 4.47 million francs for a non-compete clause which runs to May 2021, the company said in its annual report.
Speisshofer did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
The payout underscores how executives at Swiss companies still earn large sums despite the country's citizens voting seven years ago to impose some of the world's strictest controls on executive pay.
Earlier this month, it emerged former  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) boss Tidjane Thiam could collect as much as 30 million francs after resigning earlier this month over a spying scandal. 
ABB's share price fell 9.4% during Spiesshofer's term as CEO, underperforming the blue-chip Swiss market index which rose 17% as well as trailing rivals like  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn),  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and Honeywell (N:HON).
The engineering company also missed its revenue growth target in 2015, 2016 and 2017.
""The terms of departure of the former CEO, Ulrich Spiesshofer, were as per his contractual arrangements,"" ABB said in the annual report.
ABB Chairman Peter Voser picked up 3.44 million francs in compensation during 2019 for his eight month stint as interim chief executive, the annual report said. He also received 1.2 million francs for his role as chairman. 
Voser, a former boss of Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), will be replaced by ex-Sandvik CEO Bjorn Rosengren, who takes over as new CEO on March 1.
ABB said it has considered ""very carefully"" the compensation packages for both Voser and Rosengren.
""The committee has set the target total direct compensation for the newly appointed CEO nearly 22% lower than for the former CEO,"" it said in the report. 
""This is derived by a reduction in target short-term and
target long-term incentive opportunity, to more closely represent competitive market practice.""
Last week, Voser said ABB's board had long been dissatisfied with the operational performance of the company.
""ABB has never followed the same strategy for a long period, we were virtually always restructuring. That's why we weren't performing,"" Voser told Germany's Manager Magazin. 
""That annoyed me a hell of a lot.""

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets opened lower again on Wednesday, as corporate warnings of hits from the coronavirus outbreak added to growing signs of it spreading within Europe and further afield.
Markets followed the lead of both Wall Street on Tuesday and Asian stocks overnight, both of which posted further losses after the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention warned that the virus was likely to reach communities in the U.S.
That warning contradicted claims by White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow, who told CNBC that “We have contained this, I won’t say airtight, but pretty close to airtight.”
News of a big fiscal stimulus package from Hong Kong and further supportive measures from China weren’t enough to turn Asian markets around, as the number of confirmed cases in South Korea rose to 1,146.

In early news, French dairy giant   Danone   SA (PA:DANO) warned that the outbreak would stop it reaching its sales target for this year. It now expects sales to grow by between 2% and 4%, rather than the 4%-5% range it expected previously.
Beer and spirits group   Diageo   (LON:DGE) fell 1.4% after warning that the outbreak would shave some $420 million off this year’s sales, while Belgian chemicals group   Solvay   (BR:SOLB) also fell after a similar warning.

China Eastern was initially slated to be the first operator.

(Reuters) - A contingent of aggrieved  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) workers are taking complaints to Capitol Hill, saying they feel brushed aside by management.
On March 25, an advocacy group called The Committee for Better Banks will participate in a House Financial Services Committee hearing titled ""Holding Wells Fargo Accountable: Examining the Impact of the Bank's Toxic Culture on Its Employees."" Two bank workers plan to testify.
In a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said management takes their concerns seriously.
The scheduled hearing is one of three focused on Wells Fargo, which has been beset by scandal since 2016, when it acknowledged its employees opened potentially millions of phony accounts in order to meet unrealistic sales targets. Last week, the bank reached a $3 billion deal with U.S. authorities over the matter - the latest in a string of costly settlements and regulatory penalties.
Since then Wells Fargo has overhauled performance goals, compensation formulas and risk management to avoid such problems in the future. However, the advocacy group says problems still exist, citing layoffs, excessive workloads and a stressful work environment.
Brian Jackson, a Wells Fargo mortgage underwriter who is part of The Committee for Better Banks, said the group has helped elevate concerns that might otherwise be ignored.
""They're able to work with Congress and representatives and kind of gives us a voice where they'll actually do something about it,"" Jackson told Reuters.
The group has been trying in vain to get management’s attention for years. (https://reut.rs/2zV73TF) Charlie Scharf is the fourth Wells Fargo chief executive in place since the 2016 scandal. The group has not gotten an audience with any of the CEOs, but they have had success with Federal Reserve governors, Vermont Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and an Iowa lawmaker who used Wells Fargo employees as the face of her campaign to prevent offshoring.
In response to their most recent request for a meeting, Scharf suggested the employees talk to the head of human resources and operating chief instead. However, future meetings have not been ruled out, Folk said.
""Charlie takes employee concerns seriously and will continue to consider opportunities to meet with these employees as part of his ongoing internal engagement,"" he said.
The group also includes consumer advocates and organized labor representatives. Wells Fargo workers are not unionized."

The won fell toward its weakest since 2016 after South Korea reported a further escalation in coronavirus cases. Stock benchmarks were down more than 1% in Seoul and Tokyo, though came off their lows of the session. Hong Kong and Shanghai saw smaller drops. The S&P 500 Index fell 3% overnight, in its worst two-day slide since 2015. Ten-year Treasury yields held near Tuesday’s record low. The offshore yuan was flat, and the yen gave up some recent gains.
South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, said its national total for coronavirus cases is now more than 1,000, up from just 51 a week ago. American health officials on Tuesday warned that they expect the epidemic to spread in the U.S., news that extended the sell-off in stocks.
The virus and the market reaction has also entered U.S. politics. President Donald Trump tweeted “Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” after the close on Monday. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren by contrast said the plunge in stocks is only the “tip of the iceberg” of a growing economic threat from the coronavirus.
Meantime, traders are monitoring for any signs of policy accommodation as the global economy absorbs the blow of virus-linked shutdowns. U.S. central bankers are closely monitoring the spreading virus, but it is “still too soon” to say whether it will result in a material change to the outlook, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said Tuesday. Traders nevertheless are betting on further easing.
“The ultimate impact remains entirely unknown at this stage,” said Eleanor Creagh, a Sydney-based strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “And uncertainty is the enemy of conviction.”

1053,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 12:20AM ET</span>",Best Indian Bank Stock for Decade Stalls as Succession Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- After more than a decade of share price outperformance, the skies have darkened for IndusInd Bank Ltd., as the Indian lender faces challenges from worsening asset quality to a transition to new leadership.
IndusInd has a hefty exposure to India’s troubled telecommunications sector as well as to real estate where several developers are struggling amid the country’s prolonged shadow banking crisis. Further uncertainty stems from a coming leadership change, with Chief Executive Officer Romesh Sobti, 69, due to stand down at the end of March after a dozen years at the helm.
“IndusInd was commanding a premium in its share price because of its strong growth without any equity dilution,” said Siddharth Purohit, an analyst at SMC Global Securities Ltd. Now, its proportion of exposure to telecom and real estate is sparking worries about a moderation in future lending growth and the possibility of a capital raising, Purohit added.
IndusInd was the best performing stock on the Bankex index from early 2008, when Sobti took over, until September 2018, when India’s shadow bank crisis erupted with defaults at a major infrastructure lender. Since then, it’s the third worst performer after RBL Bank Ltd. and Yes Bank Ltd., the private-sector lender which has been struggling to raise new capital.
While 72% of analysts tracking IndusInd still recommend the shares, the ratio of ‘buy’ calls has dropped to the lowest in a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Bad loans rose to 2.18% of the total in the quarter ended December, close to the highest proportion in a decade, and there are worries they could rise further.
“IndusInd Bank’s non-performing loan risks have risen in the past six months,” UBS Group AG analysts led by Vishal Goyal wrote in a recent note. They said about 30% of IndusInd’s loan book is facing headwinds and also 4% of total exposure could turn sour in the next 15 months.
A key concern is IndusInd’s 34 billion rupee ($473 million) exposure to  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) Idea Ltd., which was hit hard by a court ruling last year that it and other telecom firms must pay a total of $13 billion to the government. Worries about its high exposure to the telecom and real estate sectors prompted Moody’s Investors Service to downgrade IndusInd’s outlook earlier this month to ‘negative’ from ‘stable.’
Analysts have voiced fears about rising bad loans from the real estate industry, which has suffered during the shadow banking crisis. With around 8% of its total loan book extended to the sector, according to Moody’s, IndusInd has one of the highest exposures among private sector banks -- ICICI Bank Ltd. in contrast has an exposure of less than 4%, filings showed.
Shares of IndusInd fell as much as 1.5% on Wednesday morning in Mumbai. The stock has dropped about 25% this year.
An IndusInd spokesman said all real estate and telecom loans are “standard,” meaning they haven’t soured, and the bank is well capitalized. Its gross bad loans are “amongst the lowest in the banking industry despite a challenging macro-economic backdrop,” the spokesman added in an emailed statement.
Also of concern is how IndusInd will manage these bad loan challenges after Sobti’s departure. According to an exchange filing, the bank has proposed an as-yet unnamed executive to replace him. But the Reserve Bank of India has yet to announce its approval for the chosen candidate.
Another leadership transition is due to take place later this year at IndusInd’s larger rival HDFC Bank Ltd., where Managing Director Aditya Puri, 69, is nearing the retirement age of 70 mandated by the RBI.

The IndusInd spokesman said the bank expects approval from the regulator soon “and well before the end of Mr. Sobti’s tenure.”
Indeed, analysts at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) have maintained their ‘buy’ rating on IndusInd, calling worries about asset quality overblown and seeing “a low possibility of an adverse action from the RBI on the board’s proposal on CEO term/succession,” according to a Feb. 21 note.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Some economy-class travelers envying those at the front of the plane with lie-flat beds may soon have another option: Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR) has developed a sleeping pod prototype to help passengers cope with near-18 hour flights.
The Economy Skynest concept unveiled on Wednesday, which features six bunks akin to those in a train car or capsule hotel, would provide extra comfort for an added cost at a time when airlines are turning to longer flights because passengers are willing to pay for non-stop services.
But the airline, which plans to launch Auckland-New York flights in October, faces a stiff hurdle in not just making the economics of the new product work but in meeting regulatory requirements designed to help passengers survive a crash that have held back novel seating concepts in the past.
""Despite the pretty pictures, this is likely to be a lengthy and arduous certification process,"" said David Flynn, the editor-in-chief of website Executive Traveller.
""There's a certain appeal to these railway-style sleeping berths, although it's highly unlikely that passengers could strap themselves into these bunks for take-off and landing,"" he said.
Air New Zealand said economy passengers would book the Skynest in addition to their regular seat.
Rival Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) considered but ultimately rejected an Airbus proposal to place bunks in the cargo hold on A350 planes to be used on the world's longest-ever commercial flights from Sydney to London.
Air New Zealand said it would make a final decision on whether to introduce the Skynest next year after it had assessed the performance of the Auckland-New York route during its inaugural year.
The carrier's head of airline programs Kerry Reeves said gaining certification of the product was a definite challenge, even when compared with its earlier innovations like the Economy Skycouch which allows a row of economy seats to be turned into a couch after take-off.
""But it was a prize worth chasing and one that we think has the potential to be a game changer for economy class travelers on all airlines around the world,"" Reeves said in a statement."

“We are actually seeing some bullish sentiment, with traders getting longer or monetizing hedges they’ve had on,” Amy Wu Silverman, an equity-derivatives strategist at RBCCM, wrote in an email Tuesday. “The options market does not suggest all out panic.”
For one, while implied volatility for the U.S. stock market has surged, gauges tracking longer-term swings haven’t risen as much. That indicates that the concerns are mostly for the short term -- at least for now.
Outwardly, of course, it hasn’t been a good week for bulls as worries about the spread of the coronavirus outside of China increase. The Cboe Volatility Index closed Tuesday at 27.85, its highest level since December 2018, when turmoil in Washington and concerns that Federal Reserve policy might be too hawkish sent stocks tumbling. The S&P 500 Index itself has lost 7.2% in the past four days, its worst such performance since Christmas Eve that year.
Wu Silverman also notes that some investors have been selling near-the-money put options to fund levered multiples of tail puts.
The other big thing she is watching: factor performance, particularly in stocks with positive price momentum and those seen as having relatively low valuations. So far, she sees momentum continuing to do well -- which is consensus positioning -- but on Feb. 20 she recommended trades like buying call options on the iShares Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund to position for a potential change to value.
“If we start to see a rotation here, then it flags a major shift in the market’s concerns for growth,” she said Tuesday."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - SpaceX, the private rocket company of high tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, won final approval on Tuesday to build a research and manufacturing plant for its deep-space Starship project on a tract of vacant land at the Port of Los Angeles.
The Los Angeles City Council granted a permit for the facility by a unanimous 12-0 vote, paving the way for Musk, also the founder of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) electric car company, to proceed with an accelerated development of a new spacecraft and rocket system designed to carry humans to the moon and Mars.
The L.A. Board of Harbor Commissioners gave its go-ahead to the 10-year permit last week.
""It's crazy that here we are in 2020 preparing ourselves to send people to Mars, and it's going to happen in our backyard,"" Councilman Joe Buscaino, whose district includes the port, said before Tuesday's vote. ""We are becoming a spaceport.""
Operations at the facility will actually be confined to research, design and fabrication of aerospace components. Space vehicles built there are not permitted for launch but will be transported out of the port complex by barge or ship.
The council action clears the way for SpaceX to begin leasing 12.5 acres (5 hectares) of property on Terminal Island for its Starship plant at a starting rent of $1.7 million a year, with an option to expand its site to 19 acres.
The company, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies, has an option to terminate the permit within 180 days. 
SpaceX secured a similar permit two years ago, but canceled it and moved its initial phase of the Starship project to Texas, where the company has developed and tested an early prototype dubbed Starhopper.
The Los Angeles Port site will bring further Starship development closer to SpaceX's headquarters in the L.A. suburb of Hawthorne, where it has manufactured its workhorse Falcon 9 rockets and Dragon crew capsules.
The future facility, which may incorporate renovations to abandoned warehouse and workshop structures on the site, is expected to provide 130 new jobs, according to Musk. 
As designed, the Starship itself is actually the top half of a colossal interplanetary rocket system that will stand 387 feet (118 meters) tall and be capable of ferrying dozens of humans to the moon and Mars in a single launch.

Musk has said that he hopes the Starship will be ready for its first orbital test flight later this year.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 07:49PM ET</span>","Hong Kong banks face coronavirus toll on asset quality, loan growth","By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's banks face at least two quarters of worsening asset quality and slowing loan growth as the coronavirus outbreak hits trade and consumer banking, analysts and bankers said.
Lenders in the Asian financial hub, including HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), are seeing a drop in demand for mortgages, credit card usage and corporate loans, bankers with knowledge of the matter said.
Hong Kong banks have Asia's largest exposure to China, which accounted for 29.4% of banking system assets in the first half of last year, credit ratings agency Fitch says. 
Some of the banks have already started stress testing select parts of their China and Hong Kong businesses as fears grow of a pandemic of the flu-like virus that originated in China late last year.
""Some of the companies in Hong Kong were already hanging from a thread after months of civil unrest and now the virus has come on top of that,"" said Sonny Hsu, senior credit officer for financial institutions group at Moody's Investors Service.
""The combined effect will be much more. This time, it will be more of a problem loan and credit cost issue,"" Hsu said.
An extended disruption to economic activities would weaken the banks' asset quality and profitability, and will be a credit negative, the rating agency said. 
""(The) first quarter is usually a busy month for us as clients work on their plans for the year ahead. This year, the trade finance volume is down 15% to 30% in China and Hong Kong,"" a senior banker at a large global bank in Hong Kong said.
ASSET QUALITY 
The biggest impact on asset quality in Hong Kong will come from retail, hotels and property as the city's economy, already in recession after months of anti-government protests, faces increased headwinds due to the coronavirus, the banker added.
Some banks are also concerned about the likely push from Chinese authorities to extend loan repayment periods as well as make cheaper credit available, the bankers said.
""We are not thinking about origination of new business much - (the) bulk of work is focused on minimizing the hit to asset quality. It won't be business as usual for the next two quarters at least,"" a retail banker with a global bank said. 
Unemployment in Hong Kong reached its highest in three years in January at 3.4%, while bankruptcy petitions submitted rose to 703 last month up from 665 a year-ago, data showed.
HSBC, which made 40% of its revenue from China and Hong Kong in 2019, said last week it could take up to $600 million in additional provisions against loan losses if the coronavirus outbreak persists into the second half.
HSBC declined further comment.
Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia (BEA) (HK:0023) said last Wednesday it expected a deterioration of 10-20 basis points in credit cost, the percentage of provisioning for bad loans out of total lending, for its local business in 2020 due to the economic downturn. BEA declined to comment further.

StanChart, which also makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, is expected to echo these comments when it reports on Thursday. It declined to comment ahead of its results.

Investing.com - It’s clear than any news related to the coronavirus and either its spread or containment will dictate market direction Wednesday.
But apart from what numbers or statements may come out regarding Covid-19, there will be fundamentals to trade on as well.
Home improvement retail remains the highlight of the earnings calendar tomorrow and home sales are on the economic calendar.
Official oil inventories data arrive as well.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1.Lowe's Reports With Wall Street Bullish
  Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) reported quarterly results Tuesday that topped expectations, although the stock ended up in the red following the drubbing on Wall Street on pandemic fears.
Rival home-improvement retailer Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) will issue its numbers ahead of trading Wednesday.
Analysts are looking for a profit of 91 cents per share on sales of about $16.2 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Wall Street applauded Lowe's last earnings report in November, where the company posted solid numbers and impressed investors with the success of its initiatives. That led to a host of sell-side upgrades, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) putting the stock on its Conviction Buy list.
Discount retailer TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) also reports tomorrow.
The owner of TJ Maxx is forecast to report earnings of 77 cents per share and sales of about $11.8 billion.
Major fast food names Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) and Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) will issue numbers as well.
2, New Home Sales Numbers Arrive
Continuing with the housing theme, the latest new home sales numbers will come out tomorrow.
The Commerce Department will report new single-family home sales for January at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Economists are looking for new home sales to have risen 3.5% in the month to an annual rate of 710,000.
3. Oil Inventories Expected to Show Build
Oil traders will have one eye on Covid-19 developments and one eye on government inventories numbers.
The Energy Information Administration will issue its weekly petroleum inventories report at 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT).Oil inventories are expected to have risen by 2 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 21, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.

1064,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 06:04PM ET</span>",Tesla and U.S. regulators strongly criticized over role of Autopilot in crash,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday sharply criticized Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.'s lack of system safeguards in a fatal 2018 Autopilot crash in California and called U.S. regulators' approach in overseeing the driver assistance systems ""misguided.""
NTSB board members questioned Tesla's design of its semi-automated driving assistance system and condemned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for a ""hands-off approach"" to regulating the increasingly popular systems.
NHTSA has ""taken a nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle safety"" and should ""complete a further evaluation of the Tesla Autopilot system to ensure the deployed technology does not pose an unreasonable safety risk,"" NTSB said.
The board faulted Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other smartphone makers for refusing to disable devices when users are driving. It also called on the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to use its authority to take action ""against ""employers who fail to address the hazards of distracted driving.""
The board's criticism posed a direct challenge to the auto industry’s efforts to profit from partially automated vehicles and the smartphone industry’s quest to keep user eyes on their devices.
The NTSB can only make recommendations, while NHTSA regulates U.S. vehicles. NHTSA has sent teams to investigate 14 Tesla crashes in which Autopilot is suspected of being in use, but taken no action against the company.
Concerns have grown about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, but cannot completely replace human drivers.
""It's time to stop enabling drivers in any partially automated vehicle to pretend that they have driverless cars. Because they don't have driverless cars,"" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.
The Mountain View, California crash - involving a driver who was playing a game on his phone during the fatal trip - illustrates ""semi-autonomous vehicles can lead drivers to be complacent... and it also points out that smartphones manipulating them, can be so addictive, that people aren't going to put them down,"" Sumwalt added.
Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in 2018 in Autopilot mode at about 70 miles per hour (113 kph) when it crashed into a safety barrier. The NTSB said Huang had been using an iPhone and recovered logs showed a word-building game was active.
The probable cause of Huang's crash was Autopilot steering the vehicle off the highway ""due to system limitations, and the driver’s lack of response due to distraction likely from a cell phone game application and overreliance"" on Autopilot, the NTSB said. Huang on prior trips had intervened when Autopilot steered the vehicle toward the same ""highway gore"" area. 
NHTSA said it will carefully review the NTSB's recommendations. The agency added that commercial motor vehicles ""require the human driver to be in control at all times.""
Tesla drivers are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, but Tesla advises keeping hands on the wheel and paying attention.
Sumwalt said Tesla allowed drivers to remove their hands from the wheel for up to three minutes under certain conditions when using Autopilot. 
The NTSB said Tesla added safeguards to require quicker warnings at higher speeds for drivers without hands on the wheel.
Regulators in Europe place limitations on Autopilot use and Tesla issues alerts there for hands-off driving within 15 seconds, the NTSB said.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg called Autopilot ""completely inadequate"" and noted Tesla vehicles have repeatedly crashed into large obstacles. 
Sumwalt said Tesla - unlike five other auto manufacturers - has ignored NTSB safety recommendations issued in 2017.
Tesla's Autopilot is tied to at least three deadly crashes since 2016 and suspected in others.
The NTSB will release in coming days the probable cause of a third Tesla Autopilot fatal crash in March 2019 in Florida that showed no evidence the driver’s hands were on the steering wheel in the final 8 seconds before striking a semi-trailer truck.
The NTSB also called on cellphone manufacturers to add more safeguards to prevent the misuse of devices by drivers.

Sumwalt noted that Apple does not have a distracted driving policy, but said it should have one. Apple says it expects its employees to follow the law.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 05:54PM ET</span>",Three U.S. Senate Democrats propose sweeping reforms after Boeing 737 MAX crashes,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three Democratic U.S. senators on Tuesday introduced sweeping legislation to reform how new airplanes are certified and overseen by U.S. regulators after two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people.
The bill would create an independent aircraft certification commission, bar  Boeing Co  and other manufacturers from tying employee compensation to delivery of airplanes and increase oversight of manufacturers that handle delegated certification tasks on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The legislation would also set new requirements for individuals handling delegated certification tasks and require regular audits.
Boeing's best-selling jet has been grounded since March 2019 and the FAA has been criticized by some for its role in approving the jet's new safety system in the wake of both fatal crashes. 
The FAA did not immediately comment. Boeing said on Tuesday that ""as members of Congress work on legislation, we are committed to working with them and the FAA to promote aviation safety.""
The legislation would also give the FAA administrator power to deem airplanes not sellable in certain countries until airlines met training, operating and maintenance requirements. It would require the FAA to assess a country complies with international safety standards before being sold U.S. manufactured aircraft.
The legislation would incentivise potential whistleblowers to report companies attempting to hide serious defects. Whistleblowers could receive up to 30% of monetary sanctions for information leading to a successful resolution.
The bill is backed by major aviation unions including the Air Line Pilots Association, the Association of Flight Attendants and Transport Workers Union of America.
The legislation would also reverse some provisions of a 2018 law limiting when the FAA could maintain oversight of airplane functions or requiring broader delegation.
""Returning power to federal regulators is a necessary first step to restore accountability,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, one of the three sponsors. ""Left to its own devices, the aviation industry has put corporate profits before consumer safety.""
He added: ""The system in place is broken and we must make it right before more lives are lost.""
Republicans in Congress have generally said they want to wait for the outcome of investigations before calling for certain reforms.
Several reviews of the MAX certification have called for specific reforms, including improved staffing and experience for Boeing employees handling certification tasks.
The Justice Department has an ongoing criminal investigation of the crashes and the Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General is reviewing the FAA's MAX certification.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 05:51PM ET</span>","In first public results, Branson's Virgin Galactic posts $73 mln quarterly loss","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Billionaire Richard Branson's space tourism company, Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (N:SPCE), said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter net loss widened to $73 million from a year-ago loss of $46 million as it reported its first results as a publicly traded company.
The quarterly results, which include one-time transaction and other related costs, come as the company is aiming for a first commercial flight later this year with Branson on board.
""It will be a transformative moment for the company,"" Chief Executive George Whitesides told analysts on a conference call, adding that revenue and cash flow will ramp up in 2021.
Shares of Virgin Galactic were volatile in after-hours trading and were last down 6.4%. Shares had rallied in recent days, driven by investor interest in the first space tourism company to hit public markets.
Virgin Galactic competes with billionaire-backed ventures such as Blue Origin, founded by Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, to be the first to offer suborbital flights to fare-paying thrill seekers, presaging a new era of civilian space travel that could kick off as soon as this year.
Other players including Elon Musk's SpaceX and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) have their sights set on higher altitudes like the International Space Station, the moon and eventually Mars.
Some 600 people from 60 countries have paid or put down deposits to fly on one of Virgin's suborbital flights, worth about $80 million in total collected deposits and $120 million of potential revenue, the company said.
A 90-minute flight, which allows passengers to experience a few minutes of weightlessness, costs about $250,000.
Now, Virgin plans to seize on a wave of more than 7,900 ""registrations of interest"" it has received since then from would-be astronauts by collecting $1,000 deposits to secure a place in line as seats become available, it said on Tuesday.
Virgin Galactic has so far invested $1 billion in its reusable mid-air launch technology.
Closer to Earth, Virgin also plans to develop hypersonic passenger air travel that could dramatically cut travel times across the world, the company said. For example, flying from New York to London would take about an hour, it said.
The company, which went public last year, reported fourth-quarter revenue of $529,000, and $3.8 million for 2019, the first full year of results.

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Robert Iger will step down as chief executive officer, handing the reins to Disney Parks head Bob Chapek, the company said on Tuesday, ending years of speculation on who will take over Hollywood's most powerful studio.
Iger is still keeping a significant role at the company. He will assume the post of executive chairman and direct the company's ""creative endeavors"" until his contract ends on Dec. 31, 2021, Disney said.
""The company has gotten larger and more complex just in the recent 12 months,"" Iger said on a conference call on Tuesday, citing its purchase of 21st Century Fox and launch of direct-to-consumer services such as Disney+ last year.
""I felt that with the asset bases in place and with our strategy deployed I should be spending as much time as possible on the creative side of our business.""
Shares of Disney, which ended the day down 3.6%, fell another 2.2% after the markets closed.
Chapek, who will be the seventh CEO in the company's nearly 100-year history, has most recently served as the chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Chapek will report to Iger.
In Chapek's new role, the company said he will directly oversee all of Disney's business segments and corporate functions.
As chairman of Disney theme parks division, Chapek oversaw Disney's largest business segment, including the opening of Disney's first theme park and resort in mainland China and the creation of the new Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge lands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. He joined Disney in 1993.
Iger, who has been CEO since 2005, has led the company through the development and launch of its Disney+ streaming service, which launched in November to demand that exceeded company expectations. 

Iger built up the Disney brand through a series of acquisitions, including animation studio Pixar in 2006, Marvel in 2009, and ""Star Wars"" franchise owner Lucasfilm in 2012. His biggest bet was the purchase of 21st Century Fox, a deal that was instrumental in launching Disney+.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street's main semiconductor benchmark tumbled into correction territory on Tuesday in its deepest four-day rout since the financial crisis, as the coronavirus spread further around the world and deepened fears about the global economy.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.2%, bringing the decline from its Feb 19 record high to almost 12%, the worst four-day drop for the index since 2008.
Many investors consider a correction in a security or index to be a drop of 10% or more from its recent peak.
Even after its recent slump, the chip index is up 27% over the past 12 months, a rally that was fueled by expectations that the industry would soon recover from a drop in global demand in recent years. That strong performance has left many investors concerned that chip stocks could be vulnerable to unexpected bad news.
Nvidia dropped 3.7% after Nomura Instinet downgraded the graphics chipmaker to ""reduce"" from ""neutral"" due to concerns about the coronavirus' impact on demand. Nomura Instinet also cut its forecast for global chip industry sales in 2020 to $429 billion from $437 billion, representing 4% growth instead of 6% growth.
""We think there may be risk to demand in most electronic end markets, though we believe the end markets associated with consumer purchases might have the most potential downside,"" Nomura Instinet analyst David Wong wrote in a research note.
Following a slump on Monday, Wall Street on Tuesday fell again as investors focused on the potential economic impact of the outbreak as it spread to new countries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans should prepare for possible community spread of the coronavirus.
Chipmakers rely more than most other U.S. companies on revenue from China, where the outbreak has badly disrupted factory production and crimped consumer demand.
Smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) fell 3.1%. It and Nvidia provided the strongest downward pressure on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Twenty-nine out of 30 stocks in the index fell, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co the only stock in positive territory, up 0.6%."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 tumbled 3% on Tuesday in their fourth straight day of losses as the coronavirus spread further around the world and investors offloaded risky assets as they struggled to gauge the economic impact.
Both averages recorded their biggest four-day percentage losses since the massive sell-off in December 2018, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit a record low.. 
The S&P 500 lost $2.138 trillion in market capitalization over the last four sessions, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt. 
Fears of a pandemic escalated after the coronavirus spread to Spain and dozens of countries, from South Korea to Italy, accelerated emergency measures while Iran's virus death toll rose to 16, the highest outside China.
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans should prepare for possible community spread of the virus.
""The market's realizing that though the pace of the infections looked like it was slowing, it's still spreading globally,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.
While investors had hoped the economic impact of the virus would be contained to the first quarter, Cruz said many are now estimating that ""it's going to have an impact on the first half of 2020 and probably beyond.""
The Nasdaq ended the session 8.7% below its record closing high, reached last Wednesday, while the S&P finished 7.6% under its record close achieved the same day. A total 314 of the benchmark's 500 stocks were in correction territory, traditionally viewed as a 10% drop from their high. 
The Dow ended the day 8.4% below its February 12 record close. 
In the busiest trading day since December 21, 2018, volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.24 billion shares, compared with the 7.99 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) ended down 879.44 points, or 3.15%, at 27,081.36 and the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 97.68 points, or 3.03%, to finish at 3,128.21. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 255.67 points, or 2.77%, to 8,965.61.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, climbed above 30 for the first time since December 2018 and closed at 27.85. 
The NYSE Arca Airline index closed down 5%, clocking its biggest three-day decline since October 2011. Delta Airlines Inc (N:DAL), down 6%, said on Tuesday that it expects U.S.-China flights to be suspended until the end of April and expanded its travel waiver to Seoul until April 30.
The Associated Press reported https://apnews.com/58043910be7bdc6818344bdee2096bc2 that a senior member of the International Olympic Committee said organizers are more likely to cancel the 2020 Olympics than to postpone or move them if the coronavirus makes it too dangerous to hold in Tokyo. 
Only 10 S&P stocks advanced on the day, while all of the S&P's 11 industry sectors fell. The energy sector (SPNY) was the biggest loser, with a more than 4% dip as oil prices tumbled. 
Marriott International (O:MAR) was the S&P's biggest percentage decliner, down almost 8%, and other travel stocks such as  Tripadvisor  (O:TRIP), down 4.7%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (K:NCLH), down 7.7%, also underperformed sharply.
Mastercard Inc (N:MA) shares fell 6.7%, also putting it among the S&P's biggest percentage decliners. 
HP Inc (N:HPQ), the S&P's biggest boost, pared early gains but still closed up 5.7% after saying it would step up efforts to slash costs and buy back stock as it sought investor support to defend against a $35 billion takeover offer from U.S. printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp (N:XRX).
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 7.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 6.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and 43 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 230 new lows.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 05:06PM ET</span>","Once bulletproof, tech stocks now among market's biggest losers","By Ira Iosebashvili and Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - Technology shares -- a key engine of the stock market's climb to records over the last several months -- are now among those leading Wall Street's plunge on growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.
The S&P 500 information technology sector has fallen 9.3% since Thursday’s close, outpacing a drop of 7.3% for the broader index. Only energy has performed worse, reflecting a sharp decline in oil prices on fears that the coronavirus will slow global economic activity.
Investors poured billions into big technology stocks and other momentum bets last year, as a dovish Federal Reserve stoked risk appetite and fueled a rally of more than 30% in the S&P 500. Some big technology and momentum stocks kept griding higher, driving markets to records even as concerns grew over the virus’ spread in China in recent weeks.
Now a surge in coronavirus cases outside of China has made some investors more willing to part with riskier assets in favor of traditional havens like gold and U.S. Treasuries, which have soared in recent days.
“Everyone just got a full helping of tech stocks up at the high. It was some of the most reckless buying I’ve seen in my lifetime,” said Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners.
(GRAPHIC: Roller coaster 2020 for market's big names - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R8D7C1H/eikon.png)
Stanton rode shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other big technology names higher last year. He now owns derivatives will rise if the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index continues to decline.
As of Friday, the S&P 500 information technology sector accounted for nearly 55% of the overall S&P 500's total return in 2020, even though the sector was only 24.3% of the benchmark index's market value, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Just four companies -- Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- accounted for 46.4% of the 2020 total return as of Friday, Silverblatt said.
That magnitude of concentration in a small universe of names had some investors worried that they have become overstretched and vulnerable to a sudden reversal in risk appetite. The tech sector's valuation recently stood at its highest forward price-to-earnings multiple since 2004, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
And while technology stocks have tended to outperform during good times, they can also fall further than broader markets when risk appetite dries up. When the S&P 500 tumbled nearly 20% from its high in late 2018, the tech sector suffered a steeper 23% drop over that period.
“Up until now, this market has been remarkably free of any critical thinking,” said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company. “This has given investors a perfect reason to examine what they are paying and what they are expecting.”"

Airline Stocks Fall Over Concerns on Travel Impact (4 p.m. NY)
U.S. airlines posted the biggest two-day drop since 2016 on worsening fears that the spread of the coronavirus will further stymie travel.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. led the decline, tumbling to the lowest since its 2013 merger with US Airways. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering whether to adopt more restrictions on air travel because of the outbreak, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Tuesday.

Kudlow Urges Calm After CDC Virus Warning (1:40 p.m. NY)
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow called for calm after U.S. health officials said that an outbreak inside the U.S. could cause significant disruptions to daily life if emergency plans were put into place.
“I think people should be as calm as possible in assessing this,” Kudlow said at the White House. “Emergency plans don’t necessarily mean they’ll have to be put into place.”
There have been fewer than 20 coronavirus cases diagnosed in the U.S., though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it expects the pathogen to eventually spread locally.
“We have contained this, I won’t say airtight, but pretty close to airtight,” Kudlow said. He called it a human tragedy because of the toll in China, but said it was not an economic one.
Cases Grow in Italy and Across Europe (1:02 p.m. NY)
Italy saw its 10th casualty from the coronavirus outbreak, with 322 confirmed cases nationwide, as the infection began to appear across Europe and threatened to further disrupt tourism and business. Health ministers in Germany, France, Italy and other neighboring countries vowed to keep Europe’s borders open and to improve information-sharing about travelers to and from areas with infections.
Spain’s authorities held about 1,000 guests and workers at a seaside hotel on Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, after an Italian tourist there initially tested positive for the virus. Croatia and Switzerland reported their first cases, and Austria confirmed two more. All the patients had links to Italy.
CDC Warns Americans to Prepare for Outbreak (12:53 p.m. NY)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans should prepare for school closings, cancellations of sporting events, concerts and business meetings if the coronavirus spreads in the U.S.
“We expect we will see community spread in this country,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on a call with reporters Tuesday. “It is not a matter of if, but a question of when, this will exactly happen.”
The outbreak is “rapidly evolving and expanding,” she said. “Now is the time” for businesses, schools and hospitals to begin preparing. She said that Americans should prepare for the coronavirus epidemic on our shores and to assume it will be bad.
U.S. Is Short on Masks in Case of American Outbreak (11:30 a.m. NY)
The U.S. has far fewer protective masks than it would need in the case of a major outbreak of the coronavirus in the country, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Congress Tuesday.
The U.S. has about 30 million stockpiled N95 masks that can help stop a person from inhaling infective particles, Azar said, but would need as much as 300 million for health workers in an outbreak. U.S. health officials have said they’re preparing for the coronavirus to eventually begin spreading locally.
Gilead Drug Being Tested on Evacuees in Nebraska (11:20 a.m. NY)
Gilead’s antiviral drug remdesivir will be tested on coronavirus patients at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, which is housing people who were evacuated from a virus-infested cruise ship in Japan, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said.
Although remdesivir has been administered to some patients with the virus, “we do not have solid data to indicate it can improve clinical outcomes,” said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the institute, said in a statement.
The first trial participant is an American who was repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan. So far, 11 of the 13 patients who were repatriated from the ship to the Nebraska hospital have been confirmed to have the coronavirus.
Remdesivir is also being tested in trials in China and Japan, said U.S. Heath and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at a Senate hearing Tuesday.
Pompeo Criticizes China, Iran Reponse (10 a.m. NY)
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo criticized China and Iran’s response to the coronavirus, saying that suppression of information about the infection may have made the outbreak worse or put other countries on the back foot.
“The United States is deeply concerned that the Iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,” Pompeo said at a press conference in Washington. At least 15 people in Iran are dead, authorities there have said, though there are reports of higher numbers and hundreds of potential cases.
Pompeo also criticized Chinese authorities, after the government said it would expel three Wall Street Journal reporters. In the province of Hubei, where the outbreak began, some early warnings of a new virus were initially suppressed.
“Expelling our journalists exposes once again the government’s issue that led to SARS, and now the coronavirus -- namely censorship. It can have deadly consequences. Had China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge.”
Senators Say Administration May Request More Virus Funds (9:45 a.m. NY)
Several U.S. senators emerging from a classified briefing on Capitol Hill Tuesday said they expected the Trump administration to ask for more money to combat a potential coronavirus outbreak, depending on how the situation plays out in the U.S.
Senators were told, “Let’s see how it evolves and then we can put more dollars in,” said Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. The administration has requested $2.5 billion -- half new money, half repurposed from other efforts -- from Congress to deal with the virus.

The U.S. government will oversee an international trial of  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD).’s experimental drug remdesivir, which is already being tested in China as a potential treatment for the coronavirus there.
The trial is being run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, and seeks to sign up about 400 people in the U.S. and at foreign sites. It’s expected to be completed by April 1, according to information about the trial posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry.

Catastrophe Bonds Signal Virus Nearing Pandemic Status (7:49 a.m. NY)
The World Health Organization says the coronavirus isn’t yet a global pandemic. Bonds that insure against just such a catastrophe say that it probably is.

Moderna Rallies on Quick Vaccine Turnaround (7:33 a.m. NY)
Moderna Inc., the biotechnology company developing an experimental coronavirus vaccine in collaboration with the U.S. government, said it shipped a first batch of the inoculation to begin human testing. The stock jumped as much as 25%.
The experimental vaccine was sent to the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is to be used in an early stage study to test its safety. It will likely take months of testing to determine whether or not the vaccine can successfully stop infections, and more time to roll it out if it does work.
Top Iranian Health Official Tests Positive (7:32 a.m. NY)
A top Iranian health official has been diagnosed with coronavirus in another sign the disease may be spiraling out of control in the country. Iraj Harirchi, a deputy health minister who has been the face of the government’s campaign against the virus, said he tested positive for it late Monday, the day he gave a press briefing on efforts to combat the outbreak.
Separately, Tehran lawmaker Mahmoud Sadeghi tweeted that he had tested positive. Sadeghi is a prominent reformist who was barred from participating in the latest parliamentary elections.
Earlier on Tuesday, Iran reported 34 new cases, with the death toll rising to 15. Bahrain reported nine new cases, while Kuwait has an additional three and Oman another two. So far, there are about 140 confirmed cases in the Middle East, all of them linked to Iran.
The U.A.E. has banned travel to all cities in Iran and has already suspended all flights to and from China, except Beijing. Kuwait, which has already stopped flights to Iran, on Monday suspended travel to South Korea, Thailand, Italy and Iraq. Separately, a Turkish Airlines flight from Tehran bound for Istanbul made an unscheduled landing in Ankara, according to Turkey’s Haberturk television.

Tenerife Hotel in Lockdown (6:25 a.m. NY)
An Italian staying on the Spanish island of Tenerife tested positive for the virus and a second test to confirm the case will be carried out in Madrid, the government said. The case would be Spain’s third and the first on the island. Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands, attracted more than 5.7 million tourists last year.
The tourist, a doctor, had come from Lombardy, a region of northern Italy that is a focus of an outbreak of the virus, Efe news service reported. Spain’s two previously confirmed patients no longer have the infection.
About 1,000 guests and hotel workers won’t be able to leave pending definitive results of the test expected later on Tuesday, a person familiar with the situation said.
Luxury Sales Could Drop by $44 Billion (6:20 a.m. NY)

Bernstein. China is a key market for most luxury firms, and signs that the virus has been spreading more widely are causing jitters to increase.

Investing.com - Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) fell in after-hours trade Tuesday after the company said Bob Iger will step down as CEO and assume the role of executive chairman.
Disney was down 2% postmarket.
Bob Chapek, who most recently served as chairman of Disney parks, experiences and products, will take the helm as CEO, effective immediately, the company said.
“With the successful launch of Disney’s direct-to-consumer businesses and the integration of Twenty-First Century Fox well underway, I believe this is the optimal time to transition to a new CEO,” Iger said said in a statement. “I have the utmost confidence in Bob and look forward to working closely with him over the next 22 months as he assumes this new role and delves deeper into Disney’s multifaceted global businesses and operations, while I continue to focus on the Company’s creative endeavors.”
""Bob will be the seventh CEO in Disney’s nearly 100-year history, and he has proven himself exceptionally qualified to lead the Company into its next century,"" Iger added.

By Yasin Ebrahim 

Investing.com – The S&P plunged for the second session in a row Tuesday as traders ditched stocks for safe havens, with global health authorities sounding the alarm on a ""likely"" coronavirus pandemic.

The S&P 500 slumped 3.03% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.77%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.15%, bringing its two-day loss to more than 1,900 points..

Energy and financial stocks were among the worst hit as traders continued to reassess the impact of the virus on global growth, with new outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East stoking fears of a coming pandemic.

""Current global circumstances suggest it’s likely this virus will cause a pandemic,"" Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters at a news briefing.
The CDC also said the it was ""inevitable"" that Covid-19 would spreadin in the U.S. and that Americans would face disruptions to their daily lives. That statement pushed stocks to their lows of the day in afternoon trading.
There have been confirmed 53 cases of Covid-19 in the U.S. A spate of infections were also identified across the Middle East, including two more cases in Oman, six more in Bahrain, while in Europe Switzerland confirmed its first case.

Rising worries over global growth, stoked concerns about the U.S. economy, sending the UUnited States 10-Year Treasury yield to record low 1.307% during the trading day, pressuring financials like bank stocks lower.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) slid 5%, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) sank 3% and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) lost 4.4% as a fall in bond yields tends to weigh on net interest margin.

The decline in JPMorgan came even as Wall Street Bank said it expects to post a ""mid teens"" increase in trading revenues for the first quarter. The most recent quarterly results showed stronger trading revenue helped banks offset a slowing net interest income amid a low interest rate environment.

Energy fell 4%, paced by a decline in U.S. oil prices, which settled under $50 a barrel for the first time in two weeks on worries about virus' impact on global oil demand. 

The International Energy Agency's outlook on global oil demand growth has fallen to its lowest level in a decade, IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Tuesday, and he warned of further demand pressures due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
A mixed slate of earnings, meanwhile, did little to influence direction.

Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK)'s (NYSE:SHAK) fiscal fourth-quarter revenue missed analysts' estimates and guidance also fell short, sending its shares down 14%.

HP (NYSE:HPQ), meanwhile, climbed about 5.6%, underpinned by fiscal first-quarter earnings that beat consensus estimates and a new plan to return capital to shareholders.
The economic front offered little comfort, as weaker-than-expected U.S. consumer confidence data raised doubts about the underlying strength of the economy."

(Reuters) -  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) Plc on Tuesday said it had agreed to a $1.6 billion settlement proposal in which its generic drug business would file bankruptcy in order to resolve thousands of lawsuits alleging it helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic.
The settlement was reached with a key committee that represents thousands of local governments pursuing lawsuits against opioid companies and was supported by a group of 47 state and U.S. territory attorneys general, the company said.
Mallinckrodt is the third opioid maker to consider bankruptcy protection as it deals with mounting expenses tied to lawsuits by thousands of U.S. states and local governments, holding them accountable for the U.S. opioid epidemic.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement called Mallinckrodt's proposed settlement ""a step in the right direction.""
Around 3,000 lawsuits have been filed accusing drug manufacturers of engaging in deceptive marketing that promoted the use of addictive painkillers and fueled the epidemic that since 1999 has resulted in more than 400,000 overdose deaths.
Other opioid companies who have filed for bankruptcy include Insys Therapeutics Inc and the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, which sought bankruptcy protection in September after reaching a tentative deal it values at $10 billion to resolve the cases against it.
Paul Hanly, a lead attorney for the local governments, welcomed Mallinckrodt's settlement proposal, saying he was ""hopeful that support for the deal will be widespread.""
Seven states have not signed onto Mallinckrodt's proposal, including New York, which is set to take several opioid companies to trial on March 20.
New Hampshire Associate Attorney General James Boffetti said his state was holding off from signing on, saying the proposal ""lacks specificity"" as to how the money would be distributed.
Settlement talks are ongoing with other companies. Twenty-one states recently rejected an $18 billion settlement proposal from three major U.S. drug distributors, though discussions remain active, sources told Reuters this month. [nNRAaz3b12]
Mallinckrodt said it would retain ownership of the speciality generics business after the completion of the bankruptcy process and would continue to evaluate strategic options for the unit.
Since last year, Mallinckrodt has been working to separate the business and had said it was considering several options.
The company also said it had entered into an agreement with some of its existing lenders under which it could receive a new $800 million four-year term loan.

Shares of Mallinckrodt were trading in the afternoon at $4.77, up 16.9%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German Facebook users would want the social media platform to pay them about $8 per month for sharing their contact information, while U.S. users would only seek $3.50, according to a study of how people in various countries value their private information. 
The study by U.S. based think tank the Technology Policy Institute (TPI) is the first that attempts to quantify the value of online privacy and data. It assessed how much privacy is worth in six countries by looking at the habits of people in the United States, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Columbia and Argentina.
It addresses growing concern about how companies from technology platforms to retailers have been collecting and monetizing personal data. U.S. regulators have imposed hefty fines on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet-owned Google's YouTube unit for privacy violations.
""Differences in how much people value privacy of different data types across countries suggests that people in some places may prefer weaker rules while people in other places might prefer stronger rules,"" Scott Wallsten, president and senior fellow at TPI told Reuters.
""Quantifying the value of privacy is necessary for conducting any analysis of proposed privacy policies,"" he said.
The study found Germans want to be paid more for letting technology platforms share their personal data with third-parties followed by U.S. consumers. 
People across the board place the highest value on financial information such as bank balance and biometric information such as fingerprint data in particular, and consider location data the least valuable, the study found.
A technology platform, on average, across all people the study assessed, would have to pay consumers a monthly $8.44 to share their bank balance information, $7.56 to share fingerprint information, $6.05 to read an individual's texts, and $5.80 to share information on cash withdrawals. 
By contrast, people wanted to be paid only $1.82 per month to share location data and nothing to be sent advertisements via text messages. 
The study found Latin American consumers have a preference for seeing advertisements on their smartphone, in contrast to U.S. residents and Germans.
U.S. lawmakers are working on a federal privacy legislation while states like California have put in place a new privacy law. 

On Tuesday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sent a letter to four top U.S. lawmakers urging them not to pre-empt the state's new privacy law with a watered down federal legislation.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 03:47PM ET</span>",Juul under scrutiny by 39 state attorneys general,"By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - A group of 39 state attorneys general on Tuesday announced an investigation into Juul Labs Inc's marketing practices, adding to mounting legal and regulatory problems for the e-cigarette maker over its role in the nation's youth vaping epidemic.
The probe, led by attorneys general in Connecticut, Florida, Nevada, Oregon and Texas, will examine whether Juul targeted underage users, and its claims about nicotine content and safety, the offices leading the probe said in separate statements.
Several other states, including California and Massachusetts, have already sued the San Francisco-based company saying it did little to prevent sales to underage customers and directly marketed to teenagers.
In a statement, Juul said it seeks to ""earn the trust of society by working cooperatively with attorneys general, regulators, public health officials"" and others to ""combat underage use and transition adult smokers from combustible cigarettes.""
The company said it only wants adult smokers and ""we do not intend to attract underage users.""
A Juul spokesman also said on Tuesday that two top international executives had resigned. Grant Winterton, who headed Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Ken Bishop, who headed Asia, both departed as the company centralizes oversight of international operations.
The departures were first reported by BuzzFeed News. 
On Monday Reuters reported that Juul was halting sales in Indonesia over concerns it could not stop retailers from selling its high-nicotine e-cigarettes to underage users in a largely unregulated tobacco market. 
California's lawsuit, filed in November, cited emails from Juul employees in 2017 joking about teenager interest in the product: ""40 people in checkout right now. 40 teenagers trying to buy 200 juuls.""
Massachusetts sued Juul earlier this month alleging that its ads in 2015 and 2016 appeared on teen-focused websites for Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and Seventeen magazine.
The California and Massachusetts attorneys general are not part of the 39-state group in the latest investigation.
Over the last year Juul has pulled flavors that appealed to teenagers and last fall announced it would stop all U.S. advertising.

The company faces a May deadline to prove to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that its products benefit smokers more than they harm non-smokers such as teenagers. If the company fails to meet that test, its products could no longer be sold.

Kulle, a two-decade veteran at the Swedish apparel retailer, most recently worked as strategic adviser to former H&M Group Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson.
Authentic Brands hopes Kulle's arrival would strengthen the company's loyalty program and improve its online and in-store shopping experience.

Authentic Brands and Simon Property would own 37.5% each of the retailer.
Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, hit by the rising popularity of online shopping and changing fashion trends among millennial shoppers.

During Kulle's stint as the president of H&M North America, annual sales in the region increased to $4 billion from $1 billion as the company opened 600 stores and expanded its digital presence in new markets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of North American retirement plans with more than $3.3 trillion in assets has backed a proposal by exchange operator IEX Group to use artificial intelligence to counter technology some high-speed traders use to get a trading edge.
New technologies and regulations have made the U.S. equity market more efficient. But they have also created speed advantages when executing stock orders, the group, led by pension plans in Ontario and Quebec, as well as the New York City Comptroller, said in a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
""These speed advantages have tilted the playing field in favor of firms specializing in 'latency arbitrage,' reducing the willingness of both long-term investors and market makers to display quotes,"" the group, which also includes retirement plans in California, Wyoming, and Arizona, said in the Feb. 24 letter.
In latency arbitrage, when a stock price changes on one of the 13 U.S. exchanges, a firm uses advanced technology to race ahead electronically to the other exchanges microseconds before the price updates to buy or sell at an advantageous level.
IEX asked the SEC in December to let it use machine learning-based software to monitor data feeds from all U.S. exchanges to identify when stock quotes are likely to change and then send a ""signal"" that momentarily prevents affected displayed stock orders from executing. IEX is currently using the signal for undisplayed orders, which are priced off of displayed orders. 
The signal is on for 0.02% of the trading day, and during that time, 24% of IEX's displayed stock orders are currently executed. That indicates sophisticated traders are taking advantage of tiny windows of time when prices are changing, the exchange said.
The SEC said on Feb. 12 it needed more time to evaluate IEX's proposal after trade groups representing automated trading firms and broker dealers, as well as individual firms Hudson River Trading and IMC, said quotes on IEX would not be reliable if it went ahead.
IMC called IEX's proposal ""a perilous gimmick that creates a safe zone for illusory orders.""
Investment and trading firms that have asked the SEC to approve IEX's proposal include Raymond James, Jefferies (N:JEF), T. Rowe Price (O:TROW), Baird, AGF, Clearpool and market makers XTX and Virtu Financial (O:VIRT).
""We believe that IEX's proposal is a highly innovative, market-based solution that will mitigate the negative effects of certain predatory trading behaviors that have been spawned by the latency arbitrage that exists in today's lightning speed markets,"" Virtu said.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and other investment banks have curbed trips to Italy amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak across the north of the country could quickly spread across Europe, sources said.
Lazard,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) also rushed to warn staff against all ""non-essential travel"" to northern Italy, four sources told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity as banking policies are confidential.
Bankers working on sensitive deals were told to seek special permission from top management if they still wanted to fly into Milan, Bologna or other northern Italian towns, the sources said.
Goldman said its travel restrictions applied to Italy's Lombardy and Veneto regions, and South Korea. It also advised staff against travel to, from and within the rest of Italy. Those who recently visited affected areas were told to isolate themselves and stay away from the office for at least 14 days.
Japanese bank Nomura was first to adopt a rigorous approach by restricting client visits to all countries with coronavirus cases, including France, one of the sources said.
""They are all grounded,"" this source said referring to Nomura's bankers in Milan.
Citi, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Nomura declined to comment. Lazard was not immediately available.
Coronavirus infections have soared across northern Italy in the past few days, causing almost 300 cases and seven deaths.
It is the first time banks have restricted trips within Europe as most financial institutions have so far only applied travel bans to mainland China, imposing a 14-day quarantine on those who recently returned.
Most bankers in London who want to see clients in Italy fear they may face similar quarantines.
Paris-based bankers have been urged to follow recommendations issued by the French government for people returning from ""risky countries"" - now including northern Italy - to stay home for 14 days, two of the sources said.
STUCK AT HOME
Nearly 300 people in Italy have come down with the virus since Friday, latest data showed, the vast majority of them in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.
Most financial institutions have told their employees living near the affected areas to work from home rather than the office and postpone business trips.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Lazard and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) have empty offices in Milan as most staff are working remotely, three other sources said.
Credit Suisse has also encouraged local bankers to stay home and avoid face-to-face client visits, they said.
The banks declined to comment.
Milan-based Mediobanca and UniCredit issued statements to emphasize their respective commitment to keeping employees safe at home.
French banks BNP and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) urged Italian staff to limit business trips, rely on ""smart working"" and suspend training activities and internal events.
Italian private equity funds including Clessidra SGR and Armonia SGR, as well as state-backed funds Fondo FSI and Fondo Italiano d'Investimento, have canceled their planned attendance at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin where they were set to talk about buyout deals in Italy.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Tuesday the economic fallout from the outbreak could be ""very strong"" but said he was hopeful the contagion would soon come under control.
""I can't say I'm not worried ... but I'm confident we'll have a containing effect in the next few days,"" he said."

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 02:47PM ET</span>",Investors piled into volatility bets before market tumble,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fears of a coronavirus-fueled slowdown have injected volatility back into markets, but some investors may be less exposed this time around.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, jumped on Tuesday to a near 14-month high of 26.71. It recently traded at 25.71. Wall Street extended its losses on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 (SPX) on pace to shed about 5% over three sessions.
A jump of that magnitude can hurt investors who had bet that markets would remain calm. But such wagers have dwindled lately, while investors have been more eager to pick up insurance against sharp market swings.
In volatility futures markets, bets against stock market gyrations, stood at their lowest level since September last week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.
Through Thursday, a day before the most recent stock selloff began, total assets at the two largest exchange-traded products (ETPs) designed to benefit from rising volatility, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (P:VXX) and the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (O:TVIX), were at $1.78 billion, according to YCharts data.
Even before the latest selloff started, assets at VXX jumped by 35%, compared with a year ago, while those at TVIX rose by 22%, YCharts data showed.
By contrast, the largest short volatility ETP, the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (K:SVXY), had assets of about $238 million, down 45% from a year ago.
""Most of the exposure was on the correct side for a move like this,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializes in investments using VIX instruments.
Bets against volatility had become more popular in recent years, after an extended period of stock market calm in 2016 and 2017 boosted the returns for some short volatility ETPs, including the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN XIV, attracting ever more speculative players.
That changed when a sudden drop in the U.S. stock market in February 2018 wiped out most of the value of these ETPs and led to the collapse of some products, including the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN.
Recent positioning indicates that memories of that eruption may have cooled investors' enthusiasm for betting against volatility, even as markets marched higher. Cautious investors also had ample time to pare back wagers against volatility or buy insurance against market swings as the coronavirus outbreak began to dominate headlines over the last several weeks, analysts said.
Further declines in stocks could spur selling by computer-driven funds that tend to sell their equity positions when market swings increase, said Parag Thatte, a strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Thatte expects a 3% one-day selloff to translate into roughly $13-$15 billion in selling of equities from some of these investors -- known as volatility control funds -- within a day.
Persistent volatility would draw selling from trend-following commodity trading advisors and risk parity funds, both of which have more assets than volatility control funds, he said."

Gilead’s antiviral drug remdesivir will be tested on coronavirus patients at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, which is housing people who were evacuated from a virus-infested cruise ship in Japan, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said.
Although remdesivir has been administered to some patients with the virus, “we do not have solid data to indicate it can improve clinical outcomes,” said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the institute, said in a statement.
The first trial participant is an American who was repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan. So far, 11 of the 13 patients who were repatriated from the ship to the Nebraska hospital have been confirmed to have the coronavirus.
Remdesivir is also being tested in trials in China and Japan, said U.S. Heath and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at a Senate hearing Tuesday.
Pompeo Criticizes China, Iran Reponse (10 a.m. NY)
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo criticized China and Iran’s response to the coronavirus, saying that suppression of information about the infection may have made the outbreak worse or put other countries on the back foot.
“The United States is deeply concerned that the Iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,” Pompeo said at a press conference in Washington. At least 15 people in Iran are dead, authorities there have said, though there are reports of higher numbers and hundreds of potential cases.
Pompeo also criticized Chinese authorities, after the government said it would expel three Wall Street Journal reporters. In the province of Hubei, where the outbreak began, some early warnings of a new virus were initially suppressed.
“Expelling our journalists exposes once again the government’s issue that led to SARS, and now the coronavirus -- namely censorship. It can have deadly consequences. Had China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge.”
Senators Say Administration May Request More Virus Funds (9:45 a.m. NY)
Several U.S. senators emerging from a classified briefing on Capitol Hill Tuesday said they expected the Trump administration to ask for more money to combat a potential coronavirus outbreak, depending on how the situation plays out in the U.S.
Senators were told, “Let’s see how it evolves and then we can put more dollars in,” said Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. The administration has requested $2.5 billion -- half new money, half repurposed from other efforts -- from Congress to deal with the virus.
U.S. Will Test Experimental Gilead Drug in NIH Trial (8:44 a.m. NY)
The U.S. government will oversee an international trial of Gilead Sciences Inc.’s experimental drug remdesivir, which is already being tested in China as a potential treatment for the coronavirus there.
The trial is being run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, and seeks to sign up about 400 people in the U.S. and at foreign sites. It’s expected to be completed by April 1, according to information about the trial posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry.

Moderna Rallies on Quick Vaccine Turnaround (7:33 a.m. NY)
Moderna Inc., the biotechnology company developing an experimental coronavirus vaccine in collaboration with the U.S. government, said it shipped a first batch of the inoculation to begin human testing. The stock jumped as much as 25%.
The experimental vaccine was sent to the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is to be used in an early stage study to test its safety. It will likely take months of testing to determine whether or not the vaccine can successfully stop infections, and more time to roll it out if it does work.
Top Iranian Health Official Tests Positive (7:32 a.m. NY)
A top Iranian health official has been diagnosed with coronavirus in another sign the disease may be spiraling out of control in the country.

Separately, Tehran lawmaker Mahmoud Sadeghi tweeted that he had tested positive. Sadeghi is a prominent reformist who was barred from participating in the latest parliamentary elections.
Earlier on Tuesday, Iran reported 34 new cases, with the death toll rising to 15. Bahrain reported nine new cases, while Kuwait has an additional three and Oman another two. So far, there are about 140 confirmed cases in the Middle East, all of them linked to Iran.
The U.A.E. has banned travel to all cities in Iran and has already suspended all flights to and from China, except Beijing. Kuwait, which has already stopped flights to Iran, on Monday suspended travel to South Korea, Thailand, Italy and Iraq. Separately, a Turkish Airlines flight from Tehran bound for Istanbul made an unscheduled landing in Ankara, according to Turkey’s Haberturk television.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 02:31PM ET</span>",JPMorgan executives say bank is big enough to weather any storm,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) executives tried to reassure investors on Tuesday that the bank can thrive during times of market and economic stress, due to the sheer size and breadth of its global operations.
At its annual investor day in New York, management offered updates on JPMorgan's four main business lines but did not upgrade profit targets – signaling an expectation of slow, steady growth over the medium term.
JPMorgan has spent much of the last decade capitalizing on healthy markets and strong customer demand to prepare for hard times, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said. That means the bank's balance sheet is strong enough not only to get through a downturn but make investments in the future, he said.
""Downturns present great opportunities,"" Dimon said.
As executives spoke, major stock indexes were falling on concerns about the coronavirus epidemic. The illness, which has now spread from China and neighboring countries to Europe, the Middle East and North America, is the latest in a string of problems that have whipsawed markets recently.
JPMorgan is the largest U.S. bank by assets, with operations spanning the globe and a leading market share in many of its businesses. That poses natural obstacles for growth, but it also gives JPMorgan the flexibility to invest where weaker rivals pull back, and to fund experiments in the future of financial services.
For instance, JPMorgan has opened dozens of new locations in targeted markets and installed sleek, new ATMs across its branch network, each one costing about $30,000.
The bank is chasing 40,000 prospective small-business customers it found at new branches across the East Coast and Midwest, said Doug Petno, head of commercial banking.
Thasunda Duckett, who runs JPMorgan's consumer bank, highlighted efforts to attract younger customers. Roughly 25% of the bank's new checking accounts come from college students in targeted cities like Durham, North Carolina, she said.
JPMorgan's new digital wealth-management tool was another initiative highlighted by Mary Callahan Erdoes, head of asset and wealth management.
The product, called You Invest, is offered through a smartphone app and targets customers with relatively little wealth. In addition, JPMorgan handles investments for just 5% of U.S. households with $1 million to $10 million in assets but hopes to expand that in the coming years, Erdoes said.
JPMorgan developed You Invest to compete with tools offered by rivals, as well as standalone ""roboadvisors"" like Betterment and Wealthfront.
In his typically blunt style, Dimon noted that JPMorgan is big enough to invest in novel products to one-up the competition.
""We earn $47 billion; we can burn a billion in order to do something better, rather than be disrupted,"" Dimon said. HO-HUM TARGETS
Though executives sprinkled their presentations with new details, JPMorgan kept stable the forward-looking benchmarks that investors and analysts focus on the most.
Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said the bank continues to aim for a return-on-tangible-common-equity (ROTCE) of 17%. That metric determines how much profit a bank can wring from shareholder funds. Last year, JPMorgan produced an ROTCE of 19%.
JPMorgan cut its outlook for net interest income to $57 billion for 2020 from $57.8 billion in 2019, blaming lower interest rates. It forecast $60 billion or more in net interest income for 2021, which was above analysts' estimates.
The bank also forecast higher expenses of $67 billion, compared with $65.3 billion last year, despite a ""reduction in structural expenses.""
Management's outlook for the bank's returns on equity in each of its four units – Consumer & Community Banking, the Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management – remained unchanged.
The one target JPMorgan did raise relates to financing of environmentally friendly, socially responsible or economic development initiatives.
JPMorgan pledged to put $200 billion toward such projects by 2025 as a lender, underwriter or intermediary, up from a prior $175 billion goal it had set in 2017.
The update came after years of criticism from environmental activists. Some stood outside JPMorgan's investor day, partially blocking some entrances and demanding that the bank get rid of fossil-fuel clients.
Although JPMorgan's financial targets did not change, analysts said they were generally in line with expectations. The bank's shares were down 2.7% at $128.56 in afternoon trading, tracking lower than the broader market.
Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr noted that the bank has posted better revenue growth, profits, returns on equity and overhead expenses than major rivals, which he characterized as ""amazing given their size."""

1093,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 02:19PM ET</span>",Airlines should complete inspections on 737 MAX panels before flying: FAA,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday proposed that airlines complete inspections on a key component that could make Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airplanes vulnerable to lightning strikes and interference from high-power radio frequency transmitters before returning to service.
 Boeing Co  in December issued a service bulletin that disclosed procedures for detailed inspections and repairs or replacement if needed for panels on top of the engine housing that may not ensure adequate shielding of the underlying wiring.
Boeing said in the December bulletin that owners had six months to complete inspections and repairs, but the FAA is now proposing that the actions be conducted before the airlines make further flights because of the ""potential for a common-cause failure of both engines.""
Boeing said on Tuesday it agreed with the FAA recommendation. Boeing said in December the issue impacted airplanes built between February 2018 and June 2019 and as a result ""the protective foil inside the composite panels may have gaps.""
The 737 MAX, Boeing’s best-selling plane, has been grounded since March 2019 after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. Reuters reported earlier a key certification test flight is not expected until April at the earliest.
The FAA said excessive rework of the surface of the inner foil layer of those panels could result in cuts that could expose wiring to potentially unsafe interference ""inducing spurious signals that could cause a loss of engine thrust control."" 
After the inspections, airlines will replace any excessively reworked panels, and modify an assembly to ensure adequate electrical bonding.
The FAA also said it was unclear that Boeing's service bulletin included all airplanes affected and expanded the number of planes covered. The agency estimates that the proposed directive affects 128 U.S. registered airplanes and all costs will be covered by Boeing under warranty. The public will have until late March to comment on the proposal.
Two officials said additional airworthiness directives related to the MAX are expected to be released by the FAA in the coming weeks.
Boeing faces several other outstanding issues.
The FAA is still reviewing Boeing's proposal that the manufacturer need not separate or move wiring bundles on the 737 MAX that the FAA has warned could short-circuit with catastrophic consequences.
Boeing is also still working on a software update to address an indicator light issue associated with the stabilizer trim system that incorrectly illuminated in the flight deck.

Investing.com – Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) investors are shedding shares Tuesday as it looks like problems getting Shake Shack burgers will persist.
Shares fell 14% in afternoon trading as the company’s latest guidance spooked the market and the company also said it hasn’t solved its home delivery problems yet.
Shake Shack reported fourth-quarter earnings of 6 cents per share, excluding items, and sales of $151.44 million.
Analysts were looking for a loss of a penny per share and sales of $153 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
And looking ahead, it sees 2020 revenue of $712 million to $720 million, well below the $737 million analysts were looking for, according the S&P Capital IQ consensus.
The New York City-based fast-casual chain expects ""potentially significant volatility in the delivery channel throughout much of 2020,"" Chief Financial Officer Tara Comonte said during an earnings call on Monday.
It moved last year to an exclusive partnership with third-party platform Grubhub.
The company, known for its ""roadside"" style milkshakes and burgers, is also facing ""potentially significant headwinds"" due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, where it has seven stores, and concerns throughout the rest of Asia.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) is bringing its cashier-less store technology to a larger stage.
The world's biggest online retailer on Tuesday is set to open 'Amazon Go Grocery,' a store in Seattle's Capitol Hill with four times the shopping space as the first cashier-less location it opened to the public in January 2018. The concept targets customers in residential neighborhoods rather than office workers, whom the smaller Amazon Go convenience stores serve.
The new format reflects Amazon's ambitions to capture more of shoppers' weekly spend through groceries, increasing competition with national players Kroger (N:KR), Albertsons and others. The company, once famous for selling books online, was long rumored to be working on a new chain of physical grocery stores that would cater to a more diverse set of tastes than up-market Whole Foods, which it acquired in 2017.
As with Amazon's convenience stores, customers scan an 'Amazon Go' smartphone app on a gated turnstile to enter and start shopping. Hundreds of ceiling cameras and shelf weight censors ascertain what customers add to their carts, and their on-file credit cards are billed once they leave the store - no cashiers or checkout lines necessary.
If a shopper puts an item back on the shelf after looking at it, Amazon removes the product from his or her virtual basket.
That was a major technical challenge to address in the new format, which includes produce priced per item from Whole Foods' suppliers, as well as baked goods, fresh meat and seafood. Amazon trained its technology to manage how shoppers inspect the fruit they buy, said Dilip Kumar, the company's vice president of physical retail and technology.
""There's a lot more interaction that tends to happen"" with produce than a can of Coke, Kumar said.
The new format is not the same as a full-fledged supermarket; for instance, it has fresh cold cuts in packages but not a deli or seafood counter, as at other grocers where associates offer expansive selections of items.
How much Amazon was saving on cashier labor, versus spending on cameras that underpin its technology, was unclear. The company said it hired ""several dozen associates"" for the location, who interact with shoppers and re-stock shelves.
Amazon will not fulfill customer orders out of the Seattle store, it said.

Asked whether the format represented a more profitable grocery model, Kumar said, ""Our goal is to be able to figure out how to be relevant for customers in whichever neighborhood that we're in. If we do a good job, good things happen. If we don't, we course-correct.""

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 01:21PM ET</span>","Thomson Reuters names new CEO, earnings top estimates","By Kenneth Li and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp said on Tuesday it had appointed former Nielsen Holdings Plc president Steve Hasker as its new chief executive officer, succeeding Jim Smith.
The parent of Reuters News also announced higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, reporting a 60% year-on-year rise in operating profit, helped by lower costs and investments following the sale of a controlling stake in the Financial and Risk (F&R) business.
The company's shares reached a new intra-day high and traded up 2% to C$108.82 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and 2% to $81.76 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Hasker, 50, most recently a top executive at Hollywood talent agency CAA and a senior adviser to TPG Capital, will assume his new role on March 15, Thomson Reuters said. Smith, a former journalist who oversaw a period of major change at the company, will stay on for a transition period and become chairman of the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Stephane Bello, Chief Financial Officer, will also step down from his role and will be succeeded by Mike Eastwood, current Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Bello will oversee strategy and business development into 2021, the company said.
Neil Masterson and Brian Peccarelli will continue in their roles as joint chief operating officers at the company.
Thomson Reuters maintained its organic revenue growth target of 4% to 4.5% in 2020 and said its margins will be a little higher than it forecast in October and also above 2019 levels. 
EARNINGS BEAT
Operating profit in the quarter rose 60 percent to $216 million. On an adjusted basis, earnings in the fourth quarter rose to $185 million, or 37 cents per share, from $102 million, or 19 cents a share a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected 33 cents a share, according to IBES from Refinitiv.
The news and information provider posted a 4% rise in organic revenues to $1.58 billion and showed higher sales in each of its three largest divisions: Legal Professionals, Corporates and Tax & Accounting Professionals. The Reuters News division saw organic revenue of $164 million, up 5 percent. 
""If you ask me what I am most proud of is the people in Thomson Reuters, and what we do every day and the difference that we make in the world,” Smith said in an interview. Regarding Hasker, Smith added, ""He's going to focus on ... accelerating the growth rate and new plans, and I think he'll be able to do that.""
The company, controlled by Canada's Thomson family, said the board of directors approved an 8-cent per share hike in the annual dividend, to $1.52 per share. 
In recent years, Thomson Reuters had cut costs and shed some businesses as it recovered from the fallout of the financial crisis in 2008. 
Smith’s defining accomplishment was the sale he engineered of a 55% stake in the company's financial division in 2018 to Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group Inc, valuing the business at $20 billion. Blackstone subsequently struck a deal to sell the unit, now called Refinitiv, to the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc.
Shares of Thomson Reuters have more than doubled since the Refinitiv deal, and have tripled since Smith took over as CEO in 2012. 
European competition authorities are expected to rule on the London Stock Exchange's $27-billion takeover of data and analytics company Refinitiv in coming months.
LONG-TERM GROWTH PLAN
With Thomson Reuters back on strong footing under Smith’s leadership, the board wanted to recruit an executive who would chart a long-term growth strategy for the company, two sources familiar with the matter said.
""The biggest challenge moving forward will be continuing trying to accelerate growth and acquire assets that are congruent with Thomson Reuters’ existing operations,"" said Colin Plunkett, an equity research analyst at Morningstar Research Services LLC. 
On a call with analysts following the financial report, Smith reaffirmed the company's commitment to the news business which now contributes about 10% of total annual revenue.
""There's a lot for us in addition to the tradition and the emotional attachment to the news business that many of us in leadership share,"" Smith said. ""What we've tried to explore ... is more corporate verticals. I see no reason why we can’t have newsfeeds and integrate Reuters News into our professional products as successfully as we have in our financial products."" 
Hasker, who also worked at McKinsey & Co as a media consultant earlier in his career, was selected by Thomson Reuters' board based on his experience in building platforms and running businesses that collect and analyze data, two sources familiar with the matter said.
""We have to see ourselves, before too long, to be true global leaders in the advanced analytics space and in the software and AI space,"" Hasker told employees in a staff conference call on Tuesday morning.
At Nielsen, which is primarily known for its TV ratings measurement business, Hasker helped accelerate the company's transformation into a data and analytics firm tracking media consumption and consumer purchases, former colleagues said.

He negotiated partnerships with  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and others to develop measurement tools at Nielsen to help advertisers identify the age, gender and location of people across the internet, one of the former colleagues said.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>","Macy's holiday quarter beats Street, investors skeptical on strategy","By Nivedita Balu and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) holiday-quarter results beat analyst expectations on Tuesday, but investor skepticism around its cost-cutting strategy at a time of intense online competition sent shares down nearly 5%.
Earlier this month, Macy's said it would close 125 stores, including those based in ""lower tier"" shopping malls, and explore new off-mall formats in order to trim costs and boost growth.
The Cincinnati, Ohio-based retailer, along with other department store chains, has grappled with retaining existing shoppers and attracting new ones as consumers increasingly turn to online giants like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and discount retailers like TJX Cos Inc's (N:TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains.
""The challenge with Macy's is that it is in the struggling department store sector and many of its locations just aren’t good,"" Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research, said.
""But hopefully with more drop-shipping in digital, more stores-in-stores, more private label, better supply chain - that may collectively help to reverse their revenue decline,"" she said.
Shares of the company were down 4.5% at $14.75 in afternoon trading.
To prop up profits and foot traffic, the 161-year-old retailer has also invested heavily in its off-price ""Backstage"" business and experimented with resale and rental offerings.
Some analysts were not optimistic about the cost-cutting efforts. 
Retail research firm GlobalData Retail's managing director Neil Saunders said there would be disruptions and higher expenses, and questions remained over how initiatives such as store closures and new formats would bring in gains.
There could be other headwinds as well, officials said.
Macy's has seen slower sales at tourist-based stores due to the coronavirus outbreak that began in China, and anticipates a small impact on first-quarter sales from a dent in international tourism, executives told investors on a conference call.
The company, which operates roughly 70 stores with a strong Asian customer base, is working with vendor partners to minimize disruption, the executives said.
Fine jewelry, dresses and fragrances performed well during the reported quarter, the retailer said, while demand for fashion watches and small household items was weak.
Macy's reported a small decline in holiday same-store sales in January, surprising investors who were bracing for a sharper drop after a profit warning citing weak international tourism and sluggish mall traffic. 
""We had a solid holiday season,"" though the entire year did not play out as intended, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said on a post-earnings conference call.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.12 per share, beating the average estimate of $1.96.
Net sales fell 1.4% to $8.34 billion, but were a touch above analysts' estimate of $8.32 billion.
Comparable sales at Macy's owned and licensed stores fell 0.5% in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, compared with the 0.93% fall estimated by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income attributable to the company fell to $340 million, or $1.09 per share, from $740 million, or $2.37 per share, a year earlier.

The company reaffirmed its full-year forecast on Tuesday.

Investing.com – The S&P erased early-day gains Tuesday, resuming the selloff from a day earlier as some on Wall Street cautioned against buying the dips amid a warning from health authorities about the spread of the coronavirus. 
The S&P 500 slumped 1.59%, Nasdaq Composite lost 1.21% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.60%.
""I would continue to resist, as hard as it is, to simply buy the dip,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz (DE:ALVG) chief economic advisor, as new outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East stoked fears of a coming pandemic.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 53 cases in the U.S. A spate of infections were identified across the Middle East, including two more cases in Oman and six more in Bahrain, while in Europe Switzerland confirmed its first case.
El-Erian's cautious note comes as the World Health Organization warned countries to prepare for the coronavirus, while the CDC said the American public should ""prepare for the expectation that this (Covid-19) might be bad.""
With fears running high the impact from the virus on global growth could be worse than feared, investors abandoned stocks, with energy, in particular, coming under pressure on demand concerns.

The selloff in banking stocks continued, paced by an ongoing slump in Treasury yields as investors piled into safe havens, offsetting an improved outlook on trading revenue from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).
JPMorgan) said it expects to post a ""mid teens"" increase in trading revenues for the first quarter.
On the earnings front,   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) rose 1% after its fourth-quarter results topped Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Shake Shack's (NYSE:SHAK) fiscal fourth-quarter revenue missed analysts' estimates and guidance also fell short, sending its shares down 13%.
HP (NYSE:HPQ), meanwhile, climbed about 6%, underpinned by fiscal first-quarter earnings that beat consensus estimates and a new plan to return capital to shareholders.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Turkey's state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB) has agreed to enter a formal plea of not guilty to criminal charges that it helped Iran evade U.S. sanctions, backing down from its previous refusal to answer the allegations, a lawyer for the bank said on Tuesday.
The bank has maintained that the federal court in Manhattan where it is charged has no jurisdiction over it. The case, which has caused tension between the United States and Turkey, accuses Halkbank of using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions through sham transactions in gold, food and medicine.
Andrew Hruska, the bank's U.S. lawyer, said at a court hearing that the bank had been reassured it would not give up its right to challenge the court's jurisdiction by responding to the charges. He said he had been given permission by the bank's general manager to enter a plea on its behalf.
""Now that those issues have been resolved, we're ready to proceed,"" he said.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman ordered Hruska to obtain written authorization from Halkbank before entering the plea. Another hearing is scheduled on March 3.
The bank's change of course came after U.S. prosecutors asked the judge to hold it in contempt for failing to respond and impose heavy fines, beginning at $1 million per day and doubling each week.
The charges against Halkbank, announced last October, followed related charges brought by U.S. prosecutors against nine individuals since 2016.
They included former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was convicted in January 2018 after another defendant, wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, pleaded guilty and testified against him.
Atilla returned to Turkey last year after leaving prison, and became general manager of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.

Treasuries gained.
After opening positive, the benchmark index turned lower in the wake its largest loss in two years on Monday. Energy, material and financial shares led the declines. Ten-year Treasury yields resumed a push to record-low levels. European stocks extended losses, while bonds from the region were mixed. Crude oil pushed lower again after Monday’s slide of nearly 4%.
“It’s the realization that the market was not going to bounce like it usually does after a severe one-day decline,” said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “Once that become obvious, the short-term traders started selling and the long-term investors pulled in their horns.”
Declines in banks and food producers dragged the Stoxx Europe 600 index lower. Japanese shares tumbled more than 3% as traders returned after a holiday, though the decline was less than the two-session slide on Wall Street while they were away. Stocks fell in China and Australia and pushed higher in South Korea and Hong Kong. The yen strengthened against the dollar for a third day.
Erratic market moves suggest investors remain on edge over the economic impact of the virus. The World Health Organization has held off from declaring a global pandemic even as cases surged in South Korea, Italy and Japan. Some traders may be taking encouragement from news about the development of treatments, even if experts warn it would take time to build stocks of medicines. Fujifilm Holdings Corp. and Moderna Inc. are among companies experimenting with treatments or vaccines.
“The markets are pricing in the what ifs of the coronavirus, not necessarily exactly what is,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co.
Analysts at Oxford Economics Ltd. said the epidemic could wipe more than $1 trillion from global domestic product, while the International Monetary Fund lowered its growth forecasts for the world economy.
Elsewhere, iron ore futures fell as steel inventories surged to a record in China and investors continued to weigh the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Gold retreated from the highest level since 2013.

Treasuries gained.
The S&P 500 opened higher before turning mixed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average struggled to rebounded from only its third 1,000 point decline on record.   Home Depot   Inc (NYSE:HD). shares climbed after an earnings beat. Ten-year Treasury yields lingered near record-low levels, while European bonds were mixed. Crude oil pushed lower again after Monday’s slide of nearly 4%.
“The markets are pricing in the what ifs of the coronavirus, not necessarily exactly what is,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co.
Declines in banks and food producers dragged the Stoxx Europe 600 index lower. Japanese shares tumbled more than 3% as traders returned after a holiday, though the decline was less than the two-session slide on Wall Street while they were away. Stocks fell in China and Australia and pushed higher in South Korea and Hong Kong. The yen strengthened against the dollar for a third day.
Erratic market moves suggest investors remain on edge over the economic impact of the virus. The World Health Organization has held off from declaring a global pandemic even as cases surged in South Korea, Italy and Japan. Some traders may be taking encouragement from news about the development of treatments, even if experts warn it would take time to build stocks of medicines. Fujifilm Holdings Corp. and Moderna Inc. are among companies experimenting with treatments or vaccines.
Meanwhile, Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). and United Airlines Holdings Inc. emerged as the latest companies to warn that profits are getting hurt as the disease spreads beyond its center in China’s Hubei province. Analysts at Oxford Economics Ltd. said the epidemic could wipe more than $1 trillion from global domestic product, while the International Monetary Fund lowered its growth forecasts for the world economy.
“The market is flying blind with this virus and how things play out from here,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment office at Bleakley Financial Group. “The only two certainties is that the current economic impact is profound globally and that the virus will eventually go away and things will bounce back. What happens in between is impossible to say.”

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 10:21AM ET</span>","Eight men in frame to run Norway wealth fund, including deputy CEO","By Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Eight candidates have applied to head Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the country's central bank said on Tuesday, as its board prepares to decide who should steer the global portfolio of assets worth $1.1 trillion through a time of transition.
The bank's all-male list of candidates identified seven applicants, including the fund's deputy chief executive, 49-year-old Trond Grande.
The deadline for applications was Friday, and one name was kept confidential, as permitted in exceptional circumstances such as when publicity could harm a current employer.
The successor to Yngve Slyngstad, who is stepping down as CEO after a dozen years, will take over the fund as its regulators grapple with strategic changes, such as how to respond to climate risk and a proposed $100 billion increase in investments in the United States.
The world's largest sovereign wealth fund, it manages revenues from Norway's oil and gas industry for future generations, holds stakes in more than 9,000 companies, owning 1.4% of all listed stocks globally. It also invests in bonds and real estate.
From modest beginnings in 1996, it is now worth three times more than Norway's annual gross domestic product, making its investment returns a vital source of government funding.
It has at times met political resistance, including over moves to diversify away from oil. Parliament severely diluted its 2017 proposal to divest all oil and gas stocks.
Grande, the deputy CEO, spent 11 years at Norwegian asset manager  Storebrand  (OL:STB) before joining the fund in 2007, and has since held a variety of posts, including as head of real estate holdings and head of risk management.
The fund did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Grande, who stood out as the best-known of the candidates that were named. Slyngstad's successor is expected to take charge within the next few months.
The fund's largest fixed-income holdings are in U.S. government bonds, while its top equities holdings are tech giants  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL), followed by Switzerland's Nestle SA (S:NESN), Google parent firm Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Amazon Inc (O:AMZN)."

(Reuters) - European shares edged lower on Tuesday after recording their worst losses since June 2016 in the previous session, with trading still dominated by concern that the coronavirus outbreak is spreading fast outside China.
After opening up about 0.4%, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) shed those gains more than hour into trading to trade down 0.3%.
Banking shares (SX7P) were among the biggest drags, while automakers (SXAP) dropped 1.2% as investors worried Europe's trade-reliant economy would take a bigger toll from the outbreak than previously thought.
German car parts maker Leoni (D:LEOGn) slumped 8% after reporting lower-than-expected core profits, while UK engineering firm  Meggitt  (L:MGGT) slid 3% after warning it would be hurt by the virus and Boeing's 737 MAX problems.
Traders knocked about $500 billion off the value of European companies on Monday after Italy unveiled it was struggling with the worst flare-up of coronavirus cases in Europe, reporting 220 cases and seven dead.
""Losing all 2020's gains in one session was a dramatic way to do it but yesterday's resetting of equity valuations was overdue,"" said Ian Williams (NYSE:WMB), economics and strategy analyst at Peel Hunt. ""They now more accurately reflect the downside threat to corporate earnings from the coronavirus.""
Washington and Beijing's ""phase one"" trade deal in December and continuing low interest rates have propelled the STOXX 600 to a record high, but the virus outbreak has forced economists to cut expectations for growth amid disruptions to businesses and travel.
Euro zone data on Tuesday was also underwhelming, with figures showing German economic activity stagnated in the fourth quarter due to shrinking exports.
Germany's GDAXI (DAX) fell 0.3%, while Italian shares (FTMIB) added to Monday's decline with a 0.4% loss. 
Norwegian fish farmer Bakkafrost (OL:BAKKA) fell the most on the index after disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. 
Airline stocks, which took the biggest hit on Monday, also fell further. Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), EasyJet (L:EZJ) and Ryanair (I:RYA) fell between 0.1% and 1%.

Among the few bright spots was  Prudential  Plc (L:PRU), which gained 1.9% after hedge fund Third Point LLC said it had amassed a more than $2 billion stake and called on the British insurer to split into two companies.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>","For Wells Fargo and former executives, $3 billion-deal with U.S. may not be the end","By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Although  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) settled major probes with federal agencies over abusive sales practices last week, the bank and its former executives are not out of the woods yet, legal and regulatory experts said. 
Wells, the fourth-largest U.S. lender, reached a $3 billion deal with the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday related to opening fake customer accounts. Prosecutors agreed not to pursue criminal charges against the bank if Wells cooperates with other investigations and complies with relevant laws for three years.
However, the deal did not address issues with Wells' mortgage and auto-lending businesses, where customers were enrolled in unwanted products that charged fees. Nor does it preclude potential charges against individuals who were in charge at the time of sales abuses. 
""The damage train for Wells Fargo may keep rolling along,"" said Erik Gerding, a law professor at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf on Friday said the bank is ""committing all necessary resources"" to prevent anything similar in the future. 
Ex-CEO John Stumpf and onetime head of community banking Carrie Tolstedt were among eight former Wells Fargo executives sanctioned by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) last month. The regulator banned Stumpf from the banking industry and sought over $58 million in civil penalties. Five of the bankers are contesting the matter. 
U.S. authorities have been investigating individuals, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. It is not clear they will pursue anything beyond monetary penalties or that they will be successful. 
U.S. Attorney Andrew Murray on Friday described the wrongdoing as ""known to, if not encouraged by, the highest levels within Wells Fargo."" The Justice Department also outlined ""extreme"" pressure that executives placed on employees to hit sales targets, which encouraged the unlawful and unethical conduct at the heart of the customer abuses. 
The agreement was the latest in a string of regulatory and legal settlements Wells Fargo has reached since the scandal erupted in 2016. The bank is still operating under consent orders, which include an unprecedented asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve. Its CEO and board of directors will come under fresh scrutiny at congressional hearings next month. 
Investors are hoping management can resolve all the outstanding issues to help Wells Fargo's share price recover, but there may still be hurdles, said analysts. 

The resolution was seen as positive, but the Fed's consent order remains the ""bigger overhang on shares,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note.

Investing.com - Wall Street opened higher on Tuesday, as markets attempted to bounce back a day after the S&P 500 and the Dow posted their sharpest daily declines in two years on worries over the global economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
The Dow rose 154 points, or 0.55% by 9:35 AM ET (14:35 GMT) and the S&P 500 was up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%.
The Dow shed more than 1,000 points by the close on Monday, its third largest points decline ever amid a global stock selloff spurred by fears over the global economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
The S&P 500 ended Monday down 3.3%, also the worst drop in two years. With Monday’s declines, the S&P 500 and the Dow both wiped out their gains for 2020 so far.
Stocks were boosted upbeat retail earnings. Shares of Dow-member   Home Depot   Inc (NYSE:HD) rose 2.5% after the home improvement chain beat quarterly sales and profit estimates.
Another upbeat report in the retail space was from department store operator Macy’s (NYSE:M), which jumped more than 2.6% after a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly same-store sales.

Shares of the company, considered a barometer for the economic health of U.S. households, rose 3.1% to $247 in premarket trading.
The U.S. housing market has gained from the lowest mortgage rates in more than three years after the Federal Reserve lowered borrowing costs thrice in 2019.
Sales of existing homes, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, surged 9.6% on a year-on-year basis in January, the National Association of Realtors said last week. 
""Our fourth quarter results reflect strength in our core business, solid execution around our holiday events and the overall health of the consumer,"" said Home Depot Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear.
Same-store sales at Home Depot rose 5.2% in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, above expectations of a 4.8% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The strong rise in sales also indicates that investments in the marriage of Home Depot's online and brick-and-mortar businesses is staring to pay off, boding well for this fiscal year, Jefferies analysts wrote.
Three months ago, the company said the initiative, called ""One Home Depot"", has not generated the revenue it had expected, prompting the retailer to cut its sales forecast last year.
Net sales fell 2.7% to $25.78 billion, but beat analysts' average expectation of $25.76 billion.
Net earnings rose to $2.48 billion, or $2.28 per share, from $2.34 billion, or $2.09 per share a year earlier. Analysts were expecting earnings of $2.10 per share.

Home Depot also raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to $1.50 per share.

Banga, who took charge of the company just after the 2008-09 financial crisis, has seen the payment processor's revenue triple during his tenure as online shopping gained prominence around the world.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) said Tuesday it has signed a strategic partnership deal with Qatar Airways and is reviving its codeshare agreement.
The largest U.S. airline also said it is considering launching service from the United States to Doha.
Starting in 2015, the largest U.S. carriers argued their Gulf rivals were being unfairly subsidized by their governments, distorting competition and costing U.S. jobs - something the Gulf carriers deny.
""The issues that led to the suspension of our partnership two years ago have been addressed, and we believe resuming our codeshare agreement will allow us to provide service to markets that our customers, team members and shareholders value,"" said American Chairman and Chief Executive Doug Parker in a statement.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said in a statement the strategic partnership ""will bring together two of the world's largest airline networks, increasing choices for millions of passengers and providing seamless connectivity to a significant number of new destinations.""
Pending government approvals, American will place its code on some Qatar Airways' nonstop and connecting flights to and from the United States and Qatar Airways' hub in Doha, allowing American's customers access to additional destinations in the Middle East, East Africa, and Asia that it does not serve.
Qatar Airways will place its code on select flights going beyond American's hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare, Philadelphia, Miami, New York-JFK and Los Angeles, and on American's international flights to and from Europe, the Caribbean, Central America and South America.
Parker and American President Robert Isom said in a note to employees on Tuesday that the airline has ""gotten more strategic about where American's metal is deployed and when to enter joint businesses and alliances with partners to strengthen and complement our network. We will continue to act strategically to expand and deepen our global partnerships.""
American in June 2017 notified Qatar of its decision to terminate its codeshare relationship.
Earlier this month, Brazilian budget airline Gol (SA:GOLL4) signed a codeshare agreement with American Airlines. American also announced it was expanding its relationship with Alaska Airlines (N:ALK), which is also joining the global airline network oneworld that includes Qatar and American.
In April 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration was scrutinizing Qatar Airways' acquisition of a 49% stake in Air Italy, which had been flying to U.S. destinations since 2018 in a move seen by U.S. lawmakers as flouting a deal not to add new flights to the domestic market.
Qatar Airways and another investor agreed earlier this month to put Air Italy into liquidation."

BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - As the coronavirus epidemic keeps hundreds of millions of Chinese stuck at home, they're shopping online to stave off boredom with games for Nintendo's (T:7974) Switch console, yoga mats, books and condoms all showing big jumps in orders.
Many malls and stores remain shut and sales of cars and smartphones are crumbling, but demand for health, entertainment and cosmetics products is buoyant, according to data from e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) - a potential boon for popular brands such as Lululemon (O:LULU) and L'Oreal (PA:OREP).
Nintendo's Ring Fit Adventure game for the Switch console, which combines exercise and role playing, has been a star performer, with sales more than quadrupling in the two weeks to Feb. 20 compared to normal levels, according to Alibaba.
""No medicine really functions against the virus so far. All you can count on is your own health,"" said Guo Yan, a 38-year-old office employee who recently bought the game. ""I want to exercise at home to be healthy and fit.""
Sales of yoga mats and rowing machines have also soared, up 250% during a two-week period in February from a year earlier, it said, while sales of books jumped 60% on Alibaba's Tmall marketplace in the week beginning Feb. 10 compared with the previous week.
Perhaps counterintuitively as authorities have now imposed rules that masks be worn outdoors, lipstick sales were up sevenfold for some brands while sales of eyeshadow palettes increased 150%, according to Alibaba. It did not specify the timeframe for the sales jumps or the brands.
Lu Zhenwang, CEO of Shanghai-based Wanqing Consulting, says that while overall e-commerce volumes have fallen during the outbreak, there were some stand out exceptions like yoga mats and cosmetics.
""People now have large amount of time and they are bored at home,"" he said, adding that women were taking the opportunity to practice their makeup skills.
Other Chinese e-commerce sites also had some non-traditional goods among their best-seller rankings.  Pinduoduo  (O:PDD) noted that hair cutting kits and condoms were among its most ten most popular items, while JD.com (O:JD) said sales of baking and roasting equipment had risen 7 times.
In South Korea, which has seen a surge in coronavirus cases, orders for health-related items such as red ginseng, probiotics and vitamins rose 143% during the first 20 days of February compared to the same period last year, according to Lotte Home Shopping.
Sales of small washing machines have also jumped as people avoid laundromats, up more than sixfold during Feb. 1-19 compared to the same period last month, according to South Korean supermarket chain Homeplus Co Ltd.
The bigger picture for consumer spending is, however, bleak as the outbreak keeps large parts of China's population either in quarantine or simply discourages people from venturing outside. Many businesses have yet to get back up to full speed as quarantine and travel restrictions cause shortages of both workers and supplies.
Big ticket items in China have been especially hard hit, with sales of smartphones sliding 36.6% in January and retail sales of passenger cars tumbling 92% in the first half of February. [nL4N2AL15V]"

Ticket sales accounted for 11% of Juventus’s 621.5 million euros ($674 million) of revenue during the 2018/2019 financial year, according to the club’s annual report. The team played 24 home games during the year.
Juventus was the worst performing member of Italy’s FTSE MIB index Monday as the blue-chip benchmark suffered its steepest one-day plunge since the Brexit vote in 2016. The soccer club was back among the laggards Tuesday, falling 3.1%, before paring the decline to 1.7% as of 12:01 p.m. in Milan."

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 05:04AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Japan to further ease rules on foreign ownership of stocks: sources,"By Takahiko Wada
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will add exemptions to new foreign investment restrictions for companies exposed to sensitive national security issues, government sources said, in a move aimed at keeping overseas capital in the country.
The exemptions will benefit foreign hedge funds and wealth asset managers, which own or invest heavily in Japanese shares, and help underpin Tokyo's stock market - a key element of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies.
Parliament in November passed a change in law that tightens reporting requirements for foreign investment in sectors related to national security, reflecting domestic and international concerns China could gain access to key confidential technology.
Under those restrictions, which are expected to take effect in early-May, foreign investors purchasing a stake of 1% or more in Japanese firms in 12 areas crucial to national security will be subject to pre-screening, compared with the 10% threshold that applies to a wider range of listed companies now.
The government has already set several exemptions, such as allowing financial institutions to invest without pre-screening, and other investors when buying stocks that are not among the 12 areas if they meet certain criteria such as not being given access to some sensitive information.
Sources told Reuters that the government now plans to widen these exemptions to include foreign investors in the 12 sectors if they agree to certain conditions.
Those conditions would require foreign investors not to participate in company committees that have key decision-making power and not make written proposals to boards relating to major business decisions, the sources said.
The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to speak publicly. Japan's Ministry of Finance declined to comment.
The broader exemptions follow concerns from some foreign investors that tighter rules may make it difficult for them to invest in Japan.
Those changes would be included in a government decree stipulating details of the revised law, which is expected to be made public in March, the sources said.
Japan's move to impose tighter regulation on foreign investment follows similar steps taken by the United States and some European nations, to allow greater scrutiny of ownership in industries deemed as critical to national security. 
The industries covered by Japan's foreign investment restrictions include sectors like defense, nuclear power, aerospace, utilities, gas, cyber security and telecommunications.

About 500 of Japan's 3,703 listed companies would fall under this criteria. The government plans to publish the list of the firms in April.

Having struggled to crack the Chinese market, Tesco established the Gain Land venture with CRH in 2014, combining the British group's 131 stores in China with its partner's almost 3,000.
The disposal of its 20% stake allows Tesco to further simplify and focus the business on core operations, it said on Tuesday, adding that the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
The deal is scheduled to complete on Feb. 28.
Shares in Tesco were up 0.7% at 0816 GMT, extending its gains over the last year to 12.4%.
""This extra 275 million pounds of 'forgotten value' should be accretive to most street valuations,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.
After costly exits from Japan and the United States and the sale of its South Korean business, Tesco signalled in December a further retreat from its once lofty global ambitions by starting a review of its operations in Thailand and Malaysia - its last remaining wholly owned businesses in Asia.
A sale of its operations in Thailand and Malaysia would mean Tesco's only remaining overseas operations, apart from Ireland, would be its central European division, comprising stores in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.
The Asian exit could be one of the last acts of Tesco CEO Dave Lewis, who will be succeeded by Ken Murphy in October.
Bernstein's Monteyne expects Tesco to start a 1 billion pound share buyback programme in its 2020-21 financial year.
""With this transaction and the possible sale of Thailand and Malaysia, Tesco's biggest short-term concern could be how to efficiently return cash to shareholders,"" he said.

SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - Southeast Asia's Grab said Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) (T:8306) and IT services firm TIS Inc (T:3626) have agreed to invest a combined $856 million in the ride-hailing firm, as it seeks to expand aggressively into financial services.
MUFG, Japan's biggest bank by assets, has agreed to invest $706 million, the companies said in statements on Tuesday.
""MUFG's investment into Grab is a vote of confidence in our super app strategy and our ability to build a long-term, sustainable business,"" Ming Maa, Grab's president, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Grab, backed by SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), said it will use the funding to offer lending, insurance and wealth management products and services for Southeast Asian consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises.
MUFG's deputy president and incoming CEO Hironori Kamezawa said the bank will combine Grab's advanced technologies and data management expertise with its financial experience. ""We believe that this alliance will also generate additional momentum for our ongoing digital transformation of MUFG,"" he said.
Separately, Grab also said that TIS Inc, part of TIS INTEC Group, is investing $150 million in the company.
Given a low interest rate environment at home, Japan's MUFG has focused on boosting its Southeast Asian business by acquiring stakes in some of the lenders in the region.
""Japan's progress on the digitization of banking and other fintech lags that of other advanced countries,"" S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings associate director Shoki Nagano said in a report.
""Banks must make sufficient investments in new technology, establish flexible and adaptive management suitable for fast-changing environments.""
Grab and Indonesia-based rival Go-Jek are evolving from ride-hailing app operators to become one-stop shops for services as varied as payments, lending, food delivery, logistics and hotel bookings in Southeast Asia.
In Singapore, Grab has teamed up with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel) (SI:STEL) and applied for an online banking license in the country.
On Monday, The Information reported that Grab and Gojek are discussing a merger. Gojek said in an emailed statement to Reuters that there are no plans for any sort of merger and recent media reports regarding discussions of such a nature are not accurate.

Grab declined comment when contacted by Reuters.

SEATTLE/TOKYO (Reuters) - ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) said it will buy 15 more  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787 Dreamliners worth $5 billion at list prices, the first commercial order announcement for the U.S. planemaker this year as it wrestles with the grounding of the smaller 737 MAX.
The deal, which sees Japan's biggest carrier switch from Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (L:RR) engines to ones supplied by  General Electric  (N:GE), is a boost for Boeing after it posted no January orders for the first time in decades.
ANA's order includes 11 787-10 stretch versions and four shorter 787-9s. It also has options for a further five 787-9s. The first delivery will be in the business year beginning April 2022, the airline said in a news release on Tuesday. 
ANA was the launch customer for the 787 programme and is the world's biggest operator of the planes. The new additions would bring its purchase total to 98, of which 71 are in service. It operates all three models of the plane, the 787-8, 787-9 and 787-10. 
The order is a blow to Rolls-Royce, which has supplied all of ANA's 787 engines so far. Problems with the engines which required extra inspections led the Japanese carrier to cancel hundreds of flights in 2018.
""As the 787 becomes a larger share of our fleet size, we have made the decision to diversify some of the components to minimize single source risks,"" an ANA spokeswoman said.

Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR), a Rolls-Royce customer for its initial 787 fleet, last year ordered GE engines for its latest order of eight planes, meaning it will also operate both types in the future.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 02:19AM ET</span>",Deere taps tractor-hailing tech in bid to break ground in Africa,"By Omar Mohammed and Joe Bavier
NANYUKI, Kenya/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - It's ride-hailing, farm style.  Deere & Co . (N:DE) is teaming up with the ""Uber (NYSE:UBER) of tractors"" in Africa and betting on a future where farmers summon machines with the touch of a button.
The world's leading farm equipment maker is outfitting its tractors with startup Hello Tractor's technology, which allows farmers to hail the machines via an app, monitors the vehicles' movements and transmits usage information such as fuel levels.
The aim is to help the U.S. company boost sales of it famous green and yellow John Deere tractors, a tough task in a continent with the world's highest poverty rate and the least mechanized agricultural sector.
Deere is currently testing the technology - a small black box fitted beneath dashboards - on around 400 tractors in Ghana and Kenya. It told Reuters it plans to roll out the devices across Africa in the second half of this year, offering it to all contractors who buy its equipment on the continent.
Jacques Taylor, who heads John Deere's sub-Saharan Africa business, said that the continent badly needs more machinery to develop its farming industry but most farmers don't have the scale to justify a large investment.
""We would like to see that every farmer has access to mechanization,"" he told Reuters. ""The gap that we've identified is, how do we connect small farmers with tractor owners?""
Deere declined to comment on the investment costs for the rollout. The risks are clear; there is no certainty of any measure of success in Africa, which accounts for a tiny fraction of its global sales at present.
Held back by low incomes, tiny landholdings as well as a lack of bank financing, tractor numbers have long been stagnant on the continent, even as much of the developing world has experienced a boom in mechanization.
Deere thinks it can help on the financing front: it told Reuters it could pull data from the Hello Tractor platform that showed in precise detail how farmers were using its equipment. That information, it said, could be used by the farmers - who typically lack credit histories - to help secure bank loans.
This would mean they could buy more tractors.
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS?
In central Kenya, a Deere tractor zig-zagged across a sun-drenched field, raking up dry grass and dropping bales of hay. The black box monitored its every move.
The tractor belongs to Agrimech Africa, a Nairobi-based agricultural services firm that has taken up the offer to have the devices installed on its Deere machinery.
""They do the technology. We do the management,"" said Pascal Kaumbutho, who heads the company.
Agrimech, which is paid by farmers to work their land, hopes the new tech will help optimize its Deere tractors and connect them to new customers, allowing it to expand.
Kaumbutho, whose company manages a dozen tractors, envisions a future in which Agrimech runs a 1,000-strong fleet. ""Right now, we're reaching about 1,500 farmers,"" he said. ""Within the next two or three years, I'd like to reach 20,000.""
Such opportunities exist in markets across Africa, said Hello Tractor founder Jehiel Oliver, but companies like Deere have lacked the tools to develop them.
""Nigeria alone needs 750,000 (more) tractors to be on the global average,"" he said. ""Our technology is a market-maker for tractor manufacturers who want to sell into those markets.""
Deere's annual revenue of about $40 billion is dominated by the Americas and Europe. It doesn't break out numbers for Africa, but combined revenue from Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East was $3.9 billion last year.
FINANCE FRUSTRATION
Outside South Africa, the continent's most developed economy, around 80% of African cropland is still cultivated by hand. Yields are half the global average. With its population set to double by 2050, increasing productivity is a necessity.
One of the biggest barriers to mechanization is finance; though agriculture accounts for around a quarter of Africa's economic output and some 70% of jobs, banks often view farmers as high-risk because of the lack of credit histories.
""It's one thing to go to a bank and say 'You know. Hey, I work very hard.' It's another thing to be able to show it,"" Kaumbutho said.
Deere said the data from the Hello Tractor platform shows how often equipment is in use, how much land it's working, and whether it's tilling, planting or harvesting. That information can be used to create financial statements, it added.
Tshepo Maeko, vice-president and head of agrisales at South African-based lender Absa, sees potential to unlock more lending in this kind of technology which gives banks a fuller picture.
""We will be able to see how big the risk is or how big the opportunity is,"" he said.
Deere is working with Hello Tractor and the banks to format the data to create easily digestible automated reports. No loan decisions have yet been made based on the information.
But Antois van der Westhuizen, John Deere Financial's managing director for sub-Saharan Africa, said that should be possible by the time the scheme is rolled out across Africa.
""The banking systems are trying to adapt,"" he said. ""It's a journey for us to really get them to understand it."""
1150,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 02:13AM ET</span>","UBS, Credit Suisse's emergency plans are effective: financial watchdog","By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - The emergency plans of UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) to deal with a financial crisis are effective, Switzerland's regulator FINMA said on Tuesday.
The assessment follows a review of the recovery and resolution plans for the country's big banks which FINMA ordered to be submitted by the end of 2019.
The review followed the implementation of Switzerland's Too Big to Fail rules, aimed at reducing risks in the country's financial system and avoiding the need for taxpayer-funded rescues.
The laws, brought in after UBS was rescued by the Swiss government in 2008, are intended to ensure functions like domestic deposit taking and lending continues even during a severe crisis.
""FINMA views the Swiss emergency plans of Credit Suisse and UBS as effective,"" FINMA said. 
The emergency plans of the other three systemically important banks - PostFinance, Raiffeisen [RFSHW.UL] and Zuercher Kantonalbank [ZKB.UL]- do not meet the statutory requirements yet, the regulator added.
""Implementation of the Swiss too-big-to-fail regime is critically important to the stability of the financial centre,"" said Mark Branson, chief executive of FINMA.
""Considerable progress has been made, but there is still more to do.""
FINMA said UBS met the requirements for an effective emergency plan, although certain joint and several liabilities remain excessive. Credit Suisse's emergency plan was effective, the regulator said.
Under the recovery plan, the banks are obliged to set out measures to ensure their stability in a crisis and be able to continue their operations without government intervention.
UBS and Credit Suisse have also made considerable progress in their global resolution plans, which would make it easier to wind them up or restructure them.
The two banks have for example created holding structures and Swiss subsidiaries to make it easier for them to be disentangled, FINMA said.
A simpler structure and its work in bail-in mechanisms - where shareholders supply cash to rescue struggling banks - were key parts of Credit Suisse's approach to the too big to fail issue, the bank said.

""After the establishment of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG in 2015, which consolidates the systemically important functions and other critical operations in a separate legal entity in Switzerland, the development of a credible Swiss Emergency Plan and the successful passing of the FINMA review are major landmarks for Credit Suisse,"" Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said in a statement.

Japan Cruise Ship Death Reported (11:14 a.m. HK)
A fourth passenger from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has died, NHK reported.
The patient was in his 80s and had the coronavirus, according to NHK. Three others from the ship have also died, though pneumonia was cited as the cause of one of the deaths.
The cruise ship that was quarantined for 14 days off of Yokohama has been the source of about 700 infections.
Trump Administration Seeks $2.5 Billion to Battle Virus (9:41 H.K.)
The Trump administration said it has asked Congress for $2.5 billion in supplemental funding to battle the spread of the coronavirus. More than $1 billion of the money would be go toward creating, manufacturing and distributing a vaccine, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The money would also be used to “support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,” said Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget.
House Appropriations Committee Chair Nita Lowey said the requested sum “is woefully insufficient.”
Singapore’s Temasek Freezes Pay Amid Virus (9:35 a.m. H.K.)
Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore’s state-owned investment firm, said it will implement a company-wide wage freeze and ask senior management to take bonus cuts and voluntary pay reductions starting in April amid the coronavirus outbreak.
About 26% of Temasek’s holdings were in China as of March 2019, including multibillion-dollar stakes in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. With the money saved, Temasek said it will donate to staff volunteer initiatives and support the community as needed through unspecified measures.
Japan to Recommend Fujifilm’s Avigan Drug (8:19 a.m. HK)
Fujifilm Holdings Corp. rose as much as 8.8% on Tuesday after Japan’s health minister said the country plans to recommend its Avigan drug to treat coronavirus.
Avigan, an anti-influenza medication developed by Fujifilm and Toyama Chemical Co., has previously been used to treat Ebola. A test dosage showed effects in mild and asymptomatic patients, Yomiuri reported last week. China’s National Health Commission is also studying the efficacy of Avigan.
CDC Warns Americans on Korean Travel (8:05 a.m. HK)
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans to avoid all non-essential travel to South Korea as the novel coronavirus is spreading widely throughout the community there.
Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions may be at increased risk from the pathogen, and there is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas, the agency said. The level 3 warning, the CDC’s highest, matches the caution it previously placed on China.
The CDC previously issued lower-level alerts for Italy, Iran and Japan, telling travelers to take extra care and consider postponing non-essential travel.
Singapore Air to Cut More Flights (7:59 a.m. HK)
Singapore Airlines will make more temporary adjustments to flights across its network due to weak demand because of the coronavirus outbreak, the company says on its website. The adjustments will result in a 7.1% reduction in scheduled capacity from February to the end of May.
South Korea’s Consumer Confidence Plummets (7:02 a.m. HK)
South Korea’s consumer confidence plunged the most in five years as coronavirus spreads quickly in the country, blunting the momentum toward economic recovery.
The index slid 7.3 points in February to 96.9. The fall is the largest since June 2015, when another type of coronavirus -- Middle East Respiratory Syndrome -- hit the Korean economy.
The number of coronavirus cases in South Korea has soared over the past week, rising from just dozens to almost 900, making it the most-infected country outside China. President Moon Jae-in has raised the infectious-disease alert to the highest level for the first time since 2009.
United Abandons Outlook, Mastercard Cuts Forecast (6:58 a.m. HK)
United Airlines Holdings Inc. withdrew its 2020 profit forecast, citing the financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The uncertainty surrounding the virus means United can’t guarantee its earlier goal of earning $11 to $13 a share this year, according to a company statement Monday.
If the outbreak runs its course by mid-May and travel patterns return to normal in the coming months, the earnings target is still within reach, United said.The airline’s caution underscores the worsening financial drag as the spread of the new coronavirus stymies global travel.
Separately, Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). lowered its forecast for revenue growth in the first quarter as the coronavirus curbs international travel.
U.S. Cases Now at 53, CDC Says (2:30 p.m. NY)
There are now 53 people in the U.S. with the novel coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday
The American cases include 12 people who tested positive for the condition known as Covid-19 after traveling to areas where the virus is spreading widely. Additionally, two spouses of people in that group contracted it from direct human-to-human transmission.
Three others were diagnosed after being repatriated from Wuhan, China, the outbreak’s epicenter, on State Department flights, while 36 had previously been aboard the contaminated Diamond Princess cruise ship.
Games in Japan, South Korea Postponed (11:35 a.m. NY)
The Professional Women’s Hockey Players Association postponed a three-game series in Japan as a result of the virus. A collection of North American players was scheduled to spend a week in Japan and play three exhibitions against the Japanese national team in Tokyo. The teams are hoping to reschedule for later this year or early next year.
Elsewhere, the Overwatch League, a competitive video-gaming circuit operated by Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI). canceled three weeks of matches in South Korea, including home games for its Seoul Dynasty franchise. The league said the events will be rescheduled, and possibly relocated, for a different date.
Virus Not Yet a Pandemic, WHO Chief Says (10:25 a.m. NY)
The increase in the number of cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea is “deeply concerning,” the head of the World Health Organization said at a press briefing in Geneva.
Countries need to do everything they can to prepare for a potential pandemic, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The disease hasn’t reached that stage, which is defined by an uncontrollable geographical spread.
Outbreak Could Reach Germany, Health Minister Says (9:35 a.m. NY)
The coronavirus outbreak in northern Italy shows that the virus “can also spread in Germany,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn said in Berlin.
While the virus may become a global pandemic, Germany is very well-prepared because its health system is one of the best in the world, Spahn said.
White House’s Philipson Says Virus ‘Real Threat’ (9:35 a.m. NY)
The Trump administration’s top economist called the coronavirus a “real threat” this year, but said it’s too early to tell how seriously it will affect the U.S. economy.
Tomas Philipson, the acting director of the Council of Economic Advisers, said that at the moment seasonal flu has a greater impact in the U.S. He said the White House will continue to monitor the outbreak.
WHO Says Gilead’s Remdesivir May Be Only Drug for Virus (8 a.m. NY)
Gilead’s experimental drug may be the best bet to find a treatment for the new coronavirus, Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general at the World Health Organization, said at a briefing in Beijing.
Gilead’s compound, remdesivir, has been rushed into a clinical trial in China. WHO officials have said results could be available within weeks.
WHO Says China Lockdown Blunted New Epidemic (7:36 a.m. NY)
China’s unprecedented lockdown and restrictions may have blunted the coronavirus’s spread and averted hundreds of thousands of cases, according to a team of medical experts that visited the outbreak’s epicenter last week. Fewer patients are crowding hospitals in Wuhan and are consulting doctors for fevers, Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general at the World Health Organization, said in Beijing.
But the outbreak could gain ground again as schools reopen and work resumes, Aylward warned. More broadly, he called for China’s experience in turning around the outbreak to help battle the virus elsewhere.

1153,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>",Hong Kong Stocks Trade Near Lowest Versus World Since 2004,"(Bloomberg) --
Hong Kong stock investors are the worst off in 16 years relative to the rest of the world as concerns mount over the impact of the coronavirus on an economy already reeling from last year’s protests.
The Hang Seng Index is near its lowest level relative to the MSCI All Country World Index since 2004, even after Monday’s brutal sell-off in the U.S. The Hong Kong gauge has also decoupled from mainland equities, falling to a three-year low relative to the CSI 300 Index.
Hong Kong already faced a gloomy outlook before the coronavirus emerged, as months of political unrest pushed the city’s economy into recession. Tourism has disappeared and retail is suffering, while concern over the impact of the virus on Chinese earnings is also weighing on mainland companies traded in the city.
“Hong Kong has a rather unbalanced economy, which relies heavily on sectors like retail and tourism that will be hit hard by the virus due to less mainland visitors,” said Ronald Wan, chief executive of Partners Capital International Ltd. “It’s a market with high risk at the moment.”
The Hang Seng Index rose 0.1% as of 9:42 a.m. Tuesday while the CSI 300 index dropped 0.7%.
City officials aren’t offering much optimism to investors. Paul Chan, the city’s financial secretary, wrote last week that Hong Kong is facing “tsunami-like” shocks and may incur a record budget deficit in the next fiscal year, with coronavirus impacts being felt beyond retail, restaurants and tourism.
Hong Kong, restrained by a currency peg to the U.S. dollar, has no independent monetary policy. The city’s legislative council on Friday passed a HK$30 billion ($3.85 billion) spending plan for virus-fighting efforts and to assist businesses. Further steps are to be introduced Wednesday in the government’s budget proposal.
In contrast, Chinese authorities have generated a long list of support measures to bolster the world’s second largest economy -- cutting taxes and lowering interest rates among other moves. Chinese President Xi Jinping said authorities will step up policy adjustments to achieve this year’s economic and social goals, state-run CCTV reported Sunday. The stimulus has kept investors there in a buying mood following Feb. 3’s record stock rout.
Everything China Is Doing to Support Its Markets During Outbreak
“While the Chinese government can utilize both monetary and fiscal policy tools to stimulate its economy, there’s nothing much Hong Kong can do on rates and money supply due to its U.S. dollar peg,” said Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Capital Ltd. “There’s no such option as a government rescue, so it’s normal to see lower stock valuations.”
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts said in a research note Monday that Hong Kong shares are liable to continue lagging mainland markets in March. There’s potential for Beijing to announce fresh stimulus next month, they wrote, adding that disappointing earnings news might hurt Chinese-listed equities less than those in Hong Kong. There, institutional investors have a bigger influence and are more worried about fundamentals than retail investors, who dominate Chinese trading.
This year’s earnings forecasts for Hong Kong stocks have dropped by the third most among MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan companies since mid-January, said  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
“Many sectors, including retail, property and tourism, hadn’t recovered yet from the the protests last year and the market was still waiting for their annual reports to gauge the earnings impact,” said Alexious Lee, head of China strategy research at Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. “Now that we also have the epidemic, nobody knows whether and how worse the Hong Kong fundamentals will be for 2020.”

Investing.com -   Fujifilm Holdings Corp.   (T:4901) surged 5% on Tuesday morning in Asia after Japan said it is considering using an anti-influenza medication developed by a Fujifilm group company to treat coronavirus patients.
Katsunobu Kato, Japan’s health minister, said on Saturday that the country is planning to recommend using Avigan to treat the new coronavirus. 
Avigan is an anti-influenza drug developed by a Fujifilm group company that has previously been used to treat Ebola, Fujifilm said on its website. Citing Kato, Bloomberg said test dosages have shown effects in mild and asymptomatic coronavirus cases.
The company’s shares in Japan jumped 4.9% to 5,680 yen by 11:25 PM ET (03:25 GMT). They jumped as much as 8.8% earlier in the day. That compared to the Nikkei 225, which slumped more than 3% today, on escalating concern over the global coronavirus outbreak. "

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian share markets found some stability on Tuesday after a wave of early selling petered out and Wall Street futures managed a solid bounce, allowing investors to take a breather from coronavirus fears.
Some dealers cited a Wall Street Journal report on a possible vaccine as helping sentiment, though human tests of the drug are not due until the end of April and results not until July or August.
Whatever the cause, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) bounced 0.7% to pare some of the steep 3.35% loss the cash index (SPX) suffered overnight. EUROSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) also added 0.6%, and FTSE futures (FFIc1) nudged up 0.3%.
South Korea's hard-hit market (KS11) eked out a 0.6% rise and helped MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fight back to flat.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) was still down 3.4%, catching up to the global sell-off having been shut on Monday, while Shanghai blue chips (CSI300) eased 1.6%.
European and U.S. stocks had suffered their biggest loses since mid-2016 amid fears the coronavirus was morphing into a pandemic that could cripple global supply chains and wreak far greater economic damage than first thought.
The risks were such that bond markets were wagering central banks would have to ride to the rescue with new stimulus.
Futures for the Federal Reserve funds rate have surged in the last few days to price in a 50-50 chance of a quarter-point rate cut as early as April. In all, they imply more than 50 basis points of reductions by year end.
Central banks across Asia have already been easing policy, while governments have promised large injections of fiscal stimulus, something western countries might also have to consider.
The Dow (DJI) had ended Monday down 3.55%, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 3.35% and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 3.71%. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), jumped to its highest close since early 2019.
Underlining the economic impact of the virus was a 3.5% drop in Apple Inc (O:AAPL) as data showed sales of smartphones in China tumbled by more than a third in January.
BONDS BET ON RATE CUTS
The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, feeding worries it could turn into a pandemic.
""If travel restrictions and supply chain disruptions spread, the impact on global growth could be more widespread and longer lasting,"" said Jonas Glotermann at Capital Economics.
""While we still think that it would take a significant deterioration in the outlook for the U.S. economy for policymakers to cut rates, they may feel compelled to do so if the virus spreads and leads to continued falls in the stock market and inversion of the Treasury yield curve.""
The rush to bonds left yields on 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) at 1.39%, down almost 20 basis points in just three sessions and paying less than overnight rates. Yields were now rapidly approaching the all-time low of 1.321% hit in July 2016.
The sharp drop, combined with the simple fact the Fed had far more room to cut rates than its peers, kept the U.S. dollar restrained after a run of strong gains.
The euro edged up a little from recent three-year lows to reach $1.0862 (EUR=), while the dollar was back at 110.83 yen and away from a 10-month top of 112.21. [USD/]

The proposed deal includes a Chapter 11 filing covering the generics unit and a resolution of claims from state and local governments, the newspaper said https://on.wsj.com/2SWoZXW, citing people familiar with the matter.
The settlement would offer $1.6 billion to state and local governments over eight years and warrants to buy an equity stake in the company, according to the report. 
Mallinckrodt did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Shares of the company closed down about 19% at $4.17 after falling as much as 43% following the WSJ report.
A number of U.S. states and local governments have filed lawsuits against opioid drugmakers and wholesale distributors holding them accountable for a national drug addiction epidemic.
The company had said last year it was focusing on separating its generics unit, which sells opioid drugs, from its specialty business.
OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP in September 2019 filed for bankruptcy to halt about 2,000 lawsuits and allow Purdue to negotiate legal claims with plaintiffs under the supervision of a U.S. bankruptcy judge.

Mallinckrodt is among several opioid manufacturers and distributors set to go to trial next month over allegations brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James related to the marketing and distributing of opioids.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's bid to avoid paying about $440 million in damages for using patent licensing firm VirnetX Inc's internet security technology without permission in features such as FaceTime video calling.
The justices rejected Apple's appeal in the long-running case in which a federal jury in 2016 found that Apple had infringed VirnetX's patents and awarded $302 million. A judge later increased that amount to $439.7 million including interest and other costs.
The case dates back to 2010 when Nevada-based VirnetX filed suit in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas accusing Cupertino, California-based Apple of infringing four patents for secure networks, known as virtual private networks, and secure communications links. VirnetX said Apple infringed with its FaceTime and VPN on Demand features in products such as the iPhone and iPad.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which specializes in patent disputes, upheld the judgment against Apple last year. 
During the litigation, Apple and other companies requested that a tribunal of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review the validity of the VirnetX patents. The tribunal canceled key parts of the patents at issue in the case. 
But in separate decisions also issued last year, the Federal Circuit set aside certain of the tribunal's rulings, bringing VirnetX closer to collecting damages from Apple. Apple appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the damages should be recalculated because the specific patents VirnetX accused it of infringing with FaceTime were nearly wiped out. 
Apple in a court filing called the Federal Circuit's refusal to entertain its demands ""legally wrong and grossly unfair."" The company also said the lower courts impermissibly allowed VirnetX to request damages far beyond the value of the patented invention. 

VirnetX told the justices: ""The entire damages award ... remains supported by claims that a jury - and the Federal Circuit - found valid years ago and that have not been canceled since.""

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>",Battle against coronavirus turns to Italy; Wall Street falls on pandemic fears,"By Gabriel Crossley and Hyonhee Shin
BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, sending markets into a tailspin over fears of a global pandemic even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities.
While health experts have expected limited outbreaks beyond China, the rapid acceleration of cases in Italy going from three on Friday to 220 on Monday is concerning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.
Just as China put cities on lockdown, Italian authorities sealed off the worst-affected towns, closed schools and halted the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases.
Shops are shut, bars are closed and people speak to each other from a safe distance in northern Italy.
Markets are nervous that Europe could experience disruptions similar to China, where air traffic has been disrupted and global supply chains rattled for everything from medicine to cars to smartphones.
But China's actions, especially in Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, said the head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Aylward, urging the rest of the world to learn the lesson of acting fast.
""They're at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of hospitals each day is much more than the sick going in,"" he said.
The surge of cases outside mainland China triggered sharp falls in global markets as investors fled to safe havens. European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%.
The Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day percentage drops in over two years and Nasdaq had one of its worst days since December 2018. All three indexes closed down more than 3% after notching record highs last week on optimism the coronavirus would not seriously hurt global economies.
Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), jumped to a one-year high.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the word ""pandemic"" did yet not fit the facts.
""We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,"" he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.
The epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, the WHO said.
Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO's emergencies program, told reporters it was still possible to contain the virus and that it might appear each year like the flu.
""The virus may settle down into an endemic pattern of transmission, into a seasonal pattern of transmission, or it could accelerate into a full-blown global pandemic,"" he said in Geneva on Monday. ""And at this point, it is not possible to say which of those realities is going to happen.""
In the United States, the White House is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading virus, a White House spokesman and an administration source said on Monday. Politico and the Washington Post had reported the Trump administration may request $1 billion.
MEASURE OF RELIEF
Liang Wannian of China's National Health Commission said while the rapid rise had been halted, the situation was still grim. He said over 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan, probably due to the lack of protective gear and fatigue.
Excluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on Jan. 20.
Overall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, down from 648 a day earlier. That took the total number of cases to 77,150, while the death toll rose by 150 to 2,592.
There was a measure of relief for the world's second-largest economy as more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai, reported zero new infections.
Outside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to some 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.
South Korea reported 231 new cases, taking its total to 833. Many are in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, which became more isolated with Asiana Airlines (KS:020560) and Korean Air (KS:003490) suspending flights there until next month.
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran, where the toll was 12 dead and 61 infected. Most of the Iran infections were in the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Qom.
A WHO team is due in Iran on Tuesday.
Japan had 773 cases as of late Sunday, mostly on the cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo.
In South Korea, drone footage https://share.insider.thomsonreuters.com/link?entryId=1_jqhog27w showed what appeared to be hundreds of people queuing up outside a Daegu supermarket to buy face masks.

(Reuters) - U.S. government officials are still considering ways to further curb sales to China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], despite President Donald Trump's tweets and comments last week in support of sales to China, according to people familiar with the matter.
An interagency meeting was held on Thursday to discuss national security and China export issues, including proposals to restrict sales of chips to Huawei, the world's second-largest smartphone maker, and a plan to block the sale of jet engines for China's new passenger airplane.
While blocking  General Electric  Co (N:GE) from supplying jet engines appeared to be off the table after Trump opposed efforts to stop their sale, sources told Reuters on Monday new restrictions aimed at cutting Huawei off further from its suppliers were still under discussion.
Trump told reporters last week he wanted U.S. companies “to be allowed to do business.” 
""I mean, things are put on my desk that have nothing to do with national security, including with chipmakers and various others,” he said.
He said he had been ""very tough"" on Huawei, but did not provide further details, and added that national security concerns should not be used as an excuse to make it difficult for foreign countries to buy U.S. products.
His comments contrasted with the sharp restrictions his administration has placed on U.S. companies trading with Huawei over national security concerns and foreign policy interests. 
The United States alleges the Chinese government could use Huawei equipment to spy, an accusation Huawei has rejected.
DIVISIONS
Policymakers have been sharply divided over Huawei and China ahead of a possible cabinet-level meeting, which had been scheduled for Feb. 28 but has now been pushed to a later date. Some officials have favored a tougher line while others are more focused on trading with the world’s second largest economy.
Officials from various government agencies are trying to come to a consensus ahead of the cabinet meeting, one person familiar with the matter said. 
  In their meeting on Thursday, officials discussed possible changes to what is known as the de minimis rule, which dictates how much U.S. content can be in a foreign-made product before the United States has authority to regulate its sale, the sources said.
    Under current regulations, the United States can require a license or block the export of many high-tech products shipped to China from other countries if U.S.-made components make up more than 25% of the value. 
    But the U.S. Department of Commerce drafted a rule that would lower the threshold only on exports to Huawei to 10% and expand the purview to include non-technical goods like consumer electronics including non-sensitive chips. 
Officials discussed lowering that threshold at Thursday's meeting, a second source said.
    The government agencies also have been considering changing the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which subjects foreign-made goods based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. oversight. 
    One proposed change would force foreign companies that use U.S. chipmaking equipment to seek licenses before supplying Huawei. 
    Huawei was placed on a U.S. trade blacklist last May that allows the United States to restrict the export of American-made goods to companies believed to be involved in activities contrary to the U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. 
But many foreign supply chains remained beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, frustrating China hawks and spurring the proposals to expand controls.

    Reuters exclusively reported in November that the United States was considering altering the two rules to expand its power to restrict the foreign shipment of products with U.S. technology to Huawei.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese private equity fund CMC Capital Group said it raised over $950 million in its biggest private equity fund to date, bolstering its ability to cut deals in the world’s second-largest economy.
CMC Capital Partners III, the firm's third dollar-denominated fund, surpassed its original target size after securing commitments from global investors, the firm said in a statement on Tuesday. It initially targeted about $800 million, said a media representative of the fund.
Its investors, known as limited partners (LPs), included pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, endowments and family offices across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific, it added, without naming any of them.
Like the previous dollar funds, the latest fund will continue to invest in innovative growth companies with a China angle across sectors, including media and entertainment, technology and consumer, it added.
The move comes as a batch of new companies are looking into the changing habits and tastes of China's younger internet-loving generation, who are more willing to spend money.
Chen Yulu, deputy governor of China's central bank, said in a recent article in the Financial Times that he expected the consumption and investment activities to experience ""a compensatory recovery"" as the current coronavirus epidemic is gradually brought under control.
The virus outbreak, which has claimed 2,592 lives as of Sunday, has upended global supply chains and caused widespread disruption to businesses and factory activity in China.
CMC Capital follows several China-focused private equity and venture capital managers who raised $31.7 billion in dollar-denominated funds since 2019, according to data provider Preqin.
Other players, such as Centurium Capital and CICC, are targeting to raise $2.5 billion for a second dollar fund and $1 billion for a healthcare fund, along with British drugmaker AstraZeneca, respectively, according to Preqin.
Founded in 2010 by Li Ruigang, a Chinese media mogul, CMC Capital now manages over $2.5 billion across three dollar funds and two yuan-denominated funds, according to its statement. Its last dollar fund - CMC Capital Partners II raised $600 million in 2016.
The firm has invested in more than 50 companies including cinematic technology provider IMAX China (HK:1970), video platforms of Bilibili (O:BILI) and Kuaishou, and Perfect Dairy, a hot-selling cosmetics brand."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Shake Shack Inc  (N:SHAK) expects its delivery sales to be volatile throughout 2020 after its move last year to an exclusive partnership with third-party platform  Grubhub Inc  (N:GRUB), it said on Monday.
The New York City-based fast-casual chain expects ""potentially significant volatility in the delivery channel throughout much of 2020,"" Chief Financial Officer Tara Comonte said during an earnings call on Monday.
Shake Shack shares were down more than 12% in after-market trading on disappointing results, with revenues this year forecast between $712 million and $720 million, well below average analyst estimates. Sales in stores open at least a year missed expectations.
The company, known for its ""roadside"" style milkshakes and burgers, is also facing ""potentially significant headwinds"" due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, where it has seven stores, and concerns throughout the rest of Asia.
Shake Shack's locations in China, Japan, Korea and other Asian markets are licensed, not company owned, but they have all experienced ""acute sales impact over the last five weeks,"" Comonte said, and new openings in the region for the rest of the year will be delayed.
The company went public in 2015 and is investing in aggressive expansion - a strategy that has pressured financial results in the short term.
In the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 25, same store sales dropped 3.6%, with a 1.8% increase in ticket prices offset by a 5.4% decline in traffic.
Losing delivery customers was also a drag.
Shake Shack originally planned to roll out its exclusive partnership quickly after it was announced in August.
Instead, it decided to ""transition on a market-by-market basis"" as it tests different marketing strategies to move its 185 U.S. locations to Grubhub from other delivery platforms, Comonte said on Monday. Nearly half of those locations are now using Grubhub exclusively.
In the deal, Grubhub agreed to give Shake Shack its customer ordering data - a benefit most restaurants do not usually get from third-party delivery marketplaces.
Shake Shack can use the data to market personalized offers to customers as it focuses on building out its digital ordering options and its own website and mobile app.
Since the deal was announced, other delivery platforms have pushed Shake Shack lower in their listings or even removed the restaurant altogether, Comonte said.
Grubhub competes in most markets with DoorDash Inc, Uber Technologies Inc's (N:UBER) Uber Eats and Postmates Inc.
Grubhub did not immediately reply to a request for comment."

LONDON (Reuters) - Digital banking app Revolut has raised $500 million in a fresh funding round, confirming the British-based business as one of the world's most valuable financial technology firms with a valuation of $5.5 billion.
The Series D funding round was led by U.S. investment firm TCV - which has previously backed Netflix (O:NFLX), Spotify (N:SPOT) and Airbnb - and takes the total amount raised by Revolut to $836 million.
Revolut has attracted more than 10 million customers since its launch in 2015 by offering slick money management tools and undercutting traditional banks on pricing for foreign exchange, stock trading and money transfers.
The firm is accelerating its expansion overseas and has expanded partnerships with payments firms Visa (N:V) and Mastercard (N:MA). It will open its virtual doors in America this year.
Revolut, which employs 2,000 people, said it would use the fresh funding to roll out new products including lending and to expand further in Europe.
The firm also said it would invest in improving its customer service and extending its savings service outside Britain.
Founder and CEO Nik Storonsky said the firm was aiming to build ""a global financial platform"".
Storonsky told Reuters last September that the company's workforce could grow to as many as 5,000 people this year.
GROWING PAINS
Leading 'fintechs' such as Revolut have rapidly grown customer numbers and valuations, but they have struggled to convert this into profits, with Revolut losing 33 million pounds in 2018.
There are also some signs of a slowdown in the wider British fintech industry, with the customer growth rate across neo-banks dipping in the second half of last year from 170% to 150%, while the average deposit balance fell by a quarter to £260, according to a report by consultancy Accenture (NYSE:ACN).
British fintechs are targeting international expansion to maintain their growth, with rival app Monzo launching in the United States last year.
Revolut has experienced some growing pains, including media reports about a cutthroat working culture and poor treatment of some customers.
Customers who had been victims of fraud were frustrated by the digital bank's customer service, which was slow to respond and offered only in-App chat rather than a telephone helpline, Reuters previously reported.
Revolut has sought to bolster its top team with experienced financiers in recent months, including hiring Martin Gilbert, the former co-CEO of  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen, as chairman in November."

The company's shares were down nearly 3% in extended trading.
The company now expects revenue growth between 9% and 10% in the current quarter as the virus impacts travel and e-commerce across borders.
The credit card issuer also expects that net revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in 2020 would be at the low end of the low-teens range if the impact of the virus is limited to the first quarter only.
The company had earlier forecast net revenue growth in low teens for 2020 while expecting revenue to grow in low double digits for the first quarter.
The virus has killed 2,442 and infected 76,936 people so far in China, and slammed the brakes on the world's second-largest economy."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board will hold a public hearing on Tuesday to establish the probable cause of a fatal March 2018 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Autopilot crash in California and will issue a series of safety recommendations, two people briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The safety board is expected to issue recommendations to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Tesla and a California transportation agency, the sources said.
The NTSB issued recommendations after other Tesla Autopilot crashes and planned to reiterate some of the guidance. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. The NTSB and NHTSA did not comment ahead of the 1 p.m. meeting.
There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, but cannot completely replace human drivers.
Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using the driver assistance system Autopilot, but the company advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention.
The NTSB, which criticized Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, also found in September the system’s design permitted a ""driver to disengage from the driving task"" in a January 2018 California crash.
Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016.
Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in 2018 in Mountain View, California, in Autopilot mode at about 70 miles per hour (113 kph) when it crashed into a safety barrier known as a ""crash attenuator.""
In September, the NTSB said California should ensure timely repairs of highway traffic safety equipment. California had failed to repair the attenuator after a crash 11 days before the one involving Huang. The attenuator is designed to absorb crash forces before a vehicle hits a concrete median barrier.
Caltrans spokesman Matt Rocco said on Monday the agency ""is implementing several steps to enhance monitoring and tracking of the repair of damage to highway infrastructure."" The efforts include ""enhanced reporting on the timely repair of high priority traffic safety devices.""
The NTSB said earlier that Huang’s hands were not detected on the steering wheel in the final six seconds before the fatal crash. There was no evidence of braking or evasive action. Huang also reported that on prior trips, the car steered away from the highway requiring his intervention, the NTSB said.
The NTSB said Huang had been using an iPhone and logs recovered show a word-building game was active during Huang’s fatal trip.
The NTSB previously urged the NHTSA to verify automakers using systems like Autopilot incorporate safeguards to limit their use ""to those conditions for which they were designed."""
1167,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>","Citi, Credit Suisse among banks curbing Italy trips on coronavirus fears: sources","By Pamela Barbaglia and Valentina Za
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Investment banks including  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) have curbed trips to Italy on fears that the coronavirus outbreak across the north of the country could quickly spread across Europe, four sources told Reuters.
Citi has told staff heading to Italy's financial capital Milan or other northern cities to postpone their trips or seek approval from top management if they are working on sensitive deals, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as banking policies are confidential.
Credit Suisse has also informed bankers looking to travel to and from Northern Italy including airports in Milan and Bologna that they will require extra permissions, two of the sources said.
Nomura has instead taken a more rigorous approach putting all countries affected by coronavirus deaths on a blacklist, including Italy and France, and banning staff from traveling there, they said.
The Japanese bank has also told employees working locally in Milan and Paris that they cannot book business trips to visit clients abroad, one of the sources said.
""They are all grounded,"" this source said referring to Nomura's bankers.
Citi, Credit Suisse and Nomura declined to comment.
The curbs come as coronavirus infections have soared across northern Italy over the past few days, causing seven deaths and more than 200 cases.
It is the first time banks have restricted trips within Europe as most financial institutions have so far only applied travel bans to mainland China, imposing a 14-day quarantine to those who had recently returned. 
Most bankers in London who want to see clients in Italy fear they will have to go through the same quarantine policies when flying back to London, the sources said.
""Managers have hinted at a shorter quarantine of one week rather than the standard fortnight but it is not clear yet,"" said a London-based banker whose employer had warned staff against booking trips to Italy.
Milan-based  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI) have also banned all non-essential trips, both inside and outside Italy, two sources said.
In a statement on Monday UniCredit said it has introduced ""a ban on non-essential domestic and international travel"" as a precautionary measure.
It also told staff living near the worst affected towns in northern Italy to work from home.
Other banks including  Barclays  (L:BARC) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) have told their Milan staff to avoid traveling to their respective offices in the heart of Milan, two other sources said.
Credit Suisse has also encouraged local bankers to work from home and arrange calls with clients rather than seeing them face-to-face, they said.
Barclays and Credit Suisse declined to comment while Mediobanca and Morgan Stanley were not immediately available.
More than 200 people in Italy have come down with the virus since Friday, latest data showed, the vast majority of them in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.
Italian authorities have sealed off the worst-affected towns and banned public gatherings across a wide area, halting the carnival in Venice and football matches in Milan.
International airlines are still flying passengers in and out of Italy but some countries including Tunisia have raised the prospect of putting Italians into quarantine after they land.
The surge of coronavirus cases outside mainland China triggered sharp falls in global markets on Monday.

European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%.

1168,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Feb. 25,"By Kim Khan 
Invesging.com - Retail earnings continue with a glimpse into the health of the home-improvement sector arriving tomorrow.
There will also be further data on the health of the U.S. consumer shortly after Wall Street’s open.
And after oil’s sharp drop today, traders will get some insight from the American Petroleum Institute on how U.S. inventories are faring.
Here are three things (that aren’t the coronavirus) that could move the markets tomorrow,
1. Home Depot Set to Report
Dow component   Home Depot   (NYSE:HD) will report results before the bell tomorrow, a company that hasn’t missed on earnings expectations for more than four years.
Analysts predict that the home-improvement retail chain will report a fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $2.11 per share and sales of nearly $26 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Last week J.P. Morgan lowered its comparable sales estimates for the quarter below the Wall Street average, Briefing.com reported.
Also issuing numbers ahead of trading will be department store chain Macy’s (NYSE:M).
Analysts are looking for fiscal-fourth quarter earnings of $1.96 per share and sales of about $8.3 billion.
Earlier this month, S&P cut its rating on the company’s debt to BB+ from BBB-, leaving outlook stable, saying it sees “considerable execution risks as the company attempts to improve its position in the challenging department store sector.”
2. Consumer Confidence Seen Edging Up
On Tuesday’s economic calendar the consumer will be the big highlight.
The Conference Board will issue its measure of February consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
The consumer confidence index is expected to tick up to 132 from 131.6 in January, according to economists forecasts compiled by Investing.com..
3. API Inventories on Tap
Oil prices had their worst one-day plunge since the coronavirus contagion began, ending almost 4% down today as investors continue to fret about global demand destruction.
The developments of Covid-19 will almost certainly call the tune for commodities tomorrow again, but there will be some fundamentals to also provide some market direction.
The American Petroleum Institute will report its measure of U.S. oil inventories at 4:30 PM ET (21:30 GMT).
Last week API reported a stockpile build of 4.2 million barrels."

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's top companies need to more than double their current level of spending on low-carbon projects to meet the European Commission's flagship goal of 'climate neutrality' by 2050, according to a report released on Tuesday.
The major study of 882 publicly-traded companies across multiple sectors by climate research provider CDP and consultancy Oliver Wyman showed they spent 124 billion euros ($134.1 billion) on capital investment and research and development in 2019.
That amounted to around 12% of total investment. To be on track to meet the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 however, that figure needs to jump to 25%, said CDP Europe's Managing Director Steven Tebbe.
The biggest areas for new investment were electric vehicle technologies, with spend of some 43 billion euros, renewable energy, at 16 billion euros, and energy grid infrastructure, at 15 billion euros, the report said.
""Some European companies are making bold new low-carbon investments to roll out renewables, build greener infrastructure, buy electric vehicles and make manufacturing more energy-efficient,"" Tebbe said.
""But there is a huge opportunity to do more, and we need to see more action across the board.""
While doubling capex spend was ""a big ask"", Tebbe said the costs of inaction were higher still. The companies assessed account for around three-quarters of the EU's total emissions and the same amount of its stock market capitalisation.
""To help fill this investment gap, there's a serious need for policymakers and investors to help companies finance the breakthrough technologies of the future,"" he added.
CDP, which works with companies and investors to help them manage their climate risk, is largely backed by funding from philanthropic and government grants.
European policymakers are aiming to reduce emissions targets to 50%-55% below 1990 levels by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 as part of a 1 trillion euro ($1.1 trillion) European Green Deal. [nL8N29J2QN]
In a bid to achieve its goal, the EU last week opened a public consultation on how companies report the social and environmental impact of their activities, amid concern the current rules on corporate sustainability disclosures are not tough enough.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The S&P 500 suffered its worst day in two years on Monday as a surge in coronavirus cases outside China rattled investors already worried about valuations following recent record highs.
The S&P 500's 3.35% slump was the leading U.S. stock index's deepest one-day loss since February 2018, when Wall Street was in a correction.
The fear in Monday's session came after investors in recent months often downplayed the overall risk related to the new coronavirus. Monday's drop wiped out all of the S&P 500's gains for 2020.
""With stock prices and valuations still near cycle highs, the risk of a worsening virus outbreak has not been priced into the market to a great extent,"" Truist/SunTrust Advisory Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner wrote in a client note.
S&P 500 sector indexes are mostly still close to their record highs, with the exception of energy (SPNY). The S&P information technology index (SPLRCT) tumbled 4.2% on Monday, slammed by losses for chipmakers and Apple (O:AAPL), which rely more than most other U.S. companies on China. The information technology index is down over 7% from its record high on Feb 19, but remains up almost 4% in 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) agreed to pay $90,000 to an aviation safety inspector who faced retaliation for raising concerns about unqualified flight safety inspectors, a U.S. agency said Monday.
The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) said the whistleblower aviation employee disclosed flight inspectors were certifying pilots and conducting safety ""check rides"" even though they lacked necessary formal training and certifications. 
OSC, an office that reviews whistleblower allegations, said the FAA's Office of Audit & Evaluation ""substantiated the whistleblower's allegations, calling into question the operational review of several aircraft, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Gulfstream VII.""
The FAA said it ""takes all whistleblower allegations seriously and does not tolerate retaliation against those who raise safety concerns.""
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) declined to comment. Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), said the G500 and G600 were certified by the FAA in 2018 and 2019 and have flown more than 5,000 hours since then. ""We are confident we surpassed the requirements necessary to successfully certify the pilot training program for the G500 and G600,"" a company spokeswoman said.
In September, OSC said the FAA appeared to have been ""misleading in their portrayal of FAA employee training and competency"" in providing Congress information about some safety inspectors who were involved in assessing training requirements for the Boeing 737 MAX.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed a combined 346 people. The certification process for the MAX has come under scrutiny.
The FAA said in September that all of ""the Aviation Safety Inspectors who participated in the evaluation of the Boeing 737 MAX were fully qualified for those activities."" The agency denied misleading Congress.
The FAA found that after disclosing the problem, ""the whistleblower faced retaliation. The whistleblower decided to take a new position in another city in order to escape what he believed was pervasive harassment,"" the OSC said. ""After he made the disclosures, his managers also allegedly removed his duties and denied training requests, flight certifications, and job training opportunities.""
OSC said that during the investigation, the whistleblower's then-manager retired, so it did not seek disciplinary action.
The head of the Office of Special Counsel, Henry Kerner, said in September the ""FAA's failure to ensure safety inspector competency for these aircraft puts the flying public at risk.""

New York (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday suffered their biggest one-day percentage losses in two years after a surge in coronavirus cases outside China fanned worries about the global economic impact of a potential pandemic.
Investors sold riskier assets and rushed to traditionally safer bets such as gold and U.S. Treasuries after countries including Iran, Italy and South Korea reported a rise in virus cases over the weekend even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities. 
The benchmark S&P 500, which represents over 44% of the market capitalization of all global equities, lost $927 billion of its value on Monday alone and $1.33 trillion since its closing high on Wednesday last week, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt. 
The S&P and the blue-chip Dow turned negative for the year to date and the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points on the day for only the third time in its history. 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 3.71%, the biggest daily percentage drop of the three major averages.
""We're not likely to make any progress higher until we have evidence the spread of the coronavirus is decelerating,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,031.61 points, or 3.56%, to 27,960.8, the S&P 500 lost 111.86 points, or 3.35%, to 3,225.89 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 355.31 points, or 3.71%, to 9,221.28.All of the 11 major S&P sectors closed in the red, led by the energy sector's 4.7% decline and followed by a 4.2% drop in technology stocks. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) slid 4.8% as data showed sales of smartphones in China tumbled by more than a third in January.
China-exposed chipmakers fell, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index dropping 4.8%, while concerns about growing travel curbs dragged the NYSE Arca Airline Index down 6%.
Of the S&P's sectors, the defensive utilities, real estate and consumer staples indexes fell the least on the day. 
Treasury yields fell to their lowest levels since 2016 as investors sought safety in government bonds, while the yield curve inversion between the 3-month and 10-year U.S. Treasuries deepened in what is often viewed as a recession predictor. 
Adding to worries, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) slashed its U.S. growth forecast on Sunday and predicted a more severe impact from the epidemic. [US/]
The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, registered its biggest one-day jump since February 2018 and ended the day at 25.03, its highest closing level since January 2019. 
""There was this underlying concern that was out there, and obviously over the weekend, it just escalated,"" said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia.
After Monday's nosedive, the S&P closed almost 5% below its record closing high, achieved last week, while the Nasdaq ended 6% off its peak close and the Dow ended the day 5.4% below its record close.
(GRAPHIC: Coronavirus timeline - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/0100B5FM3PJ/coronavirus-timeline.png)
The S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average and the Dow slipped below its 100-day moving average, all closely watched technical indicators.
Health insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) dropped almost 8% after Senator Bernie Sanders, who backs the elimination of private health insurance, strengthened his position for the Democratic presidential nomination with a victory in the Nevada caucuses.
Janney Montgomery Scott's Luschini said that while the coronavirus was ""by far and away the primary influence"" for the market's decline on Monday, investors, he said, were ""also beginning to handicap the odds of Sanders being the Democratic nominee.""
In a rare bright spot,  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD), whose antiviral remdesivir has shown promise in monkeys infected by a related coronavirus, rose 4.6%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 6.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 6.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 23 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 154 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges, 10.59 billion shares changed hands, compared with the 7.79 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Investing.com - Shares of   Co-Diagnostics   (NASDAQ:CODX) soared into the close of trading Monday after the company said a test for Covid-19 received European regulatory approval.
The stock closed up nearly 29% at the closer of regular trading, and eased 0.8% postmarket.
The diagnostics company said its Logix Smart Coronavirus Covid-19 Test got regulatory clearance to be an in vitro diagnostic in markets that accept CE marking (European Community approval).
“Co-Diagnostics has received overwhelming interest in our novel coronavirus diagnostic from all over the world since first announcing its development a month ago,” Co-Diagnostics CEO Dwight Egan said in a statement.
“As the disease has spread from China, so have concerns about the global health community’s ability to contain and control it,” Egan said. “The first step in containment is a prompt, accurate diagnosis, and we are pleased to provide this product to those areas that are able to utilize a CE-marked IVD to protect their residents and visitors from a disease that has already affected millions.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak, following the practice of U.S. airlines, said on Monday it would limit refunds and passengers' ability to make changes to the lowest-price train tickets starting on Sunday.
Passengers will no longer be able to make changes or cancel tickets 24 hours after purchase as they can now for the lowest-cost ""Saver fares.""
For ""Value Fares"" - Amtrak may charge a fee for cancellations or changes within 14 days of departure, while flexible fares will allow for full refunds and no-fee changes.
A search for a trip between Washington and New York for early April showed saver fares at $54 one-way, value $98 and flexible tickets $192.
Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods said ""current customer behavior limits the company’s ability to forecast demand and optimize seat usage.""
She added that ""passenger growth is expected to come both in the form of people who currently find Amtrak fares unattractive for various reasons (advanced purchase requirements, absolute price) or who are highly price sensitive and are willing to exchange some flexibility for an even more attractive fare.""
In November, Amtrak said it had set records for ridership, revenue and financial performance for the year ended Sept. 30, 2019, including 32.5 million customer trips, a year-over-year increase of 800,000 passengers.
Amtrak reported a loss of $29.8 million in its last fiscal year compared with a loss of $170.6 million in the prior fiscal year.
Earlier this month, the White House proposed cutting U.S. funding for Amtrak by more than 50% over 2020 levels. Democrats who control the U.S. House of Representatives are unlikely to go along with the proposal, which is similar to cuts that have been rebuffed in prior budgets proposed by President Donald Trump's administration.
In March 2018, Amtrak ended its policy of giving full refunds for most tickets and unveiled a 25% cancellation fee for most lower-cost tickets."
1179,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>",Treasuries May Really Get Going If Mortgage Supercharge Turns Up,"(Bloomberg) -- A rally in Treasuries that’s driven 10-year yields close to record lows could get an extra shot of adrenaline if mortgage-bond investors are forced to adjust their hedging amid the global shift in interest rates.
The abrupt slide in yields, which came as the coronavirus outbreak spurred a flight to haven assets, may deepen if the market witnesses a resurgence of so-called convexity hedging that helped weigh on rates last year. Such hedging stems from mortgage-debt holders having to adjust their exposure to interest-rate risk as lower borrowing costs spur refinancing. And while that dynamic hasn’t been a significant force in the latest bond-market rally, it may be just over the horizon if yields keep tumbling.
Investors’ response to the shrinking duration of mortgage-backed debt has “clearly not been the dominant driver of the recent rally in rates,” but “likely amplified the more fundamental forces pushing the yield curve downward,” strategists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). wrote in a note Monday.
“Adverse data” could still translate into a further 20 basis point decline in nominal yields, or even a 35 basis point slide if it combines with a large negative hit to risk sentiment, the strategists wrote. A further decline in mortgage durations would also be likely in such a scenario.
Read more about the recent decoupling of MBS duration and dollar swap spreads
An uptick in expected home-loan refinance rates has already reduced the duration of mortgage-bond indexes, removing about $1.6 trillion worth of 10-year Treasuries in interest-rate risk for MBS investors, Goldman calculates.
A bigger wave of hedging now stands ready to support a deeper Treasuries rally, and traders aren’t taking any risks.
The market moves Monday were matched with compressed dollar swap spreads, suggesting convexity hedging demands are starting to come into play. Long-end swap spreads dropped during the New York session.
Meanwhile, investors spent millions of dollars on options to hedge the 10-year yield dropping as low as 1.10% by the end of the week. Other trades included a $11.7 million bet on yields falling to 1.25% by late March.
The benchmark 10-year note fell as much as 12 basis points Monday to 1.35%, a level unseen since 2016, as markets were roiled globally and countries from Italy to South Korea grappled with how to contain the coronavirus outbreak. The yield’s record low, of about 1.32%, came in July 2016.
“We’re having the start of a violent and climactic move to lower rates as short positions are covered, which is probably going to get more climactic as we learn about the coronavirus in China and other parts of Asia, ” said Tom di Galoma, managing director of government trading and strategy at Seaport Global.

1180,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 04:49PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Stocks Are Trading at Lowest Versus World Since 2004,"(Bloomberg) --
Hong Kong stock investors are the worst off in 16 years relative to the rest of the world as recession may grip the city through 2020.
The Hang Seng Index remains near its lowest level relative to the MSCI All Country World Index since 2004. Following Monday’s fresh slide, it’s also at a more than three-year low relative to China’s CSI 300 Index. That gap has widened since Jan. 23, the last trading day in China before the Lunar New Year holiday -- the CSI 300 has climbed 3.2% since while the Hang Seng has dropped 3.9%.
Hong Kong already faced a gloomy outlook before the coronavirus emerged, as months of political unrest pushed the city into recession and made it among the world’s weakest major stock markets in 2019. Reliant on tourism, a move to quarantine anyone coming from mainland China has helped batter already-depressed visitor counts and is expected to result in back-to-back annual contractions for Hong Kong’s economy and further increases to unemployment.
“Hong Kong has a rather unbalanced economy, which relies heavily on sectors like retail and tourism that will be hit hard by the virus due to less mainland visitors,” said Ronald Wan, chief executive of Partners Capital International Ltd. “It’s a market with high risk at the moment.”
City officials aren’t offering much optimism to investors. Paul Chan, the city’s financial secretary, wrote last week that Hong Kong is facing “tsunami-like” shocks and may incur a record budget deficit in the next fiscal year, with coronavirus impacts being felt beyond retail, restaurants and tourism.
Hong Kong, restrained by a currency peg to the U.S. dollar, has no independent monetary policy. The city’s legislative council on Friday passed a HK$30 billion ($3.85 billion) spending plan for virus-fighting efforts and to assist businesses. Further steps are to be introduced Wednesday in the government’s budget proposal.
In contrast, Chinese authorities have generated a long list of support measures to bolster the world’s second largest economy -- cutting taxes and lowering interest rates among other moves. Chinese President Xi Jinping said authorities will step up policy adjustments to achieve this year’s economic and social goals, state-run CCTV reported Sunday. The stimulus has kept investors there in a buying mood following Feb. 3’s record stock rout.
Everything China Is Doing to Support Its Markets During Outbreak
“While the Chinese government can utilize both monetary and fiscal policy tools to stimulate its economy, there’s nothing much Hong Kong can do on rates and money supply due to its U.S. dollar peg,” said Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Capital Ltd. “There’s no such option as a government rescue, so it’s normal to see lower stock valuations.”
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts said in a research note Monday that Hong Kong shares are liable to continue lagging mainland markets in March. There’s potential for Beijing to announce fresh stimulus next month, they wrote, adding that disappointing earnings news might hurt Chinese-listed equities less than those in Hong Kong. There, institutional investors have a bigger influence and are more worried about fundamentals than retail investors, who dominate Chinese trading.
This year’s earnings forecasts for Hong Kong stocks have dropped by the third most among MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan companies since mid-January, said  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
“Many sectors, including retail, property and tourism, hadn’t recovered yet from the the protests last year and the market was still waiting for their annual reports to gauge the earnings impact,” said Alexious Lee, head of China strategy research at Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. “Now that we also have the epidemic, nobody knows whether and how worse the Hong Kong fundamentals will be for 2020.”

Short sellers in the 20 most-shorted pot stocks made $237 million as of midday, pushing them into the black for the first time in 2020 with $107 million in total mark-to-market profits, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Total short interest in the top 20 cannabis stocks is sitting at $3.5 billion.
The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, which tracks the sector, fell as much as 5.6% to a record low as the spreading coronavirus prompted investors to flee risky assets. Three Canadian cannabis producers were also downgraded at Cowen & Co.
Investors betting that cannabis stocks would fall lost $102 million in January as shares rebounded from a steep decline in 2019, S3 said. This compared to just over $1 billion in profits last year.
Shorting pot stocks is an extremely expensive proposition, with an average borrow fee of 31% due to a limited public floats at many of the companies.
“If short selling losses continued to mount after January’s poor short performance, we might have seen some short covering in the sector. But with most of the sector’s short positions now profitable we will probably see an upsurge in sector short selling,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing direrctor of predictive analytics at S3, wrote in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As concerns over the spreading coronavirus outbreak hammered U.S. stocks, one corner of the market was confronted with another potentially game-changing prospect: a Bernie Sanders nomination.
The S&P 500 managed healthcare index of health insurance stocks <.SPLRCHMO> tumbled over 7% early Monday afternoon, compared to a 3.5% fall for the overall S&P 500 (SPX). Shares of industry bellwether UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) dropped 7.6% and were the biggest individual drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), while shares of  Centene  Corp (N:CNC) fell more than 10%.
Sanders, a U.S. senator whose progressive agenda includes a national Medicare for All health plan, scored a dominant win in the Nevada caucuses over the weekend, adding momentum in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination to face off against U.S. President Donald Trump in the November general election.
The Vermont senator authored Medicare for All legislation that would essentially abolish private insurance in favor of a single government-run plan that covers every American. The ambitious proposal would cost more than $30 trillion over 10 years, according to independent analyses.
His dominant performance has taken some market participants by surprise. 
""It wasn't clear that it was going to be that big of a win for him,"" said Sarah James, a healthcare analyst at Piper Sandler, adding that the senator ""is still pushing his Medicare for All, anti-health insurer platform.""
James said most investors doubt Sanders' health-reform plan will receive enough support to pass in Congress and would be too disruptive to even be feasible to implement.
""But you have two scenarios,"" James said, ""one, an acknowledgement that the chance isn't absolutely zero; or two, an extension of the uncertainty, neither of which is a great setup.""
Health insurer stocks have proved volatile throughout the Democratic presidential race, sometimes falling as polls showed improvement for Sanders and fellow progressive candidate Elizabeth Warren.

On Monday, the stocks also felt pressure from news that the coronavirus was accelerating its spread outside China, with Italy, South Korea and Iran reporting sharp rises in cases on Monday.
""If it were to become a pandemic in the United States, that would be a significant impact to the operations for managed care,"" said David Heupel, healthcare analyst at Thrivent Investment Management.
""Obviously you would have a massive increase in ER visits ...,"" Heupel said. ""There's a lot of expenditures associated with that, so this would be a pretty significant increase in cost trend. That plays directly to the managed care group.""
Among other health insurer shares,  Humana Inc  (N:HUM) dropped 6.4%, while Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) was off 5.6%.

Shares of hospital operators were also under pressure, with HCA Healthcare (N:HCA) down 5.6% and  Tenet Healthcare  Corp (N:THC) off 4.6%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) executives plan to announce new climate-change initiatives on Tuesday, including restrictions on financing coal mining and Arctic drilling, as well as a $200 billion target to provide financing for sustainable projects. 
JPMorgan said on Monday that it would detail the initiatives at the bank's investor day. The bank has faced years of criticism from environmentalists for its relationships with fossil-fuel companies, scrutiny it has sought to avoid at events like its annual shareholder meeting, which are open to the public. (https://reut.rs/38lCdmj)
The bank's changing approach at its 13th annual investor day, which is invitation-only, comes as other big U.S. banks have announced similar initiatives.
JPMorgan said it will facilitate $200 billion of transactions in 2020 that ""support climate action"" and advance the United Nations' sustainable development goals. 
Those transactions are expected to be a mix of loans, underwriting, advisory services and investments, and will include $50 billion of financing for green initiatives, which was earmarked to count toward a 2017 target. 
The bank said it set the new target will allow it to do business with projects that address more than just climate change, such as initiatives aimed at improving social and economic development, like infrastructure, access to affordable housing and health care. 
The bank said it will also stop providing financing for new oil and gas developments in the Arctic, and will expand restrictions on its financing of coal mining and coal-fired power. 
The bank declined to comment on the amount of previous revenues gained from this type of lending.

Late last year,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) also swore off providing new loans for Arctic drilling or thermal coal mines. (https://reut.rs/34sOVga)

(Reuters) - HP Inc (N:HPQ) said on Monday it would step up efforts to slash costs and buy back stock, as it seeks investor support to defend against a $35 billion takeover offer from U.S. printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp (N:XRX).
The announcement came after Xerox raised its cash-and-stock bid for HP earlier this month by $2 to $24 per share, ahead of a tender offer it plans to launch in early March. It is also asking HP shareholders to replace HP's board directors with Xerox's nominees at the company's annual shareholder meeting later this year.
On Monday, HP reported $14.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, slightly lower from last year, as growth in its personal computer business offset the continuous decline of the printing business. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 65 cents for the fourth quarter, beating analysts' estimate of 54 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
HP said it would increase its share buyback program from $5 billion, announced last October, to $15 billion. It added that it was targeting $16 billion of capital to be returned to shareholders over the next three years, representing about half of its market capitalization.
HP also said it expected about $650 million of cost savings to flow through its projected operating profit growth. It had previously announced a cost reduction program that it expects to result in $1.2 billion of gross, annualized run-rate structural cost savings in fiscal 2022, with additional ongoing productivity improvements of at least $1 billion.
HP raised its previous estimate of adjusted earnings per share to a range of $2.33 to $2.43 for fiscal 2020, and said it would deliver $3.25 to $3.65 in adjusted earnings by 2022.
Calling Xerox's bid ""flawed and irresponsible"", HP executives told Reuters there were many hurdles in a potential tie-up.
""It's a combination of price, capital structure and an assessment of synergy,"" Enrique Lores, who became HP's chief executive officer in November, said in an interview.
HP said Xerox's bid would burden the company with too much debt, and that Xerox overstated the expected synergies to be generated by cost reductions and productivity gains. However, it said it would reach out to Xerox to explore if a combination was worth pursuing.

Investing.com – The Dow and S&P suffered their biggest daily loss in two years on Monday, paced by a selloff in energy and tech stocks on worries about a potential coronavirus pandemic outbreak.
The S&P 500 tumbled 3.35%, Nasdaq Composite lost 3.71% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.56%, or 1,032 points.
The World Health Organization warned that a ""sudden increase in new cases"" outside of China is ""deeply concerning,"" following a rise in infections of Covid-19 in Italy, South Korea and Iran.
Italy reported more than 220 cases of the virus, with five deaths as of Monday morning. South Korea confirmed 231 cases, taking the total in the country to more than 830. Iran, meanwhile, confirmed 61 total cases, with 12 deaths nationwide.
With fears rising that the window of opportunity to contain the virus may have been missed and of a longer-than-expected return to normal operations for supply chains in China, investors abandoned tech and travel stocks.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were down sharply.
Semiconductor companies, for which China represents an important source of growth, led the broader decline in the tech, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) both down 7% and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) down 5%.
The flight-to-safety trade triggered buying in U.S. government bonds, sending prices higher and yields lower, causing a decline in bank stocks.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) fell 2.7%, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) slid 4.7% and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lost 2.7% as a fall in bond yields tends to weigh on net interest margin.
The spread of the virus, however, has prompted investor hopes the Federal Reserve will come to the rescue and deliver a rate cut sooner rather than later.
""The U.S. economy will also likely be affected, but based on the current backdrop, recession risk still appears relatively low. The drag will be partially offset by a sharp drop in interest rates and energy prices,"" Suntrust said in a note to clients. 
But Fed members appear unwilling, for the moment at least, to sway from the central bank's ongoing narrative that monetary policy remains appropriate.
“In my view, our current policy stance is appropriate given the outlook of growth near its trend pace, solid labor market conditions, and inflation rates not far” from the Fed’s 2% goal, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said.
Energy stocks suffered sharp losses, falling 4.7%, on a slump in oil prices as the spread of the virus stoked further worries about Chinese oil demand."

(Reuters) - While Wall Street's broader indexes fell sharply on Monday on concerns about coronavirus, investors turned to some consumer companies as they bet on stock-piling of products such as disinfectants and shelf-stable foods. 
With virus cases rising in Italy and several Middle Eastern countries dealing with their first infections, fears of a global pandemic sent markets into a tailspin, even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities.
Clorox Co, a supplier of bleach and other cleaning products, was one of the top percentage gainers in the S&P 500 and one of two stocks in positive territory in the consumer staples sector, which tends to be seen as a relatively safe bet even in a weak economy.
Other outperformers in the staples sector included tissue maker Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) and food suppliers such as Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), and Campbell Soup Co as investors bet on rising demand in the event consumers have to prepare to stay at home if the virus keeps spreading. 
""These products are going to be more in use than others in the group given the spreading of the virus. It's a knee-jerk reaction,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago though he said it was too early to say whether consumers would end up stockpiling anything.
(GRAPHIC: Campbell Soup Co vs. the VIX - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/0100B5FN3PK/fear-and-soup.png)
After rising as much as 2.2% early in the session, Clorox shares were last up 1.7% and trading volume was 1.6 times their 10-day moving average. Given the global nature of investor concerns, it was also being rewarded for depending mostly on domestic revenue, said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments.
About 85% of Clorox revenue came from within the United States last year, according to Refinitiv. 
""Typically the reward goes to companies that do not have a lot of exposure globally, but also Clorox sells a lot of disinfecting products,"" said Tengler, who owns Clorox personally but says it is too expensive to include in client portfolios. 
While Kimberly-Clark, Campbell Soup and Hormel were still down on the day, their declines of less than 1% compared with the S&P's 3% decline and the staples sector's 2.5% drop.

""Days like today have indiscriminate selling, so you have to put the money somewhere. What's the best of the worst?"" said Kingsview's Nolte.

Investing.com – Tilray led the freefall in marijuana stocks on Monday as one analyst on Wall Street warned the recent legalization of further cannabis products in Canada, dubbed Cannabis 2.0, is unlikely to ease the current headwinds in the industry.
""We are downgrading Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) to market perform, all from outperform, as we grow increasingly cautious on the outlook for cannabis in Canada,"" Cowen said in a note.
Tilray fell about 10%,   Canopy Growth   (NYSE:CGC) lost 6%, Aurora Cannabis fell 7%, but Sundial Growers bucked the trend, rising 4.5%.
The legalization of Cannabis 2.0 products in October last year, stoked investor hopes that an increase in cannabis-infused products available for sale would underpin sales and spark a turnaround in the industry.
Industry experts had estimated that sales of cannabis products such as edibles, beverages and vaping products were expected to account for $900 million of sales next year, according to Brightfield Group, a market research firm.
But those hopes were somewhat overly optimistic given the headwinds in the sector, including supply and cash difficulties that continue to keep a lid on growth, Cowen warned. 
“Headwinds that have plagued the industry (pricing, stores, inventory) do not appear to be fading as anticipated, while 2.0 is likely not the elixir that the market was hoping for. Canopy Growth remains our only outperform rated stock among the Canadian LPs.”
Health Canada, the governing body overseeing and regulating cannabis sales, began accepting applications for the production of cannabis-derived products on Oct. 17. But under regulatory rules, the products were not allowed to hit the shelves for 60 days - until December – in order for inspections and approvals to be carried out."
1191,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 02:57PM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs Says Sliding U.S. Yields May Have Further to Fall,"(Bloomberg) -- A rally in Treasuries that’s driven 10-year yields toward record lows could have more room to run.
The abrupt slide in rates, which came as the coronavirus outbreak spurred a flight to quality, may extend further as mortgage-bond investors adjust their duration risk, strategists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). wrote in a Feb. 24 note. So-called convexity hedging helped fuel the decline in yields last year.
While convexity hedging hasn’t yet been a significant factor in 2020’s rate rally, the recent decoupling of duration and swap spreads for mortgage-backed securities could be short-lived. Investor responses to the shrinking duration of mortgage-backed debt have “likely amplified the more fundamental forces pushing the yield curve downward,” Goldman’s analysts wrote.
“Adverse data could still translate into a further 20bp decline in nominal yields, or even a 35bp decline if the data surprise is combined with a large negative hit to risk sentiment,” the analysts wrote. A further decline in mortgage durations would also be likely in such a scenario.
Read more about the recent decoupling of MBS duration and dollar swap spreads
An uptick in expected home-loan refinance rates has already reduced the duration of mortgage-bond indexes, removing about $1.6 trillion worth of 10-year Treasuries in interest-rate risk for MBS investors, Goldman calculates.
A bigger wave of hedging now stands ready to support a deeper Treasuries rally and traders are not taking any risks.
The sharp moves on Monday were matched with compressed dollar swap spreads, suggesting convexity hedging demands are starting to come into play. Long-end swap spreads dropped to the tightest levels since November 2019 during the New York session.
Meanwhile, investors spent millions of dollars on options to hedge the 10-year yield dropping as low as 1.10% by the end of the week. Other trades included a $11.7 million bet on yields falling to 1.25% by late March."

Havens including Treasuries and gold surged.
In a dramatic day across markets, these were some of the standout moves:
All three main U.S. stock benchmarks slumped more than 3%, with the S&P 500 Index tumbling the most on an intraday basis since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average erased all of its gains for the year.The FANG cohort of megacap tech shares that led the year’s rally plunged more than 4%. AMD Corp. led losses in chipmakers exposed to China, at one point sinking more than 10%. High-flyers Virgin Galactic and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) each fell about 7%. Alpha Pro Tech, maker of protective clothing and masks, surged 15%.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 3.8% on trading volumes well above average for the largest drop since 2016 as investors fled travel and luxury-goods shares. A gauge of credit risk on the region’s high-yield companies jumped.The yield on 10-year Treasuries approached the 2016 record low.South Korea’s benchmark dropped 3.9%, leading declines across Asia, though Japan’s markets were shut for a holiday.Spot gold approached $1,700, while Brent crude oil tumbled about 5%.The risk-off mood hardened as the epidemic spread to more than 30 countries, with South Korea reporting a jump in infections and Italy locking down an area of 50,000 people near Milan. Finance chiefs and central bankers from the largest economies warned this weekend that they saw the virus bringing downside risks to global growth.
“Stock markets around the world are beginning to price in what bond markets have been telling us for weeks -- that global growth is likely to be impacted in a meaningful way due to fears of the coronavirus,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.
Governments and companies are curbing travel and trade in an attempt to contain a novel pathogen that can be transmitted by people without symptoms. Today’s market moves follow on last week’s surge into havens after fresh warnings by companies over the potential impact of the virus on business and global supply chains. Adding to the anxiety Monday was China announcing an easing of the quarantine of Wuhan, only to retract the statement hours later.
“Markets hate uncertainty and the coronavirus represents the most uncertain macro risk markets have faced in years,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. “Investors are also acutely aware that many misjudged the economic severity of the virus early on, making them more open to entertaining worst-case scenarios now.”
Elsewhere, Italian bonds dropped on concern that the spread of the coronavirus may push the economy into a recession. The Australian dollar weakened to an 11-year low and the offshore yuan held most of last week’s decline.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of America (N:BAC) has appointed Jérôme Morisseau as its head of investment banking for France as it seeks to bolster its Paris franchise and win more business from large French clients, a memo seen by Reuters said.
The U.S. bank has also named veteran French banker Stéphane Courbon as chairman of corporate and investment banking for France.
The appointments are part of a top level management reshuffle in Paris and follow the recent departures of senior deal-makers Bernard Mourad and Luigi Rizzo who used to head investment banking in France and EMEA, respectively.
Bank of America established an 11,000 square metre office in Paris ahead of Brexit and will use it as a hub to serve clients across Europe after Britain's transition period expires in December.
The value of French mergers and acquisitions (M&A) rose 2% last year to $193 billion, the third highest in the past decade, according to Refinitiv data.
France has become a key battleground for both big investment banks and their boutique rivals.
The likes of Centerview and Evercore (N:EVR) have been looking to poach senior bankers in Paris who can boast long-standing relationships with the country's major companies.
At Bank of America, Courbon will work closely with the vice-chairman of investment banking for France, Laurent Vieillevigne, to further expand the bank's client franchise, the memo said.
Meanwhile the bank's current head of EMEA corporate banking Fernando Vicario will take on an additional role as head of EU corporate and investment banking and will be based in Paris.
In his expanded role, Vicario will report to Bruce Thompson, president of EU and Switzerland, and Jim O'Neil, head of EMEA corporate and investment banking.
Vicario will keep his existing reporting lines into both O'Neil and the bank's global corporate banking boss Anne Clarke Wolff for all matters related to corporate banking.
Morisseau and Courbon will report to both Vicario and Matt Cannon, who heads Bank of America's EMEA investment banking and recently replaced Luigi Rizzo."

(Reuters) - Hedge fund Third Point LLC amassed a more than $2 billion stake in  Prudential  Plc (L:PRU) and called on the British insurer on Monday to split into two companies.
Third Point's demands, first reported by Reuters earlier on Monday, could lead to a major shake-up at Prudential, only a few months after it spun out its European insurance and asset management businesses into a new company called M&G Plc (L:MNG).
Third Point, which specializes in shareholder activism and is run by Daniel Loeb, wrote to the 332-year old London-based company on Monday to ask it to separate its Asian and U.S. businesses.
The New York-based hedge fund said Prudential's stock would benefit if it stopped running its crown jewel Asia business and its U.S. business, Jackson National Life, out of one holding company in Britain.
Jackson accounts for a small portion of Prudential's value, but is extremely complex to analyze, Third Point said. As a result, investors are undervaluing Prudential's Asia business because they are bundling it with Jackson, Third Point added. Moreover, the current structure is putting Prudential at a disadvantage when it comes to recruiting top talent in Asia, according to Third Point.
In the letter, addressed to Prudential's board of directors, Third Point also blamed the company's management for prioritizing dividend payouts over reinvesting in the business. 
Third Point is arguing that some of the benefits of a split would include cost cuts at Prudential's British holding company, better capital allocation policies, and better management of the U.S. and Asia businesses, the sources said.
""If PruAsia and Jackson were separated, resulting in a greater focus on reinvesting capital in each unit and streamlining central costs at the group level, our analysis indicates that the interests represented by Prudential plc shares can double within three years,"" Loeb wrote in the letter.
Prudential did not respond to a request for comment.
While Prudential's headquarters are in London, it is regulated in Hong Kong following its separation from M&G.
A source told Reuters earlier this month that Prudential was studying options to reduce its ownership in Jackson, including seeking ""outside capital.""
Third Point's stake is equivalent to just under 5% ownership of Prudential, making the fund the company's second-largest shareholder and Prudential the hedge fund's biggest position currently, according to the sources. Prudential has a market capitalization of 36.8 billion pounds ($47.5 billion). 
Third Point, which has $14 billion in assets under management, has experience in pushing companies to split themselves apart, including at Yum Brands,  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and most recently United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).
To raise additional capital to build the stake in Prudential, Third Point raised a so-called special purpose vehicle, which allows hedge funds to raise money quickly and investors to put money to work in the stock of a specific company instead of a co-mingled fund.

Although Third Point is based in the United States, a significant portion of its recent activist engagements have taken place overseas, at companies including Sony Corp (T:6758), Nestle (S:NESN) and EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX).

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cargill Inc will launch plant-based hamburger patties and ground ""fake meat"" products in April, the company said on Monday, challenging Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Impossible Foods for sales in grocery stores, cafeterias and restaurants.
The entry of Cargill, one the world's largest privately held companies, in the market for imitation meat highlights the growing popularity of plant-based foods and expectations that consumers will continue to gobble up meat substitutes.
The 155-year-old company presents new competition for startups Beyond Meat and privately held, Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods. Major meat companies including  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and WH Group's Smithfield Foods [SFII.UL] also sell plant-based products.
Demand for meat alternatives has soared as consumers add plant-based protein to their diets for health reasons and out of concern for animal welfare and environmental damage from livestock farming.
Cargill plans to employ its decades-long experience handling ingredients and buying crops to produce private-label products more efficiently than competitors.
""We believe we're uniquely positioned to be very effective and efficient in the supply chain,"" said Elizabeth Gutschenritter, managing director of Cargill's alternative protein team.
Cargill will offer customers soy protein or pea protein-based patties and ground products, which can be made into tacos, spaghetti sauce or other dishes. Retailers will be able to sell the products under their own labels.
Beyond Meat products are made from pea protein, while Impossible Foods uses soy protein.
""On both, we're competing,"" Gutschenritter said.
""We are offering a portfolio that will encompass both pea and soy formulations.""
North American pea-protein producer Puris is a supplier to Cargill and Beyond Meat. Cargill has announced investments of $100 million in Puris since January 2018 and benefited from the investment due to limited supplies of pea protein, Gutschenritter said. 
""Cargill is a huge organization and so we deal with being both supplier and competitor in a lot of different areas,"" she said.
""Being able to have that raw material supply has been helpful for us for sure.""
Cargill is better known for trading crops like corn and soybeans around the world and supplying ground beef than producing plant-based foods. The company said it has invested $7 billion in animal protein in the last five years. By comparison, investments in alternative proteins are in the ""low single digit percentages,"" Gutschenritter said. 

""It's still such a small portion of the investments that we're making,"" she said.

The S&P 500 tumbled 3.42%, Nasdaq Composite lost 3.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.53%, or 1,023 points.
The World Health Organization said the Covid-19 epidemic in China peaked and plateaued between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2, but warned that a ""sudden increase in new cases"" outside of China is ""deeply concerning.""
Italy reported more than 220 cases of the virus, with five deaths as of Monday morning. South Korea confirmed 231 cases, taking the total in the country to more than 830. Iran, meanwhile, confirmed 61 total cases, with 12 deaths nationwide.
The spread of the virus beyond China has investors fretting over a potential pandemic, which many fear would roil global growth despite expectations for central banks to cushion the fallout with more easing.
""The U.S. economy will also likely be affected, but based on the current backdrop, recession risk still appears relatively low. The drag will be partially offset by a sharp drop in interest rates and energy prices,"" Suntrust said in a note to clients. 
Against the backdrop of rising worries about a prolonged hit to global supply chains linked to China, and by extension, to the global economy investors ditched stocks and piled into safe-havens like bonds, triggering a further inversion in the bond-market yield curve, a warning signal on the economy.
The spread between the 3-Month note and 10-Year Treasury yield widened to -16 basis points from -10 basis points on Friday.
Semiconductor companies, who look to China for growth, led the broader decline in the tech, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) down 8%, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) off 7% and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) down 5%.
Energy stocks were not too far behind, paced by a slump in oil prices as the spread of the virus stoked further worries about Chinese oil demand.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also on the back foot, as companies such as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), both of which have recently raised concerns about the impact from the virus on performance, came under pressure.

Investing.com - With Wall Street plunged into the red on concerns Covid-19 is a pandemic in the making, it may be surprising that the biggest drag on the Dow is a healthcare stock.
But don’t underestimate the impact of politics.
UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) lost 7.6% in afternoon trading. The Dow Industrials is a price-weighted index, so its decline of 23 points translated into a loss of 156 points for the blue-chip index.
That’s the biggest intraday loss of the stock in 8-1/2 years.
Health insurers are under pressure after Sen. Bernie Sanders won the Nevada Democratic caucus, upping his chance on becoming the party’s nominee.
Sanders’ Medicare for All healthcare plan would eliminate private insurers from the market.
“It appears to us that Sen. Bernie Sanders is not just solidifying his position but also could be a bigger threat to President Trump in the general election than the market appreciates,” S.G. Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported.
“That would represent a major threat to financials and housing as Sanders has the most punitive agenda for these sectors given his plans for taxes and regulation,” Seiberg said.
Today’s drop wiped out UnitedHeath’s gains for this year and shares are down about 5% in the last 52-weeks.
The S&P Health Care sector was down 3.2%, with just two components in the green: Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN)."

1215,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>","Apple Hit Hard on China Phone Sales, but Recoups Some Losses","By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) slumped Monday, adding to the big weakness in Wall Street’s major indices, but the megacap managed to recover some from its big plunge at the open.
Apple lost 4.5% in morning trading, but had been down about 6% when the bell rang.
That accounted for more than 95 points off the Dow, which was down a whopping 856.
Apart from the overall fear that Covid-19 could turn into a pandemic and slam global economic growth, Apple were hit by tangible demand destruction in China, where the virus originated.
Weak mobile phone number out before the bell prompted selling.
Mobile phone brands shipped a total of 20.4 million devices that month, down 36.6% from 32.1 million in January 2019, data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed.
China’s smartphone market has been shrinking for a number of years as demand became more reliant on consumers replacing existing handsets than buying new ones. However, January’s drop was far larger than was seen in the same month last year, when sales fell 11.4%.
After trading began, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Apple’s appeal against a verdict to by $440 million in damages for internet security patents held by patent licensing company VirnetX.
The justices rejected Apple's appeal in the long-running case in which a federal jury in 2016 found that Apple had infringed VirnetX's patents and awarded $302 million. A judge later increased that amount to $439.7 million including interest and other costs.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>","Warren Buffett calls coronavirus outbreak 'scary stuff,' but says he won't be selling stocks","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), on Monday called the coronavirus outbreak ""scary stuff"" but said that it was no time to sell stocks despite the threat of a pandemic.
Speaking on CNBC, Buffett said investors with a 10- to 20-year time horizon and focused on companies' earnings power will fare well in stocks, and that the outbreak has ""not changed"" his long-term outlook.
""It is scary stuff,"" Buffett said. ""I don't think it should affect what you do in stocks.""
Markets worldwide fell on Monday on concern about how the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak, which began in China and has spread to countries including Italy, South Korea and Iran, could disrupt supply chains and slow global economic growth.
Buffett, however, said long-term investors should not get caught up in daily headlines, and that Berkshire would ""certainly be more inclined"" to buy stocks than on Friday.
""If you look at the present situation,"" he said, ""you get more for your money in stocks than bonds.""
He said this was true though the U.S. economy, while sill strong, had become ""a little softer"" than it was six months ago.
The economy grew 2.3% last year but has experienced slower consumer spending and industrial production.
Buffett spoke two days after Berkshire said operating profit fell 3% in 2019 to $23.97 billion, hurt by losses from insurance underwriting, while unrealized gains in Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and other investments boosted net income to a record $81.42 billion.
Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has more than 90 operating businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurer and Dairy Queen ice cream, and Buffett said the coronavirus outbreak has affected a significant number.
Many of the roughly 1,000 Dairy Queens in China are closed, while those that are open ""aren't doing any business to speak of,"" Buffett said, while Johns Manville insulation and Shaw carpeting have seen supply chain disruptions.
""There's always trouble coming,"" he said. ""The real question is where are those businesses going to be in five or 10 years.""
Berkshire's stock price has trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) over the last decade, and Buffett said it will not trounce the broader market as it once did, in part reflecting its size and roughly $558 billion market value.
Buffett said Berkshire over the long term is unlikely to be in the top 15% or bottom 30% of stocks, but will outperform in down markets.

Any long-term outperformance ""will be minor, but it will be done in a very very safe manner,"" he said.

Investing.com - Wall Street plunged into the red in early trading Monday as a spike in the number of Covid-19 virus cases confirmed outside of China pushed money out of riskier investments.
The Dow dove 905.27 points, or 3.12%, to 28,087.04 at 9:35 AM ET (14:35 GMT) and the S&P 500 fell 93.63, or 2.8%, to 3,245.62. The Nasdaq Composite plunged 341.72, or 3.6%, 9,234.87, with tech stocks particularly hard hit.
The U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted the most since October and the 10-Year yield fell below 1.37%. Its all-time low is 1.32% hit in 2016 after the Brexit vote.
Worries snowballed over the weekend as the numbers of cases of Covid-19 jumped in Italy, South Korea and Iran. Authorities in Italy imposed a quarantine in the north of the country and its benchmark MIB index tumbled nearly 6%.
The Covid-19 shock is a test of the fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) and buy-the-dip conditioning that has helped stocks overcome the headwinds of valuations, Allianz (DE:ALVG) Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian tweeted.
“A key element is whether markets distinguish between Central Banks' willingness (high) and ability (low) to counter the economic shock,” he said.
Among individual stocks, Dow component Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sank 6% after the latest data showed shipments of mobile phones in China dove 36.6% in January from the year-ago period.
High-flying Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has a factory in Shanghai, was also hit on virus worries, with shares dropping 8.6%.
Chip stocks were also hard hit. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) lost 10.2%, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tumbled 8.4% and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) slumped 7.4%.
Expectations that the Federal Reserve would stop in with a rate cut to help the economic situation rose today, with the odds of a March cut rising to more than one in four.
“Growing consensus among economist(s) I am speaking to at (the National Association for Business Economics 2020 conference) is that the Fed will have to cut and do so soon - March - in response to COVID-19,” Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk tweeted. “It may not be called a health pandemic yet but it is an economic pandemic.”"

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",Boeing scours idle 737 MAX plant for industrial snags,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Insiders note an ""eerie"" calm at Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX factory, formerly a bustling hub that has helped fuel the aviation industry's record growth over the last two decades.
Weeks after halting production of the 737 MAX, which has been grounded for almost a year over fatal crashes, Boeing is seizing on the lull to conduct an overhaul at its Seattle-area factory to curb inefficiency, improve quality and ease the plane's re-entry to the market, four people familiar with the matter said.
Backed by engineers from roughly a dozen suppliers such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR) and robot maker Electroimpact Inc, Boeing is fixing inventory management, upgrading automated tooling, and addressing ""high-defect"" areas, three of them said. 
Boeing is also working to reduce instances where workers leave tools, rags and other debris inside jetliners as they build them, a problem at multiple Boeing factories. On Friday, Boeing said it found ""foreign object debris"" inside dozens of stored 737 MAX jets, and was investigating the cause.
A Boeing spokesman said the company was using this time to work closely with suppliers on a dozen initiatives to improve the overall health of its production system.
""The objective is to ensure a healthy and stable system that is ready for resuming production and increasing rates at the appropriate time,"" the spokesman, Bernard Choi, said. 
While Boeing has long said the Renton plant is already the most efficient in aviation, such longstanding problems were viewed as too risky to address during years of helter-skelter production to meet record jet demand.
Even before the 737 MAX grounding, the production of aircraft wings had been partially automated by robots. But concerns that missteps might harm deliveries, hurting profit, prevented a complete forensic study of the decades-old plant, two of the people said.
Now, Boeing and other aerospace companies are focusing more attention on improving production systems rather than adding to their already-bulging order books. And for Boeing, the hushed MAX assembly lines have abruptly brought that effort into sharper focus.
While production stability is expected to prevail over market share in the short term, fine-tuning the plant could help determine the MAX's market position over the long term.
Analysts say Boeing has historically led rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) in production technology, but the European group has made reversing this a top priority under CEO Guillaume Faury.
""You have this duopoly with high barriers to entry and enormous backlogs and no new product launches for years to come,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia, referring to Boeing and Airbus. ""The only thing left to focus on is building jets and keeping costs down.""
'HIGH-DEFECT' AREAS 
Part of the effort involves reducing ""high-defect"" areas, or situations where the quality of a part deviates from airline specifications - which can result in costly rework. 
If the defect is bad enough to require changes, Boeing must flag that the airplane has been repaired and the airline customer pays less - akin to a discount for a scratch on a new car, one of the people said.
""Defects and rework are a big deal, they are extremely parasitic to factory efficiency and part quality,"" he said. ""Now they have the down time, so this is the time to deal with it.""
Another initiative is redesigning kits, made up of tools and parts, to be smaller and more manageable, said Choi, the Boeing spokesman. ""Kitting"" eliminates a mechanic's need to search for the right tools.
While all manufacturers chase inefficiency, jet factories around the world have been flat out for years without pauses for model switches seen in automotive plants, for example, and any tinkering usually has to fit in alongside full-speed narrowbody production.
The shutdown has therefore handed Boeing the chance to seize an industrial opportunity out of its worst-ever crisis.
Even so, some issues are difficult to solve. 
A high proportion of fuselages have been getting flagged on arrival for unacceptable defects such as loose rivets, scratches, and construction errors, which causes delays, a fifth person with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
Even dents that are scarcely visible to the naked eye must be addressed before the jet takes flight. 
The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the work at Boeing is confidential.
Spirit and Electroimpact declined to comment and referred questions to Boeing.
The 737 MAX is the company's lifeblood, bringing in some 40% of Boeing's profit before the aircraft was grounded and deliveries frozen last March. 

When the 737 MAX is approved to fly, potentially later this year, the planemaker aims to progress cautiously, reaching a pre-grounding production rate of 52 jets monthly in 2022, and bumping it up to 57 jets a month - which would equal its record rate - in 2023, supplier sources said.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 07:14AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Juul halts Indonesia e-cigarette sales, throwing Asia expansion in doubt","By Chris Kirkham, Fanny Potkin and Neil Jerome Morales
(Reuters) - Juul Labs Inc is halting sales in Indonesia, citing concerns that it can't stop retailers from selling its high-nicotine e-cigarettes to young people in a largely unregulated tobacco market.
Juul disclosed its Indonesia plans to Reuters as the news organization was inquiring about the company's marketing to younger customers there and in the other two Asian countries where it operates - the Philippines and South Korea. A Reuters review of Juul's Asia marketing found that the firm has promoted e-cigarettes in ways similar to those that raised the ire of regulators in the United States.
Juul said in a statement that it would suspend Indonesia sales ""indefinitely"" until it could ensure that online and traditional retailers there will ""increase and enforce age restrictions and compliance measures.""
The firm's decision to retreat from the world's fourth most populous nation - which has not been previously reported - marks a major setback for Juul's larger plans to expand in Asia. The region has been seen as critical to the company's growth amid mounting U.S. legal and regulatory problems over its role in the nation's youth vaping epidemic.
Juul had launched in Indonesia just seven months ago because it was attracted to the nation's permissive regulatory environment, according to a former employee and another source familiar with its Asia sales strategy. The company had targeted customers aged 19 to 35, according to those two sources and a current Juul employee.
A Juul spokesman said the company only wants adult smokers to use its products.
The Indonesia decision comes after Juul said last month that it was ""reviewing our strategies and operations"" in South Korea - where the company has faced regulatory scrutiny - because of disappointing sales. Juul has also held off on planned expansions in the Netherlands and New Zealand. The company said it is taking a ""methodical approach"" in reviewing its overseas operations on a country-by-country basis.
In Asia, Juul has continued to sell the fruit- and dessert-flavored nicotine ""pods"" that it has voluntarily pulled from U.S. store shelves amid a hail of criticism over their appeal to youth. In Indonesia, Juul has marketed its products in movie theaters and malls frequented by young people, selling its e-cigarettes at kiosks and in sleek, Juul-branded retail shops that mimic Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stores. The firm has also hired ""ambassadors"" - often attractive young women - to promote Juul in bars and nightclubs. As recently as last month, Juul was installing kiosks in Jakarta office buildings catering to young tech employees and running advertisements for Juul flavors in office elevators.
Retailers in Indonesia and the Philippines have allowed online sales of Juul devices and pods with no age verification, according to a Reuters review of Juul products advertised for sale on Asian e-commerce platforms. Juul said it did not authorize any sales without verification and has a team that works to remove unauthorized online listings.
Juul did not answer detailed questions from Reuters about its Asia marketing efforts and their appeal to young people. The company said in a statement that it is ""committed to advancing the long-term potential for harm reduction for adult smokers while combating underage use.""
In recent months, the company's stricter approach to marketing in the United States has made it difficult for those in overseas markets such as Indonesia to market in the same way and meet sales targets, the employee said. The company has taken a more cautious approach to international expansion under new CEO K.C. Crosthwaite, the person said, compared to an earlier approach of opening new markets as fast as possible.
The company is exploring expansions in Vietnam and Japan later this year, the employee said. A Juul spokesman confirmed the company is monitoring the regulatory environment in Vietnam but said it currently has no plans to launch there. The spokesman declined to comment on Japan.
A LOSING BET ON INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
International expansion has been seen as crucial to Juul's future as the company's U.S. problems have caused investors to slash growth forecasts. Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc - which bought a 35% stake in Juul Labs Inc in December 2018 for $12.8 billion - has since marked down its value by a total of $8.6 billion.
Altria executives were initially bullish on Juul's international prospects. In an earnings call soon after the Juul deal, Altria CEO Howard Willard said he expected Juul's international revenue and profits to eventually be ""as large as or larger than the U.S. opportunity.""
Those prospects have dimmed, however, as some overseas regulators took note of the widespread criticism of Juul in the United States. India banned e-cigarettes last fall, citing the U.S. epidemic of youth use, and countries such as Malaysia are considering similar restrictions.
But Indonesia - until now - had been seen as one of the company's biggest opportunities. The country of nearly 270 million people has among the world's highest smoking rates and weakest regulations, imposing no penalties for selling cigarettes to minors.
In an interview with Reuters in July, when Juul launched in Indonesia, the company's executive running the Asia Pacific region, Ken Bishop, acknowledged that attracting young adult smokers was important to its success there.
""That is typically where we see the initial interest,"" he said, adding that eventually the product would appeal to ""any demographic"" including longtime smokers.
Bishop also emphasized the importance of preventing sales to teenagers.
MARKETING AT MOVIES, DANCE CLUBS
Just before a November screening of the movie Charlie's Angels in downtown Jakarta, Indonesia, teenagers who filled the theater watched one ad for an e-commerce site that featured Korean boy band BTS, another for spicy instant noodles, and a third for Juul e-cigarettes.
""Odor-free, tar-free, mess-free,"" the voiceover said as colorful displays of mint and mango flavors for the ""#1 Vaporizer in America"" flashed across the screen.
Juul said that Charlie's Angels was a 17-and-up film in Indonesia and that it has stopped cinema advertising in the last two months. Juul did not answer questions on what age group it aimed to reach with the movie ads or why it stopped them.
Juul hired its 150 ""brand ambassadors"" through a marketing firm to promote its products in night clubs, restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores, according to the three people familiar with its Asia marketing strategy. Through a contract with Indonesian marketing firm Nava Plus, the ambassadors charged 2000 rupiah (the equivalent of $0.15 in U.S. dollars) for sample hits on a Juul at places such as the swanky Omnia Bali nightclub. Nava Plus did not respond to requests for comment.
Such efforts reflected the goal of reaching customers in their 20s and early 30s by pitching the device as a trendy lifestyle product, according to the three sources. The campaign mirrors early U.S. promotions at music festivals and other events catering to young people, which have since become a focus of government investigations into Juul's marketing.
Juul has denied it ever targeted teenagers in any country, but the company has acknowledged that those early U.S. campaigns focused on young adults aged 25 to 34 - a strategy company executives later called a mistake.
Instagram posts last August promoting Juul's largest Asia store in Town Square (NYSE:SQ) Cilandak, a Jakarta mall, evoked a club scene, with dance music playing in the background of a promotional video with the staff, and slogans reading ""come now and feel the experience."" Juul said the Instagram post was developed by the mall, not the company, without explaining how Juul store employees were featured without its consent. The company said it requested that the post be taken down after Reuters inquired about it.
The Town Square store is located across from an ice cream shop. Near another Juul store, in the upscale Plaza Indonesia, a miniature train takes children through the mall. 
Juul has also launched its own branded stores and kiosks in Indonesia, South Korea and the Philippines, which have a sleek, modern vibe. Buyers can engrave their names for free on Juul devices, and the shops are staffed by vendors who are typically in their 20s, wearing black-and-white uniforms embroidered with the Juul logo. They almost invariably serve customers about the same age, three clerks at Juul stores in popular Jakarta malls told Reuters.
The flavors Juul stopped selling in the United States amid criticism remain a hit among young Juulers in Asia. Sungwon Cho, a 26-year old photographer in Seoul, started using Juul in April because it was more convenient than traditional cigarettes and ""didn't smell bad.""

""I like the sweet taste,"" he said. ""It feels like I am vaping a candy or jelly.""

1246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 07:06AM ET</span>",U.S. Stocks Look Set for Biggest Drop Since August: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equity futures tumbled alongside stocks in Europe and Asia on Monday as concerns mounted about the ability of authorities to keep the coronavirus from spreading further beyond China. Havens including Treasuries and gold jumped.
In a dramatic day across markets, these were some of the standout moves:

Contracts on the three main U.S. stock benchmarks were all down more than 2%, with those on the S&P 500 Index pointing to the biggest drop since August.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid as much as 3.6%, heading for its biggest decline since 2016, as investors fled travel and luxury shares. A gauge of credit risk on the region’s high-yield companies jumped.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries sank to its lowest since 2016.
South Korea’s benchmark dropped 3.9%, leading declines across Asia, though Japan’s markets were shut for a holiday.
Spot gold approached $1,700, while Brent crude oil tumbled almost 4%.

The risk-off mood was triggered by multiple outbreaks of the epidemic that’s now spread to more than 30 countries, with South Korea reporting a jump in infections and Italy locking down an area of 50,000 people near Milan. Finance chiefs and central bankers from the largest economies warned this weekend that they saw the virus bringing downside risks to global growth.
Risk assets are reeling as governments and companies curb travel to contain a novel pathogen that can be transmitted by people without symptoms. The moves follow on last week’s surge into havens after fresh warnings by companies over the potential impact of the virus on business and global supply chains. Adding to the anxiety Monday was China announcing an easing of the quarantine of Wuhan, only to retract the statement hours later.
“Until last week it was largely contained in terms of growth of new cases and growth in fatalities to China,” Tim Graf, head of macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT), said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “And there was also a belief that whatever policy response might come, it would be forceful enough that you would see a V- or U-shaped recovery. But perhaps today we’re starting to see that might be a little more complicated.”
Elsewhere, Italian bonds dropped on concern that the spread of the coronavirus may push the economy into a recession. The Australian dollar chalked up a fresh 11-year low and the offshore yuan held most of last week’s decline.
These are some key events coming up:
Earnings keep rolling in from companies including:  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) on Wednesday; Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).,  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY). Inc., Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). and Dell Technologies Inc. on Thursday; and  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc on Friday.The Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina is on Tuesday.The Bank of Korea announces its policy decision on Thursday, with risks to the outlook growing amid a surge in coronavirus cases.U.S. jobless claims, GDP and durable goods data are out Thursday.Japan industrial production, jobs, and retail sales figures are due on Friday.These are the main moves in markets:

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 06:56AM ET</span>","U.S. Treasury yields tumble, curve inversion deepens as coronavirus spreads","LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. 10-year government borrowing costs fell on Monday to their lowest levels since 2016 as more coronavirus cases were reported internationally, raising fears the outbreak could do far more economic damage than earlier predicted.
The curve inversion between the 3-month and 10-year bond yields also deepened in what has seen as a classic recession signal.
The moves come as investors dumped shares and fled for the safety of bonds, perceiving a risk that China's coronavirus outbreak will grow into a pandemic, with disruptive and deadly consequences around the world, as the number of infections rose sharply in South Korea, Italy and Iran.
Italy is racing to contain the biggest outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, sealing off the worst-affected towns and banning public events in much of the north as a fourth patient died of the illness.
While the U.S. economy has been relatively robust so far, Justin Onuekwusi, a portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management, said: ""The U.S. Treasury market is pricing that the world economy is going to be flirting with sub-2% growth.""
World growth falling below 2% is generally considered equivalent to recession, taking into account population growth and poor countries' need for faster expansion.
As investors sold stocks and rushed for safe-haven assets, the 10-year Treasury yield fell eight basis points to 1.39% (US10YT=RR), having earlier touched 1.377% - its lowest since July 2016.
The 30-year Treasury yield touched a new record low at 1.873% (US30YT=RR), also down 8 bps on the day.
Focus is likely to turn to the yield curve - the gap between short- and long-dated bond yields. Curve inversion, when short-dated borrowing costs are higher than those further out, is considered a fairly reliable gauge of U.S. recession.
The 3-month/10 year curve was at its most inverted since October at minus 0.17% (US3MT=RR) (US10YT=RR) while the 2-year/10-year curve is inching that way, standing at just 11 basis points, the flattest since last October (US2US10=RR).
Money markets have deepened their bets on interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, now roughly pricing a 25 basis-point cut in June .
The bets picked up steam after purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys on Friday showed U.S. business activity in both the manufacturing and services sectors stalled in February, the latter slipping to its lowest since 2013.

Investors snapped up U.S. Treasuries, sending the yield on 10-year securities to the lowest level since 2016. In Europe, the entirety of Germany’s bond yield curve fell back below 0% for the first time since October, meaning that investors may have to pay for the privilege of holding them to maturity. Global stock indexes tumbled, with S&P 500 futures dropping 2.6%, the most in six months.
The total stock of negative-yielding investment-grade debt looked set to jump back above $14 trillion.
Other bond markets took a beating. Italy’s debt appeared most vulnerable, with borrowing costs soaring above those of Greece’s after the government imposed a lockdown on an area of 50,000 people near Milan, with infections in the country rising to about 150 from just a handful a week ago. The outbreak threatens to weigh further on the country’s already-struggling economy.
“The moves in bunds, Treasuries etc. are all rational moves, with the coronavirus now having a significant impact outside of China,” said Peter Chatwell, the head of European rates strategy at Mizuho International Plc. “The impact on Italian bonds specifically seems extreme - this just goes to show that hotspots for the spread of the disease are being found a long way outside of China.”
The spread of the coronavirus is quashing hopes that the peak rate of infections may have passed and bodes badly for the global economy, which had seen signs earlier this year of a rebound. As investors mark down growth estimates, expectations for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have also gathered pace.
Rate Cuts
Overnight index swap markets priced for two 25 basis point cuts this year, with the first fully-priced for June. Money markets also moved to price in a full, 25 basis point rate cut from the Bank of England in November, having previously not anticipated one for 2020.
The U.S. 10-year yield has dropped more than 50 basis points this year. The 30-year bond, typically favored in a risk off environment, saw yields touch a record low on Monday. The rate on its German and Dutch peers fell below 0% for the first time since Oct. while Italy’s 10-year yield jumped the most since December, reaching 1.0%, meaning borrowing costs are higher than Greece’s across the curve. Stock futures from Europe to the U.S. fell.
Cash trading was shut during the Asia trading session due to a holiday in Japan. The dollar once again proved itself to be the currency to own at times of stress, appreciating versus all group-of-10 currencies with the exception of the yen. The latter’s appreciation showed its reputation as a haven outshining the growing recession risk in Japan.
To help model the effect of the virus, analysts are looking toward other major shocks, such as the terrorist attacks on the U.S. in 2001, or the global financial crisis. ADMacro is recommending investors target the bond markets of countries where central banks still have relatively high interest rates.
“Events are moving at speed and for all the bluster from central banks they have shown how quickly they can move when they have to -- Think 9/11. Think GFC,” wrote Patrick Perret-Green, head of research and strategy, in a note to clients. “The view is simple – look at the countries that have room to ease and where the pricing of such action is delayed. The US and Canada are the stand outs and the U.K. is interesting.”

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>","Some Samsung, Hyundai workers self-quarantine as Korea Inc braces for virus impact","By Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - Some South Korean workers at Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) are staying home as a precautionary measure as corporate Korea scrambles to prevent the coronavirus outbreak from causing widespread disruption in its home market.
The country's third-largest conglomerate SK Group, which controls memory chip maker SK Hynix (KS:000660) and mobile carrier SK Telecom (KS:017670), advised its employees to work remotely starting from Tuesday due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
About 1,500 workers of Samsung Electronics' phone complex in the southeastern city of Gumi have self-quarantined after one of its workers was infected with the disease, a person familiar with the matter said. They include 900 workers who commute to Gumi from neighboring Daegu city, the person said.
The southeastern city of Daegu - the epicenter of the virus outbreak in South Korea- and nearby cities are an industrial hub in South Korea, Asia's fourth-biggest economy, and home to factories of Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor and a number of others. 
South Korea on Monday reported 161 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected patients in the country to 763, a day after the government raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level.
Samsung Electronics shares fell 4.1% and Hyundai Motor ended down 4.3%, tracking the wider market's (KS11) 3.9% fall, as the spike in new coronavirus cases intensified fears about the epidemic's fallout on the economy and businesses.
Samsung said it has restarted production at its phone factory complex in Gumi on Monday, after closing it over the weekend, adding that the floor where the infected employee worked will resume production on Tuesday. 
""As of 1 p.m. KT (0400 GMT) Feb. 24, the Gumi Complex has started normal operations and we expect no impact on production,"" Samsung said in a statement, without elaborating further. 
Samsung's Gumi factory accounts for a small portion of its total phone production, but it produces premium phones and foldable phones, research firm Counterpoint said. 
Six employees at Hyundai Motor's factories in the southeastern city of Ulsan are also at home, with four of them linked to a church at the center of the virus outbreak, a union spokesman said in a statement. 
""We are walking on ice,"" one Hyundai factory worker told Reuters.
A factory run by Hyundai supplier Seojin Industrial was closed over the weekend after the death of a virus-infected worker, an official at the supplier said. He said that authorities disinfected the factory, located in the city of Gyeongju, and it is unclear when production will resume.
Seojin declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. 
Any disruption would be a fresh blow to Hyundai, which has restarted most of its domestic factories' production after being hit by suspensions due to parts shortages from China.
Ulsan is home to Hyundai's biggest car factories, and there are a number of suppliers in the city and surrounding areas, which cater not only to the automaker, but export to the United States, Japan and other markets. 
A Hyundai Motor spokesman said there has been no production disruption so far as the automaker has inventory. 

With virus fears spreading nationwide, Hyundai set up thermal cameras at all of its operations across the nation, including its headquarters in Seoul, to check temperatures.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global share markets and oil fell on Monday, safe-haven gold surged and U.S. Treasury yields reached their lowest since mid- 2016, as coronavirus cases spread outside China, darkening the outlook for world growth.
Europe took a beating early on, with Italy plunging more than 4% after a spike in cases of the virus left parts of the country's industrial north in virtual lockdown. (EU) That put Milan on course for its worst day since 2016.
Frankfurt and Paris were both down more than 3% and London's FTSE dropped 2.5%, meaning at least $350 billion had been wiped off the region' market value.

That left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan at its lowest since early February. Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday.
The virus has now killed 2,592 people in China, which has reported 77,150 cases, and spread to some 28 other countries and territories, with a death toll outside of China around two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.
Iran, which announced its first infections last week, said it had confirmed 43 cases and eight deaths, with most of the infections in the holy city of Qom. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan imposed travel and immigration restrictions on the Islamic Republic.
""There is lots of bad news on the coronavirus front with the total number of new cases still rising,"" AMP chief economist Shane Oliver wrote in a note. ""Of course, there is much uncertainty about the case data. New cases outside China still look to be trending up.""
FUTURES GLOOM
Among U.S. stock futures, E-minis for the S&P 500 fell 2.3%. CBOE's VIX volatility index, the so called fear gauge, reached its highest since August.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",Italy's UniCredit says Mustier to stay on as CEO,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's biggest bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI) said on Monday boss Jean Pierre Mustier had confirmed he would remain in his role, after a source told Reuters the French banker had ruled himself out for the top job at rival HSBC (L:HSBA).
UniCredit shares came under pressure last week after media reports that said Mustier, 59, was a leading candidate to succeed HSBC interim CEO Noel Quinn, who is vying for the permanent job. 
The stock fell 3.9% in early trade on Monday, outperforming a 4.8% slump in Italy's banking sector (FTIT8300) triggered by concerns over the economic fallout of an outbreak of the new coronavirus in the country. 
UniCredit recently launched a new plan through 2023 and its ""whole management team, including Jean Pierre Mustier, is fully focused on its successful execution"", the bank said in a statement.
""We consider the news positively as a potential CEO resignation would have reduced the credibility of the company's business plan,"" Banca IMI (LON:IMI) said in a research note.
Mustier arrived at UniCredit in mid-2016 and is widely credited with turning around the bank's fortunes by shoring up its weak capital base, slashing costs and dealing with problem loans.
Under his management, the bank has also disposed of a raft of assets.
After failing to clinch a cross-border merger, Mustier has focused on boosting investor returns through dividends and buybacks to drive the bank's share price higher.
UniCredit shares are up around 36% since Mustier's arrival compared with a 10% rise in Europe's banking index (SX7P).
Still, UniCredit trades below its book value like other European rivals, which are grappling with negative interest rates, the costs of digital transformation and rising competition from nimbler non-banking players.
News about Mustier comes amid a string of top executive changes in Europe. Swiss banks  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and UBS (S:UBSG) both named new bosses this month. On Monday, the Financial Times newspaper reported that  Barclays  (LON:BARC) would start looking for a new CEO.
HSBC said last August it would appoint a new CEO within six to 12 months following the shock ouster of John Flint.
Quinn, the favorite for the role, last week announced plans for a major overhaul at the bank, its third since the financial crisis.
A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday that Mustier had ruled himself out of the race to take the helm at HSBC.
Two sources familiar with the matter had previously confirmed the Frenchman, formerly head of investment banking at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), was being considered.

Money managers are selling stocks and looking for havens after South Korea saw a surge in cases to 763 and the concern in Italy intensified. European equities surged to a fresh record high last week, which is adding to investor anxiety about possibly stretched positioning and valuations.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 01:41AM ET</span>",Coronavirus concerns spur odd market moves,"By Ira Iosebashvili and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some asset prices are moving together in unusual ways, an indication that investors may be preparing their portfolios for a coronavirus-led global slowdown.
U.S. stocks, gold, Treasuries and the dollar have all surged in 2020, a climb that has taken place alongside persistent concerns over the outbreak's economic fallout.
Such synchronous moves are not typical, as investors usually have different reasons for buying each asset class. A bullish bet on stocks, for example, is often a wager on stronger economic growth, while gold and bonds tend to find favor in more pessimistic times.
That conventional wisdom has not applied this year. The S&P 500 is up 3.3% in 2020 and stands just off a record high despite Friday's drop, gold is up 8.3% and near its highest level in seven years while the U.S. Dollar Index is up 3% and hovering near a three-year high. Stocks, gold and the dollar have all notched yearly gains of 3% or more only twice in the past decade.
Meanwhile, the 10-day rolling correlation between the dollar and gold stands at 0.6 -- higher than it has been more than 99% of the time over the last decade. Typically, a stronger dollar tends to pressure gold, which is denominated in the U.S. currency and becomes more expensive for foreign buyers when the buck rises.
Correlation is measured on a scale from minus one, which represents asset prices going in opposite directions, to plus one, indicating prices moving in perfect tandem.
Several forces may be fueling the multipronged rally, analysts said. While investors are loathe to reduce their stock exposure--a losing strategy over the more than-decade-long bull market--many are buffering their portfolios with haven assets such as gold, bonds and the dollar in case the outbreak accelerates or its economic fallout is greater than expected.
At the same time, investors are favoring U.S. stocks and bonds, as many expect the U.S. economy to be less vulnerable to a hit from the coronavirus than those in Asia and the eurozone. That has boosted the dollar while sending yields on some U.S. government bonds to record lows.
""Market participants are looking at U.S. assets as a safe haven no matter what asset class,"" said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), global head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities.
Many also expect the disruptions wrought by the outbreak to hit global growth and push central banks--including the Federal Reserve--to cut rates or introduce stimulus measures.
Fed funds futures on Friday implied traders are pricing in a 59% chance of a rate cut at June's monetary policy meeting, compared with an implied probability of 17.5% at the start of the year.
That is seen as positive for stock prices, which have been buoyed by years of low rates, as well as gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when rates rise. Bonds also become attractive because their prices rise when yields fall.
Lockstep moves in asset prices sometimes concern investors. Assets that rose in tandem could be at risk of a sharp simultaneous reversal if investors decide all to sell at once. Such moves occurred when worries over China's economy triggered wide selloffs in 2015 and 2016.
Others, however, are more optimistic. Denise Chisholm, sector strategist at Fidelity Investments, noted that markets saw declines in a broad range of assets in 2018, followed by rallies in most major asset classes the next year.
Such a momentum shift has occurred only four times since 1975 and has been followed by an average return of 17% on the Russell 3000 index, her research shows.

1258,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>","In Singapore, REITs Are Becoming More Important Than Ever","(Bloomberg) -- Singapore is becoming a hub for the property-management industry: It has more foreign REITs than anywhere else in the world, and the companies’ importance on the nation’s benchmark equity index is the highest it’s ever been.
Since the city-state saw the first share sale of a real estate investment trust in 2002, it has pocketed 41 IPOs of such firms -- including seven foreign-currency-denominated ones. In comparison, Hong Kong, the world’s top initial public offering venue last year, has just had 11 since then, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.
The country’s favorable tax regime and well-established legal system made it particularly appealing for international investment trusts. Being commercially flexible and open to tweaking its regulations has allowed Singapore to continue to lead in the area, according to Ee Kean Wong, capital markets partner at WongPartnership LLP.
The hunt for yield has certainly helped boost the allure of the trusts as global central banks keep lowering interest rates to fend off an economic slowdown, and to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has so far killed some 2,500 people. With a yield of 6.2% -- one of the highest globally -- Singapore-listed REITs are sought after and more frequently traded by investors than most of the blue-chip stocks in the country.
The importance of REITs has also shown up in their Straits Times Index weighting, which has doubled over the last five years. Here is a look at how property managers are becoming more significant to Singapore’s financial market:
Initial Public Offerings
The city-state’s journey to become a REIT hub started in 2002, with the first investment trust IPO from CapitaLand Mall Trust. Its market capitalization has since jumped 16 times to $6.6 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as it keeps issuing new shares.
Singapore’s reliance on REIT listings has grown steadily. They account for the majority of IPO proceeds in three of the last five years. More foreign investment trusts have flocked to the city-state, with the recent pound-denominated Elite Commercial REIT being the first of its kind to be sold there.
“The investing community here will always have an appetite for REITs, given the attractive yields they offer,” said Jin Rui Oh, a Singapore-based director at United First Partners.
Yields
Singapore-listed investment trusts boast an average forward dividend yield of 6.2%, one of the best globally, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Meanwhile, they also give out the highest payout among all sectors in the Straits Times Index.
Performance
These REITs have outperformed the city-state’s benchmark index by a wide margin in the past two years, as the nation’s investors have a penchant for high-dividend stocks. The FTSE Straits Times REIT Index has gained 18%, compared with a drop of 9.4% for the Straits Times Index. The former reached a 12-year high this month.
Trading Volume
Property-manager stocks have attracted significant trading over the years, taking five spots out of the top 10 most-active shares in the Straits Times Index, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. By contrast, DBS Group Holdings Ltd., the largest bank in Southeast Asia by assets, and Keppel Corp Ltd., an infrastructure-to-property conglomerate, rank 15th and 17th, respectively.
“With the growing popularity of REITs among investors, more listings by these trust can help to improve the market turnover,” said United First’s Oh. “It works when there are a variety of offerings to appeal to the diverse group of investors, allowing them to rotate into different sectors.”
Index Weight
As REIT listings rise, their weighting on the Straits Times Index has grown to 11% in 2020 from less than 5% in 2015, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.
“With the successful listing of Manulife US REIT, Cromwell European REIT, Prime US REIT, and Elite Commercial REIT in Singapore, we can expect more international REITs to follow suit in the years to come,” Oh added"

The currency declined as much as 0.8% to 1,218.35 against the dollar, the weakest since August. The benchmark Kospi Index sank 2.9%.
“The virus appears to have a bigger-than-expected negative impact on the financial markets,” said Park Sang-hyun, an economist at HI Investment & Securities Co. “The point is whether the virus outbreak would stabilize in end-February or early March.”
More than 700 people were confirmed to have been infected in the nation, with the government raising its alert level to red. President Moon Jae-in said the government could take “powerful measures like never before without being tied to regulations” to contain the outbreak.
Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol will convene an emergency meeting related to the coronavirus outbreak at 3 p.m. local time, the central bank said on Sunday.
Forward swap rates indicate that traders have priced in a rate cut over the next three months, with the odds jumping to 80% on Friday from less than 40% on Feb. 14. Yields on Korea’s 10-year sovereign bonds dropped 5 basis points to 1.4%.
“The market will be watching how the government and BOK measures to stimulate the economy will unfold,” said Kim Yumi, a market strategist at Kiwoom Securities in Seoul. “More easing, which is normally a weakening factor for the won, may help ease market anxiety and provide some relief for the currency.”

The U.S. multinational food and beverage maker said the acquisition of Be & Cheery, which sells snacks from nuts to dried fruits mainly on Chinese e-commerce platforms, was an important step in its goal to become China's leading consumer-focused food and beverage company.
""Be & Cheery adds direct-to-consumer capability, positioning us to capitalize on continued growth in e-commerce, and a local brand that is able to stretch across a broad portfolio of products, through both online and offline channels,"" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Greater China, said in a statement on Sunday.
""We also expect to leverage Be & Cheery's innovation and consumer insights capabilities to drive innovation in other key PepsiCo growth markets.""
Haoxiangni, which is based in the eastern city of Hangzhou, said in a separate filing that it had decided to sell as it wanted to focus on the jujube business. 
Founded in 2003, Be & Cheery is one of the largest online snack companies in China and reported revenues of about 5 billion yuan ($711.7 million) in 2019, the companies said. 

The transaction is subject to a Haoxiangni shareholder vote, certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, they said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook's former sustainability chief has launched an organization to help employees at big companies press their bosses for more aggressive policies to fight climate change. 
Hundreds of companies have committed to reducing emissions in their own operations to be in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement, in which governments aim to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
Beyond their own operations, however, many companies have refrained from advocating for broader solutions needed to avoid a global catastrophe, said Bill Weihl, who led sustainability efforts at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and will head the new organization, ClimateVoice. 
Employees at tech companies have objected to selling cloud services to Big Oil, and companies are reticent to exert lobbying influence on behalf of specific legislation. 
""When it's an issue that might be really important for society but doesn't directly affect them, by and large most companies are silent most of the time,"" said Weihl, who left Facebook in 2018. 
ClimateVoice is launching as a volunteer effort but aims to raise funds and hire staff soon after launch. Weihl said it will seek to organize and amplify climate activism among tech employees to push executives to lobby on behalf of legislative efforts around climate. 
Workers have become a key constituency in the climate change debate, particularly at the biggest tech companies. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced more ambitious emissions targets after employees ultimately made their concerns publicly known.
Bruce Hahne resigned as a technical program manager at Google this month and criticized the company in a public letter for selling technology to the energy sector to more efficiently produce fossil fuels -- echoing concerns raised by workers at Amazon and Microsoft.
""We're dying by fire, and the Google Cloud oil and gas sales vertical is pouring on the gasoline,"" Hahne wrote.
Google respresentatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
ClimateVoice initially intends to advocate for legislation at the U.S. state and regional levels, instead of the U.S. Congress. The group could be useful in providing employees with a list of policy priorities to raise with their bosses, Hahne told Reuters. It could also help bring together workers at different companies, who could work together on proposed bills with less fear of management retaliation. 

""ClimateVoice is going to need to design sets of tactical behaviors that work well with cultures of the organizations, and that are safe,"" Hahne said.

The S&P BSE Sensex declined 1% to 40,749.17 as of 9:32 a.m. in Mumbai. The NSE Nifty 50 Index slipped 1.1%%. Markets were closed on Friday for a holiday.
India’s imports from China account for nearly 14% of total purchases from abroad, Mumbai-based brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt said in a note. Industries that are most exposed include pharmaceutical, automobiles, consumer durables, fertilizers and chemicals.
Crisil Ltd., a credit assessor and ratings company, expects Indian companies to be “severely” affected if delays of supplies and parts extend beyond three months.
Strategist View
“Sentiment is negative as investors are concerned about the impact of the coronavirus on global growth,” said Anita Gandhi, a Mumbai-based investment adviser at Arihant Capital Markets. “It will take some time to gauge the impact on us but most of the China export-dependent Indian companies could see pressure.”

1263,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2020 11:34PM ET</span>","Teck drops C$20.6 billion oil sands Frontier project, to take writedown","TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian miner Teck Resources Ltd has withdrawn an application to build its C$20.6 billion ($15.7 billion) Frontier oil sands mine in Alberta, days before the federal government was to decide on whether to approve a project opposed by environmentalists and indigenous groups.
Teck said on Sunday it would write down the C$1.13 billion ($852.12 million) carrying value of the project. The news was first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper.
The company released a letter by Teck Chief Executive Don Lindsay to Canada's environment minister, stating Teck was ""disappointed to have arrived at this point"".
The fate of the mine, which was first proposed in 2011, was expected to be decided next week in what had become a test of Canada's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and repair relations with the country's indigenous people.
At full capacity, the mine would have produced 260,000 barrels of crude oil per day, making it one of the largest in Alberta's carbon-intensive oil sands. 
""The growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved,"" Lindsay wrote in his letter. ""In that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project."" 
On Friday, the Canadian miner floated a potential exit from the oil sands and warned of the possible C$1.13 billion hit should Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government reject the Frontier bitumen mine.
The decision was a complicated one for Trudeau who made a 2019 election pledge to put Canada on the path to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 
But unhappiness with the government's energy and pipeline policy cost Trudeau's Liberals all their seats in Alberta, where the project was considered essential for employment and growth.
""The withdrawal of Teck's Frontier Mine application is more devastating news for the Canadian economy, especially for Albertans and indigenous people,"" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney tweeted on Sunday. 
""This decision is clearly the result of federal regulatory uncertainty and the current lawless opposition to resource development.""
In recent weeks, protesters have blocked railway lines in Ontario, Quebec and Alberta in solidarity with a British Columbia aboriginal band seeking to stop the construction of a gas pipeline over its land.
Trudeau's office said in a statement he spoke with Kenney on Sunday about Teck's decision, as well as the railway blockades, and ""reaffirmed the government of Canada's commitment to working with Alberta and the resource sector"" to create jobs.
Even if approved, the project would have still faced hurdles.
Teck had told the government that for it to build Frontier, it needed a pipeline to be built, a partner and favorable oil prices. 

In addition, the company told regulators it expected long-term oil prices exceeding $95 per barrel during most of Frontier's operations from 2026-2066 - a level they have not reached since 2014.

Investing.com - Asian markets slid on Monday morning, with South Korea’s KOSPI plunging more than 3% after the country raised its infectious-disease alert to the highest level after a 20-fold increase in cases.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.3% by 10:42 PM ET (02:42 GMT), while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.1%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.6%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.4%.
South Korea’s KOSPI plunged 3.2%. The number of infections in South Korea soared from just 30 to almost 800 in the past week, while at least seven people died from the virus.
The Bank of Korea will hold an emergency meeting this afternoon to discuss the virus impact, as some expect the central bank to reduce its benchmark rate to support the economy.
Meanwhile, the government is reviewing all possible measures, including an extra budget, Bloomberg reported citing local media.
The epidemic poses a “large concern that it will limit the trend of economic recovery started late last year,” First Vice Minister Kim Yong-beom said.
Kim noted that domestic consumption and exports to China have dropped due to the virus outbreak.
In other news, finance officials from the world's 20 biggest economies on Saturday called for a coordinated response to the coronavirus outbreak, which the International Monetary Fund predicted would pull down China's growth this year to 5.6% and cut 0.1% from global growth.
“But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted,” said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva at the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting."

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Saturday posted a 23% decrease in quarterly operating profit, while soaring prices in stock holdings such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) enabled the conglomerate to smash its old record for full-year earnings.
In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett defended Berkshire's foray into stocks, which comes amid a four-year drought since its last major acquisition that has left Berkshire sitting on $128 billion of cash.
Berkshire did step up repurchases of its own stock, buying back roughly $2.2 billion in the quarter. Repurchases totaled $5 billion for the full year.
""I am delighted with the increased commitment to share repurchases,"" said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests $13 billion, of which 13% is in Berkshire. ""It may be a very large arrow in Berkshire's quiver to increase intrinsic value on a per-share basis.""
Nonetheless, while the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units showed improvement, reinsurance operations weighed on operating results, and the Geico car insurer posted ""subpar performance"" as loss claims eclipsed premium growth, according to Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research.
""The big miss was on the insurance front, though energy and railroads were stronger,"" Seifert said. It will be interesting see the impact of coronavirus on freight traffic in the first quarter and beyond.""
Fourth-quarter operating profit fell to $4.42 billion, or approximately $2,720 per Class A share, from $5.72 billion, or about $3,484 per share.
Berkshire did not write down its 26.6% stake in Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC), which is struggling to rebound from years of cost-cutting amid changing consumer tastes, though its market value is well below the $13.8 billion carrying cost on Berkshire's balance sheet.
Net income, reflecting stock gains, totaled $29.16 billion, compared with a net loss of $25.39 billion a year earlier.
For all of 2019, net income totaled $81.42 billion, topping the record $44.94 billion for 2017, when Berkshire benefited from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate.
Such huge swings stem from an accounting rule requiring Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income.
Buffett wrote that companies whose stocks Berkshire owns are generating returns that are ""remarkable under any circumstances,"" especially compared with returns on bonds.
Apple soared 86% in 2019 and 31% in the fourth quarter alone, leaving Berkshire with a $73.7 billion year-end stake.

Berkshire's stock was a laggard in 2019, rising 11% compared with a 31.5% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends, in part reflecting the drag from the cash stake.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier has ruled himself out of a switch to European rival HSBC (L:HSBA), a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
Italy's biggest bank is set to announce he will remain part of the lender's plans, ending speculation Mustier was set to take the helm at HSBC after he emerged as a contender last week.
UniCredit declined to comment.
HSBC said last August it will appoint a new CEO within six to twelve months following the shock ouster of John Flint, with his interim replacement Noel Quinn the internal candidate and favorite for the role.
The news of Mustier's withdrawal will come as a boost for Quinn, who announced on Tuesday an overhaul of HSBC as he auditions for the permanent role under Chairman Mark Tucker.
Quinn announced HSBC would shed $100 billion in assets, shrink its investment bank and revamp its U.S. and European businesses in a drastic overhaul that will mean 35,000 jobs cut over three years.
Analysts and investors had criticized Tucker's decision not to appoint Quinn as he presented the new strategy.
Mustier arrived at UniCredit in mid-2016 to oversee a turnaround that has seen the bank slash costs and bad debts while also selling assets and new shares to boost capital."

RIYADH (Reuters) - Failure to reach a global deal on where and how much to tax digital giants such as Google (O:GOOGL), Amazon (O:AMZN) or Facebook (O:FB) would result in many digital tax regimes emerging all over the world, France's Finance Minister said on Sunday.
It would also likely trigger U.S. retaliatory tariffs, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters, underscoring Washington's determination to thwart tax rules planned by France and other countries if no global deal is reached.
Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a meeting of world financial leaders, Bruno Le Maire said the gathering had been very useful in establishing consensus on such global tax rules.
Finance ministers and central bankers from the world's 20 biggest economies, the G20, met in Riyadh for talks on economic issues, with digital taxation topping their two-day agenda.
Mnuchin said the issue was being addressed in negotiations with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and he hoped it could be resolved by the end of the year.
But he said Washington would strike back at the digital taxes passed by France and others if those efforts failed.
""We've been very consistent in saying we think the digital services tax is discriminatory in nature against digital companies, and specifically a handful of U.S. companies,"" he said. ""The president was clear that we were proceeding with ... reciprocal tariffs.""
France and the United States have declared a truce to allow the multilateral talks to reach a conclusion by year-end.
""For the first tine there is wide consensus among the G20 members on the necessity of having a new international taxation system,"" Le Maire said.
""We have to address the issue of digital companies making profits in many countries without any physical presence, which means without paying the due level of taxes,"" he said.
""And we also have to address the key question of minimum taxation and the risk of having a race to the bottom on taxation,"" he said.
The OECD wants to agree on technical details of such a tax by July.
""There is a consensus to build a solution by the end of 2020,"" Le Maire said, noting the alternative - no agreement - would create a proliferation of different tax systems making life more difficult for companies.
""Lets be clear - either we have at the end of 2020 an international solution... clearly in the interest of all countries and digital companies, or there is no solution and ... then it will be up the national taxes to enter into force,"" Le Maire said.
""Instead of having one single, simple solution, we would have many different digital taxes, all over the world.""

The United States, home to most of the digital giants, has been wary of committing to a solution on taxing them before a presidential election later this year.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Japanese finance minister Taro Aso criticized on Sunday a U.S. tax reform proposal that he said could undermine global efforts to agree new rules on taxing big tech companies.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) is developing rules to make digital companies pay tax where they do business, rather than where they register subsidiaries - a move that was broadly endorsed by finance leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) major economies on Sunday.
Yet the OECD efforts were stalled late last year by last-minute changes demanded by Washington, including a proposed ""safe harbor"" regime which critics say would let multinationals choose whether to abide by the new set of rules or stick to existing regulations.
""I told my counterparts that Japan is very concerned about the 'safe harbor' proposal,"" Aso told reporters after attending the G20 gathering.
""It would extremely diminish the regulatory effect of what we're trying to do. That is a view expressed by various countries,"" he said, joining a chorus of criticism by France and other nations over the U.S. proposal.
Many G20 officials view the United States as reluctant to deal with a potentially tricky political matter before the presidential election later this year.
It is rare for Japan to openly criticize the United States on economic policy, given the two countries' close defense ties.
The taxing of global digital firms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - and the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy - have figured prominently at the weekend gathering of G20 finance leaders in Riyadh.
In a communique issued after the meeting, finance leaders said they encouraged further progress in narrowing remaining differences towards reaching a consensus on the tax issue by end of 2020. The OECD says the measure could boost national tax revenues by a total of $100 billion a year."
1271,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",Buffett calls for more accountability for corporate directors,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday called on corporate America to make their boards of directors more accountable to shareholders and less beholden to chief executive officers, perhaps by reducing their pay and requiring that they buy more stock.
In his annual letter to  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) shareholders, Buffett said pay for outside directors has ""soared"" to levels that might threaten their independence, sometimes reaching $250,000 to $300,000 for two weeks work, while ""generous"" age limits ensure ""fabulous"" job security.
Buffett said this can make even ""independent"" directors resist challenging bad decisions by CEOs, especially in takeovers.
""When seeking directors, CEOs don't look for pit bulls,"" Buffett wrote. ""It's the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.""
He said one large American company he did not identify recently had eight directors who never bought its shares with their own money.
""I feel better when directors of our portfolio companies have had the experience of purchasing shares with their savings, rather than simply having been the recipients of grants,"" Buffett wrote.
Berkshire has more than 90 operating units such as the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurer, and Dairy Queen ice cream.
Its own 14-person board is no paragon of youth, with six directors -- including the 89-year-old Buffett -- over age 70 and three in their 90s.
And the voting influence of most Berkshire directors is limited because Buffett, considered by many among the world's greatest investors, controls nearly one-third of the voting power despite owning only about one-sixth of Berkshire's stock.
Still, no Berkshire director was paid more than $7,300 for their work at the company in 2018, a regulatory filing shows, though several including Buffett and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates are billionaires, and can afford it.
Buffett also said adding women to boards ""remains a work in progress."" Three Berkshire directors are women.
Buffett said he has been a director at 21 publicly-traded companies including  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO), Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) and Washington Post Co, and in all but two ""represented a substantial holding of stock.""

He has given up all directorships apart from Berkshire, one of several moves in recent years to reduce his workload.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday forcefully defended Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (N:BRKa) decision to invest heavily in stocks of companies such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) as he labors through a four-year drought since his last major acquisition of a company.
Buffett, 89, also used his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders to assure they should not worry about the future of the company, which is ""100% prepared"" for when he and 96-year-old Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are no longer around.
Berkshire also posted record full-year earnings of $81.42 billion, nearly twice the prior high from 2017, boosted by unrealized gains from its stock investments. Operating profit, however, fell 3% to $23.97 billion.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate ended the year with a $128 billion cash hoard, after repurchasing $2.2 billion of stock in the fourth quarter and $5 billion in 2019.
""I do think it's on the right path,"" said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh, which invests one-fourth of its assets in Berkshire. ""Its balance sheet is exactly the type of toolkit you'd like to leave a successor.""
Berkshire has more than 90 units employing 391,539 people, including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and See's candies; clothing and jewelry companies, and namesake utility and real estate brokerage businesses.
It also invests in such companies as  American Express  Co (N:AXP), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO).
Berkshire ended the year with a $128 billion cash hoard, having made no major acquisitions since paying $32.1 billion in January 2016 for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, and Buffett lamented his inability to find big companies to buy.
""The opportunities to make major acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare,"" he wrote.
Buffett's letters have grown shorter in recent years, with less humor and less discussion about the economy and investing.
James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst who rates Berkshire a ""buy,"" called Saturday's letter a missed opportunity to show how Berkshire, whose stock has trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) over the last decade, is undervalued.
""It felt much more businesslike and detached, and lost some of the wisdom that made it so entertaining,"" he said.
AMERICAN TAILWIND REVISITED
The record profit is largely the result of an accounting rule that Buffett urges investors to ignore, requiring Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income.
Buffett, whose $90.2 billion net worth makes him the world's fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine, said that while he still prefers buying whole companies, stocks are a better bet than low-yielding bonds.
He attributed that in part to the ""American Tailwind,"" or the economy's ability to grow despite roadblocks such as war, high inflation and financial panic.
""If something close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments,"" he wrote.
Buffett's comments surprised Stephen Dodson, who manages the Bretton Fund, which owns Berkshire shares.
""I was expecting him to say the market was expensive,"" Dodson said. ""He didn't even hint that.""
The cash stake has nonetheless been a drag for investors.
In 2019, Berkshire's stock rose 11% while the S&P 500 including dividends rose 31.5%, the biggest shortfall in a decade.
SUCCESSION
Buffett also used his letter to comfort investors that Berkshire will be in good hands after he leaves.
In 2018, Berkshire promoted Greg Abel, 57, and Ajit Jain, 68, to vice chairmen, giving them oversight of Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance operations, respectively, and freeing Buffett and Munger to focus on deploying capital.
Buffett also has portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler helping him buy stocks.
Combs, 49, on Jan. 1 also became Geico's chief executive.
""Charlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone,"" Buffett wrote. ""That's not exactly great news for us. But Berkshire shareholders need not worry: Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.""
He also said shareholders will be able to ask Abel and Jain questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 2, where Buffett and Munger normally do most of the talking.
""I'm comfortable with how Berkshire is moving up the next generation,"" said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a longtime Berkshire shareholder.
Buffett said his estate may need 12 to 15 years to dispose of his Berkshire stock, which is going to charities including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Berkshire stock will be ""a safe and rewarding investment"" during that time.
The disposal plan ""gives investors the ability to focus on everything else,"" said David Marcus, chief investment officer at Evermore Global Advisors, who personally owns Berkshire shares. ""If Buffett weren't the age that he is, it wouldn't matter."""

Japan's third-largest automaker has seen its profitability decline by more than half in the past two years, led by a series of quality-related issues.
In a statement, Honda Cars Philippines Inc said its production plant south of the capital Manila will cease operations next month. But automobile sales and after-sales services will continue through Honda's regional network. (https:// ""To meet Honda's customer needs in the Philippines for reasonably priced and good quality products, Honda considered efficient allocation and distribution of resources,"" the company said.
Production will focus on other hubs in Asia and Oceania, it added.
Honda Philippines' manufacturing plant, which has 650 employees and associates, started operations in 1992. It makes BR-V and City passenger cars catering to local demand.
Honda Philippines counts Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (PS:RCB) and a unit of conglomerate  Ayala Corp  (PS:AC) as its local partners.
The Philippines' automotive output is a minnow compared with its Southeast Asian peers, notably Thailand. A government tax incentive program launched in 2015 has failed to significantly raise the country's local auto production."

HOUSTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD), Scott Sheffield, on Thursday called on energy investors to sell shares or pull funding from companies that have rates of natural gas flaring.
The practice of burning off natural gas produced alongside more profitable oil has become a top issue for investors, who are focused on sustainability measures and already are frustrated by a decade of poor financial returns in oil and gas. Flaring has surged with U.S. oil output, but can worsen climate change by releasing carbon dioxide.
If producers in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, cannot drop flaring rates below 2% of gas produced by the first half of next year, when new pipelines would have come online, Sheffield asked investors in public shares, bonds or private equity firms to ""end up either not doing business or sell whatever you have in regard to that company.""
The idea, Sheffield said during an earnings call, came out of a late January workshop in Austin, Texas, coordinated between Columbia University and the University of Texas at Austin, which brought together producers, pipeline companies, policymakers, non-governmental organizations, academics and analysts to talk about Permian Basin flaring. The workshop was invitation-only, but Columbia plans to release a report on it.
Companies attending agreed to share best practices, better report data to state agencies in Texas and New Mexico and set flaring targets, Sheffield said.
""I think it's important to remove that black eye on the Permian Basin going forward,"" said Sheffield, who in November first called for companies to limit flaring.
Other executives that have spoken out against high flaring rates include Matt Gallagher, CEO of Parsley Energy and the head of Royal Dutch Shell's Permian Basin operations, Amir Gerges, who said this month that the region needs ""regulatory requirements that incentivize reduction in flaring.""
On Tuesday, one of Texas' oil and gas regulators defended flaring rates, which average around 5% in the Permian but also released a report naming companies with the worst records and said he would hold public meetings on the topic.
Several Permian Basin producers reported financial results this week, including Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO), which said it dropped its flaring rate to 1.6% last year from 3.6% in 2017.
“There's a lot of push, obviously, on the industry and from within the industry to continue to move that number down,” Concho CEO Tim Leach said on Wednesday."

Samsung Electronics, the world's top smartphone maker, said the floor where the infected employee worked would be shut down until the morning of Feb. 25.
""The company has placed colleagues who came in contact with the infected employee in self-quarantine and taken steps to have them tested for possible infection,"" Samsung said in a news release.
Samsung's factory in Gumi accounts for a small portion of its total smartphone production, and it makes high-end phones, mostly for the domestic market. Samsung produces most of its smartphones in Vietnam and India. 
Gumi is close to the city of Daegu, home to a church at the center of South Korea's largest coronavirus outbreak. 
South Korea said on Saturday that the number of people infected with the coronavirus in the country had more than doubled to 433. 

Samsung said production at its chip and display factories in other parts of South Korea would not be affected.

1278,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 22, 2020 04:02AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"
By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan
Investing.com - Financial markets found themselves at the mercy of coronavirus headlines once again this week.
But digging deeper in some market-moving events, the U.S. dollar saw a swift change of its narrative as weekly trading came to a close.
Amusement park icon Six Flags admitted that its thrill-ride business needs a major rethink.
And Hong Kong faces not just a dearth of visitors, but pessimistic locals.
Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. Dollar Gets a Gut Check
The U.S. dollar index surged earlier this week, setting it sights on the 100 handle, a level it has not breached in nearly three years. But its stumble on Friday has many debating whether the greenback's rally is sustainable.

For the majority of managers on Wall Street, the greenback's rally is on borrowed time, according to a Bank of America fund manager survey.
A net 54% of respondents surveyed in February said the dollar was overvalued, up one percentage point since the last survey and the second-highest reading since 2002, BofA said.
Concerns about the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on global growth has sparked a bid in the dollar as a safe-haven investment in recent weeks, according to the survey respondents.
The rise in the dollar caught Wall Street by surprise.
Toward the end of last year, many were betting on the dollar to falter in 2020 on expectations that easing U.S.-China trade tensions would support global growth, sparking a rebound in global economies, some of which sport unattractive negative rates (like the EU).
But the spread of the coronavirus and its potential impact on the global economy has undermined those bets.

The ratio of the MSCI US Index to the MSCI World Index, excluding the U.S., rose to a record high of 1.6, suggesting yield-starved investors view the U.S., and by extension the dollar, as the only game in town.
""Currencies are weakening on incoming bad data that leads to inflows into dollar assets,"" Ben Emons, global macro strategist at Medley Global Advisors, wrote.

Others agree and expect the dollar to continue racking up gains against its rivals, with the euro feared to add to recent losses. 
""Since data will most likely show the divergence between the eurozone and U.S. economies widening in the coming weeks, further losses are likely,"" said Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management.
2. Six Surrender Flags
Investors likely saw the big drop in shares of theme park operator Six Flags Entertainment (NYSE:SIX) (and the obligatory accompanying roller-coaster jokes). But given how double-digit percentage moves in stocks are common lately, the scope of the fundamental problems the company is facing might have been overlooked.
The company reported earnings on Thursday and the bottom line was a very unpleasant surprise.
Six Flags reported a loss of 13 cents per share, compared with expectations for a profit of 15 cents per share, according to analysts forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
It also announced it was slashing its dividend by 70% to 25 cents per share and that its chief financial officer was leaving
There are big problems with its project to open theme parks in China, as its partner in the country defaulted on payment obligations. There will be no revenue or income from China park developments in 2020, Six Flags said.
But even more concerning, its “base business” – the core (ahem, flagship) parks like Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags Great Adventure -- is struggling. Attendance, guest spending per capita and revenue were flat in 2019.
And this year the company predicts “operating cost headwinds, including higher wages and increased investment in the parks to improve the guest experience.”
All this is leading Six Flags to overhaul its strategy, with a new plan to be unveiled at its investor day on May 28.
Piling onto the pessimism today, S&P put its current BB credit rating for the company’s debt on review at CreditWatch negative. That could mean a downgrade if S&P isn’t convinced Six Flags can stop erosion in earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
But after all that there are already some betting the turnaround will be a success.
After Thursday’s plunge, shares closed up 2.3% Friday.
3. Hong Kong Ghost Town?
While supply-chain questions abound about mainland China and the effects of Covid-19, Hong Kong is providing an illustration on what can happen to a financial center during a possible pandemic.

Charles Schwab Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Sonders tweeted this week, illustrating the enormous plunge in daily visits to Hong Kong.
Citing a chart from Christophe Barraud, chief economist and strategist at Market Securities, which used preliminary data from the Hong Kong Tourist Board, the island is seeing just 3,000 people visit per day.
That’s a “nearly 99% drop from February last year when about (200,000) people visited per day,” Sonders tweeted.
That may not be affecting financial market activity as much, with many in the sector living there or able to meet and work remotely. But the impact on the businesses that provide services to financial workers will be huge.
Looking at a longer-term picture, Sonders tweeted a chart showing the rise in pessimism about Hong Kong’s economy.
The chart from Statista showed that the percentage of people who think the local Hong Kong economy is getting worse jumped to 79% in 2019 from 23% in 2006.
Those who think the economy is getting better fell to 12% from 63%.
The percentage of those who think it’s about the same dipped slightly to 7% from 9%."

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has found debris in the fuel tanks of dozens of undelivered 737 MAX jets amid ongoing inspections as the Chicago-based planemaker struggles to restore the trust of airlines and the wider public in the grounded fleet.
Boeing found debris in the fuel tanks of about 35 aircraft, a company spokesman confirmed on Friday. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that more than 50% of the undelivered 737 MAX jets inspected thus far have had debris found in them.
Several more planes are still awaiting inspection.
""We are taking steps to make sure we eliminate FOD (foreign object debris) from any and all aircraft. This is unacceptable and won't be tolerated on any Boeing aircraft when it's delivered to the customer,"" Boeing said in an emailed statement.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), when asked about the debris, said it could not confirm Boeing's numbers.
An FAA spokesman said the agency was aware that Boeing was conducting a voluntary inspection for FOD, adding that FAA had increased its surveillance based on initial inspection reports and would take further action based on the findings.
The findings of debris were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Boeing has come under scrutiny since two crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft, in October 2018 and March 2019, killed 346 people. The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide last March after the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Foreign object debris, an industrial term for rags, tools, metal shavings and other materials left behind by workers during production, has been a quality-control issue for various Boeing aircraft, such as its KC-46 tankers.
This week, an internal memo seen by Reuters showed that Boeing found debris that could pose potential safety risks in the fuel tanks of several 737 MAX aircraft in storage and waiting to be delivered to airlines. 

The New York Times reported on Friday that federal prosecutors investigating Boeing are examining whether the planemaker misled the FAA while it was seeking approval for the 737 MAX.

Boeing said it was cooperating with the U.S Department of Justice investigation. 
The prosecutors have questioned several Boeing employees in recent months, focusing on whether Mark Forkner, a top pilot at the company, intentionally lied to the regulator about the nature of new flight control software on the jet, according to the report.
A lawyer for Forkner did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Forkner had said he might have unintentionally misled regulators, in a series of internal messages from 2016 that became public in October.
The messages appeared to have been the first publicly known observations that the MCAS anti-stall system behaved erratically during testing before the aircraft entered service.
The comments by Forkner, who has since left Boeing, were among those pinpointed by U.S. lawmakers in hearings in Washington as evidence that Boeing knew about problems with flight control software before two crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft in October 2018 and March 2019 killed 346 people.
Bloomberg News reported late on Friday that the planemaker had put three employees who worked with the former chief technical pilot of the 737 MAX on administrative leave, with the employees being notified of the action last week.

Boeing shares closed down 1.8% at $330.38.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 08:34PM ET</span>",Fund managers look for value in high-priced consumer sector,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Expectations that spending on items ranging from hotels to clothing will continue to rise have helped make consumer discretionary stocks the most expensive sector in the S&P 500.
Now fund managers are looking for ways to profit without getting burned, if a pullback comes on the back of worries about the coronavirus and other factors.
The consumer discretionary sector now trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 24.2, well ahead of the 23.7 forward valuation of the technology sector, according to Refinitiv data.
Higher prices for consumer discretionary stocks come at a time when the broad S&P 500 trades at a forward P/E of 18.9, its most expensive valuation since 2002, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research. 
High expectations will be tested in the coming week as companies ranging from Macy's Inc (N:M) to Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) to Caesar's Entertainment Corp (O:CZR) report fourth quarter earnings, giving investors a broad look at where consumers are choosing to spend their money and if there are any signs of a slowdown due to the coronavirus, now known as COVID-19. 
Sellers on Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which constitutes about 26% of the sector, are already bracing for product shortages due to the spread of the virus among Chinese workers. 
At the same time, consumer companies are among the most likely to be affected by rising U.S. wages. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicts wages will grow at a rate of 3.5% this year, putting additional margin pressure on companies that employ lower-wage workers. Average hourly earnings rose 3.1% in January compared with January 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
""We are now a consumer-focused economy and anything that affects the consumer will spread out to touch other sectors as well,"" said Moustapha Mounah, a research associate at James Investment Research. ""We are looking for companies that can grow their market share without sacrificing their margins due to wage pressures.""
As a result, Mounah is focusing on sectors such as homebuilders and discount retailers, both of which should benefit from low interest rates and the ability to pass on higher prices to their customers. At the same time, he is shying away from restaurants and department stores that have high fixed-costs and slim margins. 
Overall, sales at clothing stores fell 3.1% in January, the biggest drop since March 2009, according to the Commerce Department, while overall core retail sales were unchanged. 
Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes, said he is looking at discount retailers that have a strong perception of value as part of their brand identities, which will allow them to maintain high revenues even if the broad economy starts to dip.
""You are paying for the perceived safety and continued strength of the U.S. consumer,"" he said. By focusing on companies that are taking market share, investors can avoid the risk of an earnings or revenue disappointment, he said. 
Overall, consumer discretionary companies are expected to increase their earnings by an average of 7.2% in 2020, a growth rate trailing projected gains in energy, healthcare, and technology stocks, according to Refinitiv data. For the year to date, the sector is up 6.2%, compared with a 3.8% gain in the broad S&P 500. 
Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Avalon Advisors, said the high valuation of the consumer discretionary sector was a result of Amazon's outsized weight, with the company's 73 forward multiple bringing up the valuation of the sector overall. As a result, he is focusing more on companies in the sector like Macy's and cruise line operator Carnival Corp (N:CCL) that trade at multiples of nine or lower. 

""It's surprising to me that growth stocks have outperformed value by so much,"" he said. ""At some point once the coronavirus outbreak passes we should get an acceleration in the economy and that should finally be the impetus for value stocks to catch up.""

On Thursday, Morgan Stanley entered into a deal to buy E*Trade, the biggest acquisition by a major Wall Street bank since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
E*Trade has been the subject of M&A speculation for some time, especially after  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp said it would buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp last year.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the Marlboro maker adequately disclosed the risks to its shareholders when it spent $12.8 billion in 2018 for a 35% stake in the start-up, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Friday.
The SEC has issued subpoenas to Juul and the e-cigarette maker has responded, according to the person familiar with the matter. 
Juul has turned over documents including correspondence with Altria and financial projections Juul shared with Altria before the deal, the person said.
Altria has recorded $8.6 billion in impairment charges since investing in Juul in December 2018, bringing the value of its investment to $4.2 billion by end of 2019.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 07:43PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo to pay $3 billion to U.S., admits pressuring workers in fake-accounts scandal","By Chris Prentice, Pete Schroeder and Imani Moise
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) has agreed to pay $3 billion to resolve criminal and civil probes into fraudulent sales practices and has admitted to pressuring employees in a fake-accounts scandal, U.S. officials said on Friday, wrapping up one of the last major investigations looming over the bank.
Wells Fargo will pay the penalties to the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission and enter into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement during which the San Francisco-based bank will continue to cooperate with any ongoing government investigations, Justice Department officials said.
As part of the deal, Wells Fargo admitted that between 2002 and 2016 it pressured employees to meet ""unrealistic sales goals that led thousands of employees to provide millions of accounts or products to customers under false pretenses or without consent, often by creating false records or misusing customers' identities,"" the department said in a statement.
In a statement, Charles Scharf, Wells Fargo's new chief executive, described the past conduct as ""reprehensible."" Wells Fargo is the fourth-largest U.S. lender.
""This case illustrates a complete failure of leadership at multiple levels within the bank. Simply put, Wells Fargo traded its hard-earned reputation for short-term profits, and harmed untold numbers of customers along the way,"" Nick Hanna, U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said in a statement.
Top managers within Wells Fargo's Community Bank division were aware of the ""unlawful and unethical"" practices as early as 2002, and many of the practices were referred to as ""gaming"" within the bank, the Justice Department said. 
The agreement resolves the civil and criminal liability regarding Wells Fargo's fake-accounts scandal.
About $500 million of the penalties will go to the SEC to be distributed to investors to settle charges that the bank committed fraud by misleading investors about its sales practices, an SEC official said on a call with reporters about the resolutions settlement.
Settling the multi-agency investigation marked an important milestone for Scharf, who joined the company from BNY Mellon in September shortly after the third anniversary of the scandal.
""We are committing all necessary resources to ensure that nothing like this happens again, while also driving Wells Fargo forward,"" Scharf said. 
'GHOST IN A MACHINE'
Watchdog group Public Citizen criticized the deal, saying it does not go far enough.
""Any resolution for Wells Fargo's massive, management-directed misconduct must hold individuals to account. We know many of the crimes, and we know that real executives, not some ghost in a machine, committed them,"" said Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate with the Washington-based group.
The deal does not preclude civil or criminal charges against individuals, Justice Department officials told reporters. 
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, wrote on Twitter, ""This is a small step in the right direction, but it's not a substitute for holding senior executives individually accountable - and bringing criminal charges against them if the evidence justifies it.""
The probe examined activities in Wells Fargo's community bank unit, with Justice Department citing pressure coming from the division's leadership. 
In a rare move last month, a U.S. bank regulator charged several former Wells Fargo executives for their roles in the scandal. That included a settlement with former CEO John Stumpf and civil charges against Carrie Tolstedt, former head of the community bank unit.
""Ms. Tolstedt acted appropriately and in good faith at all times, and the effort to scapegoat her is both unfair and unfounded,"" her lawyer Enu Mainigi said on Friday.
The Justice Department inquiry was seen by analysts and investors as a key hurdle the bank had to clear before it could focus on its growth strategy, which includes convincing the Federal Reserve to remove an unprecedented growth restriction placed on Wells Fargo's balance sheet until it proves it has fixed its risk management and controls.
Wells Fargo had already paid out more than $4 billion in fines and penalties related to the scandal since 2016. Internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo's major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank. 
The U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hold three hearings on Wells Fargo's conduct next month.

Over the past three years, Wells Fargo has taken various steps to fix its issues and rebuild trust with customers, investors and regulators. They include changes to its board, centralizing risk teams and hiring an external chief executive. However, ongoing reputation issues and unresolved legal matters have weighed on the bank's stock price and profitability, which have lagged peers since 2016.

1285,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 05:34PM ET</span>",Hedge Funds Shrug Off Oil’s Rebound With Bets on Further Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds are bracing for more trouble in the oil market, even after crude rebounded for a second week on hopes the coronavirus outbreak’s threat to economic growth is waning.
Bets against West Texas Intermediate crude increased by 11% to the highest in four months during the week ended Feb. 18, data released Friday showed. That puts oil short-selling at more than triple the level at the start of the year.
“Everyone is still trying to figure out what’s going to happen with the coronavirus,” said Mark Waggoner, president of commodities brokerage Excel Futures. “Under normal circumstances, they would be buying but there’s fears the virus could expand.”
News of the epidemic that began in China, the world’s largest energy buyer, sent oil prices in New York on a nosedive below $50 a barrel this month from more than $65 in early January. Crude has since risen to around $53 but concerns are lingering and futures stumbled anew on Friday.
Shifting infection tallies in China are eroding public trust in official numbers, and virus cases are spreading in Japan, South Korea and the Middle East. In the U.S., a key gauge of business activity dropped to the lowest since October 2013 as the outbreak hits supply chains and makes firms hesitant to place orders.
Money managers’ WTI net-long position, or the difference between bullish and bearish bets, dropped 22% to 95,536 contracts, the lowest since October, according to data released Friday by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Long-only wagers fell 6.7%."
1286,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 05:33PM ET</span>",Stock Bulls Just Got a Wake-Up Call in a World of Confusion,"(Bloomberg) -- If complacency was the charge, the market just delivered its punishment.
As the coronavirus spreads and U.S. business activity takes a hit, the S&P 500 Index notched its first weekly decline since January. The yield on 30-year Treasuries dropped to record lows, gold rose to seven-year highs, volatility markets woke up.
Bonds finally got the attention of stock bulls as key portions of the U.S. curve flashed traditional signs of a brewing downturn -- again.
All told, this is a mild setback for stock traders who’ve been pumping up markets to records.
The more pressing questions: Should they heed warnings on global growth ostensibly sounded by their fixed-income peers? Are the defensive strategies that have benefited from those very fears looking expensive?
Abi Oladimeji has one answer.
“Although investors are aware of the need for caution because of the downside risks, once you look beyond that, you look around and you see significant monetary policy stimulus,” said the chief investment officer at Thomas Miller Investment Ltd. in London. “Long-duration trades, from a multi-asset portfolio standpoint, are a hedge against downside risk in equities.”
In this view, investors are largely keeping their risk-on exposures but hedging them with bonds. The Federal Reserve is standing by if risks from the virus spill over to domestic shores. The Goldilocks-lite scenario in a liquidity-driven world is largely intact -- even if the virus undercuts output in the coming months.
At  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management, the multi-asset team’s favored exposure reflects the mixed sentiment in markets now. While it’s still optimistic about equities, especially the tech sector, the fund is also positive on consumer staples and gold.
“People were caught a little flat-footed with the news of coronavirus and the interruption to growth in China and how that then emanates into growth in the rest of the world,” said strategist Brian Jacobsen. “Any weakness that we see in the economic data coming from the coronavirus effect is likely to be short-lived and we could see a snapback.”
Jacobsen is mulling a bet on a steeper yield curve based on the view that global stress has exacerbated declines in longer-dated yields beyond what’s warranted by economic fundamentals.
Investors in one corner of the stock market are faced with an allocation conundrum that’s deepening.
The flattening yield curve has translated into epic gains for equities with fast earnings growth, which are dubbed growth equities and seen as long-duration assets. By contrast, value shares -- many of which are acutely tied to the economic cycle -- are getting hit. That has pushed the valuation of growth over value to the highest since the dot-com bubble. With billions invested in these strategies, there’s a risk of a disruptive rotation.
No wonder then that stretched multiples spurred Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. this week to call for a rotation in favor of the beleaguered value strategy.
“The last time we got to these levels, the bubble burst and a 50%+ global bear market began,”  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). strategists led by Robert Buckland wrote in a note, referring to the dot-come era. But “this could get worse before it gets better,” they said.
There were incipient signs of a shift this week, with tech posting the worst performance among sectors as bond-like stocks from utilities to consumer staples beat the pack. Minimum-volatility stocks, with tend to behave like bonds, outperformed the benchmark as borrowing costs plunged.
Whatever happens, all signs suggest stock investors will be living with the epic bond bull market for a good while yet. Fixed-income funds could see $350 billion of inflows in 2020, exceeding an already strong $204 billion in 2019, Bank of America estimated based on trends so far this year.
It helps explain why yields on investment-grade and high-yield companies are trading at multi-year lows and suggests that credit investors are still bullish about the outlook for Corporate America’s cash flows. That’s another reason why stock managers can be sanguine right now.
“There are growth concerns, but they are not significant concerns at the minute,” Thomas Miller’s Oladimeji said. “The bit that we don’t know or nobody knows is what the overall impact of the COVID-19 will be. So our approach is to look at hedging in various guises.”"

Investing.com – The S&P closed above the lows of day on Friday, but was unable to prevent its first weekly loss in three weeks as investors fretted over the coronavirus’ impact on global growth.
The S&P 500 fell 1.05%, Nasdaq Composite fell 1.79% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.78%.
With the spread of the coronavirus appearing to have picked up pace outside of China, traders were forced to consider whether the impact of the virus will be worse than feared.
South Korea recorded 100 new infections, the World Health Organization said Iran now has its first case of the illness and U.S. officials confirmed 34 cases of novel coronavirus in the country.
In China, meanwhile 800 new cases were reported overnight, taking the total to 75,000 confirmed cases and the death toll above 2,000.
Tech and energy were the worst hit on worries about a longer-than-expected disruptions to global supply chains and weaker Chinese oil demand.
Pacing the declines in tech, chip stocks fell 3%, pressured sharp decline in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU).
Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) and Deere (NYSE:DE), however, bucked the trend on quarterly results that topped estimates.
Dropbox soared 20% as CEO Drew Houston said the company would turn a profit by the end of the year, following better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
Deere, meanwhile, climbed 7% after topping estimates on both the top and bottom lines, with CEO John May touting optimism that weakness in the U.S. farm sector was reaching a bottom.
On the economic front, the U.S. services sector unexpectedly contracted this month, raising fears about the strength of the overall economy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks sold off on Friday as a spike in new coronavirus cases in China and other countries and as data showing U.S. business activity stalled in February fueled investors' fears about the economy.
Declines on Friday were led by heavyweights  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) for a second straight day.
The S&P technology index (SPLRCT) dropped 2.4%. Chipmakers, with strong ties to China for revenue, also fell sharply, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) falling 3%.
China reported a jump in new cases on Friday, while South Korea became the latest hot spot with 100 new cases and more than 80 people tested positive for the virus in Japan.
""It's creating a wild card,"" for companies and others, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""Going into a weekend not so long after the stock market was hitting highs, people are taking some money off the table.""
The impact could extend beyond the first quarter, he said.
Apple (O:AAPL) earlier this week warned on sales due to the impact of the virus outbreak.
The worries pushed up Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index (VIX), and caused investors to seek safe-haven assets.
Gold and bond prices rose, while defensive equity sectors - utilities, real estate and staples - all rose.
The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' index of services sector activity dropped to its lowest level since October 2013, signalling a contraction for the first time since 2016. The manufacturing sector also clocked its lowest reading since August.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 262.56 points, or 0.9%, to 28,957.42, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 39.79 points, or 1.18%, to 3,333.44 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 189.39 points, or 1.94%, to 9,561.57.
Hopes of monetary easing by major central banks had propelled the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) to all-time highs earlier this week, but the indexes are on course for their first weekly decline in three weeks.
Among other stocks, Dropbox Inc (O:DBX) jumped after it raised its outlook for operating margin, and Deere & Co (N:DE) rose after an unexpected rise in first-quarter profit.
Sprint Corp (N:S) climbed 5.7% as it announced new merger terms with T-Mobile US (O:TMUS) that would reduce the stake of major Sprint shareholder SoftBank. T-Mobile shares dipped 0.9%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 54 new lows.

Investing.com – ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) fell for the second session in a row as Wall Street postulated that its disappointing quarterly numbers weren’t a blip.
Shares dropped 3.6% Friday.
The broadcast and media company reported a net loss and missed earnings expectations by a wide margin yesterday, sending shares down sharply.
Guidance was also an unpleasant surprise. The company said it predicts earnings of $5.15 to $5.50 per share, well shy of the S&P Capital IQ consensus of $5.97 per share.
  Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) resumed coverage of the stock today and gave it an underweight rating and a price target of $25, about $3 from where it stands now.
The weak guidance and big fourth-quarter miss means the credibility of the company’s management is “irreparably damaged for the time being,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Steven Cahall wrote in a note.
ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish admitted yesterday the company faced “a significant set of merger-related items that were a headwind for expenses and cash flow” and was in a transitional period.
The company is looking to focus on streaming through this year.
It is planning on launching a new service combining free and paid services of CBS, programming from brands including MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and BET as well as films from the Paramount movies studio, Reuters reported last week."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former hedge fund manager Philip Falcone has been sued for more than $65.8 million after he allegedly defaulted on a series of loans and improperly sold some of the underlying collateral, including an Andy Warhol painting.
In papers filed on Friday with the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Melody Business Finance LLC said Falcone and several business affiliates have reneged on their obligations to repay the loans, which date from 2013 to 2017.
Melody said Falcone has cited obligations to other creditors, including New York's attorney general and New York City, for his inability to repay the loans or turn over the collateral, which also includes millions of dollars in jewelry.
Falcone previously ran Harbinger Capital Partners, which once oversaw $26 billion of assets.
He is now chief executive of New York-based HC2 Holdings Inc, which has businesses in construction, marine services and several other sectors. HC2 is not a defendant.
Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing Falcone, said in an statement: ""This is a personal dispute without merit. We will fight this.""
According to court papers, the pledged collateral also included works by Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Camille Pissarro, as well as several Warhols.
Melody said Falcone mentioned last fall that he sold a Warhol and a painting by Japan's Yayoi Kusama that were among the collateral at Christie's.
In April 2017, Alabama-based Harbert Management Corp, which had sponsored Harbinger, reached a $40 million settlement with the New York attorney general's office for nonpayment of taxes.
Then in September 2018, an offshore hedge fund firm once led by Falcone agreed to pay $30 million to resolve New York state and city tax claims.
Falcone agreed in 2013 to a five-year industry ban related to Harbinger, including for favoring some investors over others and borrowing $113 million to pay personal taxes.

The case is Melody Business Finance LLC v Falcone et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651155/2020.

Investing.com - EBay is looking to offload its classified-ads business, with several suitors believed to have expressed an interest, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was up 2% on the news.
Its classifieds business, which could fetch about $10 billion, has been under strategic review over the past year, with eBay considering a range of options including a sale, spinoff or joint venture. 
TPG and Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Naspers and Axel Springer SE have recently expressed interest in the classified-ads business, according to the report.
The review was borne out of pressure from two activist hedge funds, Elliott Management and Starboard Value, who urged the company to sell its assets and cut costs to turn around performance.
Elliott previously said eBay) shares could be worth $55 to $63 by the end of 2020 if the company adopted its recommended measures, including asset disposals. 
""It is critical to recognize that eBay's sustained underperformance is not due to a lack of potential or a poor end-market. Instead, we believe that eBay) has missed a number of actionable growth opportunities while distracted by non-core endeavors,"" wrote Elliott Management partner Jesse Cohn. ""These have been meaningful financial disappointments in their own right, but the larger cost was the diversion of attention from Marketplace."""
1294,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 02:19PM ET</span>",Timberland sees eco-green with slower delivery speeds,"By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - Outdoor apparel retailer Timberland is testing online shoppers' willingness to help the environment by slowing down delivery as Amazon.com (O:AMZN) drives retailers toward pricier, more polluting one-day shipping.
New Hampshire-based Timberland, part of VF Corp (N:VFC), since August has offered to plant a tree every time customers choose to have their orders delivered in 4-8 days versus the standard 3 days.
Customers hit the brakes on more than 18% of all Timberland orders during the holiday season's Black Friday to Cyber Monday shopping spike. Acceptance has averaged about 14% and resulted in about 55,000 tree plantings so far.
The effort, part of the retailer's commitment to plant 50 million trees by 2025, comes as shippers are under pressure to reduce transportation-related emissions that contribute to extreme weather, higher temperatures and rising sea levels.
""Hopefully it's a step toward making a larger impact,"" Tracy Smith, Timberland's vice president for North America, told Reuters.
The race to deliver everything from televisions to toothpaste in one day could upend the emissions reductions that come from replacing individual car trips to the store with deliveries from a single truck. Experts say that fast deliveries require more trips with cars, vans and climate-damaging airplanes.
Timberland charges for fast shipping, an option less than 5% of its customers choose.
It did not quantify the cost savings from its tree-planting program. Experts said switching from 3-day delivery to a slower service could cut a retailer's shipping costs by roughly 20% and create a halo of goodwill.
""Not only are you saving money, you're being the good guy,"" said Robert Passikoff, founder of Brand Keys, a marketing consultancy.
Timberland's campaign is in line with shifting attitudes, said Passikoff, who polls tens of thousands of consumers each year. Apparel shoppers are becoming less interested in delivery speed and more interested in sustainability, he said.
Amazon.com has committed to putting 10,000 zero-emission electric vans on the road by 2021 and founder Jeff Bezos this week committed $10 billion to curb climate change. Meanwhile, the company is using more airplanes, the most polluting mode of transportation.
The world's biggest online retailer is quietly encouraging shoppers to slow down deliveries. It offers $1 credits toward music or other digital purchases if shoppers choose ""no-rush"" shipping.
Amazon declined to comment on how many customers choose that slower shipping option."

The global freight industry has been hard-hit by uncertain demand and crews' health concerns following the outbreak of the deadly virus in China, leading airlines and freight firms to scale back services, causing delivery delays and mounting backlogs.
Starting on Feb. 25, DSV plans to operate flights between Shanghai and Huntsville thrice weekly using the firm's Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747-8 freighter plane, it said in a statement.
""Due to the risk of spreading of the coronavirus (COVID-19), multiple airlines have either suspended or reduced the number of flights to and from mainland China,"" it said.
Crew on DSV's plane would rest in South Korea before flying to Shanghai and would virtually not disembark the plane while in Shanghai before returning to the United States with cargo.
""By doing it this way we can safely have this setup,"" Flemming Nielsen, executive vice president, told Reuters.
Last week DSV said the coronavirus was squeezing air and sea freight capacity, but that it was still possible to ship goods on airplanes to countries neighboring China and fly them out from there.
DSV said it estimates capacity has shrunk by 5,000 tons a day due to the suspension of flights to China."

The S&P 500 slipped 0.83%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.51% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.72%.
More than 800 new Covid-19 cases were reported in China overnight, taking the total to 75,000 confirmed cases and the death toll above 2,000. Outside mainland China, meanwhile, infections continue to rise.

(Reuters) - Developers of self-driving cars are amping up criticism of a California reporting requirement on test data, saying the data could mislead, as the state prepares to release the latest results for 2019.
Companies such as General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cruise and startup Aurora have said the metric, called disengagements, is not an accurate or relevant way to measure their technical progress, even though it is widely used to do just that.
The debate is taking on more importance amid delays in the rollout of self-driving vehicles and concerns over a lack of regulation and the prospects for profitability for the companies that make such vehicles.
The focus on disengagements -- when a human driver must take manual control from a self-driving system -- and the backlash from self-driving companies have been growing since the California Department of Motor Vehicles began releasing annual disengagement reports five years ago.
California requires all companies testing self-driving vehicles on public roads to submit an annual report on disengagements and what caused them, ""written in plain language.""
In 2018, the companies with the most miles between disengagements were Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo and Cruise. Companies with the greatest number of disengagements were Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER).
In a February 2019 blog post, Waymo wrote that ""the key to self-driving technology safely improving and scaling is through a robust breadth of experience and scenario testing, represented by a wider array of data points beyond disengagement alone.""
In the same post, Waymo noted its disengagement rate in 2018 dropped 50% from the previous year, while miles between disengagements nearly doubled.
Self-driving companies say the disengagement data can draw unfair comparisons between companies and their self-driving technology.
Aurora co-founder Chris Urmson, who previously headed Waymo's self-driving program, wrote last month that ""these numbers mean little when there's no clear definition of what constitutes a disengagement.""
Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt expressed similar concerns in a blog post last month, adding:
""The general public and regulators deserve hard, empirical evidence that an (autonomous vehicle) has performance that is super-human"" -- that is, better than the average human driver -- if the deployment of that technology is to have ""a positive overall impact on automotive safety and public health."""

""Despite the HP board's intention to deny shareholders the chance to choose for themselves, we will press ahead with our previously announced tender offer and electing our slate of highly qualified director candidates,"" Xerox said.
It raised its offer earlier this month by $2 to $24 per share, following several rejections of its previous buyout offers by HP.
HP on Thursday said the implementation of the stockholder rights plan, which has a one-year expiration period, aims to stop investors from amassing more than 20% stake in the company.
That leaves Xerox with one realistic alternative for its takeover plans. It will have to go ahead with its plans to replace HP's board with its own nominees in a shareholder vote during the latter's upcoming annual meeting.
Xerox said in January it plans to nominate 11 independent candidates to HP's board.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A powerful surge in the dollar threatens to magnify the pain for companies and nations already struggling with the economic fallout of the coronavirus.
The U.S. dollar index has jumped 3.5% this year, taking the greenback to its highest level since 2017 and making it the best performer of all global currencies year-to-date.
(Graphic: King Dollar dominates - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2338/2306/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
The rally is being fueled by investors pouring money into U.S. stocks and bonds amid expectations that the country will be less vulnerable to the economic fallout from the coronavirus, which already threatens to dent China's growth rate and push Japan and the eurozone into recession.
Investors seeking a comparatively safe place to put their cash amid uncertainty over the virus' trajectory and economic impact are also piling into the dollar. That effect has been heightened in recent weeks as concerns over Japan's economy have weighed on the yen, traditionally a popular destination for nervous investors.
Meanwhile, though yields on U.S. Treasuries have dipped, they continue to exceed those offered by other developed countries, increasing the dollar's allure to income-seeking investors.
(Graphic: 10-year Treasury/10-year Bund yield spread - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2337/2305/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
""You get some of the best growth in the developed world, plus a yield,"" said Clifton Hill, global macro portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management, which oversees $101 billion in assets.
Hill came into the year expecting a trade deal between the United States and China to benefit a wide range of assets around the world, but the strengthening dollar has pushed him to shift his view.
He is now betting the buck will rise against a range of Asian currencies including the Korean won and Thai baht, and positioned for a decline in various commodity prices, which tend to weaken when the dollar rises.
(Graphic: Surging dollar - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2336/2304/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
A stronger greenback is an unwelcome development for U.S. multinationals because it makes it more expensive for them to convert foreign earnings back into dollars.
Currency headwinds accounted for $11.55 billion in collective losses for North American companies in the third quarter of 2019, according to treasury and financial management firm Kyriba. Companies such as Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Apple (O:AAPL) have mentioned the strong dollar as a drag on their earnings.
""If we really start to see the dollar gain traction ... that could potentially mean less fuel to sustain the rally we have seen in stocks,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.
Companies in the materials and technology sectors are among the most exposed to currency headwinds, with around 50% of the corporations in both sectors deriving the greater part of their revenues from abroad, an analysis of Russell 1000 companies by Bespoke Investment Group showed.
By contrast, only around 5% of the companies in the real estate and utilities sectors receive the majority of their revenue from overseas, the firm said.
At the same time, the dollar's strength is likely to increase the burden on developing countries, especially those more exposed to the economic effects of China's coronavirus-led slowdown.
Total dollar-denominated debt held by emerging markets stood at $6.4 trillion as of the third quarter, according to the Institute of International Finance. That debt becomes more difficult for countries to service when the dollar rises.
(Graphic: Emerging markets total dollar-denominated debt - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2240/2208/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
On the other hand, a strong dollar will likely help the eurozone and Japan, as it pushes down their currencies. A weaker currency helps countries' exporters by making their products more competitive abroad and makes it easier for central banks to spur inflation.
But the rising dollar's potentially salutary effects on some foreign economies are unlikely to sit well with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly complained that other countries are benefiting from a strong dollar at the expense of the United States.

1310,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 09:48AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Lower as Fed Officials Damp Rate Hopes,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Wall Street fell at the opening on Friday, as concerns about the spread of the coronavirus outside China, coupled with upbeat comments from Federal Reserve officials, combined to deter bulls.
By 9:45 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 177 points, or 0.6%, at 28,996. The S&P 500 was down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.0%.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC earlier that hopes for a rate cut due to the Covid-19 outbreak were overblown.
“There’s a high probability that the coronavirus will blow over as other viruses have, be a temporary shock and everything will come back,” Bullard said.
Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic – who isn’t a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee this year - had also said cutting rates isn’t his central case scenario right now, citing the ongoing strength of the labor market in particular. Earlier this week, Minnesota Fed President Neel Kashkari, a noted dove who does have a FOMC vote this year, had said he expects rates to stay on hold for “three months, six months, even longer.”
Those comments are at odds with recent developments in the bond markets, which have pushed the Fed-sensitive two-year Treasury yield down as far as 1.38%, well below the current target range for fed funds of 1.50%-1.75%. 
Irrespective of the Fed’s reaction function, concerns about the virus’ impact on the world economy have returned as the number of reported cases in South Korea more than doubled this week. Developments in Korea may give a more reliable indication of how easy – or hard – it will be to contain if it reaches the general population in the U.S. and Europe.
Among individual stocks, agricultural machinery maker Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) outperformed, rising 7.9% after posting quarterly earnings nearly one-third above expectations. Deere said confidence among U.S. farmers, its core customer base, had improved as a consequence of the U.S.-China trade truce, but was still subdued.
Sprint (NYSE:S) stock jumped 6.1% to a six-year high after the revision of its merger deal with T-Mobile gave Sprint’s free shareholders a pass. While major shareholder Softbank (OTC:SFTBF) will get a smaller share of the combined company (24% compared to 27% under the original deal), Sprint’s other shareholders will still to receive the original exchange ratio.
T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock fell 0.6%.
Elsewhere, Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) stock was up 2.5%, after a Business Insider report claimed that Uber (NYSE:UBER) wants to move 38,000 employees onto the system.
Risk aversion shot through other markets too, as U.S. crude oil futures fell 2.2% to $52.72 a barrel, while gold futures hit their highest in over seven years, undismayed by the Fed comments downplaying hopes of lower rates. Gold rose 1.5% to $1,644.75 an ounce.
The dollar, meanwhile, continued its surge against emerging market currencies, although it lost ground against both the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen and sterling. "

In a note examining the potential impact on stocks of changes to recycling methods,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts said the likes of Broomfield, Colorado-based Ball and Philadelphia-based Crown Holdings Inc (NYSE:CCK) could get a boost as consumers look to move away from harder-to-recycle plastic.
As makers of ethylene and plastics, the likes of Dow and   LyondellBasell Industries   NV (NYSE:LYB) may see downside risk from tighter recycling regulations, while plastic packagers such as Berry Global Group Inc (NYSE:BERY) and   Sealed Air   Corporation (NYSE:SEE) could face headwinds if recycling rates remain low, the analysts wrote.
“Aluminum is infinitely recyclable, and generally collected and recycled at a higher rate than PET bottles,” the  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts wrote. Global aluminum producer   Alcoa   Corp (NYSE:AA) could benefit from increased use of the metal, though faces challenges such as the heavy carbon footprint of production and the practical features of using a can, they said.
Growing pollution from plastics has rapidly become an urgent environmental crisis, with more than 60 countries having introduced bans or taxes aimed at reducing waste.
With the likes of Berry Global and Sealed Air having joined the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, plastic’s sustainability message “could be vastly improved,” according to Citigroup. But if current recycling systems stay as they are, the metal packagers could take back share, they said.
The metals and mining sector could also be impacted if governments start to demand lower carbon emissions,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said. Here, mini-steel producers which recycle scrap metal, such as  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE),   Steel Dynamics   Inc (NASDAQ:STLD) and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) may have an advantage over integrated mills, the analysts wrote."

LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese yen regained its footing on Friday after a bruising week, as the spread of coronavirus cases knocked down stocks and boosted demand for traditional safety plays from bonds to gold.
China reported more cases of the disease, with finance leaders from the Group of 20 major economies meeting in Saudi Arabia over the weekend set to discuss risks to the global economy stemming from the outbreak.
Though markets have largely shrugged off fears of long-term economic damage from the virus, a steady drip of new cases in countries beyond China - South Korea on Friday recording over 50 new cases - has kept worries gnawing away. 
Among the winners on Friday were the yen, gold and government bonds. 
The yen gained as much as 0.5% against the dollar  in European trading, clawing back some ground after what had looked set to be its worst week in 2-1/2 years. It was last up 0.3% at 111.78.
Other shelters also gained. 
""It's risk-off. Bonds are being bought again and hedges are being put into play at the moment,"" said Olivier Marciot, an investment manager at Unigestion.
Gold scaled its highest in seven years and was last up 0.8% at $1,634.49 , having added over 3% this week.
Yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries (US30YT=RR) fell below the psychologically important 2% level to the lowest since September 2019, while yields on 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) fell to similar lows.
Ten-year German government bond yields fell to a four-month low (DE10YT=RR), with the entire yield curve on the cusp of turning negative. The entire Dutch yield also returned to negative territory. 
The moves came at the expense of stocks. Europe's broad Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell nearly half a percent at one stage and MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS) was 0.2% lower and set for its worst week in four. 
Wall Street futures gauges (ESc1) slipped 0.25%. 
""U.S. and EU equity markets have been sold across the board with core global yields benefiting from safe-haven flows,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. 
Not helping the nerves were signs that economies in Asia were feeling the fallout from the epidemic. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) slipped 1%. 
In Japan, factory activity suffered its steepest contraction in seven years in the clearest evidence yet of the coronavirus' damaging effects.
In a vignette of the impact in Asia, the International Air Transport Association estimated losses for the region's airlines alone could near $28 billion this year - with most of that in China.
Still, European surveys painted a brighter economic picture, suggesting fallout further from Asia may be limited. 
Business activity in the euro zone accelerated more than expected this month, with France's service sector rebounding and German private sector growth also holding steady.
British businesses also grew at a solid clip in February, with factories posting the quickest rise in output for 10 months.
PATCHED-UP YEN? 
The flows into bonds have been a boon to the U.S. dollar, boosting it to multi-month peaks against a raft of competitors this week.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was last down 0.1% at 99.722, retreating from 33-month highs touched a day earlier.
As the dollar has gained against the yen, some have called into question its status as a haven in times of economic and geopolitical strife. 
Yet some traders said on Friday reports of the yen's demise were overdone. 
""It was too soon to write off the yen as a safe haven,"" said Mayank Mishra, an FX strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) in Singapore. 
""I think the yen is reasserting its status as a safe haven.""

1314,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 08:07AM ET</span>",Deere Surges on Surprise Profit Growth Spurred by Farm Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- Machinery giant Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) delivered an unexpected increase in earnings and maintained its annual outlook as early signs of stabilization in the U.S. farm sector offset a slowdown in construction. Shares surged.
“Farmer confidence, though still subdued, has improved due in part to hopes for a relaxation of trade tensions and higher agricultural exports,” Chief Executive Officer John May said in a statement accompanying its fiscal first quarter results.
While the CEO didn’t mention the coronavirus in the statement, his comments may help ease concerns about how much the outbreak will delay China’s return to U.S. agricultural markets as laid out in the phase one trade deal. The tit-for-tat tariff spat with China made American farmers cautious on replacing large equipment, Deere’s top moneymaker.
Shares, down 4.3% this year, rose as much as 10% before the start of regular trading Friday. Investors will be looking for more detail on the company’s prospects for this year in light of coronavirus on a conference call scheduled for 10 a.m. in New York.
Deere maintained its fiscal 2020 guidance, forecasting a range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. That compares with the $2.9 billion average analyst estimate.
The company’s cautiously optimistic view on agriculture contrasts with the results of a survey released Thursday in which more than half of U.S. farmers said they planned to spend less on capital equipment this year. Fundamentals for American farming remain challenged with increasing competition from South America and the Black Sea region compounded by a strong dollar. Two of Deere’s peers issued disappointing 2020 outlooks.
As Deere reduces production to work through excess inventory and faces weaker demand, Bloomberg Intelligence expects a slow start to fiscal 2020.
Precision Ag
“The Coronavirus has driven investors to a defensive positioning in machinery and Deere has been the defensive play,” Stephens analyst Ashish Gupta said in a Feb. 18 report. “The long-term thesis centers around Deere coming out the farm machinery winner due to investments in precision ag and we do not think an F1Q results shortfall is likely to change that.”
Deere said it is proceeding with measures to create a more focused organizational structure that can operate with greater speed and agility, the CEO said.
The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.63 a share for the quarter, up from $1.54 a year ago. The average analyst estimate was $1.25. Company-wide sales fell 6%, dragged down by lower construction and forestry shipment volume and unfavorable currency effects.
“We expect a positive stock reaction as we think full-year EPS estimates are likely to move higher,”  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts said."
1315,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 08:03AM ET</span>",Deere's unexpected rise in quarterly profits sends shares soaring,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co (N:DE) on Friday reported an unexpected increase in first-quarter profit and retained its full-year earnings forecast as signs of stabilization in the U.S. farm sector offset weak demand for construction machines, sending its shares soaring. 
The farm equipment manufacturer reported net income of $517 million, or $1.63 per share, for the quarter ended Feb. 2, up from $498 million, or $1.54 per share, in the same period last year. 
That compares with the average analyst estimate of $1.26 per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The Moline, Illinois-based company said it still expects net income in 2020 to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion.
The world's largest farm equipment maker's shares were last up 9% at $180.75 in pre-market trade.
Deere's earnings in the past quarters were buffeted by a nearly two-year-long U.S.-China trade war that hit U.S. agricultural exports, leaving farmers struggling to turn a profit.
But President Donald Trump's interim trade deal with China has raised hopes of a recovery in farm machinery demand.
""Farmer confidence, though still subdued, has improved due in part to hopes for a relaxation of trade tensions and higher agricultural exports,"" Chief Executive John May said in a statement.
Improved pricing power along with lower production costs and warranty expenses in the latest quarter drove up operating profits at its farm and turf business, which accounts for nearly 60% of Deere's revenue.

Across Europe, Asia and South America, the tobacco firm has affixed the IQOS brand to music festivals and art exhibits. The company also markets through IQOS lounges at mountainside resorts in the Pyrenees and in fashionable neighborhoods of Rome. Throughout Europe, it has partnered with ""IQOS friendly"" bars and restaurants - closed to cigarettes but open to IQOS.
Such promotions are part of a wide-ranging ""normalization"" strategy by Philip Morris (N:PM) to scrub its image as a purveyor of cancer-causing cigarettes and present its new smoking alternatives as youthful, upscale lifestyle products, according to a ten-month study by tobacco researchers at Stanford University, who shared it exclusively with Reuters before its release on Friday. The marketing strategy mimics that of tobacco companies in the mid-20th century, when they started associating cigarettes with Hollywood and high society.
""Philip Morris, as a company name, is somewhat of a pariah,"" said Robert Jackler, a professor who led the study and heads Stanford's Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising. ""IQOS is an attempt to sanitize their product line.""
The Stanford researchers said their study was spurred in part by a May 2019 Reuters investigation that found Philip Morris had used young online personalities, including a 21-year-old woman in Russia, to promote IQOS. The company's internal marketing standards prohibit it from using youth-oriented celebrities or ""models who are or appear to be under the age of 25."" The Reuters report prompted the company to acknowledge it had violated its own policy and to suspend its use of social media influencers.
The Stanford study found that, although the company suspended its ""most visible"" social-media influencer programs, IQOS marketing continues to stray substantially from its corporate standards on youth-oriented marketing.
""Its use of youth-oriented social media channels, trendy pop music festivals and celebrity influencers are mis-aligned with their commitment to exclusive 'adult smoker' targeting,"" the Stanford report concluded.
(For the full report, see: http://tobacco.stanford.edu/iqosanalysis )
Philip Morris declined to answer detailed questions from Reuters on its IQOS marketing strategy and the Stanford findings, saying it did not have access to the full report. ""However, we doubt that there is anything PMI could say or do that Dr. Jackler, and others who criticize our scientific commitment and smoke-free vision, would ever find satisfactory.""
The IQOS device is central to the firm's efforts to overhaul its image through such initiatives as its ""unsmoke"" campaign, which promotes such ""smoke-free"" alternatives as a way to accelerate the shift away from cigarettes. The device heats up but does not burn packages of ground-up tobacco, which resemble small cigarettes, to create a nicotine-filled aerosol that is similar to that produced by e-cigarettes, which heat flavored liquid nicotine.
At this year's Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland - a gathering of some of the world's richest people - Philip Morris set up an ""Unsmoke your mind"" lounge, where panelists argued against regulations preventing ""truth in marketing"" by tobacco firms looking to promote smoking alternatives.
IQOS is sold in about 50 countries, including the United States through a partnership with U.S. Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc. The two companies pledged to regulators that they would market the device only to adult smokers, showing sample advertisements of adults conservatively dressed in business attire.
But in other markets across the world, the Stanford study said, Philip Morris uses ""coaches"" and ""ambassadors"" to market IQOS. In Romania and Russia, employment agencies recruit attractive women as young as 19 to market IQOS, according to job postings mentioned in the Stanford report and reviewed by Reuters.
Instagram postings for Be Like Me, a Romanian marketing agency, show young women posing with the IQOS device in recent months, often wearing robe-like uniforms in malls. The Instagram account for RBT Group, a staffing agency in Russia that markets IQOS, similarly shows photos of attractive young women in front of IQOS signs or posing with other ""coaches.""
Be Like Me and RBT Group could not be reached for comment.
Other Instagram accounts with the ""IQOS"" name, including one called ""iqostyle.arm,"" based in Armenia, continue to show young women posing with the IQOS in what appear to be professional photographs. One photo on that account from last July - two months after Philip Morris said it had suspended all influencer marketing - showed Nika Shuvalova, a 22-year-old Ukrainian model, posing in a swimsuit on a boat with an IQOS.
Shuvalova could not be reached for comment.
A message sent to the ""iqostyle.arm"" Instagram account was returned by someone calling themselves Tiko, who said the IQOS postings were a ""hobby"" and that he had not been paid by Philip Morris.
BIG BET ON IQOS AND 'NORMALIZATION'
The stakes for Philip Morris are huge: The company invested $6 billion in developing ""smoke-free"" products such as IQOS in hopes of staving off a trend of declining global cigarette sales. In 2018, company CEO Andre Calantzopoulos told shareholders that it hoped to receive about 40% of its revenue - nearly $20 billion - from ""reduced risk"" products by 2025.
Internal Philip Morris documents underscore the importance of its larger strategy: ""Make 'normalization' a PMI priority and imbed this mindset into the organization,"" read an internal company document from 2014, reviewed by Reuters as part of a 2017 investigation. The document also cited ""the threats posed by PMI/industry de-normalization"" - such as lobbying bans and exclusions from international treaties and trade agreements - ""and the need to reverse this trend to drive future growth.""
The Stanford researchers pointed to wide-ranging company efforts to associate IQOS with fashion, art and popular culture in a way that cigarette brands such as Marlboro have been unable to do, given changing social attitudes and laws around the world that prohibit such advertising and promotions.
IQOS has been present at events such as Germany's Bambi Awards - which honor stars in TV and film, sports, art and music - as well as that country's Playboy Playmate of the Year Awards.
Philip Morris worked with British sculptor Alex Chinneck on a dramatic installation at the 2019 Milan Design Week. The work depicted the facade of an old, two-story building being unzipped like a pair of jeans - meant to signify the IQOS ""notion of opening the future,"" the sculptor said in an interview with FAD magazine. A representative of Chinneck confirmed the partnership.
The company also worked with distinguished industrial designer Karim Rashid to create an installation at the previous year's Milan Design Week. In an interview with website fashionrepublik.com, Rashid described his installation, showing two faces meeting one another, as similar to the IQOS, which he called “an intimate device that speaks to forward-thinking and original expression.” A representative of Rashid said he was unavailable for an interview on Thursday.
GETTING TOBACCO BACK INTO RESTAURANTS, BARS
The company has also sought to distinguish IQOS from smoking through partnerships with restaurants, bars and salons who designate themselves as ""IQOS friendly"" spaces, where cigarettes are banned but the IQOS device is allowed. The Stanford researchers found evidence of hundreds of ""IQOS friendly"" establishments in places such as the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Romania and Japan. 
Philip Morris did not respond to questions about its business relationships with the establishments that promote the device and display its branding.
The Stanford researchers and other experts say such policies undermine public smoking laws and encourage dual use of cigarettes and alternative devices. Many users will continue smoking outdoors, but turn to e-cigarettes or IQOS where they are permitted indoors. Such switching can “deepen nicotine addiction and make cessation less probable,” the Stanford report said.
The brand also had a presence at a Tel Aviv University student music festival last year - where the minimum age for entrance was 16, and where a video showed young IQOS staff at a pop-up booth.
At a launch party for IQOS in Albania last year, a performer in an elaborate white sequined dress did an interpretive dance on stage with an IQOS, while another performer attached to wires performed acrobatic moves in the air while playing a violin.
""They're trying very hard to resurrect the glory era of smoking, where it was glamorous and sophisticated and stylish,"" Jackler said. ""It's about associating it with all the good things in life."""
1317,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>",Half of China’s Shopping Malls Are Still Shut,"(Bloomberg) -- Half of China’s malls remain shut a month after retailers began closing their doors at the start of the Lunar New Year holidays, as consumers restrict their shopping to essentials amid the coronavirus outbreak.
While the death toll for the disease is still mounting daily, businesses are struggling to restore operations amid lingering fear of infection and as swaths of the country effectively remain under quarantine.
The rate of mall reopenings is “relatively low,” Zheng Wen, a director-general at the Ministry of Commerce, said in a media briefing Friday. “Even if they’re open, the operating hours are significantly shortened and a majority of counters and stores are still shut.”
As of last week, retailers from   Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group   (OTC:CJEWY) to   Yum China Holdings Inc   (NYSE:YUMC) had closed as many as 80% of stores, while authorities asked residents to stay indoors to avoid the deadly coronavirus.
Stores selling necessities are opening at a significantly higher rate, Zheng said. More than 95% of supermarkets are operating, as are 80% of convenience stores.
Anta Sports Products Ltd., the country’s biggest sportswear maker, said its first half results will “inevitably be affected” by the epidemic in China, with business recovering in the second half at the earliest. Only 40% of Anta’s mainland China stores had resumed operation as of Feb. 14. Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) earlier this week said its business in greater China dropped 85% in the weeks since Jan. 25.
Zheng of the ministry said Friday many regions have gradually launched policies to support companies resuming operations.
“More large shopping malls will gradually return to business,” he said."
1318,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 06:38AM ET</span>",Coronavirus on G20 agenda as China reports uptick in cases,"By Pei Li and Se Young Lee
BEIJING (Reuters) - China reported an uptick in new cases of coronavirus on Friday, boosted by more than 200 people testing positive for the disease in two prisons outside of Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
As international authorities tried to stop the outbreak in China from becoming a global pandemic, finance leaders from the Group of 20 major economies meeting in Saudi Arabia over the weekend were set to discuss risks to the global economy.
China has had more than 75,400 cases of the coronavirus and 2,236 people have died of the disease it causes - known as COVID-19 - most in Hubei province and its capital of Wuhan where the virus emerged in a wildlife market in December.
Asian shares dipped on Friday as fears over the creeping spread of the disease sent funds fleeing to the sheltered shores of U.S. assets, lifting the dollar to three-year highs.
""COVID-19 anxiety has risen to a new level amid concerns of virus outbreaks in Beijing and outside of China,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB.
Japan and Singapore are on the brink of recession and South Korea on Friday said its exports to China slumped in the first 20 days of February, with the outbreak upending global supply chains.
Mainland China had 889 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections as of Feb. 20, the National Health Commission said, up from 394 cases a day earlier. The death toll rose by 118, with most in Wuhan, which remains under virtual lockdown.
Infections found in two jails, in the northern province of Shandong and the eastern province of Zhejiang, made up most of the 258 newly confirmed cases outside Hubei.
After several days of more encouraging trends in infections, China's Communist Party newspaper warned that it would be mistake to think victory was in sight.
""If we give in to blind self-confidence, the epidemic could rebound and the virus exploit us when we are off guard,"" the People's Daily said.
HOT SPOTS
The virus has emerged in some 26 countries and territories outside mainland China where there have been 11 deaths, according to a Reuters tally of official statements.
South Korea reported 52 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, taking the national total to 156, the majority in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people, where dozens of people were infected in what authorities described as a ""super-spreading event"" at a church.
More than 400 members of the church were showing symptoms of the disease, though tests were going on, officials said.
In Hong Kong, which has confirmed 69 cases and two deaths from the disease, dozens of police officers were quarantined after an officer tested positive following a banquet on Tuesday.
Another hot spot has been the Diamond Princess cruise ship held under quarantine in Japan since Feb. 3.
Japan has allowed passengers who test negative to leave the ship and hundreds have done so this week, with hundreds more set to disembark on Friday.
Japan reported the deaths of two elderly passengers on Thursday, the first fatalities from aboard the ship where more than 630 cases account for the biggest cluster of infection outside China.
Amid criticism of the government's handling of onboard quarantine, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said one of passengers who died had developed a fever on Feb. 5 but was not removed from the ship until Feb. 12.
Tokyo said it would cancel or postpone major indoor events for three weeks, Jiji news agency reported, as the city prepares to host the Olympic Games starting in July.
GOOD SHAPE OR BAD?
As G20 finance ministers prepared to meet, the IMF said it was too early to tell what impact the virus would have on global growth.
""We are still hoping that the impact will be a V shaped curve"" with a sharp decline in China and sharp rebound after the containment of the virus, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said. 
""But we are not excluding that it might turn to be a different scenario like a U curve where the impact is somewhat longer.""
China's commerce ministry said it is looking into more financial measures to support companies.
The earliest vaccine for the coronavirus would be submitted for clinical trials around late April, China's Vice Science and Technology Minister Xu Nanping said.
Fears of the contagion triggered violence in Ukraine, where residents of a town clashed with police, burned tires and hurled projectiles at a convoy of buses carrying evacuees from Hubei to a quarantine center.
Hundreds of helmeted police and an armored personnel carrier were sent to keep order.
Americans evacuated from China also faced discrimination.
Amy Deng, who underwent home quarantine with her daughter Daisy, 8, said neighbors had called police over concerns they would spread the disease.
""People were already panicked, then they made up this rumor and spread it, telling us not to even live in the community,"" said Deng, 45, a Santa Rosa, California, acupuncturist.

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 06:37AM ET</span>","Daimler warns of ""significant adverse effects"" of virus outbreak","BERLIN (Reuters) - German luxury carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) on Friday warned of risks for the economy and its own business from the outbreak of coronavirus that is spreading in China and around the world.
""Risks for the Daimler Group may not only affect the development of unit sales, but may also lead to significant adverse effects on production, the procurement market and the supply chain,"" the Stuttgart-based company said in its annual report https:// It also noted that the epidemic posed a risk for economic growth in China, other Asian countries and worldwide.
Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius announced last week that its key Mercedes-Benz brand had re-started production of luxury passenger cars in Beijing, adding it was still too early to gauge the impact of the coronavirus on Daimler's business.
Daimler also said stricter anti-pollution tests have made it harder to comply with new rules and increased provisions for regulatory proceedings, liability and litigation risks to 4.9 billion euros, up from 2.1 billion euros in 2018.
The increase relates to ongoing governmental and legal proceedings and measures taken with regard to Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles in several regions and markets, as well as an updated risk assessment for an extended recall of Takata airbags, the carmaker said.
Due to the replacement of the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) with the new measuring method WLTP (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure), the average emissions of carbon dioxide have risen, the car and truck maker said.
""In the light of today's knowledge, this makes it more difficult to achieve the CO2 targets as of 2020,"" Daimler said.
The current public focus on vehicle emissions as well as possible certifications stops and recalls could result in damage to Daimler's reputation, the company said."

1321,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Big Oil Looks Into the Abyss,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Either the oil and gas sector is either on the verge of disaster, or a buying opportunity has opened up.
For obvious reasons, oil and gas-related stocks tend to track the price of crude oil, although the degree of correlation varies according to sector and to region. But the combination of coronavirus, trade wars, the OPEC-Russia alliance and Climate Change appear to have broken that link, at least in the short term.
The price for Brent crude – which admittedly tends to be more volatile than aggregate share prices – has rebounded over 10% from its Feb. 10 bottom of $53.11 a barrel, but you really wouldn’t guess it from looking at the stock market.
Almost all of Europe’s majors – Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),   BP   (LON:BP),   Total   (PA:TOTF),   ENI   (MI:ENI) and Repsol (MC:REP) – are trading below where they were on the day that Brent troughed. Norway’s Equinor (OL:EQNR) is the sole exception, and even that is only 2.2% above its low.
Why, when the oil market is doing its best to ‘look through’ the short-term impact of Covid-19, is the stock market failing to do the same?
It can be argued that OPEC’s inability to agree deeper production cuts with Russia has hit western majors particularly hard, given that the resulting ‘lower-for-longer’ crude scenario turns profitable projects into marginal ones and requires higher risk premiums from equity investors.
The coronavirus has also hit some harder than others. Shell (LON:RDSa), for one, has suffered particularly badly from the disruption to the LNG market as Chinese buyers have invoked refused to take delivery of contracted cargoes, forcing the world’s most expensive gas to be dumped elsewhere in Asia at firesale prices.
Shell (LON:RDSa) is the world’s largest LNG supplier and also the worst-performing of the majors this year, down 15%. Of the other big LNG players, Total is down 9.6%, Repsol (MC:REP) 13% and Equinor 9.6%. Only  BP  (LON:BP) has escaped relatively lightly with a 2.7% drop.
But neither OPEC nor coronavirus can explain why Shell (LON:RDSa), Equinor, Eni and Total are all at or near their lowest in three-and-a-half years with no sign of a bounce in sight.
The explanation for that lies most likely in a long-term structural shift away from fossil fuel companies flagged last month by Blackrock’s Larry Fink in a letter that warned of a “fundamental reshaping of finance” to reflect concerns about Climate Change.
It’s no accident that low-carbon energy companies, which for years were also chained to oil prices because they were the marginal technology, have emphatically broken that link this year, at the same time as hydrocarbon giants have floundered.
Hydrocarbon producers may be due a bounce if crude prices can hold at their current level, which is still in the ball park of what they need to cover capex and dividends. The rich valuations of 'greener' stocks may even provide a nice arbitrage opportunity short-term. But Fink's warning will still be valid when the last coronavirus patient has recovered, "
1322,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 05:03AM ET</span>",European shares fall as investors stay wary of virus impact,"By Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday as investors remained wary of the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the bloc, despite data showing a faster-than-expected pickup in business activity in February.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) shed nearly half a percent and was set to end slightly lower for the week as China reported an uptick in new virus cases.
The index had scaled record highs earlier in the week as data signalled a slight slowdown in the outbreak, lending weight to forecasts that the crisis might blow over by April.
The outbreak has killed more than 2,000 people so far and upended industrial activity in China, causing disruptions for several European manufacturers that supply and source products from one of the EU's largest trading partners.
On Friday, IHS Markit's euro zone flash composite purchasing manufacturers' index (PMI) showed business activity expanding at a better-than-expected pace, although expansion remained slow.
Investors will now look to the final reading due in early-March.
""The news (about the virus) has not been too positive, but nothing has indicated that we are falling into a catastrophic scenario yet as far as markets are concerned,"" said Hubert de Barochez, markets economist at Capital Economics in London.
""The PMIs are encouraging that we're not heading into recession at least, but we still see consistently slow growth.""
German stocks (GDAXI) recovered slightly from initial losses after preliminary IHS data showed the country's business activity was slightly better than expected in February.
Commodity-linked EU subindexes such as basic resources (SXPP) and oil and gas (SXEP) stocks were among the worst performing sectors, shedding around 1% each.
Among individual movers, British luxury brand  Burberry  Group (L:BRBY) fell 3% after Jefferies cut the stock's price target, saying it was one of the most exposed brands to the coronavirus outbreak.
Swiss construction chemicals maker Sika AG (S:SIKA) dropped 2.5% after it posted a weaker-than-expected annual operating profit.
Anglo-Australian miner  Rio Tinto  PLC (L:RIO) fell 1.1% after it said its Mongolian copper unit had begun an international arbitration process to resolve a dispute with the local tax authority.
On the other hand, French consultancy Sopra Steria Group SA (PA:SOPR) topped the STOXX 600 after it reported strong annual results and announced plans to buy software developer  Sodifrance  SA (PA:SDIF)."

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's manufacturing sector is suffering supply chain problems caused by the coronavirus epidemic, which may delay production of Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics' new phones, the Ministry of Industry and Trade told Reuters on Friday. 
""Car, electronics and phone manufacturers are experiencing difficulty in acquiring supplies and materials due to disruptions from the virus,"" the ministry said in an emailed statement. 
""Vietnam relies much on China for materials and equipment, which makes the country become vulnerable when such outbreak happens,"" it said.
Vietnam on Thursday eased some health-related restrictions on cross-border trade to prop up economic activity, but some strict measures are still in place.
Samsung, Vietnam's largest single foreign investor, is an example, the ministry said. The epidemic would have an impact on its production of two new phone models as most of the components are sourced from China.
""Samsung is considering using sea or air transport to import needed components but it would lift up the cost and would hardly meet the production schedule and demand,"" the ministry said.
Samsung said it was ""making our best effort to minimize impact on our operations"".
Although the ministry has not reported any plants being shut down because of the virus, the biggest problems facing car and electronics manufacturers are securing alternative materials and goods, along with inventory management.
""If the epidemic is not contained in the next 1-1.5 months, we will run out of inventory. Domestic TV's and phone's output will sharply decline,"" said the trade ministry, citing a report by the Vietnam Electronics Business Association.
The government said it would stick to this year's economic growth target of 6.8% and take steps to ease the impact of the outbreak.
The Ministry of Health said on Friday that 15 out of 16 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country had recovered, while 28 suspected cases were being quarantined in hospital.

Disagreement Over Japan Patients Returned to U.S. (4:37 p.m. NY)
Officials from the U.S. State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disagreed over how to handle 14 people from a cruise ship who tested positive for the coronavirus while in the process of being repatriated to the U.S., according to the Washington Post.
According to the report, CDC officials wanted to wait and have the people who had tested positive for the virus travel separately from about 300 people being sent back to the U.S. after a long stint on a cruise ship where the virus broke out. State Department officials disagreed and pushed for the patients to be included.
The group was eventually flown back together, and the patients are being treated.
Airlines Expect First Global Traffic Drop Since 2009 (11:20 a.m. NY)
The airline industry expects the first annual decline in global passenger demand in 11 years, after tallying up the initial impact of the thousands of flights canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
The estimate shaves about 4.7 percentage points off of a passenger-growth forecast issued just two months ago, with almost all of the impact in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the International Air Transport Association. That may be conservative: The projections assume the loss of demand will be limited to markets linked to China.
The drop would be the first overall decline since the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Global passenger demand is now seen contracting by 0.6% this year, compared with a December forecast for 4.1% growth, IATA said.

1325,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>",German Economy Faces Coronavirus Hit as Export Orders Sink,"(Bloomberg) --
Germany's economy is facing renewed pressure from beyond its borders as export orders plunge and manufacturers worry about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on their supply chains.
The latest purchasing managers index from IHS Markit shows industry still in a contraction, and expectations for output over the next 12 months dropping.
Overall economic momentum was broadly unchanged from January, signaling that domestic demand remains in reasonable shape. Services still slowed though, in part due to weaker tourist numbers.
The report illustrates the uncertain outlook for growth in the 19-nation euro area, potentially extending its protracted slowdown. Manufacturers in both Germany and France reported disruptions due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, where many factories have had to shutter their operations.
A gauge of German manufacturing activity unexpectedly rose, but IHS Markit said that was likely a distortion caused largely by supply chain disruptions.
That number “flatters the sector’s current trajectory,” said IHS Markit economist Phil Smith. “These are still early days in what could potentially be a lengthy saga.”
A report for the euro area is due at 10 a.m. Frankfurt time."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Listed Chinese companies are queuing up to issue shares and have already announced plans to raise more than $10 billion in the past week after fundraising rules were relaxed to help ease cash strains caused by the coronavirus.
More than 50 companies, including Bank of Ningbo (SZ:002142) and battery maker Yinghe Technology (SZ:300457), have published as of Thursday fresh or revised plans to raise as much as 73 billion yuan ($10.4 billion) through private placements, according to Reuters calculations.
The new rules allow companies to sell shares worth up to 30% of their share capital via private placements compared with 20% previously. The number of investors allowed to participate in such placements was lifted to 35 from 10.
The changes also make the deals more attractive to investors by halving the lock-up periods and enabling more flexible pricing.
The rush to market comes as China has been pumping liquidity into the financial system, cutting interest rates as well as easing other funding avenues, in a bid to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 people and stalled many business activities.
The share sales will also be helped by a resurgent stock market. The blue-chip CSI300 (CSI300) has rebounded roughly 13% from a low hit on February 3 when traders returned after the new year break, compared with 3.8% for the U.S. S&P 500 (SNP) benchmark over the same period.
China cut its benchmark lending rate on Thursday, helping lift the tech-heavy ChiNext index to the highest level in almost three years.
""Investors are encouraged by monetary easing, and are looking beyond the epidemic,"" said Wu Kan, a portfolio manager at Soochow Securities Co.
""China needs a booming stock market to help channel funding to the real economy.""
MORAL HAZARD?
Relaxation of the rules comes as a relief to many companies. More than 75% of respondents in a survey of over 140 companies by Sealand Securities, said the epidemic was straining their liquidity, with smaller firms saying they will burn through their available cash within three months unless the situation normalizes.
Some companies badly hit by the virus reported an 80% slump in revenue.
But the relaxed standards represent a reversal of China's stance since officials sharply tightened share placement rules following the 2015-16 market crash, where reckless fundraising was seen as a contributing factor.
Xu Chao, analyst at the Pacific Securities, said the rule changes represented a ""very strong loosening signal"" from the authorities.
Private placements raised just 122.9 billion yuan last year from a peak of 1 trillion yuan in 2016, according to Kaiyuan Securities, which expects fundraising via this route to at least double in 2020 from 2019.
The easier access to funds could increase the risk of moral hazard, some analysts have warned.
""It's a double-edged sword,"" said Fan Lei, economist at Sealand Securities, who said the moves implied regulators were becoming more tolerant toward market speculation, often dubbed ""stir frying"".
""A bit of stir-frying helps attract money into the market,"" Fan said."

Other carmakers like Tesla (O:TSLA), BMW (DE:BMWG) and Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn) have also started to promote products heavily online in recent weeks as the health crisis escalated and authorities warned people to stay away from public places.
Consumers can order and customize their cars on Geely's website, it said in a statement. It will also offer test drives where potential consumers will be able to arrange a drive starting from their home address in coordination with local dealerships.
The coronavirus has killed 2,236 people and stricken more than 75,400 in mainland China, and strict public health measures
to contain its spread have severely disrupted business and consumer activity.
Sales of passenger cars in China, the world's largest auto market, plunged 92% in the first 16 days of February compared with the same period a year earlier, data from one industry group showed.
Victor Yang, a senior official at Geely, told Reuters promoting online sales will allow automakers to directly reach customers through sales and marketing and help them build experience should they want to continue to do so in future.
Geely, which is China's most globally-known automaker thanks to its investment in Volvo and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), said that car production in February is around one-third of its usual monthly output, but around 90% of workers will return to work by the end of this month, Yang said, adding the automaker has bought facial masks for workers and dealers.
Geely has partnered with third-party online sales platforms including Tmall (N:BABA), JD.com (O:JD) and Suning.com (SZ:002024) in the past but it is the first time the Zhejiang-based automaker is selling cars through its website. Tesla, which is building cars from its $2 billion factory in Shanghai, has been promoting online sales for years.
Nationwide car sales are likely slide more than 10% in the first half of the year due to the outbreak, and around 5% for the whole year, provided the epidemic is effectively contained before April, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) told Reuters last week."

Under the revised deal, SoftBank (T:9984) will hold about 24% of the combined entity, down from 27% under the earlier terms. T-Mobile's parent Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) will hold about 43% of the combined entity, up from the 42% that the German group would have held.
Shares of Sprint were up 5% to $9.95, while T-Mobile fell 1.5% to $98 in trading after the bell.
SoftBank has agreed to surrender about 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to the new company after the deal closes, changing the exchange ratio to 11 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share, higher than the originally agreed 9.75 shares.
Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to receive the original exchange ratio.
SoftBank can get the shares back if the combined company hits stock price milestones, the companies said without disclosing the details.
Sources said SoftBank agreed to the change to avoid delaying the close of the merger. If the ratio for the Sprint common shareholders was changed, a new fairness opinion and a shareholder vote may have been required, which could have delayed the close by four months.
The companies now hope to close on April 1.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.
Last week, a federal judge approved the merger deal, rejecting a claim by a group of states that said the proposed transaction would violate antitrust laws and raise prices.
New York on Sunday dropped its fight against the merger of the U.S. wireless carriers, saying the state would not appeal the judge's approval of the deal.
Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges said on Wednesday the new T-Mobile would have a market value of around $120 billion. That compares with $274 billion for AT&T (N:T) and $242 billion for Verizon (N:VZ).

HSBC this week unveiled a drastic overhaul, the third since the financial crisis, under interim CEO Noel Quinn.
Bloomberg News reported on Thursday Mustier had emerged as a contender for the job, which Quinn is vying to secure on a permanent basis. HSBC said in August it would pick a permanent CEO within six to 12 months.
A source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters Mustier is a candidate. Both banks declined to comment.
UniCredit shares were down 1.3% in early trade on Friday, following a 2.9% drop the previous day when it underperformed a 2.1% fall in the sector (FTIT8300).
Mustier arrived at UniCredit in mid-2016 to oversee a turnaround that has seen the bank slash costs and bad debts while also selling assets and new shares to boost capital."

Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) said it would keep its plants in Xianyang, Hubei Province, and Zhengzhou, Henan Province, shuttered after Feb. 24, when it had planned to resume operations. It did not give a new date for reopening.
Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said operations at its plants in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, would remain suspended until March 11.
In an email, Nissan said the delay was due to the latest government directive by Hubei authorities, who asked firms to keep operations shut down through March 10. Output issues at its suppliers were also affecting vehicle production, it said.
The coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,200 in mainland China, has wreaked havoc on the global automotive supply chain, stalling production at plants in China and leaving automakers scrambling to source the roughly 30,000 parts needed for each car.
China's manufacturing sector is struggling to restart after an extended Lunar New Year break, hindered by travel and quarantine restrictions in many parts of the country.
Suspended output at Nissan's two plants, which make the X-Trail SUV crossover and the Altima sedan in a joint venture with China's Dongfeng Motor (HK:0489), comes as the automaker is already struggling to recover profitability after the arrest of its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, in 2018.
Nissan has also reduced output at some of its plants in Japan over issues with procuring components. It said that there has been no impact on its other global plants."

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 01:16AM ET</span>",Coronavirus' spread challenges U.S. investors' blue-sky view,"By Megan Davies
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors' persistent optimism that the coronavirus will be short-lived is being challenged by increasing evidence that the virus has spread beyond China's borders.
While the World Health Organization (WHO) said a continued decline in the number of new cases of coronavirus infections in China was encouraging, it said that infections outside the country could still spread.
There has been a spike in new cases of coronavirus in South Korea, and international authorities are trying stop the coronavirus from becoming a global pandemic.
""What is becoming clear is that the consensus that is being priced into risk assets is on much thinner ice,"" said Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.
""The consensus (forecast) has a very solid recovery in earnings this year. That is coming under pressure from loss of demand in Asia and also the stronger dollar.""
Risk averse investors piled into the U.S. dollar on Thursday, pushing the greenback to its highest level in nearly three years against a basket of currencies. Gold, another popular haven asset, climbed to a seven-year high.
U.S. equity markets - which had been posting new highs - sank 1% on Thursday on worries about the virus, as news reports of infection levels at a Beijing hospital hit during trading.
Solita Marcelli, deputy Americas chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said that a discussion about coronavirus at the firm's weekly investment meeting on Thursday took more than an hour.
While the firm's base case prediction is that the virus will be largely controlled by the end of March, she said that could be upended ""if we see the virus spreading independently in Europe or the U.S. at an accelerated pace,"" which could lead to greater global economic disruption.
Others are watching closely for signs of containment. Indeed, experts have said that trying to predict a peak is destined to fail.
""It’s less about calling a peak, and more about when we can say COVID is effectively contained,"" said Grant Wilson, head of Asia Pacific at Exante Data, which provides institutional investors with advisory services and data analysis.
""We aren’t even close to that yet,"" said Wilson, who is based in Sydney.
One epidemiologist says it could get a lot worse.
Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said by email - repeating comments published on the Harvard Gazette's website - that there is likely to be a period of widespread transmission in the United States.
Lipsitch said there was some evidence that coronaviruses transmit less efficiently in warmer weather. ""So it’s possible that we will get some help from that, but I don’t think that will solve the problem,"" he wrote.
Gaurav Saroliya, director of global macro strategy at Oxford Economics, said global risk assets were at risk of correction if there is worsening news about the virus.
""There has been a trickle of headlines documenting the global spread,"" said Saroliya. ""What we haven't seen quite yet is meaningful spread to Europe or the U.S. Until that happens or you begin to actually see the effects of the virus in macro data in China and beyond China, the markets in the West, particularly the equity and credit markets, are likely to stay in a bit of denial."""
1335,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 12:15AM ET</span>",Outbreak will not change China's commitments to buy U.S. goods: senior U.S. official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government expects China to honor its commitments to buy more U.S. goods under a trade deal signed by the world's two largest economies in January despite the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday.
The U.S. Treasury official said it was too soon to make accurate forecasts for the impact of the virus on the global economy, but the base case scenario sees China's growth dropping in the first quarter and then rebounding sharply. The impact could be more significant if the outbreak worsens, the official told reporters ahead of this week's G20 meeting.
The International Monetary Fund said this week the epidemic had already disrupted economic growth in China and could derail a highly fragile projected recovery in the global economy in 2020 if it spread to other countries.
China's commerce ministry on Friday said January and February exports and imports would be hit by the coronavirus outbreak, but foreign companies in most places would resume production by the end of February.
Asked if the outbreak would require changes to the Phase 1 trade deal with China, the official said: ""At this stage, we're not expecting changes to implementation of Phase 1. ... We still expect them to meet their commitment, but it's over a period of time.""
Under the deal, which took effect this month, China pledged to increase U.S. goods purchases by $77 billion in 2020 and by $123 billion by 2021, compared with a baseline of U.S. imports from 2017, the year before the U.S.-China tariff war began.
Experts had expressed skepticism that China would be able to meet such aggressive purchase commitments even before the coronavirus emerged, while reports of new cases in China and elsewhere have further intensified fears over its impact on the global economy.
But the Global Times newspaper, which often speaks for the Chinese government, reported on Thursday that China was likely to buy 10 million tons of U.S. liquefied natural gas despite a gas glut.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will discuss the economic impact of the epidemic with senior finance officials and central bankers from the world's 20 largest economies (G20) in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Saturday and Sunday.
China said on Wednesday it was not sending senior central bank and Finance Ministry officials to the meeting because of the virus outbreak.
The Treasury official said lower-level officials would represent Beijing.
Mnuchin and the other G20 officials will also discuss efforts under way among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members to draft new international rules for taxation, with an eye to bridging ""significant gaps"" and reaching a multilateral consensus this year, the official said.
Washington plans to explain its proposal for a ""safe harbor"" that would allow companies to opt out of proposed reforms, the official said. That proposal has drawn sharp criticism from France and other countries and threatens to stall the reform drive.

The rules would affect big U.S. digital companies such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL), Google,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and China's  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Pro-democracy protesters have all but vanished from the streets of Hong Kong over the past month as residents avoid the new coronavirus, but the outbreak has broadened discontent with the city's leadership and China's influence on the financial hub. 
Some business leaders and pro-Beijing politicians have joined pro-democracy and union figures in attacking Carrie Lam's administration for what they see as an uncoordinated response to the virus and its refusal to seal the border with mainland China, which might have prevented infections.
""Regardless of political opinions, people in Hong Kong have already lost confidence in the government of Carrie Lam,"" said Mike Lam, chief executive of the AbouThai department store chain.
Lam's stores have experienced some of the chaos caused by the virus, recently receiving almost 100,000 applications for only 3,400 boxes of surgical masks in stock, said Lam. 
Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents have largely ignored the government's attempts to calm the situation, panic-buying food staples and toilet paper in supermarkets and forming long queues for masks and hand sanitizer in the rare places they can be found. 
That has led to widespread anger and will fuel renewed protests this summer, activists say. 
""Now, it is not really about politics, it's about your genuine life,"" said Clement Chung, chairman of the Hong Kong Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Industries Employees General Union, which has recruited 320 members since it formed on Dec. 31. 
""It connects all the people in Hong Kong in terms of anti-government sentiment. The disappointment and the anger, they want something to change,"" he said. 
'CLOSE THE BORDER, SAVE HONG KONG'
Lam's refusal to completely shut the border with mainland China - largely seen as a move to appease Beijing - has inflamed many in Hong Kong.
Four current and former leaders of the territory's Liberal Party, which is generally in favor of business, the government and China, criticized Lam on the issue.
""As the new coronavirus wreaks havoc on the mainland, the only right decision you should make is to immediately close the border,"" they wrote to Lam this month, calling her response hesitant and ineffective. 
Three-quarters of the city's residents agree, according to a survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute released earlier this month. The same proportion of 156 U.S. business leaders polled by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong also said they want the border closed.
In the first week of February, 8,000 doctors, nurses and medical workers in the newly formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) took part in a five-day strike, chanting: ""Close the border, save Hong Kong.""
Hours after the strike began, Lam announced the closure of four more border crossings to mainland China, but stopped short of a total shutdown. Now 10 of 13 checkpoints are closed. 
That may not be enough to stop frustration spilling over this summer.
""The anger that is building up will fuel future protests against the government and for democracy,"" said Lee Cheuk-yan, a labor activist and former pro-democracy politician.
Lee said the next marches will likely start around July 1, the 23rd anniversary of Britain handing back control of Hong Kong to China, or earlier if the virus subsides.
Hong Kong was roiled by often violent protests throughout the second half of last year, following an attempt by the government to introduce a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.
The bill was withdrawn but the protests escalated into a broader call for greater democratic rights in the city and an inquiry into alleged police brutality in dealing with the protests.
ANTI-CHINA MOOD
The virus, first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected 75,465 people and killed 2,236 in mainland China, according to the country's National Health Commission. Hong Kong has reported 68 infections and two deaths.
Lam rejected a complete shutdown of the border as discriminatory and impractical. Her administration said its decisions were based on World Health Organization guidelines, and not politically motivated. 
""The only consideration of the government in dealing with the infection is public health, and the government's actions are underpinned by very strong scientific and expert advice,"" Lam's office said in a statement to Reuters. 
Lam has also pledged HK$30 billion ($3.85 billion) to measures to counter the spread of the virus and ease the financial impact on businesses.
Not all in Hong Kong are critical. Sunny Ho, executive director of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, said he was happy with Lam’s measures and that critics had ""grossly underestimated the difficulties that the administration has to consider.""
That understanding is not visible at street level, where many remember the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 that also started in mainland China and killed nearly 300 people in Hong Kong. 
Some reactions have crossed into hostility toward residents and visitors from the mainland. 
A list circulating on social media shows 34 restaurants that refuse to serve customers from areas they deem to be high risk for coronavirus. Posters outside some restaurants entrances ban mainlanders, citing health concerns. 
Edgy Salon said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) it would only cut ""Hong Kongers' hair,"" while Kwong Wing Catering posted: ""You won't seal the border, so I'm sealing my shop."" 
One popular post on a pro-democracy Facebook page bragged of misleading mainland Chinese tourists into buying sexual lubricant instead of scarce hand sanitizer. 
'A NEW BATTLEFRONT'
Hundreds rallied in at least three Hong Kong neighborhoods last weekend to protest against plans to turn some government-owned public housing into coronavirus quarantine centers, angry about lack of consultation with citizens. 
In January, a group of protesters set alight the lobby of one of the buildings. 
Some of the 40 or so pro-democracy unions formed since late 2019 have led a more organized approach to the outbreak, and plan to use that momentum to put more pressure on the city's government.
HAEA chairwoman Winnie Yu, who organized the medical workers' strike, called labor unions ""a new battlefront for our protest."" 
Chung said he hopes others unions will ""take the relay baton to continue the strike,"" although most of the new unions need more members to force change.

""They broke the stereotype that Hong Kong people cannot strike,"" said Alex Tsui, chairman of the new, 450-strong Hong Kong Hotel Employees Union, referring to the HAEA walkout.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus SE (PA:AIR) plans to invest between 500 million euros and 1 billion euros ($539 million-$1.08 billion) this year on its A220 passenger jet program, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on Thursday at the company's A220 factory in Mirabel, just outside Montreal.
Earlier in February, Airbus raised its stake in the A220 program - known as Airbus Canada - to 75% from 50.1% after teaming up with the government of the Canadian province of Quebec to buy Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) 33.5% stake.
With the deal, Bombardier exited the civil aviation industry and bolstered the European planemaker's position in its ongoing competition with U.S. rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
The A220, previously known as the CSeries, is a 110-130 seater aircraft, a little smaller than Airbus’s mainstay A320 jet.
Airbus has been ramping up production of the A220 towards its maximum monthly capacity rate of 10 at its facility in Mirabel and to a monthly rate of four in Mobile, Alabama, targets it hopes to reach by the middle of this decade.

Production in the United States has become more important for Airbus since the U.S. government slapped tariffs on jets made in Europe for purchase by U.S. airlines following a years-long tariff dispute.

(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Thursday it would buy discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp in a stock deal worth about $13 billion, the biggest acquisition by a Wall Street bank since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
Part of a broader consolidation in the discount brokerage sector, the move will add breadth to Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit, a business that Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has been trying to build out to insulate the bank from weak periods for trading and investment banking.
Morgan Stanley's main rival,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), has also been forging ahead with an upstart retail bank, while others including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and UBS are trying to focus on basic lending and wealth management services.
""The addition of E*Trade's products and iconic brand will serve as a leap forward"" for the bank, Gorman said on a call with analysts.
The deal reflects a more relaxed regulatory mood under President Donald Trump's administration, which has helped unleash other big-ticket takeovers in the financial sector. 
Big banks have been emboldened to do deals that would have been tricky for the Wall Street titans under President Barack Obama's administration. 
In March last year, U.S. regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp's purchase of smaller rival MB Financial Inc for $4.7 billion got a nod from regulators. It was followed by approval for a $28 billion marriage of BB&T Corp (NYSE:TFC) and SunTrust.
""We believe federal regulators are likely to approve Morgan Stanley's acquisition of E*Trade though the review could take longer than realized as we expect the Federal Reserve to conduct a systemic risk review,"" said Jaret Seiberg of Cowen Washington Research Group.
Gorman sounded confident that the deal would go through without any regulatory hurdles.
""We wouldn't be entering into this (the deal) if we didn't think from a regulatory perspective this would be viewed favorably,"" said Gorman. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve did not immediately comment on the deal.
Banking deals in particular had languished after the financial crisis as strict capital and liquidity rules were imposed on lenders with more than $50 billion in assets, making it unattractive for mid-size firms to acquire more assets.
THIRD TIME LUCKY FOR GORMAN
In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Gorman said he had attempted to buy E*Trade twice - in 2002 when he was at Merrill Lynch and then again in 2007 at Morgan Stanley - before re-initiating talks late last year and finally sealing the deal. 
Since taking over a decade ago, Gorman has pulled off multiple big acquisitions. He orchestrated the bank's takeover of Smith Barney, making wealth management the cornerstone of his plan to stabilize revenue.
E*Trade, which became popular nearly two decades ago with commercials that blasted financial advisers for high fees, had been under the gun as the online trading space became more competitive with increased cut-throat pricing.
Revenue growth at the brokerage, like at rivals, has taken a hit in recent years from the emergence of digital upstarts called roboadvisers, falling commissions and lower interest rates, prompting consolidation in the sector.
Late last year, E*Trade's biggest rival  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp agreed to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp for $26 billion.
Morgan Stanley will get E*Trade's more than 5.2 million client accounts and $360 billion of retail client assets, and the brokerage's CEO, Mike Pizzi, will continue to run the business following the merger.
E*Trade shareholders will get 1.0432 Morgan Stanley shares for each share as part of the deal. That translates to $58.74 per share - a premium of 30.7% to the last closing price of E*Trade shares.

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) - British entrepreneur Richard Branson will unveil the ""Scarlet Lady"" on Friday, a 60,000 tonne cruise liner complete with a tattoo studio and yoga deck aimed at drawing in a younger generation of holiday-makers.
Despite the unfortunate timing, with passengers on one ship quarantined after hundreds caught the coronavirus and another turned away by five countries over fears someone on board may be ill, Branson sees cruises as a growth area.
With the Virgin brand already offering everything from airlines to banking, TV, healthclubs and travel, he has set his sights on a boutique hotel-style pitch.
""I have dreamed of starting my own cruise line since I was in my 20s and I'm thrilled that moment has arrived,"" he said in a statement. 
""The Scarlet Lady is truly special and we've worked with some of the world's most sought-after designers, artists and architects to craft an extraordinary experience.""
The launch date though comes at an undeniably awkward time. 
The coronavirus epidemic, which originated in mainland China and has killed more than 2,100 people, has taken a toll on cruise operators as travel restrictions and the fear of it spreading have also led to cancellations of trips in the Far East. 
Virgin Voyages will unveil the first of four ships in Dover on the south coast of England before she sails on to the United States for a maiden voyage around the Caribbean in April.
Demand for cruising holidays has leapt over the past decade, with some 32 million passengers expected to set sail in 2020, a figure that has almost doubled since 2009. 
The United States is the biggest market for passengers, with the Caribbean and Mediterranean the most popular destinations for the leading cruise lines including Carnival (NYSE:CCL), Royal Caribbean and Norwegian.
Like other Virgin brands, Branson's Voyages line will target younger tourists with spas, a gym, 20 restaurants, DJ sets, drag queens and a vinyl store. Children are not allowed. 
Apart from the virus, the cruise industry has also been forced to address its environmental impact and improve its cooperation with ports to prevent multiple ships from flooding thousands of tourists into tiny coastal communities at once, destroying their way of life.
Virgin Voyages says it is one of the first cruise lines to use Climeon, a technology that generates electricity from the heat of the ship's engine to reduce its demand for fuel, while it will also purchase carbon offsets.

Built at the Fincantieri shipyard in Italy, the Scarlet Lady will host 2,770 passengers and 1,160 crew.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas on Thursday sued Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google search engine, alleging that its educational software collects young students' personal information without the required parental consent.
Google called the allegations ""factually wrong"" and did not respond to a request to elaborate.
The company sells its Chromebook laptops to schools around the world alongside its free or low-cost G Suite for Education software package, which includes email and writing tools.
Brian McMath, an assistant attorney general under Balderas, said recent testing by his team and outside technical experts found that students aged below 13 who are given Chromebooks by their schools have their Web browsing, location, passwords and other personal information transmitted to Google.
The lawsuit states that Google failed to gather ""verifiable parental consent"" before collecting the data, a violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
McMath said while there was no evidence that Google had misused the students' personal information, he was concerned that the company might generate revenue from the data.
Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said ""G Suite for Education allows schools to control account access and requires that schools obtain parental consent when necessary.""
The Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the child privacy law, has said that school districts essentially provide the consent when evaluating and purchasing educational software.
But Balderas and about two dozen other state attorneys general last year urged the FTC to reconsider, contending that it gave companies such as Google too much latitude to track children under 13 without their parents' knowledge.
In 2018, Balderas sued Google and a few other tech companies, accusing them of illegally collecting data from mobile apps made for children. The companies have denied any wrongdoing, and the case awaits a decision by a federal judge.
In September, Google's YouTube video service was asked to pay the FTC $170 million to settle allegations that it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children.
Social media companies have been facing regulatory scrutiny globally over their policies and data monitoring practices, particularly for children. On Feb. 4,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said it planned to add new tools and features for parental control in its messaging app for users under the age of 13."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region stand to lose $27.8 billion of revenue this year as they slash flights due to declining demand as a result of the coronavirus, according to a preliminary estimate from an industry body.
The bulk of the losses will be borne by Chinese carriers, including a $12.8 billion hit to the Chinese domestic market alone, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in a forecast released in New York on Thursday.
Chinese airlines have cut 80% of their planned capacity to, from and within China this week, according to flight data firm OAG, as they grapple with a sharp fall in demand due to the virus that has killed more than 2,100 people in China.
Asian hub carriers Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) have cut capacity across their global networks as they look to manage the crisis.
Overall, IATA expects passenger traffic in the Asia-Pacific region to fall by 8.2% this year, compared to an earlier estimate of a 4.8% rise.
""Airlines are making difficult decisions to cut capacity and in some cases routes,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement. ""Lower fuel costs will help offset some of the lost revenue. This will be a very tough year for airlines.""
Carriers outside Asia are expected to lose $1.5 billion of revenue due to the virus, IATA said, adding it was too early to quantify the impact on earnings.
Air France KLM SA (PA:AIRF) warned on Thursday of a 150 million to 200 million euro ($162 million to $216 million) hit to earnings by April as it contends with the coronavirus epidemic's ""brutal"" impact on the airline industry."
1347,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 06:31PM ET</span>","Fannie-Freddie May Be Freed With Treasury Backstop, Mnuchin Says","(Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are expected to retain “limited and tailored government support” after they are freed from U.S. control, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a letter to lawmakers seeking information on the Trump administration’s plans for the mortgage giants.
Responding to questions posed by Senate Democrats, including Mark Warner and presidential contender Elizabeth Warren, Mnuchin and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria elaborated on their plans for ending the federal conservatorships that have been in place since the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, were seized during the 2008 financial crisis.
In their letter, Mnuchin said the Treasury Department was prepared to continue support of Fannie and Freddie pending congressional action to provide an explicit guarantee of the companies’ securities.
“Treasury expects that it will be necessary to maintain limited and tailored government support” to provide confidence that the GSEs will meet their financial obligations, Mnuchin wrote. “Stability in the housing finance system is crucial, and there should be no disruption to the market as a result of Treasury’s recommended administrative reforms.”
The lawmakers sent almost two dozen questions to the Treasury and FHFA in December, seeking information on matters ranging from the potential impact releasing Fannie and Freddie would have on the trillions of dollars in mortgage securities that the companies backstop to whether housing costs will rise.
Warner and the others said their questions were crucial in assessing whether the Trump administration’s proposals would ensure “housing access and affordability, and the continued success of the secondary mortgage market.”
Mnuchin’s response could help quell concerns that bond investors, banks, credit rating companies and even real estate agents have raised about the plans for overhauling Fannie and Freddie, which backstop $5 trillion in mortgage bonds.
Groups including the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association, one of Wall Street’s top lobbying groups, have warned that making changes without an explicit guarantee of Fannie and Freddie’s bonds could be devastating to the market. Only Congress can provide an explicit guarantee. Keeping some sort of commitment with the Treasury could be seen as a second-best option.
Mnuchin reiterated that he would prefer to work with Congress on a plan including providing an explicit guarantee, but he also outlined some of the administrative changes that the Treasury and FHFA are pursuing on their own. He said that the Treasury’s plan for housing reform wasn’t “prescriptive with respect to a specific path or the timeline” about how they would free Fannie and Freddie.
A spokesman for Warner expressed appreciation for the Treasury and FHFA’s responsiveness and said that the lawmakers expect that the conversation will continue.
Mnuchin and Calabria didn’t provide any details on some of the thorniest questions that still need to be worked out, including how to deal with shareholders. Hedge funds including Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital and John Paulson & Co. have billions at stake if Fannie and Freddie are freed. Mnuchin and Calabria said they haven’t made any decisions regarding the Treasury’s repayment requirements.
Calabria has previously outlined an ambitious timeline for how quickly Fannie and Freddie would be ready to raise capital from outside investors. He also has described a possible scenario where there might be a period where the mortgage giants’ operate under a consent agreement where they are technically out of conservatorship but not completely free from the government’s grip. In the letter to lawmakers, Calabria said a consent agreement wouldn’t “necessarily accelerate the end of conservatorship.”
In their letter, Mnuchin and Calabria said that they believe that Fannie and Freddie will “need to raise third-party capital,” but declined to offer any details of how soon that could happen. Other options would be for Fannie and Freddie to just continue to retain more of their profits to meet benchmarks required before they can be set free."

On the economic calendar the latest report on sales of existing homes arrives, as do number on manufacturing and services activity.
Deere, the top seller of farm equipment, issues its quarterly results.
And a host of Federal Reserve board members will be discussing the economy, including whether the Fed has a Fun House dilemma.
Here are three things that could move the markets Friday.
1. Existing Home Sales Seen Falling
Housing numbers are on the economic calendar again, this time with data on sales of existing homes.
The National Association of Realtors will report on January sales of existing residential buildings at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Existing home sales are expected to have ticked down 1.8% to an annual rate of 5.43 million last month, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Manufacturing numbers are also on their way, with Markit’s preliminary purchasing managers’ index (PMI) coming out at 9:45 AM ET.
The manufacturing PMI is seen ticking down to 51.5. The services PMI is also expected to show a small drop, down to 53.
2. Loads of Fed Talk on the Table
Following the Federal Reserve Minutes released Wednesday, the week ends with a host of Fed speakers.

At the same event, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester will talk at the panel entitled “Financial Markets and Monetary Policy: Is There a Hall of Mirrors Problem?”
That term comes from a 2004 speech by former Fed chief Ben Bernanke made, where he warned against focusing too much on meeting market expectations when determining monetary policy.
""Such a strategy quickly degenerates into a hall of mirrors,"" Bernanke said.
3. Deere on the Docket for Earnings
This week has shown us that even when megacaps are scarce on the earnings calendar, the results-related swings can be wild.
Double-digit moves were seen by the likes of Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG), Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP) and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX).
On Friday a couple of companies could give investors more insight on the overarching concern of the broader market: China.
Agricultural equipment maker Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) will weigh in ahead of trading. The company had been expected to begin to recover from the U.S.-China trade war, but Covid-19 will be a further setback.
Analysts are looking for quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share on sales of about $6.3 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Chinese internet company Sohu.Com (NASDAQ:SOHU) will report before the opening bell also.
The company recently issued upside fourth-quarter guidance for earnings to be flat to 25 cents per share, with revenue of $465 million to $500 million."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Senator Investment Group told clients on Thursday that its founding partners are splitting up, ending one of the industry's more profitable and durable professional marriages.
Alexander Klabin will be leaving the $6.9 billion Senator to ""pursue a more entrepreneurial approach to investing,"" the firm wrote in a letter to investors. Portions of the letter were read by investors to Reuters.
Douglas Silverman, with whom Klabin cofounded the firm 12 years ago, will stay on and run it alongside a senior executive who is being promoted. Jay Bharadwa, who currently runs Senator's credit portfolio, will become co-chief investment officer, the firm said.
Silverman and Klabin, who graduated from Princeton University, worked together at York Capital Management and then joined forces to found Senator in 2008 with help from Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group Inc, the world's biggest hedge fund investor.
Klabin's departure was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The pair had spent a year considering options after people who knew them said tensions had been rising for some time, said two sources who were prohibited from speaking about the matter publicly.
A representative for Senator did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Klabin could not immediately be reached for comment.
In the rough and tumble hedge fund industry, Senator stood out for its strong performance which began with a 60% return the year after the pair launched operations and ended with returns of between 18.6% and 20.3% after fees in 2019, a person familiar with the returns said. There was a loss in 2018.
A number of other employees are also leaving, including Sam Siegal, who headed healthcare investments and is going to Citadel, and investor relations executive Zlata Gleason who is moving to Lone Pine Capital."

Increasing anxiety over the toll and spread of the virus appears to have contributed to the momentum in trades that took the 10-year yield just shy of 1.50%, to the lowest since Jan. 31. Expectations for further easing by the Federal Reserve ramped up quickly, with fed funds futures at one point pricing in as much as 45 basis points of easing by year-end. A day earlier, the market saw a quarter point cut and 50-50 odds of another.
“Ultimately, it’s a function of growth risks getting priced in,” said TD Securities rates strategist Priya Misra.
The rallies coincided with a more than a 1% slide in the S&P 500 at the day’s weakest levels. Misra said may reflect concerns based on the extent of quarantines and supply-chain disruptions.
“That fear is permeating” the market, she said. “The risk complex has been in this camp that this is transitory and modest and I’d disagree with both.”
Misra also attributed the speed of the Treasury market’s move in part to convexity hedging positions in mortgages. The spillover also showed in inflation markets. The 10-year breakeven -- a gauge of the market’s outlook for the consumer price index over the next decade -- slumped close to its lows so far this year, to 1.62%.
The market’s increasing expectations for more action from the central bank haven’t yet been endorsed by any officials. Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida Thursday said “the fundamentals in the U.S. are strong,” and it was too soon to judge how the deadly virus might weigh on the economy. At its January meeting, the Fed projected holding rates steady this year after three cuts in 2019."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday, led by declines in technology heavyweights, after reports of new coronavirus cases in China and other countries intensified fears over its spread and impact on the global economy. 
Investors were unnerved by a sharp late-morning drop that took the S&P 500 briefly down more than 1% on the day, with some traders attributing the move to a Global Times report that a central Beijing hospital had reported 36 new cases. This raised worries about a potential increase in infections in the Chinese capital.
Investors were already skittish after Japan reported two new deaths and South Korea reported a rise in new infections. Research suggested the virus was spreading more quickly than previously thought.
""The overlying question is the uncertainty over the coronavirus and whether it's going to spread further and impact global economic activity before things stabilize and ultimately get better,"" said Michael Sheldon, executive director and CIO at RDM Financial Group at Hightower in Westport, Connecticut.
He said it appeared investors were taking profits in some high-flying technology names and buying shares of other groups, including small caps. The Russell 2000 index ended up 0.2% on the day.
The S&P 500 technology index lost 1% on the day. The index has led gains in the S&P 500 so far this year and is still up more than 10% since Dec. 31. Shares of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell and were among the biggest drag on the S&P 500 on Thursday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 128.05 points, or 0.44%, to 29,219.98, the S&P 500 lost 12.92 points, or 0.38%, to 3,373.23 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 66.22 points, or 0.67%, to 9,750.97.
Recent policy easing by China, a largely better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings season and hopes that the economic jolt from the coronavirus will be short-lived have pushed Wall Street's main indexes to new highs in recent weeks.
""In my opinion, what is happening is the market got well ahead of itself. The coronavirus thing is not over by any stretch,"" said Ken Polcari, senior market strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in Jupiter, Florida. 
E*Trade jumped 21.8% after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) offered to buy it in a $13 billion stock deal, the biggest acquisition by a Wall Street bank since the financial crisis.
In other corporate news, ViacomCBS Inc slumped 17.9% as its earnings fell short of revenue and profit expectations in its first quarterly earnings results since closing its merger.
The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 138 new highs and 56 new lows.

Investing.com – The S&P recouped some losses following a sudden selloff Thursday, as investors reassessed the threat of the coronavirus on growth as reports of sharp uptick in infections in Beijing weighed on sentiment. 
The S&P 500 slipped 0.38%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.67% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.44%.
Over recent days, investors have cheered signs the spread of the coronavirus in China, named Covid-19, could be slowing, but reports of a sharp increase in infections in Beijing and outside of mainland China has gripped investor attention.
A hospital in Beijing has reported 36 new cases as of Thursday, a sharp increase in the number of cases reported in the capital city, taking the total cases to 45, denting hopes that China, the world's factory, could resume normal activity.
Several companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) have cautioned on outlook, forcing some to reassess expectations about the impact the outbreak will have on growth. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) warned investors against taking the threat too lightly.
""In the nearer term…we believe the greater risk is that the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices, suggesting that the risks of a correction are high,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer told clients.
Tech was the worst hit, falling 1%, with chip stocks giving back gains from a day earlier and large-caps like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) adding to the broader downside move. 
Stocks got the session underway on the back foot as investors had to contend with mixed quarterly reports. 
Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) slumped 16% after the theme park operator delivered a softer outlook on profit and cut its dividend by nearly 70% amid a surprise loss in the fourth quarter.
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) plunged 18% to a 52-week low after its earnings missed estimates and guidance was weak.
Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) bucked the trend, rising 17%, after its fourth-quarter losses were not as bad as Wall Street had estimates amid a ramp-up in activity on its housing platform.

1356,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 04:21PM ET</span>",Virus Surge in Japan Risks Undoing Abe’s Efforts to Woo China,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has so far managed to keep the coronavirus outbreak from damaging his hard-won relationship with China. That’s getting even more difficult with each new case confirmed in Japan.
Abe has taken a softer approach to China over the virus than the Trump administration, winning Tokyo praise in Beijing. That chimes with his efforts to nurse Japan’s relationship with its giant neighbor and biggest trading partner back to health since he took office in 2012 amid the worst crisis in decades.
Unlike others including the U.S., Australia and Singapore, Abe’s government has avoided a blanket ban on visitors from its neighbor, instead restricting entry from just two provinces. While acting quickly to evacuate its citizens from the virus epicenter of Hubei, Japan also used the planes to fly in aid packages for China.
That’s contrasted with Japan’s counterparts in the U.S., who have questioned China’s commitment to transparency during the crisis -- leading to bickering between the two sides. China is also keen to keep ties strong with Abe amid a painful trade war with the U.S. that has battered its economy.
“Japan’s attitude has been very helpful for China,“ said Noriyuki Kawamura, a professor at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies. “China’s initial response to the virus was insufficient. The question is what Japan will do when those problems are exposed. Will it criticize China or close its eyes?”
China has shown its appreciation for Japan’s approach, marking an unusual interlude in a relationship between Asia’s two biggest economies long rocked by disagreements over history and territory. Personal touches like a fragment of ancient Chinese poetry attached to aid packages from a Japanese group and a video of a Tokyo-based ballet troupe singing the Chinese national anthem won widespread praise on Chinese social media.
But as coronavirus infections rise in Japan, Abe is likely to find his position harder to maintain, especially given that an earlier alert from China could have slowed the spread of the disease. Before global warning flags were raised, thousands of Chinese tourists visited all parts of Japan and have since been linked to cases of virus transmission. Three people have so far died of the infection in Japan.
‘Cherry Trees Bloom’
Chinese visitors to Japan in January rose 22.6% from a year ago, data released Wednesday showed. Even though infection numbers in China grew dramatically in late January, Abe’s government only banned entry from Hubei province on Feb 1.
While the virus outbreak initially provided an opportunity for Japan to show solidarity, it’s likely to interfere with Abe’s plans for a state visit by President Xi Jinping, meant to crown the seven-year slog to restore relations. Japanese officials have repeatedly said there’s no change to the plan to treat Xi with full state honors “when the cherry trees bloom” in early April, but both sides may find the trip harder to manage.
The virus also appears to be eating away Abe’s long-solid voter support. A poll published this week by the conservative Yomiuri newspaper, which generally backs Abe, showed 52% of respondents were dissatisfied with the way the government has been handling the outbreak. His support rate dropped in all three media surveys published Monday.
Japan’s Abe Arrives in China Vowing to Lift Ties to ‘New Level’
The opposition Democratic Party for the People has called for a ban on all foreigners visiting from China. Former premier Yukio Hatoyama’s Twitter announcement that an organization he heads had donated a million masks to China was met with a barrage of online criticism amid a serious shortage of such items in Japan.
Clampdown coming?
Some in Abe’s own ruling Liberal Democratic Party oppose Xi’s state visit, partly because of the ongoing incursions by Chinese ships into what Japan sees as its territorial waters around disputed East China Sea islands.
Japan Needs to Do More to Fix China’s Image Problem, Xi Says
An annual poll by think tank Genron NPO published in October found 46% of Chinese had a favorable impression of Japan, the highest since the survey began in 2005, as more tourists experience the country for themselves. Nearly 10 million Chinese visited Japan last year.
Almost 85% of Japanese respondents to the same poll said they had an unfavorable impression of China. By contrast, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said gratitude would bring the two peoples together.
“Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the Japanese government and people have expressed sympathy, understanding and support to us,” she told reporters Feb. 4. “What the virus has done is cruel and will not last. What the people have done is touching and will be remembered forever.”
Skeptics point out that there are still deep divisions between the neighbors, including over Japanese citizens detained in China and restrictions on Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang. The territorial dispute over East China Sea islands that brought them close to a military clash in 2012-13 is no nearer resolution.
“Neither side has reduced its number of patrols close to the islands,” said Tsai Hsi-hsun, director of Tamkang University’s Graduate Institute of Japanese Political and Economic Studies in Taiwan. “They still don’t trust each other in terms of national security and that distrust is deeply ingrained on both sides even though, on the surface, the relationship looks better.”"

(Reuters) - U.S. department store operator Sears has reached a deal for a fresh financial lifeline totaling roughly $100 million from hedge fund Brigade Capital Management LP, as it tries to stabilize after bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
Sears' billionaire owner Eddie Lampert rescued the retailer from liquidation in a $5.2 billion takeover during bankruptcy proceedings a year ago. The company's unabated need for new funding underscores Lampert's challenges in turning it around.
Sears reached an agreement with Brigade for the $100 million financing in recent weeks, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified because the negotiations were confidential. Lampert has also bankrolled Sears in recent months, the sources added, without disclosing the total amount of funding he provided.
A spokesman for Sears, now called Transform Holdco LLC, declined to comment. Brigade did not respond to a request for comment.
Brigade has extended loans to other troubled retailers, including high-fashion chain Barneys New York Inc and childrens' clothing shop Gymboree.
Last year, Sears sold its DieHard car battery business to  Advance Auto Parts  Inc (N:AAP) for $200 million and clinched a separate $250 million loan from Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, and other investors. The company has also been paying down some of its borrowings from banks, one of the sources said.
Sears said in November it would close nearly 100 stores, leaving it with only about 182, down sharply from the 425 Lampert acquired when he rescued the chain from bankruptcy. The department store operator is a shadow of the company created by Lampert more than 15 years ago through its merger with Kmart, when it boasted $55 billion in annual sales.
Sears lost money nearly every year over the past decade, amid competition from e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), while Lampert, formerly the company's chairman and chief executive, provided financing lines to keep it afloat.

The company's struggles have drained its cash coffers, risking a potential breach of its debt agreements with banks, people familiar with the matter have said. That has left Sears with the choice of raising additional capital or closing even more stores.

Investing.com – Apple's iPhone sales in China may fall sharply in the first quarter of the year, as its supply chain comes under siege from the coronavirus outbreak, an industry expert warned, casting doubt on Wall Street's bullish calls on the iPhone maker.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares fell 1%.
Apple's iPhone sales in China may fall by 40 % to 50% in February and March, compared with the same period last year, as the Covid-19 outbreak has hurt sales of all mobile phone suppliers in China, Liang Zhenpeng, a senior industry expert, told the Global Times on Thursday.
The tech giant's suppliers are already feeling the pain, with Foxconn Technology warning that full-year revenue was expected to take a hit from disruptions to China-based manufacturing by the coronavirus.
Apple's OLED supplier, BOE, told the Global Times on Thursday they are yet to fully restore operations.
""The impact of the outbreak is certainly there and if our other business partners are affected, so are we,"" said a customer service representative with China's panel display-maker BOE. She noted the iPhone's LCD screens belong to the first-line products and its factory in Beijing has partially resumed production.
The warning signs for a potential protracted delay to iPhone production in China comes against somewhat bullish calls from Wall Street analysts earlier this week as they downplayed the significance of Apple's revenue warning.
Apple said Tuesday it will miss its fiscal second-quarter revenue guidance range of $63 billion to $67 billion."

(https://bloom.bg/37JLp2v) 
The companies are hoping the legal fee overture will garner more support among governmental entities for their offer to pay $18 billion to resolve more than 2,000 lawsuits accusing them of ignoring suspiciously large opioid orders to reap billions in profits, Bloomberg reported.
Reuters reported last week that 21 states rejected an $18 billion settlement proposal from the drug distributors to resolve lawsuits over their alleged role in the opioid crisis, but discussions are still active.
Some 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths between 1997 and 2017 have been linked to opioids, according to government data.
The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids in ways that downplayed their risks and drug distributors of failing to detect and halt suspicious orders. The companies have denied any wrongdoing.
Shares of AmerisourceBergen and McKesson rose nearly 1%, while Cardinal Health's shares also rose marginally.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 01:49PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Canadian regulator considers changes to new drug pricing plan,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's drug pricing agency is contemplating significant changes to how it will apply new regulations aimed at lowering costs, Reuters has learned, as drugmakers unhappy with the policy delay introducing new medicines in the country and blame it for job cuts.
Canada in August passed the new regulations for medicines under patent protection despite heavy lobbying from drugmakers that stand to lose billions in revenue.
The new rules base Canadian drug prices on those from a group of countries with lower prices than the benchmark group currently used to set price ceilings, and give regulators the power to review new medicines based on cost effectiveness.
In response, Swiss drugmaker Roche (S:ROG) last month withdrew its immunotherapy Tecentriq from evaluation as a treatment for breast cancer, citing ""significant uncertainty and complexity"" around the new regulation.  Merck & Co  (N:MRK) in November said it would cut 145 jobs, 30% of its Canadian staff, blaming the new policy.
The Canadian reforms have drawn outsized industry attention over fears that lower prices could spill into its most lucrative market, the United States, where policymakers have floated importing less expensive Canadian drugs or basing some prices on drug costs in other countries, including Canada.
The impact of the regulations will depend on how Canada's Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) ultimately applies them through its pricing guidelines, which could be revised.
""The draft guidelines remain just that - a draft,"" the regulator said in a statement. ""The PMPRB is contemplating significant changes to the document in light of stakeholder feedback.""
PMPRB Executive Director Doug Clark told Reuters companies could be given an 18-month grace period to comply with parts of the regulation, and that cost-effectiveness measures may be applied to fewer treatments.
Asked if changes under consideration were a result of pulled applications and objections by the pharmaceutical industry, Clark said, ""absolutely not.""
There is no evidence that lower prices reduce access to new drugs, as industry has argued, he said.
DRUG DELAYS AND JOB CUTS
Despite pulling its application for government coverage, Roche said it will make Tecentriq available for free through a patient support program. Such programs are usually employed as a temporary bridge during the wait for public coverage.
The PMPRB said threats by companies to pull products when faced with price controls in Germany in 2011 led to few withdrawals.
""No amount of reassurance can be expected to persuade the pharmaceutical industry to support these reforms, given that the inevitable end result will still be lower ceiling prices for many patented medicines in Canada,"" PMPRB said in a statement.
The oncology division of the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) had previously rejected Tecentriq for small-cell lung cancer as too costly for the benefits it delivers.
Innovative Medicines Canada, the industry's main lobby group, said at least seven drug launches have been delayed over the new regulations since August, but declined to identify them.
U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) said it delayed one application, while Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) said it delayed new treatments for hairy cell leukemia and for the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis.
Drugmakers have been especially critical of the PMPRB plan to consider a new medicine's cost-effectiveness - a common practice in some other countries - and patient population size in making pricing decisions.
While the draft guidelines would make most new drugs subject to this analysis, Clark said that was never the intention. The agency may instead zero in on drugs at particular risk of being excessively priced.
Another change under consideration would be to drop the new measures for routine price approvals, and only employ them in litigation. The PMPRB signs off on most drug prices without incident, but a few go before an internal tribunal and then to federal court.
Clark said the final decision on any changes rests with the agency's board, and that staff are still sifting through feedback."

Investing.com – Wall Street moved off session lows but remained under pressure Thursday, paced by selling in tech stocks as investors continued to assess the Covid-19 virus outbreak.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.72%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.69%.

It wasn’t immediately clear what triggered the sudden move lower in stocks. But reports of a sharp increase in infections in Beijing dampened hopes that China’s capital would be able to resume normal operations sooner rather than later.

A hospital in Beijing has reported 36 new coronavirus cases as of Thursday, a sharp increase in the number of cases reported in the capital city, taking the total cases to 45, Chinese state-run Global Times reported.
Beijing recently ramped up measures to prevent the spread of the virus including restrictions on movements and a ban on public gatherings that forced schools to shut down.

Tech led the broader decline lower amid worries about prolonged disruptions to supply chains in China at a time when several companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), have cautioned on outlook as the virus outbreak continues.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 01:16PM ET</span>",Uber returns to Colombia less than a month after exit,"BOGOTA (Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) resumed transporting passengers in Colombia on Thursday with a new service model that allows users to rent cars with drivers, just 20 days after it exited the Andean country following a ruling by regulators which the company described as arbitrary. 
The Superintendency of Industry and Commerce (SIC), which regulates fair competition and protects consumers, in December ruled Uber had violated competition rules.
Uber said on Feb. 3 it was considering taking the ruling to international arbitration, noting that it violated a U.S.-Colombia trade deal and that damages from suspending its service could exceed $250 million. 
""We have looked for new alternatives to keep working and help connect people in the country and also to respond to the support we have received from the community in recent weeks,"" Uber said in a statement. 
""Our new model will allow users to rent a vehicle with a driver, under an agreement between both parties. The application will be the point of contact which connects the two parties together to form a contract,"" the company said. 
Uber will offer five service choices, including options to rent by the hour, and an economy or extra large car.
The December ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by a taxi company which accused Uber of operating without meeting the requirements for public transport companies. Colombia lacks clear rules for ride-hailing apps, which also include Didi and Cabify. 
Uber has more than 2 million users in Colombia and some 88,000 drivers.
Bogota-based driver Ferney, who declined to give his full name, welcomed Uber's return, saying the service offered the best earnings potential among ride-hailing apps.
""I consider it to be good news; (the app) can once again contribute to mobility in the city,"" Ferney said.
Technology companies say regulations in Colombia are outdated and could threaten the country's position as the region's second-most popular destination after Brazil for foreign investment.
Uber said it had paid more than $20 million in taxes in Colombia and plans to expand its investment here.

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: France's Engie eyes U.S. energy services firm Ameresco - sources,"By David French
(Reuters) - French power utility Engie SA has approached Ameresco Inc, a U.S. provider of energy efficiency solutions and developer of renewable energy plants, to express interest in acquiring it, according to people familiar with the matter.
The approach will test the appetite of Ameresco's 72-year-old chairman and chief executive, George Sakellaris, to cash out. Sakellaris founded the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company in 2000 and remains its controlling shareholder.
The sources cautioned that there is no certainty that Engie's interest will lead to deal negotiations and an agreement with Ameresco. They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Engie and Ameresco did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Ameresco shares jumped as much as 15% in New York on the news and were trading up 5% at $23.94 Thursday afternoon, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.1 billion. Engie shares ended trading in Paris down 1% at 16.48 euros, giving it a market value of 40.1 billion euros ($43.3 billion). 
Ameresco provides energy efficiency services to customers such as public housing authorities, colleges and federal government buildings. It also builds, operates and maintains landfill gas-to-energy, solar and wind renewable energy plants.
Engie's interest in Ameresco comes after it said earlier this month it would not renew the mandate of its chief executive, Isabelle Kocher. Engie, formerly known as GDF Suez (PA:ENGIE), said it put in place an interim management team as it searches for a new boss.
The company added it needed to clarify its strategic options and boost its business model in renewable energies and client solutions.

Engie has acquired several energy services companies in North America, most recently Conti Corp last year.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 12:41PM ET</span>",World government debt to hit record $53 trillion this year: S&P Global,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The amount of debt owed by the world's governments will jump to a record $53 trillion by the end of the year, S&P Global estimated on Thursday, with $8.1 trillion set to borrowed this year alone.
About 70%, or $5.8 trillion, of sovereigns' gross borrowing will be to refinance maturing long-term debt, though the expected $2.3 trillion of new borrowing will still be worth at least 2.6% of global GDP.
S&P said the increase reflected the higher borrowing needs of the largest countries. The U.S. at $3 trillion and Japan at $1.75 trillion will remain by far the largest borrowers globally, accounting for almost 60% of the overall total.
""By end-2020 we project that the commercial debt stock of all sovereigns we rate will rise by 5% to reach a record of $53 trillion compared to 2019 and by 30% compared to 2015,"" a report headed by analysts Karen Vartapetov and Roberto Sifon-Arevalo said.
After the U.S. and Japan, China is forecast to issue around $636 billion, followed by Italy, Brazil, and France, each of which are expected to borrow $250 billion in 2020.
Those four together will account for around 17% of the global total, slightly below Japan by itself, while the G-7 group of nations will account for approximately 70% of global borrowing and debt.
The top 20 emerging economies are expected to issue a combined $1.62 trillion this year meanwhile, with up 4% from 2019 and a historical high.
""The (global) increase reflects the higher borrowing needs of the largest sovereign issuers as their fiscal stance loosens in 2020 amid the fragile global economic outlook,"" the report said, adding that low interest rates were also encouraging the trend."
1418,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 12:38PM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Targets Young Money With E*Trade,"(Bloomberg Opinion) --  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is trading in its white shoes for Converse Chuck Taylors.
That’s the initial impression on Wall Street at least after the bank announced Thursday that it had agreed to buy discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp. for $13 billion in an all-stock takeover, the biggest acquisition by a large U.S. bank since the financial crisis. It would add E*Trade’s $360 billion of client assets to Morgan Stanley’s $2.7 trillion and instantly give the bank more direct access to consumers through digital banking and brokerage services. While the two brands would remain distinct under the arrangement, it seems on its face like a match between two companies with polar opposite reputations.
Now, it was hardly a secret that Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has been emphasizing wealth management as Morgan Stanley’s future, largely because the revenue is more dependable than high-stakes trading. In the firm’s second-quarter earnings call last July, when the wealth-management division posted a 28% profit margin, Gorman was asked how he could possibly sustain that pace. He insisted “we’re playing for the long run.”
The long run, it turns out, involves going where Morgan Stanley has rarely opted to go before: down-market. “It is so off-brand for the white-shoe investment bank Morgan Stanley, I’m just stunned,” David Bahnsen, founder of wealth-management firm the Bahnsen Group, who used to work at Morgan Stanley, said on Bloomberg TV.  
I’m not so sure it should come as much of a surprise. After all, there were rumors toward the end of last year that  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). was contemplating an acquisition of E*Trade on top of its other retail-client initiatives like its consumer bank, Marcus. Yes, Goldman and Morgan Stanley are probably the two Wall Street titans most associated with catering to the wealthiest and most financially savvy. But they’re also astute enough to see which way the winds are blowing for the industry: Technology is democratizing the way people invest, save and trade.
As Gorman sees it, that trend is especially true for the “next generation.” In a conference call, he summarized his vision by saying that E*Trade gives Morgan Stanley access to people with what he called “emerging wealth.” By getting them into the fold early, Gorman expects they’ll move over to the bank’s existing wealth-management offerings once they accumulate more money and need a robust financial plan. He said that even now, clients and their children only want to interact with the bank digitally, so E*Trade provides a better way for that to happen. “We’re not messing around,” he said.
E*Trade also stands to benefit from standing underneath Morgan Stanley’s umbrella. After  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. slashed commissions for U.S. stock trading to zero in October, E*Trade had little choice but to follow suit. Unsurprisingly, smaller fees means compressed profit margins. The race to the bottom was due in part to the rise of Robinhood Financial LLC, which said it had more than 10 million accounts as of December. About a week earlier, CNBC’s Jim Cramer claimed that Robinhood had turned E*Trade into a dinosaur.
Powered by Morgan Stanley, E*Trade will almost certainly avoid extinction. E*Trade shares soared 24% and Morgan Stanley’s dipped 4.1% at the start of trading. The deal should close in the fourth quarter — nothing about the transaction seems like a glaring issue for regulators. The one wild card would be a rival bid, but Bloomberg Intelligence’s David Ritter considers that “unlikely” because of the already steep premium.
Plus, it seems as if the two CEOs are already becoming fast friends. Mike Pizzi, E*Trade’s recently appointed leader who’s in his mid-40s, joked on the conference call that the companies’ cultures are similar, apart from the dress code. Gorman piggybacked off that by noting that when they got together, Pizzi asked whether he owns a pair of jeans (Gorman said he does).
Maybe some Converse shoes will be next. "

CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The outbreak of coronavirus in China has forced U.S.-based suppliers to industrial giants such as  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT),  Deere & Co  (N:DE) and Komatsu Ltd (T:6301) to grapple with a surge in costs to avoid production disruptions.
As the epidemic slows exports from the global manufacturing hub, the higher prices for everything from tubes to metal pieces could further dent earnings of tractor and machinery makers that are already battling with a downturn in America's industrial economy.
China is struggling to get its economy back on track after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain the virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year, which has so far killed over 2,100 in China and spread globally.
Illinois-based Morton Industries is trying to find a domestic source for tooling and fixtures used to shape metal that it previously imported. But limited domestic supply and a rush to secure the supplies that formerly flowed from China have sent prices up as much as 30%, said Kevin Baughman, vice president of operations at Morton.
Baughman said the company has asked customers to shoulder the higher costs for the components ""as we couldn't absorb them.""
The increased costs are not limited to the parts these companies make. Shifting sourcing often means buying new tools and spending money to ensure that new parts fit the specifications demanded by equipment makers.
Caterpillar declined to comment, as did Deere, which reports earnings on Friday. Komatsu did not respond to a request for comments.
Executives of half a dozen suppliers told Reuters they are taking measures that include tying up sources outside China and booking air freight - as opposed to normal sea freight - to fly in the available parts and components from China, where roads and ports have been restricted, to ensure they can keep their customers supplied.
Woodridge, Illinois-based Morey Corp expects to face shortages for circuit boards and casting parts next month if the stocks are not replenished.
The electronics manufacturer has reached out to vendors in the United States, but its sourcing director, Tanveer Khan, said the price difference between domestic and Asian suppliers is as much as 30%.
EXACERBATING PAIN OF TRADE WAR
Supply disruptions come on the heels of a nearly two-year-old Sino-U.S. trade war, which inflated the costs of imports of industrial parts and components from China and sapped business confidence, resulting in layoffs and production cuts at manufacturers including Deere and Caterpillar.
Unlike the trade war, the coronavirus impact may be short term. Prices could spike, then decline as supplies improve. The number of newly reported cases in China has fallen in recent days.
But for now, the outbreak is further inflating the costs and the threat of component shortages looms.
A Moline, Illinois-based supplier of Caterpillar and Deere that declined to be named said it is paying 40% more to domestic vendors for components that used to come from China - costs it is passing on to customers.
Bill Bachman, chief executive at St. Louis, Missouri-based Bachman Machine Company, said an industrial company had reached out to him for price quotations for metal stampings after facing difficulty in obtaining supplies from China.
While he has done work for this customer for three decades, Bachman says he cannot match the Chinese rates.
""Regardless of what they're paying over there, we have to quote what we have to charge here,"" he said.
'THERE COULD BE SHORTAGES'
In a bid to contain the epidemic, most Chinese provinces had extended the Lunar New Year holiday and kept factories closed until Feb. 10. Many factories have reopened, but are operating at partial capacity.
Meanwhile, Chinese ports are short-staffed. A shortage of truckers is making it difficult to move products from factories to ports.
This has led to higher demand for air cargo. But the capacity is limited and costs are becoming prohibitive.
Evan Poulakidas, director for North America at CCTY Bearing, says his company is ready to fly in products ""piece by piece"" from its plant in China.
The bigger challenge is how to keep the facility running if the factories of sub-suppliers remain closed. CCTY has informed its customers that stocks on hand would not last beyond April.
""It is not just for our products, but also for other products, there could be shortages,"" Poulakidas said."

Investing.com – Sometimes together isn’t always better.
ViacomCBS Inc. (NASDAQ:VIAC) showed Wall Street it still has lots of wrinkles to iron out, as its first earnings report as a combined company had shareholders heading for the exits.
Shares fell 17% in midday trading.
ViacomCBS reported an adjusted profit of 97 cents per share on revenue of $6.87 billion, down 3.1% from the year-ago period.
Analysts were looking for a profit of $1.40 per share on revenue of $5.63 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Looking ahead, the company said it predicts earnings of $5.15 to $5.50 per share, well shy of the S&P Capital IQ consensus of $5.97 per share.
ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish noted the company faced “a significant set of merger-related items that were a headwind for expenses and cash flow” and was in a transitional period.
Part of the plan is further emphasis on streaming, led by its flagship service CBS All Access, which along with Showtime is on track to have 16 million subscribers at the end of 2020, the company revealed.
ViacomCBS said its streaming and digital video segment pulled in revenue of $1.6 billion last year."
1421,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 12:33PM ET</span>","Shipping lines, ports count cost as coronavirus hits supply chains","By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - China is struggling to resume normal trade operations as fallout from the coronavirus outbreak hits container shipping lines and logistics chains, with goods stuck and costs mounting, industry officials say.
The epidemic has upended global supply chains and caused widespread disruption to businesses and factory activity in China, prompting authorities to deliver a steady stream of policy measures over recent weeks to cushion the blow to growth. 
China is a vital player in the container sector, transporting everything from fresh food to phones and designer clothes as well as industrial parts. 
The world's biggest container line Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) warned on Thursday that the coronavirus outbreak would weigh on earnings this year, adding to pressure on a sector already hit by trade wars and an economic slowdown.
""We are experiencing huge pressure at (Chinese) port terminals because there aren't enough workers at the ports to move the containers around, not enough truck drivers to move the goods, and no one to receive them at the factories or warehouses,"" Maersk's chief executive Soren Skou told reporters on Thursday.
""We have lots of ships laying idle in Asia, because we have cancelled many loadings out of China in the last two weeks.""
The world's number two container line MSC said the discharge of refrigerated reefer containers was also affected due to problems with power sources. 
""The blanked sailings and reefer congestion issue are likely to contribute to a shortage of containers in some regions,"" an MSC spokesperson said, referring to cancelled port calls. 
The MSC spokesperson added that a surge in demand for containers was expected when production capacity in China returns to normal.
Shipping consultancy Alphaliner estimated that 46% of scheduled departures on the major Asia to north Europe route had been cancelled in the past four weeks. 
""We are beginning to see the impacts in terms of trade flows,"" said Richard Ballantyne, chief executive of the British Ports Association trade body.
""This will mean higher costs for shipping and problems further down the supply chains such as increased costs and shortages of certain commodities."" 
Anesco, the Spanish dockworkers’ employers association, said it estimated that container volume could decrease by up to 30% in coming months due to the impact of the virus, which would result in economic losses across Spain's ports. 
Rotterdam, one of Europe's busiest ports, was already expecting a fall in volume in 2020 from throughput volume of 14.8 million TEU (20-foot equivalent units) in 2019. 
""We expect a negative impact somewhat south of 1% container throughput per annum in 2020,"" a port spokesman said. 

""It is a common feature that - after such a production interval - there is a spike in production as well as cargo shipment afterwards to make up for lost time.""

Mustier has been credited with turning around the biggest Italian bank through major restructuring in the past three years, including cost cuts, dumping bad debts and shrinking the bank's international presence.
Mustier has been in talks with HSBC about thejob, according to the report, although the board is still undecided and is considering candidates including the bank's interim chief, Noel Quinn.
Quinn took the interim role after HSBC ousted John Flint as CEO in August 2019 due to differences of opinion with Chairman Mark Tucker over Flint's more tentative approach to reviving growth.
Quinn, an HSBC veteran, is auditioning for the permanent role of CEO, which the bank said in August would be announced within six to 12 months.
HSBC on Tuesday announced a drastic overhaul to shed $100 billion in assets, shrink its investment bank and revamp its U.S. and European businesses that will mean 35,000 jobs cut over three years.
HSBC and UniCredit declined to comment."

The sale, potentially Europe's biggest private equity transaction in 13 years, is entering its final stretch, with two buyout consortia in a neck-and-neck race to acquire the world's fourth-largest lift maker.
Under the deal, Thyssenkrupp would likely sell all of the division, Elevator Technology, to realise the highest valuation, the people said. The 16 billion euros is roughly the same as the combined total of the group's net debt - which soared in the last quarter - and pension liabilities. 
There is a small chance the group could retain a minority stake in the business, the people said, adding the likelihood of that happening had decreased in recent weeks.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.
Shares in Thyssenkrupp rose as much as 1.4% on the news before trading down 0.7% at 1548 GMT.
The company, a steel-to-submarines conglomerate, said this week it would either sell a majority stake or all of the unit. Labour representatives, as well as the group's top shareholder, the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation, have argued in favour of keeping a stake.
""Of course it would be profitable for the company to keep a stake,"" Ursula Gather, who heads the foundation's board of trustees and also sits on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.
'REGRETTABLE'
Gather said many factors had to be taken into account as part of the deal. ""But again, the decision lies with the management board,"" she said, adding there had to be a fast decision on how proceeds would be spent, including on how cash could be provided to the group's steel business.
Any private equity sale would likely see the elevator division being loaded up with debt, lowering the chance it will have enough room to pay dividends or pass on huge amounts of cash, the people said, making a stake less attractive.
Thyssenkrupp said this week it was focusing on talks with two consortia: Blackstone (N:BX), Carlyle (O:CG) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board; and Advent and Cinven (CINV.UL).
Sources have previously said the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany's RAG foundation were part of the Advent/Cinven tie-up, which sources said submitted a bid just shy of the roughly 16 billion euros offered by its rival consortium.
Finland's Kone (HE:KNEBV), which had made a bid of more than 17 billion euros, dropped out.
""From a shareholder view it is of course regrettable that the highest bid won't be successful but apparently Thyssenkrupp has no time to lose,"" said Michael Muders, fund manager at Union Investment, a top-20 shareholder. 
""The price is still attractive.""
Bidders have until next week to make final changes to their binding bids submitted this month, one of the people said. Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Feb. 27 and could make a decision, sources have previously said.

Thyssenkrupp, which is keeping open the option of listing the elevator unit, aims to wrap up the process in February but talks could delay the process to March, one of the people said.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 11:01AM ET</span>",UBS's tech-savvy new boss Hamers not always loved by the Dutch,"By Bart H. Meijer and Michael Shields
AMSTERDAM/ZURICH (Reuters) - Ralph Hamers made his mark as a tech-savvy chief executive who led Dutch bank ING (AS:INGA) back to profitability after cementing its position as a no-frills lender in Germany and simplifying its product portfolio.
It was this record which likely appealed to Switzerland's UBS (S:UBSG), which has named him CEO in a surprise move, rather than the controversies which somewhat tainted his seven-year tenure atop the Netherlands' largest bank.
Hamers' time as ING head saw the bank subject to a record fine for lax anti-money laundering procedures, and public rows with politicians over his and other bankers' pay.
Hamers, 53, climbed the ranks at ING since starting there in 1991, becoming head of its Dutch operations in 2005 and its Belgian branch in 2011 before taking the helm in 2013.
Hamers was responsible for a major reorganization as the bank tried to recover from the financial crisis and realign its operations with new technology, closing hundreds of bank offices and cutting more than 10,000 jobs.
One person who knows him described Hamers as a ""people's man"" who during ING's restructuring and immediately after the money laundering allegations made it a point to take senior colleagues into his confidence by briefing them on how he planned to tackle the challenges.
Hamers, who holds a Master of Science degree in Business Econometrics/Operations Research, is lauded for his focus on improving the bank's digital services, improving its smartphone app for retail clients, and acquiring a string of fintech companies, with varying levels of success.
Both Hamers' experience of digitalization and on cost cutting will be needed at UBS, where CEO Sergio Ermotti has struggled with persistently high costs.
""Whilst he may be viewed as a leader in digital innovation, much of the investor concern for UBS is on the ability to right-size the cost base"",  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said.
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE 
Hamers told a news conference in Zurich: ""You can't focus on digitalization per se ... That is not a goal in itself."" He said the focus had to be on how to improve the way customers experience digital services.
Despite his successes, credit for Hamers' record remained limited outside ING, as politicians from all sides of the Dutch political spectrum hammered on about the importance of curbing bank executives' pay.
Yet local pay caps meant Hamers was one of the lowest-paid among major European bank CEOs, and in moving to Switzerland he is likely to escape such salary strictures, given the generous 13.8 million Swiss francs ($14 million) doled out to Ermotti, excluding benefits, in 2018.
That compares with the 1.75 million euros ($1.9 million) Hamers received at ING, with his bonuses scrapped due to the money laundering fine. 
Married to a former ING colleague and with twin children, Hamers repeatedly scorned traditional Dutch frugality, warning that it limited banks' ability to attract top talent. 
He also didn't shy from criticism of the European Central Bank's ultraloose monetary policy, which he deemed unnecessary and harmful to consumer confidence.
Usually without a necktie, Hamers - who told the Financial Times his interests included cycling, running and swimming, and that he sometimes acts as referee's assistant at his son’s soccer matches - tried to sport the image of a young, modern and approachable CEO.

Yet his easy-going image received a blow in 2018 as ING was fined a record 775 million euros ($837 million) in a settlement with prosecutors over ING's inability to spot money laundering for years.

The epidemic, which originated in China's Hubei province and has claimed more than 2,000 lives, has raised concerns on its economic fallout stretching further into 2020, as companies have been forced to shut stores and curtail manufacturing in the critical market.
The company's supply side has come under pressure, as it relies on 387 suppliers in China that ship more than 9,000 different materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished product items.
""Each of these suppliers faces their own challenges in resuming operations,"" Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said in a presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference.
P&G also said store traffic was considerably down in China and had fallen in other Asian countries as well.
""Some of the demand has shifted online, but supply of delivery operators and labor is limited,"" Moeller added.
The company, which reaffirmed its full-year targets, did not provide financial estimates for the hit it would take in the quarter ending March."

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss bank  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) has been reprimanded by the country's financial watchdog for ignoring money laundering risks in handling millions of francs of payments linked to corruption in Venezuela and world soccer body FIFA.
In a highly critical report, FINMA said there had been scores of failings at Switzerland's third-largest listed bank, such as its acceptance of a 70 million Swiss franc ($71 million) transfer for a Venezuelan customer in 2014 despite knowing he was accused of corruption. 
The regulator's announcement, which outlined serious lapses as recently as 2018, comes as Switzerland seeks to change its image as one of the world's most opaque and secretive financial centers. 
Under pressure from tax authorities abroad, the Alpine nation pared back banking secrecy, though some experts say its concessions apply to rich countries rather than poor ones and recent scandals show money laundering remains a major risk.
FINMA told Julius Baer to improve its controls and appointed an auditor to oversee the group. Nonetheless, it did not make use of its power to demand the return of profits linked to wrongdoing, meaning the bank faces no financial penalty.
In a similar case in 2016, FINMA confiscated 95 million Swiss francs from Swiss bank BSI only to have its decision overruled by a Swiss court in December.
The watchdog on Thursday said it had uncovered systematic failings and management inaction on money-laundering risks, with the vast majority of the 150-plus sample transactions it had examined showing irregularities between 2009 and early 2018.
Julius Baer acknowledged the lapses.
""We accept FINMA's findings and regret the shortcomings identified in our business with Latin American clients,"" said Chairman Romeo Lacher. ""This is not compatible with the risk culture that we are striving to achieve.""
The bank's shares were down 1.9% by 1448 GMT.
BRIBERY SCANDAL
The failings were connected to cases of corruption linked to Venezuelan oil company PDVSA and global soccer governing body FIFA, the regulator said. 
FIFA has been embroiled in a bribery scandal that led to former president Joseph Blatter and former vice-president Michel Platini being banned from soccer in 2015 over illicit payments.
The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG) said on Thursday that it had filed an indictment against former FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke, who it has charged with accepting bribes.
Venezuela's PDVSA, where military officials took over management in late 2017, is subject to sanctions from Washington, imposed in an effort to oust the South American country's President, Nicolas Maduro.
FINMA appointed an agent to investigate Julius Baer in 2017, broadening its inquiries in 2018 after the arrest of a Baer banker in the United States. 
The watchdog said Julius Baer had to take steps to identify bankers whose clients are a high money-laundering risk and adjust its pay and disciplinary policy to avoid risk. 
Baer said it had since improved and would take action demanded by FINMA.
Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti said the findings were serious and he believed that some of the recent changes in Julius Baer's strategy needed to be seen in this context.
The bank last year appointed company insider Philipp Rickenbacher as chief executive, replacing Bernhard Hodler, the former risk chief who took over when Boris Collardi abruptly left in 2017 to help to run unlisted rival Pictet.
Pictet, where Collardi is a managing partner and joint head of wealth management, said Collardi and the bank declined to comment.
""What was already an open secret has now been confirmed. Julius Baer sailed too close to the wind,"" ZKB analyst Michael Kunz said in a note.

Investing.com -- Wall Street opened in a cautious mood on Thursday as optimism over containment of the Covid-19 virus in China was offset by signs of it spreading elsewhere in Asia, notably in South Korea, where the number of recorded cases doubled overnight.
By 10:20 AM ET (1520 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2 points, effectively flat, as was the S&P 500. The Nasdaq 100 was down 0.1%.
Among the biggest movers was online brokerage E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC), which rose 24.2% after the company agreed to be bought by   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS).
Morgan Stanley stock was down 4.1%, as market participants looked askance at the $13 billion price tag, thinking that the rapid consolidation of the retail brokerage sector ought to have strengthened its bargaining hand.
There were further extreme gains for Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) and hydrogen fuel cell maker   Plug Power   (NASDAQ:PLUG), as the flood of retail investors into both stocks continued to outweigh short positioning. Reuters reported on Wednesday that nearly one-third of Virgin Galactic’s free float was now shorted, but it still managed another 5.7% gain in early trading. Plug Power added another 2.6%.
Joining the party was online marketplace Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR), which rose 11% to its highest since last June’s rocky float. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts upgraded the stock earlier to overweight with a target price of $37, according to wire reports. That implies another 11% upside potential even after the morning’s move.
Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) rose 4.9% to an eight-year high after the company raised its dividend by 79%, offering further cost cuts and disposals to free up cash even as the price of the gold it mines hits a seven-year high.
Elsewhere, oil and gas stocks drew little comfort from the bounce in U.S. crude prices, with   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM),   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) all edging down. By contrast Williams (NYSE:WMB) rose 4.6% to its highest in four weeks after posting stronger-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock meanwhile pulled back 1% after extraordinary gains in recent sessions. A report that China may extend subsidies for electric vehicles beyond this year went largely overlooked.
In other markets, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, came off an earlier high of 99.817 that was its highest in nearly three years. By 10:20 AM ET, it was at 99.60, unchanged on the day."

The private equity firm will own 55% of Victoria's Secret, the world's best known specialty retailer for lingerie, while L Brands will keep a 45% stake. The Columbus, Ohio-based company's Bath & Body Works, which sells soaps and home fragrances, would be run as a standalone company.
Chief Executive Leslie Wexner, who bought Victoria's Secret in 1982 and shaped its image by hiring supermodels to wear jewel encrusted bras and wings at its annual fashion shows, will step down and hand over to Bath & Body Works executive Andrew Meslow.
Wexner, 82, will become chairman emeritus and Meslow, now chief operating officer at Bath & Body Works, will join the board. Three other directors, including the lead independent director, will be replaced.
The company's shares were down 3.5 in early trading at $23.45 after having climbed in the last weeks amid speculation that Sycamore would buy the ailing retailer.
The moves come after activist investor Barington Capital last year bought a small stake and urged the company to split fast growing Bath & Body Works from Victoria's Secret, push Wexner to give up his CEO position and refresh the board, where the majority of directors were men. Barington serves as an adviser to the company.
L Brands, which has a market valuation of about $7 billion, has seen sales dwindle at its Victoria's Secret business as it faces increased competition from online retailers. It has been criticized for an outdated brand image and for lingerie that was not inclusive of all body types.
The brand accounted for nearly half of the company's $13.24 billion revenue in 2019, but has seen sales decline for at least four quarters. Bath & Body Works' revenue has risen. 
""We believe this structure will allow Bath & Body Works to continue to achieve strong growth and receive its appropriate market valuation,"" said Wexner, who owns a 13.24% stake in L Brands and has been leading the company since 1963, making him the longest-serving CEO of a S&P 500 company.

The company last year canceled its fashion show and Edward Razek, its chief marketing officer, who was closely associated with the shows, left.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) plans to invest heavily in its newly combined retail and private banking business as it targets internationally minded customers in markets such as China, the United States and Singapore, the unit's Chief Executive Charlie Nunn told Reuters.
Nunn, a former McKinsey consultant who joined HSBC (HK:0005) in 2011, was one of the biggest winners in the banking group's latest management reshuffle, taking control of a division with $1.4 trillion in clients' assets.
The plan is to grow in the three major markets where HSBC has scale, namely Britain, Hong Kong and Mexico, focusing on mortgages, wealth and insurance products, and unsecured lending respectively.
HSBC will also target wealthier customers who travel or invest often overseas in more than 10 markets such as China where its share is smaller, Nunn said. He was speaking to Reuters in the first interview by a senior HSBC executive since the bank announced plans to cut 35,000 jobs and restructure.
""We're in some of the fastest-growing wealth markets in the world... the fact we now have a $1.4 trillion wealth business should be exciting for our customers and hopefully scary for our competitors,"" Nunn said.
Nunn is already making management changes. 
HSBC named Kevin Martin, head of Asia Pacific retail banking and wealth management, as the chief operating officer of the new global wealth and personal banking business, Reuters reported on Thursday. 
The wealth and personal banking division combined two of HSBC's better-performing businesses in 2019, growing adjusted profits by 19% and 15% respectively.
CHINESE DIASPORA
As part of its Asia expansion HSBC has hired some 800 frontline and support staff in wealth management since 2017, Nunn said, mainly product specialists and relationship managers for its private bank and 'Jade' offering for those with assets of $1 million-$5 million. 
""We remain committed to really trying to capture share and be more relevant in the Greater Bay area of China,"" Nunn said.
In an example of how the lender is targeting the global Chinese diaspora, HSBC has launched an international payment system allowing mainland Chinese customers to pay university fees directly, in renminbi, across 1,700 institutions worldwide.
HSBC interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn said on Tuesday the bank is combining wealth and personal banking so it can boost profits from the transfer of products and investment between the two.
HSBC will aim to expand a partnership with the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), to use its Aladdin investment management software in more markets.
The bank will also extend its Lombard lending product which allows customers to borrow against assets they hold with the bank, for example to buy property for a family member.
TOUGH COMPETITION
HSBC will face a tough challenge in its target markets, however, with domestic players dominating retail banking in the United States and China and global giants such as UBS (S:UBSG) ruling the market for wealthier clients.
While HSBC's British and Hong Kong retail banking businesses have powered its profits in recent years, in other markets such as France its sub-scale high street banking presence has been a drag on earnings.
The lender is attempting to sell that business, Reuters has previously reported. Nunn declined to comment on the progress of that strategic review but said a decision will be made in 1-2 months.
He also declined to comment on other markets such as Turkey, Greece and Oman, previously reported by Reuters as earmarked for exit.

""We'll continue to review markets on a case-by-case basis,"" Nunn said.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 08:07AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Westinghouse set to sign pact with Indian firm for nuclear reactors during Trump visit,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Neha Dasgupta
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Westinghouse is expected to sign a new agreement with state-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India for the supply of six nuclear reactors during U.S. President Donald Trump's visit next week, officials said, aiming to kickstart a long-running project.
The agreement will lay out timelines and the lead local constructor for the reactors to be built at Kovvada in southern India and also address lingering concerns over India's nuclear liability law.
The United States has been discussing the sale of nuclear reactors to energy-hungry India since a 2008 landmark civil nuclear energy pact and last year the two governments announced they were committed to the establishment of the six reactors.
Last week representatives from U.S. energy and commerce departments, Westinghouse, the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum and The Nuclear Energy Institute were in India for talks with government officials as part of a commercial mission to promote nuclear exports to India.
""We are encouraging moving forward with Westinghouse and NPCIL to sign a MoU. It certainly is a private industry to private industry, a business to business decision,"" Dr. Rita Baranwal assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy in the U.S. Department of Energy, told Reuters in a phone interview.
""We're optimistic that an MoU will be signed shortly,"" Baranwal, who was part of the mission, said. Once that is cleared the two sides will begin contract negotiations, delivery schedules and pick vendors. The plan for a new MoU has not been previously reported. 
Westinghouse did not respond to a request for comment nor did NPCIL. But Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said on Thursday Westinghouse and NPCIL were in talks to move forward with the project. 
""Following resolution of Westinghouse's bankruptcy issues, the two sides are in discussion regarding the division of responsibility of the work,"" he said. 
Trump has made bilateral trade with India a top priority, seeking greater market access for U.S. products from farm goods to motorcycles. Negotiators are trying to put together a limited trade deal before a bigger agreement that Trump said this week will probably happen after the U.S. presidential elections.
Lack of movement on the nuclear reactors has been a sensitive issue, another member of the U.S. delegation said, after Washington made an exception for India by agreeing to provide it civilian nuclear energy technology even though it has not given up its nuclear weapons program.
A longstanding obstacle has been the need to bring Indian liability rules in-line with international norms, which require the costs of any accident to be channeled to the operator rather than the maker of a nuclear power station.
Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse's plans to supply the AP1000 reactors to India which it has also sold to China were thrown into further doubt when it filed for bankruptcy in 2017 after cost overruns on U.S. reactors.
LIABILITY LAW
Canada's  Brookfield Asset Management  (TO:BAMa) bought Westinghouse from Toshiba in August 2018 and has sought progress on the India sale over the next six-seven months, the member of the U.S. delegation said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
India has made clear there is no going back on the 2010 Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage law that foreign governments and vendors say leaves open the possibility of lawsuits against suppliers for nuclear accidents, rather than the operators of the plants. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has tried to limit the impact of that law by setting up an insurance fund for potential victims of a nuclear accident.
""To be clear, there are still open issues around the liability issue,"" Baranwal said, adding it was part of the discussions last week. ""I can't say that it's been resolved. But we made some progress and understanding was that concerns were at a higher level.""
India expects to generate 22,480 MW of electricity from nuclear stations by 2031 up from the 2019 level of 6780 MW. 
But with renewable power dropping in price and the government's focus on solar power generation, there is a chance nuclear power will remain only small proportion of the country's energy mix where it stands at 1.9 percent.

V.K. Saraswat, a top member of the government think-tank Niti Aayog said while solar was top priority, the government remained committed to nuclear energy also, as a clean source.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 08:06AM ET</span>","Domino's U.S. same-store sales, profit beat estimates, shares jump 20%","(Reuters) - Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ) on Thursday reported quarterly U.S. same-store sales and profit above analysts' estimates, as its focus on faster delivery and new promotions to lure diners paid off, sending shares up nearly 20%.
Sales at its established U.S. restaurants rose 3.4% in the fourth quarter, beating estimates for the first time in over a year. Analysts had projected a rise of 2.3%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The pizza chain has been opening new stores, launching new menu items and offering faster deliveries to battle competition from rival pizzerias, mom-and-pop stores and aggregators such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, Postmates and GrubHub (N:GRUB).
As third-party delivery services make it easier for diners to order a variety of food to their door step at the touch of a button, chains like Domino's have been investing heavily to keep customers coming back for their fast service and offers.
As a part of these efforts, Domino's offered half off on menu-priced pizzas for online orders during the Cyber Monday week and also expanded its GPS delivery tracking technology across its U.S stores during the reported quarter.
""Our relentless focus on our customers, our franchisees ... helped us deliver a solid 2019 in the face of unique competitive headwinds,"" Chief Executive Officer Ritch Allison said. 
The Ann Arbor, Michigan-based company has also been aggressively opening new restaurants in a move it calls ""fortressing"" to facilitate faster delivery to more locations.
Rival Pizza Hut, owned by Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM), however, reported disappointing results earlier this month, as stiff competition took a bite out of sales.
At Domino's international same-store sales rose 1.7%, missing estimates of a 2.09% rise.
Net income rose to $129.3 million, or $3.12 per share, in the three months ended Dec. 29, from $111.6 million, or $2.62 per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $3.13 per share, 15 cents above expectations. 
Total revenue rose 6.3% to $1.15 billion, beating estimates of $1.13 billion.

The company's shares, which were last up 19.5% at $355 before the bell, are set to open at a record high on Thursday.

1438,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Goldman Sees High Risk of Stock Market Correction on Virus Complacency,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors may be underestimating the negative impact of the coronavirus on corporate earnings, which poses a threat to the stock market rally, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s chief equity strategist.
While coronavirus fears triggered a worldwide sell-off in January, the losses proved short-lived. Global equities are trading near record highs on optimism that the impact from the epidemic will be limited and China will step up support for its economy. Goldman’s Peter Oppenheimer cautions against complacency.
“Equity markets are looking increasingly exposed to near-term downward surprises to earnings growth,” Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman, wrote in a Feb. 19 note. “While a sustained bear market does not look likely, a near-term correction is looking much more probable.”
“Spillovers” from weaker Chinese demand are “dramatically more important” to regional and world economies compared with a decade or two earlier, and tourism alone accounts for 0.4% of global gross domestic product, according to Oppenheimer.
He estimates that a 1% drop in global sales-weighted GDP would cut European earnings by about 10%, turning them negative. The exposure of the Euro Stoxx 50 Index to China is about twice that of the S&P 500 due to such sectors as banks, automakers and luxury shares.
Companies too are starting to sound the alarm. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). said this week it would miss its sales targets for the quarter because of the fallout from the coronavirus.  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) SA last week cut its full-year growth forecast by about half, while today, Air France-KLM warned the outbreak will wipe as much as 200 million euros ($216 million) from earnings.
“In the context of relatively weak earnings growth, there’s probably too much complacency and we could see some negative earnings,” said Oppenheimer in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. “And valuations are vulnerable to a setback.”
While the odds of a short-term correction are high, the resilience of the global economic cycle is likely to be supportive for equity markets on a relative basis over the next year and beyond, according to Goldman.
Powerful monetary easing by central banks around the world, including policy moves by the likes of Russia and Mexico this year, in addition to lower bond yields have kept the equity bull run going despite coronavirus concerns. The MSCI All-Country World Index surged to a new all-time high last week and both U.S. and European benchmarks closed at records on Wednesday."
1439,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",Thomson Reuters close to naming ex-Nielsen president Hasker as CEO: sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli, Kenneth Li and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) -   Thomson Reuters  Corp  (TO:TRI) (N:TRI) is close to naming former Nielsen Holdings Plc (N:NLSN) president Steve Hasker as its next chief executive, succeeding Jim Smith, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The appointment of Hasker, a senior adviser at private equity firm TPG and former McKinsey & Co media consultant, could be announced as soon as Tuesday, when the Toronto-based company reports its fourth-quarter results, one of the sources said. 
Two sources cautioned that his appointment had not been finalized and the timing of an announcement could be slightly delayed. 
Hasker, 50, did not respond to requests for comment. 
In a statement on Wednesday, Thomson Reuters said no decision had been taken by the board yet, but the company will provide an update on the search process when it announces results. Thomson Reuters is the parent of Reuters News.
After the story was published on Thursday, Smith, 60, reiterated that no decision had been made by the board on new leadership. “This is part of our normal course succession planning and I am actively involved in the process,” Smith said in a memo to employees. “When the time comes to hand over the reins, you will hear it from me.”
The appointment of a new CEO will mark a turning point for Thomson Reuters, which is majority-owned by Canada’s Thomson family. Two sources familiar with the matter said the board wanted to recruit an executive who could chart a long-term growth strategy for the company. 
In recent years under Smith, Thomson Reuters had cut costs and shed some businesses as it recovered from the fallout of the financial crisis in 2008. 
In a transformative deal, Smith engineered the sale of a 55% stake in the company's financial division in 2018 to Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) that valued the business at $20 billion. Since then, Thomson Reuters' share price has more than doubled. Blackstone subsequently struck a deal to sell the unit, now called Refinitiv, to the  London Stock Exchange  Group Plc (L:LSE).
MEDIA INSIDER
Hasker is expected to prevail in the CEO search process over other internal and external candidates, including Thomson Reuters co-Chief Operating Officer Neil Masterson, one of the sources said.
Masterson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In focusing on Hasker, the board of Thomson Reuters considered his experience at Nielsen, best known for TV ratings, in running businesses that collect and analyze data, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
Hasker has been a media industry insider for more than two decades. Between 1998 and 2009, he was a media consultant at McKinsey, where he impressed David Calhoun, then the chief executive of Nielsen, according to a source familiar with the situation. 
Calhoun, now the chief executive of  Boeing Co  (N:BA), hired Hasker at Nielsen in 2009, where the executive rose to become president and chief operating officer.
After Nielsen, Hasker went to Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists Agency, where he served as a top executive until August 2019. CAA is a TPG portfolio company.
SEARCH PROCESS 
Hasker's appointment would conclude a succession planning process that began at least as far back as January 2019, when Thomson Reuters was interviewing executive search firms, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
Last October, in response to a report in the Financial Times, the company confirmed it was engaged in succession planning for Smith as ""a matter of good governance.” In a memo to employees at the time, Smith said he was “not planning to go anywhere soon.”

Smith joined Thomson as a journalist in 1987 and rose through the ranks to run its North American newspaper business, before the company divested it in 2000. He later led the company's professional businesses. Smith became CEO in 2012.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 07:34AM ET</span>",Volkswagen to resume talks over German class action on emissions,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and the German consumer protection organisation have agreed to resume talks aimed at reaching a deal in a class action lawsuit over the carmaker's rigging of diesel emissions tests.
VW admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests in 2015, a scandal which has cost it more than $30 billion in vehicle refits, fines and provisions. 
Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States, but VW has said there was no legal basis for consumers in Germany to seek compensation due to differences in law.
A court in the town of Brunswick, which has urged Volkswagen to settle the lawsuit, said on Thursday the parties to the case had agreed on the advice of the court to resume discussions to try to reach a settlement.
State-financed consumer protection organisation Vzbv said it had accepted the court invitation and said talks should take place soon. A Volkswagen spokesman confirmed the new talks, but declined to comment further.
Vzbv said it had not changed its demand that any settlement must be fair, transparent and verifiable.
Vzbv has said it aimed to show that owners of VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat cars with so-called type EA 189 diesel engines have been intentionally harmed by VW’s use of software that was used to cheat emissions tests.
The German class action was made possible after the cabinet approved a draft law in 2018 allowing consumer protection organisations to litigate on behalf of consumers, avoiding the high legal costs that might put people off legal action.
When the diesel scandal broke, 2.4 million cars with defeat devices were on German roads. In the meantime, most have received a software update.

Carmakers need to lower their output of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas blamed for global warming, but carmakers have struggled to meet stricter emissions goals as clients increasingly choose to buy heavier sports utility vehicles.
""The fleet average emissions will go down significantly in 2020, by around 20%,"" Peter told journalists at a roundtable discussion in Munich. BMW's fleet average emissions were 128 grams per kilometer in 2018, and just below that in 2019, he said.
In 2020, BMW's fleet average emissions will be just over 100 grams per kilometer and the carmaker will meet the emissions standards for 2021, thanks to higher sales of electrified vehicles and more efficient combustion engines, he said.
Peter reiterated that BMW expected to grow sales in 2020.
""We have started well into January and grew sales in China,"" Peter said, adding that the carmaker had sold around 175,000 cars in January."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks were set to open slightly lower on Thursday as reports of the spread of the coronavirus beyond China dented investor sentiment a day after two of the main indexes on Wall Street closed at fresh record highs.
At 6:45 AM ET (1145 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 edged down 0.1% while futures for the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones were down a similar amount.
China announced a steep drop in the number of new cases of the virus overnight and the country’s central bank lowered its benchmark lending interest rate amid ongoing efforts to offset the economic impact of the epidemic.
But South Korea recorded an increase in new cases, Japan reported two deaths and new research indicated the virus may spread more easily than previously believed, alarming investors.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose to record closing highs on Wednesday as hopes for additional monetary stimulus by China had eased concerns about the economic fallout from the virus in what is the world’s second largest economy.
Wednesday’s minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's January policy meeting showed policymakers were cautiously optimistic about their ability to hold interest rates steady this year while acknowledging new risks caused by the virus outbreak.

In foreign exchange markets, the dollar remained broadly stronger. Against a basket of currencies, the greenback rose to its highest level since May 2017, while the steep decline in the yen cast its status as a safe haven investment into doubt, at least temporarily.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Lenovo Group (HK:0992), the world's biggest PC maker, posted a better than expected profit on Thursday and said its global operations would help it tackle short-term headwinds from China's coronavirus outbreak, sending its shares up 7%.
The Chinese company reported an 11% rise in net profit for its third quarter ended December to $258 million thanks to strong demand for its PCs and smart devices, beating an average $223 million estimate of seven analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue rose to a record $14.1 billion.
""The numbers are very good,"" said Christopher Yim, analyst at BOCOM International, adding that the PC business' profitability was impressive.
Lenovo is among companies facing disruptions to their supply chain after local governments in China extended a Lunar New Year holiday and imposed strict travel curbs to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
IPhone maker Apple (O:AAPL) warned earlier this week it will not be able to meet sales forecasts for the current quarter as the virus outbreak was pressuring its supply chain.
One of Lenovo's biggest factories is in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where businesses remain shut.
A shortage of workers and difficulties faced by Lenovo's component suppliers are among the biggest bottlenecks, but the company was increasing production at overseas facilities it has in Brazil, United States, India and Japan to mitigate some of the impact, Lenovo's Chairman Yang Yuanqing told Reuters.
He said he was confident that the majority, if not all, of production at the firm's Shenzhen and Hefei facilities, which produce most of its PCs, would resume by the end of the month.
Given current infection trends, he is also optimistic that the company could see production fully recover by end-March. China reported on Thursday a sharp drop in new cases but the data was partly attributable to a change in how it diagnoses the virus, which has killed about 2,100 people and infected some 75,000.
Demand from China in the current quarter would be hit but the company would be buffered as the country only accounts for 25% of the company's overall business, he said.
""Another good thing is that this quarter is not Lenovo's peak quarter, the peak quarter was Q3, last quarter, so that means that the impact on our shipments would be less than last quarter even though we cannot 100% recover our capacity,"" Yang said.
The global PC market grew 2.3% in the quarter to December, as customers replaced machines to migrate to Windows 10, market research firm Gartner said last month. Lenovo took a 24.8% market share during the quarter, ahead of rivals HP Inc (N:HPQ) and Dell, it said.
The year began on a positive note for Lenovo after an early January interim agreement between Washington and Beijing eased 18 months of U.S.-China trade tensions.
Laptop computers were among $156 billion worth of Chinese goods that Washington had threatened to hit with tariffs in December, along with cellphones and toys, which U.S. President Donald Trump later decided not to implement."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares in affiliates of HNA Group surged on Thursday following a news report that China plans to take over the debt-laden conglomerate as the coronavirus outbreak has further hit its ability to meet financial obligations.
The government of the southern province of Hainan, where HNA [HNAIRC.UL] is based, is in talks to take control of the group and sell off its airline assets, Bloomberg said on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
HNA, which controls or holds stakes in a number of domestic carriers including its flagship Hainan Airlines (SS:600221), did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.
China's aviation regulator said last week it would support restructuring or mergers to help airlines cope with the fallout of the epidemic, which has prompted carriers to cancel thousands of flights.
The Bloomberg report said that under the plan most of HNA's airline assets would be sold to China's three top carriers -  Air China  Ltd (SS:601111) (HK:0753), China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co (SS:600029) (HK:1055) and China Eastern Airlines Corp (SS:600115) (HK:0670).
Air China and China Eastern are prepared to hold talks, but a deal could take time as the industry also battles the fallout from the virus outbreak, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Air China and China Eastern did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China Southern declined to comment.
Shares in Hainan Airlines, HNA Innovation (SS:600555) and HNA Investment Group (SZ:000616) closed up by their 10% daily limit after the news report of the planned takeover.
HNA Technology (SS:600751), Bohai Leasing (SZ:000415) and HNA Infrastructure Investment Group (SS:600515) posted gains in a range of 3.9% to 8.8%. Hong Kong-listed stocks linked to HNA also rose.
Heavily indebted HNA Group has restructured jet orders with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) in a deal that includes an order for dozens of A330neo jets, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
TOUGH OUTLOOK
HNA Group was once one of China's most aggressive dealmaking firms, spending $50 billion on acquisitions that included stakes in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Hilton Worldwide  (N:HLT), and prime property in New York, Sydney and San Francisco.
Its total borrowings were 706.7 billion yuan ($100.6 billion) as of the end of June, data filed to the government shows.
""HNA does have money to pay back but the money is actually within its subsidiaries, which they cannot draw on to pay back the bondholders,"" said Warut Promboon, head of credit research at Bondcritic.
""There are still bonds coming due and if the government is taking it over, we believe they have to honour the debt.""
HNA began unwinding many acquisitions to focus on its core airlines and tourism businesses after racking up high levels of debt and drawing regulatory scrutiny.
But the prices HNA has sought and the complex structures, loans and other business bonds among its holdings have made it tough to unwind them, bankers said.
In December, Chairman Chen Feng said the firm had delayed some salary payments in 2019 because of cash flow shortages, but vowed to resolve liquidity risks in 2020.
However, the virus outbreak has pressured its core airline business this year, with Hong Kong Airlines, part-owned by HNA, announcing a plan to cut 400 jobs this month."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Electric vehicles have charged up investments around the world, but Australia is reveling in a slew of deals involving old-school petrol stations, with a bidding battle developing for one of its top fuel retailers, Caltex Australia (AX:CTX).
A shake-up in the structure of the fuel industry over the past decade, sparked by refinery closures and oil major retreats, has produced deals worth $33 billion including offers for Caltex, according to Refinitiv data. That's made petrol stations a reliable earner for the country's dealmakers.
That restructuring created four fuel retailing leaders -  BP  (L:BP), Caltex and supermarkets Coles (AX:COL) and Woolworths (AX:WOW), each with about 14-16% of the market - yet leaving enough opportunities to lure independents, too, in a market worth tens of billions of dollars a year.
""Australia is a high-quality 'short',"" said a banker involved in the tussle for Caltex, using the industry term for a market short on fuel and referring to Australia's stable demand. He declined to be named as the bidding war is ongoing.
Caltex on Wednesday said privately owned British retailer EG Group had offered A$3.9 billion ($2.59 billion) for its convenience stores, plus shares in a new listed infrastructure and refinery company made up of Caltex's remaining assets.
The offer pits EG, which entered the market last year with the purchase of some sites from Woolworths, against Canadian convenience store giant Alimentation Couche-Tard (TO:ATDb), which has offered A$8.8 billion in cash for all of Caltex.
Both bidders are focused on Caltex's convenience stores, seen as the most profitable side of fuel retailing.
""There are a number of reasons why Caltex is quite an attractive business despite the market being broadly competitive,"" said one banker not involved in the bids, pointing to its solid market position and also the value of its real estate.
Caltex did not disclose what EG's whole offer, including the infrastructure assets, was worth.
EG declined to comment on its proposal.
COMPETITION CONCERNS
Key for EG - and future deals - will be the thinking of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which has been active in encouraging new entrants into the market.
In 2017 it blocked the sale to BP of Woolworths sites, and in 2010 it stopped Caltex buying Exxon's portfolio.
Independent operators now hold 25% of the market, according to the watchdog's latest data up to 2017 - a proportion that has jumped sharply since, with EG's $1.25 billion purchase of the former Woolworths sites.
While EG benefited from the ACCC blocking Woolworths' sale to BP, its latest bid could run into similar resistance, analysts and bankers said. The deal would take its market share to around 30%.
""We think at this stage Couche remains in the box seat, but this situation looks to have plenty left in it to run,"" RBC analyst Ben Wilson said in a note on Wednesday.
But there may be a wildcard on the horizon - global energy major  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX).
Chevron, which quit Australian fuel markets in 2015, made a surprise re-entry last December with the $288 million purchase of Puma Energy's sites. Those fuel stations have given Chevron roughly a 3% market share, spawning speculation it may want to expand.
Chevron declined to comment on its intentions.
""For Chevron it would be logical, given they've just bought a similar business and they're obviously in the market looking and they know the business pretty well,"" said the banker not involved in the bids."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar trampled everything in its path on Thursday after a steep and sudden slide in the Japanese yen called into question its safe haven status and others from the euro to the Australian dollar were all knocked over.
The dollar has surged almost 2% since Tuesday against the yen, reaching its highest in almost 10 months, and climbed to near three-year highs against the euro. 
Its DXY index against the world’s most traded currencies, which is up 3.6%, rose overnight to its highest since May 2017. It also gained to its best levels of the year against China’s offshore yuan and MSCI’s index of emerging- market currencies.
A host of reasons were cited for the move, among them the outperformance of U.S. economic and earnings numbers and worries over the threat of recessions in Japan and the euro zone. 
""I think this has really brought into focus the role the dollar is playing as a safe haven,"" said Rabobank senior currency strategist Jane Foley. Japan's proximity to China's coronavirus problems and recent poor economic data there had also turned markets off the yen, she said.
China had reported a drop in new virus cases and announced an interest rate cut to buttress its economy. But South Korea recorded an increase in new case, Japan reported two deaths, and researchers said the pathogen seemed to spread more easily than previously believed. 
European stock markets opened little changed. London, Frankfurt and Paris markets were flat to 0.3% lower after the first hour of trading. (EU)
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.3%, led by drops on Hong Kong's Hang Seng and South Korea's KOSPI. Wall Street futures for the S&P 500 were lower.
DOLLAR BULLS 
The yen had been undermined by a run of weak data this week, but traders were unnerved when it blew past a support level at 110.30 per dollar.
It dropped nearly 1.4% against the dollar, its sharpest fall in six months, and 2% against the Norwegian krone - its sharpest daily drop in almost three years. 
The euro slipped 0.1% lower to $1.079. Its 3.7% plunge since the start of the year is its worst start to a year since 2015. 
""Nearness to China and dependence on China have not helped the yen as a risk-off. We have seen the yen and gold diverging for a while and this may not be the end of it,"" said Shafali Sachdev, head of FX in Asia at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Wealth Management.
""The kind of classic correlations between U.S. yields and the yen, those have been kind of breaking down ... we need to see past this virus situation to see whether the yen will regain its safe-haven status.""
The skittish mood had investors dumping Asian currencies. The Singapore dollar dropped to an almost three-year low and the Korean won weakened past 1,200 to the dollar.
The Australian dollar fell 0.6% to an 11-year low of $0.6633 after a surprise rise in unemployment. [AUD/]
Bonds were slightly firmer, oil prices held overnight gains that lifted Brent to near $60 a barrel [O/R] and gold remained around $1,609 per ounce.
""Markets have taken a step back because the authorities won't do any major stimulus until they are completely sure the virus has stopped"" said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong.

""There's no point in doing it when people are sitting at home. They can't even spend the money or use it.""

1452,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 05:08AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Air France, Maersk Flesh out Europe's Virus Concerns","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It’s conventional wisdom that Europe’s companies are more exposed to economic spillovers from the coronavirus outbreak than U.S. ones. China accounts for more of eurozone exports than of U.S. ones, and the eurozone in particular does not share the U.S. economy’s twin props of expansive fiscal policy and robust domestic demand.
So while the U.S. stock market was happy to shrug off Apple’s revenue warning earlier this week, European markets are evidently struggling more to look through the short-term impact of the outbreak.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 index was down 0.2% at 432.94 by 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT) on Thursday, after a string of disappointing corporate updates in which the virus figured prominently.
Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) fell 5.5% after saying the virus would cut operating profit by as much as 200 million euros ($215 million) in Q1. It didn’t help that the group entered the year on a weak footing, with falling freight traffic and slowing passenger revenue growth. The promise that the group’s full-year fuel bill would fall by 300 million euros, or 5.5%, due to the drop in oil prices, barely helped.
The news also dragged Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) down 2.7%, but short-haul specialists – for whom the fuel issue is more important than Chinese travel trends – outperformed.
Covid-19 was also visible in the results of AP Moeller-Maersk (OTC:AMKBY), the Danish shipping company that operates the world’s biggest container fleet. Maersk warned of a “very, very weak February” and a “weak” March but chief executive Soren Skou told the Financial Times that he expected a “sharp rebound” in global trade from April, as China’s factories get back to normal.
Skou added that on current trends, the virus would “not have been a huge event for us.”
Maersk stock, a bellwether for global trade, rose as much as 4.0% to its highest in over a month before paring gains as the market remembered Maersk also forecast a drop in underlying operating profit this year and warned of “low visibility”.
Together with reports of spreading infections in South Korea, the reports pushed other China-sensitive sectors such as luxury and travel lower too.
There were other losses unrelated to China. French insurance giant AXA (MI:AXA) fell to the bottom of the CAC 40, losing 2.6% after it said it will replace the head of its XL reinsurance business after an expensive year for natural disaster claims. The news revived concerns that the company paid too much for XL two years ago. Fellow insurer   Swiss Re   (SIX:SRENH) was also fell 3.9% after its annual results were hit by heavy catastrophe losses from Typhoon Hagibis, Australia’s wild fires and the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX disasters and subsequent grounding.
The morning’s biggest gainers were both health care names, with Germany’s Fresenius (NYSE:FMS) and the U.K.’s Smith & Nephew (LON:SN) both beating expectations with their fourth-quarter numbers. Behind them came UBS (NYSE:UBS) and ING Group (NYSE:ING), which both rose on the news that the Swiss giant had appointed ING's Ralph Hamers, a renowned specialist in digital banking, as it new CEO."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) forecast another year of growth in 2020, saying the company was well-placed to take advantage of increased defence spending that could help to offset any future impact from a German ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia.
Full-year results announced on Thursday at the upper end of forecasts, helped to drive shares 3.5% higher at 664.6 pence by 0954 GMT.
The maker of Typhoon fighters, combat vehicles and Astute Class nuclear-powered attack submarines, has been affected by a German ban announced in 2019 on exporting arms to Saudi Arabia.
The export ban has put a question mark over a multi-billion pound deal to sell 48 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Riyadh, built by a BAE-led consortium that also includes MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) and Airbus (PA:AIR).
CEO Charles Woodburn shrugged off its impact, saying there were other opportunities.
""A number of European countries are looking to increase their defence spending and move closer to meeting their NATO commitments. The group is well-positioned to benefit,"" he told reporters on Thursday.
The company expects Germany to order more of its Typhoon jets, anticipates higher sales at European missile maker MBDA, in which it owns a stake, and new orders for its Swedish-based land vehicle business.
Woodburn also predicted business in the Middle East, despite the difficulties in Saudi Arabia.
""Within the Middle East region, there are a number of other customers in addition to Saudi, who I think in future will be looking at additional Typhoons,"" he said. Oman, Kuwait and Qatar are existing customers.
The Typhoon, whose full name is the Eurofighter Typhoon, is the most important combat aircraft in BAE Systems' portfolio.
'RENEWED LIFE'
BAE said its earnings per share would grow by a mid-single digit percentage next year. The group also said on Thursday it would make a 1 billion pound ($1.29 billion) one-off payment into its pension scheme in the coming months, funded by debt.
Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said he was encouraged the company had addressed its pension deficit.
""We figure there is certainly renewed life at BAE,"" he said.
BAE's earnings per share were 45.8 pence for 2019, at the upper end of a forecast for a mid-single digit rise on 2018's 42.9 pence, helped by an improved operational performance, after a focus on boosting performance in its U.S. combat vehicle unit, and a slightly lower tax rate.
BAE's results this year could exceed forecasts, as they exclude any boost from two U.S. acquisitions totalling $2.2 billion, which it announced in January and which should be completed this year."

(Reuters) - European shares eased from record highs on Thursday, as a raft of disappointing earnings added to fears about the global impact of the coronavirus outbreak after research suggested it was more contagious than previously thought.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) shed 0.3%, led by a 1.2% fall in insurance stocks (SXIP) after  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) posted a lower-than-expected annual profit. The reinsurer's shares dropped 4.2% to a two-week low.
A 4.6% fall for Spain's  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) weighed on the benchmark index after the telecoms group said one-off charges in Mexico and Argentina hurt its annual profit.
The stock was also the biggest decliner on the Spanish bourse (IBEX).
Joining a growing list of companies to put a number on the impact from the coronavirus epidemic, Franco-Dutch airline Air France-KLM SA (PA:AIRF) forecast an earnings hit of as much as 200 million euros ($216 million) by April. Its shares fell 6.5%.
Although recent figures have pointed to a slowdown in the outbreak in China, new cases in South Korea have rattled global equity markets and sparked fears that the virus might be harder to contain. [MKTS/GLOB]
Analysts said European equity investors were in a wait-and watch mode ahead of flash readings of the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) on manufacturing activity in the euro zone, due on Friday.
""You've got the manufacturing PMIs tomorrow, which is probably the most important figure this week because they may show the early impact of the coronavirus on demand and the supply chain,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 04:52AM ET</span>",Walmart's struggling Japan unit finally delivers with online grocery growth,"By Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) might finally have found the sweet spot in Japan's food market with a fast-growing venture ranked third in a nascent online grocery sector, as the brick-and-mortar stores it bought into two decades ago continue their search for profit.
The barely year-old tie-up between the U.S. supermarket chain's Seiyu and local e-commerce firm  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755) clocked 30% sales growth for late October through December versus the same period a year earlier when Seiyu was going it alone, said Rakuten Seiyu NetSuper Chief Executive Tamae Takeda.
""We're doing even better since the start of the new year,"" Takeda told Reuters. Concerns over the ongoing coronavirus epidemic may be encouraging people to try the service, she said. ""People aren't really wanting to go out.""
The change in fortune is a boost for Walmart as it steps up its rivalry with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) in its home market where retailers are racing to deliver online orders faster.
It also demonstrates that greater confidence in online services and improved logistics can win over Japanese shoppers often considered too picky about freshness to buy produce through the internet, analysts said.
Helping drive overall growth, Takeda said, was demand for time-saving solutions, particularly as an increasing proportion of mothers work. Government data showed over 70% of Japanese women with children under 18 work, versus 50% just 20 years ago.
Helping the venture in particular is Seiyu's access to Rakuten's 99 million members, expanding its reach beyond its 333 stores. Rakuten, in turn, has benefited from Seiyu's ties with local suppliers, helping it fight back against Amazon.com.
Together, they are able to better ease the pressure of a shrinking labour market which has driven up delivery costs and prompted Seiyu's rivals such as Uny, owned by Pan Pacific International Holdings Corp (T:7532), to abandon e-commerce.
PROFIT IN SIGHT
Seiyu entered e-commerce in 2000, an early start which analysts said helped propel it to third place in the online grocery sector. It trails only bigger supermarkets Aeon Co Ltd (T:8267) and Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd's (T:3382) Ito-Yokado, and is ahead of Amazon, showed a Statista consumer poll.
Takeda declined to disclose user numbers or sales, but also placed the venture third. The former McKinsey & Co consultant said profitability was ""in sight"" although the venture would prioritise growth for another two to three years.
That contrasts with Walmart's overall story in the country.
The U.S. firm entered Japan in 2002 buying 6% of Seiyu, building up its stake before a full takeover in 2008. It slashed costs and closed unprofitable stores but has mostly recorded losses.
Many expected it to go the way of foreign peers including Britain's  Tesco  PLC (L:TSCO) and France's  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR) which bowed out of Japan. Last year, Walmart moved to end on-and-off speculation of an imminent exit, saying it hoped to eventually list Seiyu while retaining a majority stake.
Meanwhile, growth online has prompted Seiyu's venture to plan a second logistics centre for this year to bolster scale and efficiency - considered crucial to offset delivery costs. Takeda said the company was discussing setting up more.
That is in expectation of online shopping accounting for 10% of households' 60 trillion yen ($539 billion) grocery spending from around 2.5%, she said, without giving a time frame.
""It is true that Japanese people appreciate fresh food. But people are realising you don't have to go to the supermarket to get fresh food,"" said Roy Larke at researcher JapaneseConsuming. ""Long term, we will get there.""

1457,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 03:36AM ET</span>",UK watchdog to review how companies report on climate change,"By Simon Jessop and Muvija M
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial accounting watchdog plans to review how companies and auditors assess and report the impact of climate change on their businesses, as investors push for better disclosure of the risks.
Climate change has surged to the top of the agenda for investors as policymakers demand companies step up efforts to help drive the global transition to a low-carbon economy.
""Not only do boards of UK companies have a responsibility to report their impact on the environment and the risks of climate change to their business, but investors expect them to operate sustainably,"" Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Chief Executive Jon Thompson said in a statement.
""Auditors have a responsibility to properly challenge management to assess and report the impact of climate change on their business.""
Yet many money managers are concerned that the information they are given by companies, and the accounts signed off by auditors, do not give a full picture of the risks, leaving them at risk of steep losses.
In response, the FRC said its review will look into the extent to which British companies and auditors are responding to climate-related issues to ensure reporting requirements are being met.
The FRC said it would check company reports and accounts for their compliance with reporting requirements, and audits to see how auditors reflect climate risk, both in terms of the judgments they make and any related disclosures.
As well as assessing how much resource auditors such as KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC devote to evaluating the impact of climate change, it would also evaluate the quality of future risk disclosures under Britain's new Corporate Governance Code.
Getting a measure of the longer-term risks posed by climate change, including through the provision of better data and more rigorous stress-testing under a range of scenarios, is increasingly a central concern of global policymakers.
Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who leaves in the coming weeks to take up a role as climate envoy at the United Nations, has said the issue will be an area of focus at the United Nations' climate conference in Glasgow in November.
Carney has also championed the roll-out of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework, which helps companies frame their climate-related risks in a more structured way, and has suggested it could become compulsory.
Ahead of that, the FRC said it would evaluate whether the Financial Reporting Lab’s recommendation for companies to report in line with the TCFD had been adopted."
1458,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 02:47AM ET</span>",Maersk Says Outlook Hit by Uncertainty Due to Coronavirus,"(Bloomberg) --
A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, the world’s largest container shipping company, said 2020 will be marred by “considerable uncertainties” due to the outbreak of the coronavirus and its impact on global trade.
The Copenhagen-based company expects its operating profit, or Ebitda, to reach about $5.5 billion this year, less than the $5.94 billion estimated by analysts.
Maersk said it expects a “weak start to the year,” due to the fallout of the virus, according to its fourth-quarter report on Thursday.
“The outlook for 2020 is impacted by the current outbreak of the coronavirus in China, which has significantly lowered visibility.”
Per Hansen, an investment economist at Nordnet in Copenhagen, called Maersk’s outlook “disappointing,” and said the fourth-quarter numbers were also “worse than expected.” He pointed to “loads of uncertainties,” including U.S.-China trade disputes and the fallout of the coronavirus on freight rates.
In 2019, Ebitda reached $5.71 billion, just shy of the $5.78 billion analysts had predicted.
Chief Executive Officer Soren Skou said the company’s “financial performance improved” last quarter, “albeit only marginally.”
“Despite weaker market conditions we were able to improve profitability and cash flow,” he said.
The coronavirus adds to a litany of challenges for the container shipping industry, which is already grappling with the fallout of U.S.-China trade tensions as well as persistent oversupply.
Since its outbreak, the coronavirus has disrupted global supply chains and hurt shipowners, as China grows into the maritime industry’s main source of cargo with 90% of all global trade moving by sea.

Maersk said it expects global sea-borne container growth to be 1-3% in 2020 compared with 1.4% in 2019. The company expects its own growth rate to be in line “or slightly lower” than the market.
Maersk also listed new low-sulfur fuel that the industry has been forced to use from last month as an uncertainty that could impact bunker fuel prices and freight rates in 2020. It noted “weaker macroeconomic conditions” as an external uncertainty factor.
Maersk shares are down 11% this year compared with a 4% gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Maersk, which operates a fifth of the world’s container fleet, has in recent years tried to reduce its reliance on sea-borne shipping.
On Wednesday, the company said it agreed to buy U.S. warehousing and distribution company, Performance Team, as part of its strategy to expand land-based transport services. The deal is valued at $545 million.
These were some of the other highlights from Maersk’s annual report:
FY revenue $38.9 billion, estimate $39.28 billion (range $38.56 billion to $39.97 billion)FY Ebit $1.73 billion, estimate $1.76 billion (range $1.54 billion to $1.96 billion)FY underlying profit $546 millionFY dividend per share DKK150(Adds details from report in last paragraph, analyst comment)"

Futures on the S&P 500 Index were down along with the offshore yuan after the Japanese report. The dollar rose against most Asian currencies, and held near the strongest against major counterparts since May 2017. Australia’s dollar reached its lowest against the greenback since the global financial crisis after a monthly jobs report underscored slack that may keep monetary policy easy. Treasuries edged up.
Japan’s Topix earlier climbed as much as 1.2% after an overnight tumble in the yen boosted prospects for exporter earnings. The yen slumped past 111 per dollar with little immediate trigger; market participants ascribed a host of reasons, ranging from disappointing economic news to early positioning before the fiscal year-end next month. The currency Thursday took back a sliver of the biggest losses since August.
While the number of new coronavirus cases in China continues to come down -- epicenter-province Hubei reported a steep drop Thursday, though that was tied at least in part to another change in methodology -- those outside are sparking alarm. Japan, which has come under criticism for insufficient efforts to contain the disease, said two people from a quarantined ship have died.
“Over the next couple of months we are going to see very bad economic data coming out of China and the rest of the Asian markets,” Suresh Tantia, senior investment strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), told Bloomberg TV in Singapore. “Analysts are likely to revise down the earnings estimates. So, after this rebound, we don’t see much value in Asian markets.”

Investing.com - Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX:QAN) said it is reducing its flight services in Asia and halting recruitment due to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China. 
 
In a statement, Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said the airline could extend the cuts, or “add seats back” if demand resumes. 
 
The airline had already trimmed capacity to Hong Kong in response to anti-government protests last year.
 
In an interview with Bloomberg, Joyce said Qantas could double its capacity cuts if fallout from the virus deteriorates. 
 
“When this is over, there will be pent-up demand,” Joyce said. “When the market does recover, we certainly want to be flying the entire fleet.”
 
Separately, the airline said its first-half profit fell less than estimates. Underlying profit fell 0.5% to A$771 million, compared to the expected A$754 million. 
 
The company’s shares surged 5.5% to A6.64 by 12:10 AM ET (04:10 GMT).

Brand management company Authentic Brands said on Wednesday it and mall owner Simon Property would own 37.5% each of the retailer, while Brookfield Property would buy 25% of the intellectual property and operating businesses.
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Forever 21, which has 593 stores in 57 countries, will continue to operate in U.S. and international markets, Authentic Brands said.
Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, making it another victim of the rising popularity of online shopping and changing fashion trends dictated by millennial shoppers.
The retailer's current, owned store operations in Central America, South America, Mexico, the Philippines, and the Caribbean would be converted to a licensed partnership model.

Investing.com - Asian markets were mixed on Thursday in Asia after China cut its loan prime rate (LPR) as expected. 
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.5% by 10:59 PM ET (02:59 GMT). The Shenzhen Component rose 1.3%.
The 1-year LPR was reduced by 10 basis point, while the 5-year rate was reduced by 5 basis points, the People’s Bank of China announced today. The decisions were in line with expectations. 
""The fundamentals of China's economy have not changed,"" the People's Bank of China said. ""China's economy, however, also faces several challenges but will fend off major financial risks.""
On the coronavirus front, China’s National Health Commission reported an additional 114 deaths, and 394 new confirmed cases as of Feb. 19.That brings the total deaths in the mainland to 2,118 and the confirmed cases to 74,576 cases.
The lowered number of new cases were largely due to new measures introduced by Beijing that would allow Hubei to remove those in the “clinically diagnosed” category, according to CNBC.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 11:14PM ET</span>",Google plans to move UK users' accounts outside EU jurisdiction,"By Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google is planning to move its British users' accounts out of the control of European Union privacy regulators, placing them under U.S. jurisdiction instead, the company confirmed late on Wednesday.
Reuters had reported the plans earlier on Wednesday, citing people familiar with them. 
The shift, prompted by Britain's exit from the EU, will leave the sensitive personal information of tens of millions with less protection and within easier reach of British law enforcement.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google intends to require its British users to acknowledge new terms of service including the new jurisdiction, according to people familiar with the plans.
""Nothing about our services or our approach to privacy will change, including how we collect or process data, and how we respond to law enforcement demands for users' information,” Google said in an emailed statement. “The protections of the UK GDPR will still apply to these users.""
A spokesman declined to answer questions.
Ireland, where Google and other U.S. tech companies have their European headquarters, is staying in the EU, which has one of the world's most aggressive data protection rules, the General Data Protection Regulation.
Google has decided to move its British users out of Irish jurisdiction because it is unclear whether Britain will follow GDPR or adopt other rules that could affect the handling of user data, the people said. 
If British Google users have their data kept in Ireland, it would be more difficult for British authorities to recover it in criminal investigations. 
The recent Cloud Act in the United States, however, is expected to make it easier for British authorities to obtain data from U.S. companies. Britain and the United States are also on track to negotiate a broader trade agreement.
Beyond that, the United States has among the weakest privacy protections of any major economy, with no broad law despite years of advocacy by consumer protection groups.
Google has amassed one of the largest stores of information about people on the planet, using the data to tailor services and sell advertising.
Google could also have had British accounts answer to a British subsidiary, but has opted not to, the people said.
Lea Kissner, Google's former lead for global privacy technology, said she would have been surprised if the company had kept British accounts controlled in an EU country with the United Kingdom no longer a member.
""There's a bunch of noise about the U.K. government possibly trading away enough data protection to lose adequacy under GDPR, at which point having them in Google Ireland's scope sounds super-messy,"" Kissner said.
""Never discount the desire of tech companies not be caught in between two different governments.""
In coming months, other U.S. tech companies will have to make similar choices, according to people involved in internal discussions elsewhere.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which has a similar set-up to Google, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 10:26PM ET</span>",Manufacturers entangled in logistical nightmare as virus-hit China limps back to work,"By Josh Horwitz and Chayut Setboonsarng
SHANGHAI/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Blocked highways. Stranded workers. Dwindling supplies. Shipping and air freight companies also hamstrung.
The Chinese manufacturing engine that powers much of the world economy is struggling to restart after an extended Lunar New Year break, hindered by travel and quarantine restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus epidemic and still in place in many parts of the country.
Case in point: in the southern China manufacturing hub of Dongguan, a factory that makes vaporizers and other products had just half of its workforce of 40 last week and was struggling to function without key personnel.
""The quality inspectors, they're all out,"" said Renaud Anjoran, who runs the factory. ""One is stuck in Hubei, the other is in an area with no transportation open.""
Anjoran said other Dongguan manufacturers were also scrambling with half their normal staff levels, with some having even less than that.
The problems are exacerbating pain inflicted by loss of business from the U.S.-China trade war and present huge logistical challenges as companies, many dependent on migrant workers, grapple with a myriad of restrictions that differ by province, city and local district.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Monday rescinded a quarterly sales target made just weeks ago, saying the ramp up of factories in China was slower than anticipated.  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) have had to suspend some production - not just in China but also at home - for lack of parts.
Some smaller firms, particularly in Southeast Asia and reliant on supplies from China, are having to make tough decisions.
Taiwan's Sica New Materials abruptly shut its factory in Thailand at the end of January, laying off about 350 workers.
""They couldn't produce because raw materials weren't being sent from China,"" said Pairote Panthakarn from the government's welfare and labor protection office in Kanchanaburi province, where the factory is located. Sica New Materials did not respond to a request for comment.
Sinoproud Cambodia Garments Co Ltd, whose customers include fashion retailer Zara's parent  Inditex  (MC:ITX), told Reuters it may scale back production as stocks of fabric were getting low.
""We hope we get the product in March and if we don't get the product in March, we might just have to cut back and put the workers on half pay,"" said general manager Tu Ailan.
Nearly half of 109 U.S. companies responding to a poll by Shanghai's American Chamber of Commerce said plant shutdowns have already had an impact on their supply chains, while almost all of the remainder expect an impact within the next month.
The outbreak, slow pace of business resumption and its impact on the global economy is set to dominate discussions at this weekend's G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Riyadh, though Chinese counterparts will not attend as they focus on efforts to limit the fallout.
The coronavirus, described by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva as a global health emergency and ""our most pressing uncertainty"" is set to knock 0.5 percentage points off global growth in the first quarter for a growth rate of 2.5%,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists estimate. They predict China's GDP will expand just 4.2% in the quarter from a year earlier, down from 6% in last quarter.
FREIGHT ACHES
Even if factories have enough workers, the transportation of supplies and finished goods has also been a major headache.
""The resumption of motor transport is very slow and curbs production,"" said an executive at a steel mill in the eastern province of Shandong, citing insufficient drivers and a plethora of checkpoints slowing down traffic.
""The situation is easing now, but total recovery might need to wait till the end of the month,"" said the executive who was not authorized to speak to media and declined to identified.
The shortage of workers at Chinese ports has resulted in fewer calls from container shipping lines, a situation likely to result in months of delivery delays, while some air cargo firms such as Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) have reduced services in response to crew health concerns and uncertain demand.
FedEx Corp (N:FDX) told Reuters it was starting to see a slow pick-up in demand and that it was in discussions with many local governments as there were different restrictions in different cities.
The magnitude of the challenges presented by the new coronavirus crisis is much greater than SARS in the early 2000s, said Karen Reddington, president of FedEx Express Asia Pacific.
""China is so much more connected, the fact that China now represents so much of the world's economy I think that's why, it seems so much more impactful at this time,"" she said.
Mathieu Montelon, general manager of France's Bigben Interactive, which makes smartphone accessories in the southeast province of Guangdong, said the disruptions underscored the complexity of inter-connected supply chains.
""Even when the factory is in a position to open and take orders, their subcontractors might have issue with other local authorities, so they cannot open, or they don’t have the workers,"" he said.
He added that Bigben is switching up the mix of products it offers retailers, pushing goods made in other countries less affected by the virus.
Others are looking at more drastic action, accelerating a broader shift of production out of China that took off with the trade war.
Anjoran, the operator of the factory in Dongguan, is considering setting up a second assembly center in Mexico to serve U.S. customers with minimal reliance on China.
""People are seeing China as a major source of risk,"" he said."
1468,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 10:22PM ET</span>","U.S. meeting on Huawei, China policy still on for Thursday despite Trump tweets: sources","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A meeting of U.S. government officials to discuss further curbs on exports to Huawei and China is still on for Thursday, two sources said, despite pushback from President Donald Trump against the restrictions.
The deputy-level meeting was called to discuss proposals including possible new restrictions on sales of chips made abroad to China's blacklisted Huawei Technologies, a maker of telecommunications equipment, and on sales of airplane components to a Chinese aircraft maker.
Policymakers have been sharply divided ahead of a cabinet-level meeting scheduled for Feb. 28, with some officials favoring a tough line on Huawei and China while others are more focused on prioritizing trade ties with Beijing. One of the sources said that meeting had not been officially canceled either. 
Doubts swirled about whether the meetings would still occur after Trump on Tuesday blasted the proposal that would prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China's aviation industry.
In a series of tweets and comments to reporters, Trump said national security concerns, often cited as the reason for U.S. curbs on Huawei, should not be used as an excuse to make it difficult for foreign countries to buy U.S. products.
The president's comments came after weekend reports by Reuters and other news media that the government was considering whether to stop  General Electric  Co (N:GE) from further supplying engines for a new Chinese passenger jet.
Trump also took aim at another proposal that would allow the U.S. government to block shipments of chips to Huawei from foreign suppliers that use U.S. equipment, in a major blow to the blacklisted firm. 
""Things have been put on my desk that have nothing to do with national security, including chipmakers,"" Trump said on Tuesday.

Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist in May 2019 over national security concerns. That forced some companies to seek a special license from the U.S. government to sell to the world's top telecoms equipment maker. But many supply chains remained beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, frustrating China hawks and spurring the flurry of proposals to expand controls.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG) on Wednesday said quarterly adjusted operating income edged 3% higher as growth in dialysis services and products was partly offset by a negative adjustment for accounts receivable in a legal dispute in North America.
Fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax, adjusted for special items, advanced to 655 million euros ($707 million), the group said in a statement, coming in below a median analyst estimate of 689 million euros, according to a company-provided poll.
The kidney dialysis provider, controlled by diversified healthcare group Fresenius SE (DE:FREG), reaffirmed a guidance for 2020 revenue and net income to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate in 2020, when measured without currency swings and excluding special items.
The guidance is based on the adjusted results for 2019, including the acquisition of home dialysis company NxStage, it added.
The group added it was too early to quantify the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China on its Asia-Pacific operations and that its priority was to continue treating its dialysis patients as well as employee safety.
Asia accounted for 11% of its total quarterly revenue of 4.58 billion euros."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and lawyers representing families of victims of a 737 MAX crash agreed in court on Wednesday to hold a conference call with U.S. government crash probe authorities over access to documents related to the now-grounded aircraft's design, development and two fatal disasters involving it.
Boeing has resisted sharing documents sought by lawyers representing families of victims of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash on March 10, which killed 157 people five months after a similar Lion Air disaster in which 189 people died.
The lawyers, who are asking why the MAX continued flying after the first crash, say the materials are critical for assessing liability by Boeing and punitive damages.
""They're hot documents,"" Robert Clifford, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, told reporters, saying some show what and when Boeing knew about factors that played a role in the Lion Air accident. 
Boeing has argued that the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is restricting release of the documents under international guidelines on crash probes and that they are confidential.
The plane, once Boeing's fastest-selling jet, has been grounded globally since mid-March while Boeing addresses software and training issues involved in both disasters, costing the planemaker nearly $19 billion.
The NTSB seemed to switch its stance on some of the documents in a Feb. 18 letter to Boeing, one topic of Wednesday's hearing in U.S. federal court in Chicago before U.S. Magistrate Judge David Weisman.
Boeing and the plaintiffs' lawyers agreed to brief the court on the outcome of a conference call with NTSB assistant general counsel Benjamin Allen scheduled for Thursday. 
Chicago-based Boeing is in the process of settling a separate batch of lawsuits related to the Lion Air crash, but families of the Ethiopian crash are seeking a jury trial.
Following 737 MAX testimony from Boeing executives at congressional hearings in Washington, Ethiopian crash victim lawyers want to know whether the planemaker hid materials.
Dan Webb, a lawyer for Boeing, rejected in court the notion that documents have been hidden, saying that some ""haven't been produced yet.""
""Boeing takes very seriously its legal obligations and is working with the plaintiffs in good faith, and consistent with our obligations as a technical advisor to the NTSB, to provide the information they need to pursue their claims,"" the company said in an emailed statement, adding that it was cooperating fully with investigative authorities.
A Lion Air investigation faulted Boeing's design of the 737 MAX but said the airline also made mistakes.

The Ethiopian probe is still ongoing, nearly a year after the crash.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 05:51PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico government objects to moving forward with new debt plan,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Bankrupt Puerto Rico's government told a federal judge on Wednesday that its opposition to a new plan announced earlier this month to restructure more than $85 billion of its debt should put the brakes on a confirmation process.
The U.S. commonwealth's federally created financial oversight board had asked Judge Laura Taylor Swain to approve a schedule that would culminate with a confirmation hearing on a so-called plan of adjustment for Puerto Rico's core government debt and pension obligations commencing in October.
The scheduling motion followed the board's Feb. 9 announcement that it had reached a deal with an expanded group of bondholders to reduce $35 billion of bonds and claims to about $11 billion, moving Puerto Rico closer to exiting bankruptcy, which began in 2017.
But Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez objected to the deal's enhanced recoveries for some bondholders, while certain government retirees would still face the same pension cuts called for in an earlier plan the board announced in September.
In a court filing on Wednesday, Puerto Rico's fiscal agency said the revised plan of adjustment, which the board has not yet filed in court, was ""unconfirmable.""
""Unless the oversight board clearly articulates how it proposes to confirm the amended plan without government support and cooperation, any confirmation schedule is patently premature,"" the filing stated.
It added that the deal with bondholders requires legislative action to issue new general obligation and junior lien sales tax-backed bonds, noting the board lacks the power to legislate under the 2016 federal PROMESA Act, which created the board and a form of municipal bankruptcy for the Caribbean island.
There was no immediate reaction to the filing from the board.
James Spiotto, managing director of Chapman Strategic Advisors and a municipal bankruptcy expert, said PROMESA does not allow the board ""to enact legislation for a new bond issue or to incur new debt."" He added it was doubtful the judge could order the government to take action.
""Hopefully both the oversight board and the legislature and the governor will realize they are all in it together and there is no benefit to delay or obstruction of any reasonable and fair resolution,"" he said. ""But they have to be sure they have a proposed plan that is a reasonable and fair plan."""

Hamers will succeed Sergio Ermotti, who has been with the company for close to a decade, the FT reported.
UBS Chairman Axel Weber offered the job to Hamers after concluding he was the most capable and experienced candidate, according to the report.
Weber had approached Hamers months ago after it was decided that Ermotti's tenure as the CEO would not be extended, the FT reported.
Earlier on Wednesday, ING abruptly pulled a planned bond issue, saying new information has come to light that meant it needed to delay it.
An ING spokesman did not comment on the FT report. A spokeswoman for UBS declined to comment.
A 30-year ING veteran, Hamers was named to the top job at the Dutch bank in 2013. Under his watch, the lender returned to profitability, while repaying the Dutch government money it received during the financial crisis.
Investing heavily in digital, ING now has one of the lowest cost-revenue ratios in Europe, relying far more on its online offering and less on branch network than most of its rivals.
Ermotti, who was named UBS CEO in 2011, has earned plaudits for helping rebuild the bank after the financial crisis, with a focus on wealth management.
However, the share price has fallen over the past year, hit by a 4.5 billion euro ($4.86 billion) fine in a French tax fraud case.

Airbus last month announced a surprise order for 40 of its A330neo wide-body aircraft, worth $12 billion at list prices, but the buyer's identity was kept under wraps.
The sources said the order, dated Dec. 23, came from HNA Group airlines and reflected efforts already in place to carry out a restructuring of fleet plans that would see some previously unfulfilled jet orders fall by the wayside.
In December, HNA chairman Chen Feng said the firm had faced cash flow shortages that forced it to delay some salary payments in 2019, but vowed to resolve its liquidity risks this year.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported that China plans to take over HNA Group and sell off its airline assets as the coronavirus outbreak had further hit the Chinese conglomerate's ability to meet financial obligations.
A collapse in Chinese airline activity due to the virus appears to have brought matters to a head at HNA, Sash Tusa, aerospace analyst of UK-based Agency Partners, said in a note.
HNA has ordered dozens of aircraft from Airbus and its U.S rival Boeing (N:BA) over the years but has failed to take delivery of several aircraft in a standoff stretching back to 2018, according to people familiar with the matter.
The move has left several aircraft with distinctive red tail markings of HNA Group airlines parked outside Airbus factories.
An Airbus spokesman had no immediate comment.
HNA could not immediately be reached for comment.
If confirmed following the reported nationalization plan, a move to lock in orders for the A330neo would boost an Airbus program that has been losing momentum. But sources said it remained unclear how many orders Airbus would give up in return.
Airbus has sold 337 A330neos but analysts have questioned the viability of at least a quarter of the orders, which include 28 sold to Iran in a deal since blocked by U.S. sanctions. Airbus last week announced a cut in A330 output despite a recent pickup in sales of the jet, which competes with the Boeing 787.
It said it would deliver 40 A330-family jets in 2020, down from 53 in 2019, implying slower production in its factories."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street's newest cult stock appears to be Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc (N:SPCE), as investors drive shares of the space tourism company to sky-high levels and short sellers dig in their heels.
Virgin Galactic jumped 23% during Wednesday's session, adding to a rally that has seen the money-losing company surge over 400% since early December. After hours, it added another 5%.
That hypersonic ascent has made it a favorite among short sellers betting the shares will eventually fall back to earth, drawing comparisons to Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), which has also surged in recent months.
""I’m calling it Tesla Junior because it's showing all the signs of becoming a cult stock on the long and on the short side,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
Like other so-called cult stocks, interest in Tesla and Virgin Galactic is driven by speculation about big future payoffs rather than fundamentals.
The value of short bets against Virgin Galactic hit a record $500 million on Tuesday after the stock surged to its own all-time high, according to Dusaniwsky. The company's rally this year has cost short sellers $345 million in paper losses.
Virgin Galactic is racing against SpaceX and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to bring tourists into space, but is the only one of the three whose shares are publicly listed. That makes Virgin Galactic the only option for stock market investors who want to buy into the emerging business of space travel.
Traders on Wednesday paid the equivalent of a 34% annual interest rate to borrow Virgin Galactic shares to make new short bets, reflecting a shortage in the shares due to its popularity among short sellers. Short sellers borrow shares and then sell them, expecting to buy them back at a lower price and pocket the difference after paying the stock lender interest.
Underscoring retail investors' interest Virgin Galactic, the company was the second most traded stock on Fidelity's online brokerage in recent sessions, with two-thirds of clients buying shares, rather than selling. Orders for Virgin Galactic on Fidelity trailed only Tesla.
Helped by improved profitability, Tesla has seen its stock surge 120% this year, including a 7% jump on Wednesday. 

Traders are shorting $18 billion worth of Tesla's shares, dwarfing overall short bets against Virgin Galactic. Those bets are equivalent to 15% of Tesla's float, while short bets against Virgin Galactic are equivalent to 31% of the company's stock float, up from 7% in November.

1477,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 04:54PM ET</span>",Fed Officials Saw Policy Appropriate ‘For a Time’ Amid Risks,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials viewed their current monetary policy as appropriate “for a time” while they remained on guard against domestic and global risks that could slow the longest U.S. expansion on record.
“Participants discussed how maintaining the current policy stance for a time could be helpful in supporting U.S. economic activity and employment in the face of global developments that have been weighing on spending decisions,’’ according to the minutes of the Jan. 28-29 Federal Open Market Committee meeting released Wednesday in Washington.
Click here for Bloomberg’s TOPLive blog on the report.
The minutes showed a broad discussion as officials considered inflation ranges as a tool to achieve their 2% target, how to adapt policy to combat financial-stability risks, and how they would wind down ongoing repurchase agreement and Treasury-bill purchases.
The record also showed “several” officials pushing for “inflation modestly exceeding 2%” for a time. Such action “would be consistent with the achievement of the committee’s longer-run inflation objective” and “underscore the symmetry of that objective.”
The staff official in charge of open market operations told policy makers that in the second quarter, reserve conditions would “support slowing the pace of Treasury bill purchases.”
Phasing Out
“Many participants stressed that, as reserves approached durably ample levels, the need for sizable Treasury bill purchases and repo operations would diminish and that such operations could be gradually scaled back or phased out,” the minutes said.
The FOMC left the benchmark lending rate unchanged in a range of 1.5% to 1.75% during the gathering, and said that the setting was “appropriate” to sustain the expansion and achieve its goals of maximum employment and stable prices.
The U.S. economy began 2020 on solid footing with payrolls rising by 225,000 in January. The jobless rate edged up to 3.6%, still near a half-century low, while average hourly earnings climbed 3.1% from a year earlier.
U.S. central bankers are counting on household consumption -- aided by low interest rates -- to sustain growth and help lift inflation back to their 2% target. Their preferred price measure rose 1.6% in 2019.
Within their ongoing framework review, officials held their most substantive discussion to date about the possibility of transforming their inflation target -- currently 2% -- into a range. The review began in early 2019 and is meant to assess whether the Fed has the right tools and strategies to deal with persistently low interest rates and low inflation.
Inflation Ranges
The committee considered inflation ranges based on three concepts: an “uncertainty” range, meant to communicate how wide inflation outcomes might vary and still be considered consistent with the target; an “indifference” range, emphasizing that policy need not respond to deviations within the range; and an “operational” range that could be used when officials wanted inflation to favor one side.
While the U.S. economy started the year in good shape, the coronavirus has raised questions about global growth, including the potential for spillovers affecting the U.S.
Participants expected growth to continue at a moderate pace, supported by accommodative monetary and financial conditions. “In addition, some trade uncertainties had diminished recently, and there were some signs of stabilization in global growth. Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remained, including those posed by the outbreak of the coronavirus,” the minutes said.
Officials saw consumption spending as likely to remain on a firm footing, “supported by strong labor market conditions, rising incomes, and healthy household balance sheets.”
Powell told lawmakers in semi-annual testimony last week “it’s too uncertain to even speculate’’ on how the outbreak would impact the economy or if it could present a “material change’’ to the outlook, though he said the impact on China should be “substantial.’’
U.S. central bankers are purchasing Treasury bills at a pace of $60 billion per month to boost reserve balances and plan to continue the operation into the second quarter. They are also conducting term and overnight repurchase agreements at least through April to offset seasonal demands for payments and cash.
The minutes said the term repo operations could be phased out after April."
1478,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 04:48PM ET</span>","French judges step up Ghosn probe over palace party, Oman dealings","PARIS (Reuters) - French prosecutors have stepped up their investigation into alleged misappropriation of funds at  Renault  (PA:RENA) by former boss Carlos Ghosn, saying a judge had now been assigned to the case to launch a formal investigation. 
The prosecutor's office in Nanterre, on the outskirts of Paris, had since last year been looking into a party Ghosn had thrown for his wife at the sumptuous Versailles palace among other financial dealings. 
It said in a statement on Wednesday a judge would now examine several charges linked to Renault and levelled at an unnamed person or people. A judicial source confirmed that Ghosn was among them.
A lawyer for Ghosn said he welcomed the opportunity to give his version of the events. 
""We will provide our explanations to the designated magistrate after we can finally have access to the case file,"" lawyer Jean-Yves Le Borgne told Reuters. 
Ghosn - now in Lebanon after he last month fled prosecution in Japan on financial misconduct charges - has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. 
Reuters reported in January that judges, who have wider powers than investigators to pursue a criminal case, were set to get involved, potentially bringing prosecution a step closer.
The prosecutor's office said the case involved suspect financial flows between Renault and a car dealership in Oman, as well as spending on trips and events. 
Prosecutors had been looking into whether Ghosn knowingly used company resources to throw a party that was for private purposes - his wife's birthday - in 2016. 
Ghosn's lawyers have said he did nothing wrong, but there may have been a misunderstanding between Versailles and party planners over who was to foot the bill for renting the venue.
Another event at Versailles in 2014, when Ghosn held a corporate party to celebrate the 15-year anniversary of Renault's alliance with Japan's Nissan, will now also fall under the scope of the investigation, the judicial source said. 
At a news conference in January, Ghosn rejected allegations that most of the guests at the party - paid for by RNBV, a Dutch-based holding company for Renault and Nissan - were his own friends and family, saying the companies had invited business contacts from dealerships and other partners. 

Renault conducted its own internal inquiry into Ghosn's time at the carmaker and handed over information to prosecutors last year. This included its probe into millions of euros described as dealer incentives to an Omani distributor.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose to record closing highs on Wednesday as optimism that China would take more measures to prop up its economy eased concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic.
Stocks held gains following the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting, which showed policymakers were cautiously optimistic about their ability to hold interest rates steady this year while acknowledging new risks caused by the virus outbreak.
The number of new coronavirus cases dropped for a second straight day in China.
China is widely expected to cut its benchmark lending interest rate on Thursday, which would add to measures aimed at limiting the impact from business shutdowns and travel curbs on the world's second-largest economy.
""It sounds as though investors are breathing a sigh of relief that they believe the worst of the coronavirus is behind us,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.
""Investors are feeling emboldened because central banks have got their back,"" he added.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose 1.4%, recouping most of the losses in the previous session after a surprise sales warning that highlighted concerns about the coronavirus' impact on global supply chains.
The S&P 500 technology sector (SPLRCT) also rose, ending up 1.1%. Among sectors, it was the second-biggest percentage gainer after energy (SPNY), which rose 1.3%.
Oil prices overall gained 2% on the back of slowing coronavirus cases.
""There seemed to be a number of high-profile companies that were talking about coronavirus and the potential for it to impact earnings.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 04:37PM ET</span>","Should Facebook, Google be liable for user posts? asks U.S. Attorney General Barr","By Nandita Bose and Raphael Satter
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday questioned whether Facebook, Google and other major online platforms still need the immunity from legal liability that has prevented them from being sued over material their users post.
""No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts. They have become titans,"" Barr said at a public meeting held by the Justice Department to examine the future of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. 
""Given this changing technological landscape, valid questions have been raised about whether Section 230's broad immunity is necessary at least in its current form,"" he said.
Section 230 says online companies such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) cannot be treated as the publisher or speaker of information they provide. This largely exempts them from liability involving content posted by users, although they can be held liable for content that violates criminal or intellectual property law.
Barr's comments offered insight into how regulators in Washington are reconsidering the need for incentives that once helped online companies grow but are increasingly viewed as impediments to curbing online crime, hate speech and extremism.
The increased size and power of online platforms has also left consumers with fewer options, and the lack of feasible alternatives is a relevant discussion, Barr said, adding that the Section 230 review came out of the Justice Department's broader look at potential anticompetitive practices at tech companies.
Lawmakers from both major political parties have called for Congress to change Section 230 in ways that could expose tech companies to more lawsuits or significantly increase their costs.
Some Republicans have expressed concern that Section 230 prevents them from taking action against internet services that remove conservative political content, while a few Democratic leaders have said the law allows the services to escape punishment for harboring misinformation and extremist content.
Barr said the department would not advocate a position at the meeting. But he hinted at the idea of allowing the U.S. government to take action against recalcitrant platforms, saying it was ""questionable"" whether Section 230 should prevent the American government from suing platforms when it is ""acting to protect American citizens.""
Others at the meeting floated different ideas.
The attorney general of Nebraska, Doug Peterson, noted that the law does not shield platforms from federal criminal prosecution; the immunity helps protect against civil claims or a state-level prosecution. Peterson said the exception should be widened to allow state-level action as well. Addressing the tech industry, he called it a ""pretty simple solution"" that would allow local officials ""to clean up your industry instead of waiting for your industry to clean up itself.""
Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which counts Google and Facebook among its members, said such a solution would result in tech giants having to obey 50 separate sets of laws governing user content. 
He suggested law enforcement's energies might be better spent pursuing the millions of tips that the tech industry sent over every year, only a small fraction of which, he noted, resulted in investigations.
""There appears to be some asymmetry there,"" he said. 
Others argued that different rules should apply to different platforms, with larger websites enjoying fewer protections than internet upstarts.
""With great scale comes great responsibility,"" said David Chavern, of the News Media Alliance, whose members have bristled as Google and Facebook have gutted journalism's business model.
But other panelists argued that distinguishing one site from another might be tricky. For example, would platforms like Reddit or Wikipedia, which have large reach but shoestring staffs, be counted as big sites or small ones?
The panelists also briefly debated encryption, another area over which Barr has pressed the tech industry to change its modus operandi. Facebook, in particular, has drawn the ire of U.S. officials over its plans to secure its popular messaging platform.
Kate Klonick, a law professor at St. John's University in New York, urged caution.

""This is a massive norm-setting period,"" she said, with any alterations to one of the internet's key legal frameworks likely to draw unexpected consequences. ""It's hard to know exactly what the ramifications might be.""

China reported 1,749 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, marking the lowest number of newly confirmed cases since Jan. 29 and the second-straight day infections have remained under 2,000.

""The fundamentals of China's economy have not changed,"" the People's Bank of China said. ""China's economy, however, also faces several challenges but will fend off major financial risks.""
Easing Covid-19 fears triggered a wave of green across energy stocks amid a climb in oil prices, setting up the broader market for a record day.
In tech, chip stocks rallied strongly as investors bet that supply chain disruption would be limited after China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reportedly vowed to help businesses that were impacted.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed 2.6% higher, led by a 6% rise in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Bernstein upgraded its rating on Nvidia to outperform from market perform and hiked its price target on the company to $360 per share from $300 per share, sending its shares to an all-time high.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also supported the rally after Piper Sandler raised its price target on the stock to $928 from $729, sending the electric automaker's shares up 6.9%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, clawed back the bulk of losses from a day earlier, when it warned on revenue on concerns that the virus would hurt iPhone demand and production. Shares closed up 1.45%.
On the earnings front, Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) surged 6.7% after its fourth-quarter results topped estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell well short of consensus estimates, sending its shares down about 18%."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday said it was pushing the Big Four accountancy firms to ramp up internal controls on audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, especially in light of growing business risks posed by the coronavirus.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been locked in a decade-long struggle with the Chinese government to inspect audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. The regulator's accounting oversight arm, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, is still unable to access those critical records, it said.
That has become a greater worry as the coronavirus outbreak poses a threat to New York-listed Chinese companies as well as to Chinese suppliers of other U.S.-listed firms. 
The SEC said on Wednesday it had been pressing the largest accounting firms, which audit roughly 140 U.S.-listed Chinese companies, to ensure they are scrutinizing how firms are managing and disclosing the risks. 
The regulator said it had also asked the firms to keep an eye on the impact of the virus on audit quality, since the coronavirus had caused personnel disruptions in mainland China and Hong Kong.
""How issuers plan and respond to the events as they unfold can be material to an investment decision, and we urge issuers to work with their audit committees and auditors to ensure that their financial reporting, auditing and review processes are as robust as practicable,"" the SEC chair Jay Clayton said in a joint statement with the chairman of the accounting board.
The PCAOB, which was set up by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a private-sector nonprofit corporation overseen by the SEC, is tasked with policing the accounting firms that sign off on the books of the nation's listed companies.
The audit-quality issue has been festering since 2011, when scores of Chinese firms trading on U.S. exchanges were accused of accounting irregularities.
On Wednesday, Clayton said the SEC would extend some flexibility to companies whose disclosure filings cannot be completed as scheduled, with appropriate auditor review, due to business disruption by the coronavirus.
""The staff will determine whether to provide additional guidance and relief as appropriate for affected parties,"" Clayton said. ""Relief may be made available on a case-by-case or broader basis as circumstances merit."" 
Reuters reported earlier this month that auditors for listed Chinese companies will likely struggle to complete their work by stock exchange deadlines because of travel bans and other restrictions designed to limit the spread of the new coronavirus.

Arizona’s expanding state economy and low unemployment should help Trump in a state he won by more than 3 percentage points in 2016, but there are significant warning signs for the president.
Democrat Kyrsten Sinema beat Republican Martha McSally for an open U.S. Senate seat in 2018. This year, a popular Democrat is running ahead in polls for the state’s other Senate seat, which could bolster turnout among party voters. A handful of polls in recent months have shown Trump running roughly even with Joe Biden and beating several other Democrats.
Trump’s decision to visit Phoenix on Wednesday shows his campaign is worried about Arizona becoming a swing state. The Trump campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Nationally, a recent Gallup poll found Trump’s approval rating to be the highest of his presidency, but surveys matching him up against top Democrats show them edging him out.
Arizona has been among the fastest growing states, threatening the GOP’s dominance. As of July 1, 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated there were 7,278,717 residents, up 4.8% from July 2016.
The number of minorities, especially Hispanics, has been increasing and some estimates suggest that minorities will be in the majority by 2030. Minority voters are more likely to support Democrats.
Even some state Republican leaders and strategists said the state is up for grabs and that the outcome will depend in part on who Democrats pick as their nominee.
“Arizona is going to be in the limelight,” said George Khalaf, a Republican pollster and strategist. “No one is going to take Arizona for granted. If you’re on the left, it’s not a slam dunk, if you’re a Republican, you don’t want to take it for granted.”
Republicans command about 35% of the state’s registered voters, ahead of Democrats, who make up 31%. But there’s a big wild card: 33% of voters are registered as independents.
The state, long known for its conservative politics and for electing Republicans like Barry Goldwater and John McCain, has voted for Democrats in only eight presidential elections since 1912. But in recent years Arizonans have shown an increasing willingness to elect Democratic candidates.
In the Senate race two years ago, Sinema won even as Arizona’s Republican Governor Doug Ducey was re-elected. Three other Democratic women won statewide office in that election.
In December 2018, McSally was appointed to the senate seat that had been held by McCain, who died earlier that year. She’ll be on the ballot again in November and polls show her trailing Mark Kelly, a Democrat, former astronaut and husband of former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords.
The state’s economy is doing well, but isn’t among the top performers.
Real gross domestic product growth in Arizona was 13th in the nation at 2.4% in the third quarter of 2019, government data show. That’s a slowdown from 5.4% a year earlier, mirroring the broader economy that’s coming down from 2018 levels.
Arizona’s unemployment rate has tightened, falling to 4.6% in December from 5.2% in January 2017 when Trump was inaugurated. Still, the present unemployment rate is among the highest in the nation.
One of the most important counties to Trump’s re-election prospects is Maricopa, which includes Phoenix, the location of Trump’s rally. The county, which has been the fastest growing in the country for several years, accounts for 61% of Arizona’s registered voters.
Chuck Coughlin, an Arizona-based Republican strategist, said the state is crucial to the GOP’s election strategy. “I don’t think there’s a scenario in which they lose Arizona and win the White House,” he said.
Voters who oppose Trump were trying to make their voices heard on Tuesday in advance of his arrival.
Rally Stirs Both Parties
Fred Bauer, 67, was among a group of about a dozen people gathered at a busy Phoenix intersection, holding signs that included slogans like “Anyone but Trump 2020.”
Bauer says that he’s originally from Chicago, but he bounced around the U.S. and abroad, last working in California, before he and his wife moved to Phoenix four years ago. Bauer, who said he supported President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, considered himself an independent until Trump’s election.
“You can start with how he denigrates people from Muslims to people of color to sexual orientation to football players,” Bauer said. “He’s not working to bring people together. I don’t think tariffs have had a positive effect. Foreign policy is a hotbed.”
Rae Chornenky, chairman of the Maricopa County Republican party, expects a tough fight. She said Trump’s rally was helping to generate enthusiasm.
“I can’t keep up with the people who are contacting us saying, ‘I want to do something, how can I help?’” Chornenky said. “I’ve never seen this much of an influx of that.”

1487,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 03:03PM ET</span>","Business jet deliveries hit decade high in 2019, helped by new models","By Allison Lampert and Mike Stone
MONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Business jet deliveries across the globe hit a decade high in 2019, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) said on Wednesday, helped by strong market demand for new models. 
Deliveries rose 15% from 703 to 809 jets, the highest level since 2009, GAMA said in its 2019 year-end aircraft billing and shipment numbers. 
Business jet deliveries are being underpinned by the ramp-up of new models by manufacturers like  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and General Dynamics Corp (N:GD) unit Gulfstream Aerospace that offer longer ranges and amenities such as beds and hot showers at 40,000 feet. 
Honeywell Aerospace's (N:HON) business aviation outlook from last year expects a 7% rise in deliveries in 2020.
Business jet executives who are bringing new planes to market defended the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s certification process, which has come under fire following the March global grounding of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX jet.
Crtics have said the FAA’s long-standing practice of delegating “a high level” of certification tasks to manufacturers like Boeing needs significant reforms to ensure adequate safety oversight. In 2019, a global panel pointed to the FAA's review of a MAX safety system that was later tied to two crashes that killed 346 people.
Textron Aviation (N:TXT) President Ron Draper called the 2019 certification of its super-midsized Cessna Citation Longitude as ""the most rigorous certification process on any airplane we've done in our history."" 
Draper told reporters at a GAMA event in Washington DC that the delegation system overseen by the FAA remains ""rigorous,"" and it would not make sense to scrap it.
""The FAA orchestrates this like a conductor from the entire process and we have to show compliance on every system every safety aspect of the airplane,"" he said. 
GAMA said North America accounted for 67.1% of business jet deliveries, the largest market for corporate aircraft followed by Europe. 

Gulfstream generated the highest value of deliveries with almost $7.9 billion in billings, followed by Bombardier at $5.7 billion.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 01:44PM ET</span>","Exclusive: 'Made in Russia' passenger jet finds a single buyer, Aeroflot","By Gleb Stolyarov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's main home-grown passenger jet, the Sukhoi Superjet 100, conceived as a rival to Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer, has no confirmed orders this year beyond a long-standing deal with state carrier Aeroflot (MM:ALTR), two sources told Reuters. 
The aircraft, which entered service in 2011 and was the first passenger jet built in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, has had a troubled history despite the state pouring billions of dollars into its development. Last year, a Superjet crash-landed in Moscow, killing 41 people. 
Sukhoi Civil Aircraft, which is controlled by Russian state holding company Rostec, had hoped to sell hundreds. But slack demand and servicing problems and delays in sourcing spare parts, means only 142 of the planes are in use.
Aeroflot, which currently has 54 Superjets in its fleet, is expected to receive up to 17 more this year, Russia's Trade and Industry ministry told Reuters. The carrier signed a long-term contract in 2018 to lease 100 Superjets between 2019 and 2026.
But two sources familiar with the firm's plans told Reuters that Sukhoi currently has no other customers lined up for 2020.
""(The Superjet project) depends on a government decision about state support, because it does not yet work commercially,"" one of the two sources said.
The Superjet is predominantly operated inside Russia by regional airlines, corporations and government entities. It has had mixed success with foreign carriers.
Irish airline CityJet stopped operating its seven Superjets last year and Mexican Interjet said last year it planned to sell its 22 Superjets. 
Sukhoi in a statement declined to disclose its portfolio of customers.
""The company is working to implement contracts in the interests of aircraft operators and customers, the principal one of which is Russian carrier Aeroflot,"" it said. 
Asked whether they had any plans to purchase or lease Superjets this year, Russia's three biggest private airline companies - S7, UTair and Ural Airlines - said no. 
Five other Russian airlines, who have Superjets in their fleets, did not respond to requests for comment. 
IrAero, an airline based in Russia's Far East which has previously demanded compensation from Sukhoi citing the Superjet's poor technical performance, told Reuters there were problems using the planes and that the ""contract terms are far from the most advantageous for users."" 
Sukhoi said last year it would sell 16 jets to customers. It missed that target however and delivered just eight planes in the end, five of which were leased to Aeroflot. 
AEROFLOT CONTRACT
Aeroflot has so far leased five of the 100 Superjets it committed to in its 2018 contract with Sukhoi.
Those transactions were financed by Russian state development bank VEB. But the arrangement was made on an ad hoc basis and no decision has yet been taken on how the next 95 planes will be financed, a third source, employed by a company that works with Sukhoi, said.
VEB told Reuters it was considering financing future Superjet deliveries and was ready to finance deliveries for other buyers as well.

Aeroflot said it was unable to comment on commercial deals. Sukhoi Civil Aircraft declined to comment on more potential leasing arrangements with Aeroflot.

Investing.com – The S&P and Nasdaq rallied to record highs on Wednesday as reports of a slight decline in Covid-19 cases and hopes for additional stimulus from China prompted investors to resume their bullish bets on stocks.
The S&P 500 rose 0.62%, the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.01% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.53%.
China reported 1,749 confirmed new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, the lowest number of newly-confirmed cases since Jan. 29, stoking investor optimism that the spread of the virus was slowing.
Also adding to the positive backdrop on Wall Street, Bloomberg reported that Beijing was considering cash injections or mergers to bail out airlines hit by the virus.
Tech powered the broader rally in stocks, led by a 1.7% rise in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as easing virus jitters gave credence to bullish calls from analysts, many of whom had downplayed the tech giant's warning that it will miss second-quarter revenue guidance.
Chip stocks also welcomed a wave of buying, with Nvidia leading the charge higher following a bullish note on the chipmaker from Wall Street.
Bernstein upgraded its rating on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to outperform from market perform and hiked its price target on the company to $360 per share from $300 per share, sending its shares to an all-time high, up 5%.
The return of risk appetite triggered selling in U.S. government bonds, sending prices lower and yields higher, pushing bank stocks higher.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose more than 1% as a rise in bond yields tends to boost net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
With investor hopes growing that efforts to control the virus are gathering pace, oil prices found their footing, triggering a rebound in energy stocks following a selloff a day earlier. 
On the earnings front, investors had to contend with mixed quarterly results.
Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) surged 8% after its fourth-quarter results topped estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell well short of consensus estimates, sending its shares down more than 19%.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continued its run higher, up 7% after Piper Sandler raised its price target on the stock to $928 from $729 on optimism over the electric automaker's move into battery and solar power products."

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>","This revamp will be different, says HSBC boss; staff not so sure","By Sumeet Chatterjee and Sinead Cruise
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Noel Quinn, the interim chief executive of HSBC (L:HSBA), says this time things are going to be different.
Unveiling the bank’s third overhaul since the financial crisis, Quinn told Reuters this week that the latest revamp would be less reliant on external factors, such as global interest rates and China's economy.
""I believe this plan is predicated on three things we can control, which are costs, simplification of the business, and capital efficiency, rather than being dependent on revenue growth assumptions influenced by the macroeconomic environment,"" he said.
Investors and HSBC employees aren't convinced.
In a call with staff on Tuesday, Quinn and Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson were put on the defensive over the bank's commitment to the overhaul given that Quinn, the man unveiling it, has not been made permanent.
""Internally, expectations had built up in the run up to the strategy update that Quinn will be confirmed as the group CEO,"" said a person with knowledge of the call.
""But the way the whole thing is being handled ... it has created more confusion about the strategy and whether the bank will stick to it for the next three years even if there is a change at the top.""
HSBC's shares dropped 6.6% on Tuesday to their lowest level in more than three years after the bank, which has struggled to keep pace with leaner and more focused rivals, said it would suspend buybacks for two years to pay for the restructuring.
Stevenson told employees that even if the markets didn't have much conviction in the execution of the strategy, HSBC staff would have to rally behind management to see it through.
HSBC declined to comment.
RELENTLESS
The London-headquartered bank, which makes 90% of its profit in Asia, is shrinking its investment bank, cutting 35,000 jobs and revamping its U.S. and European businesses, to remove $4.5 billion in costs.
HSBC veteran Quinn is auditioning for the permanent role of CEO, which the bank said in August would be announced within six to 12 months.
""This is a significant restructuring which is being driven by an interim CEO who may not be the person that delivers it,"" one of the bank's 20 largest investors told Reuters, declining to be named in line with his firm's media policy.
HSBC's Hong Kong shares (HK:0005) dropped 1.3% on Wednesday, while the London stock finished up 1.3%.
Against a backdrop of lower global growth and depressed interest rates, a second investor among HSBC's 20 largest shareholders said he was disappointed the bank was running hard to stand still.
While withdrawing from investment banking businesses sounded like a good idea, analysts pointed out that exits were often expensive and complicated, and could lead to disposal losses greater than the $1.2 billion HSBC has set aside.
""They are having to do a lot of heavy lifting and all this restructuring just to hit the targets they had before. I know there might be disappointment among the workforce but I'm not sure management have much of a choice,"" the investor said.
""I think once they do this, they are going to have to do it again. While this low interest rate environment persists, they will have to keep hacking away at the cost base. It's going to be relentless."""

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>","Airbus defense division plans to cut more than 2,300 jobs","(Reuters) - The defense business of Airbus (PA:AIR) on Wednesday laid out plans to cut more than 2,300 jobs, citing a flat space market and postponed defense contracts.
The aircraft maker said its Airbus Defense and Space division had entered consultation with the company's European works council on the planned cutbacks.
The plan foresees the reduction of 2,362 positions until the end of 2021, of which 829 would be in Germany, 357 in Britain, 630 in Spain, 404 in France and 141 in other countries, according to a statement.
The head of the defense business said on Saturday that talks were about to start with labor representatives as the German-based group retrenches following setbacks with its A400M military transporter.
Recurring technical problems with the A400M led the German air force to refuse delivery of two of the aircraft last autumn.
The group has also taken a 1.2 billion euro ($1.3 billion) charge on the worsening sales outlook, with a German ban on defense exports to Saudi Arabia causing Airbus Defense and Space to lose a promising potential customer, Dirk Hoke said.
Airbus Defense and Space, formed in 2014 as part of a broader restructuring, employs 34,000 staff - 13,000 of them in Germany - and contributes around a fifth of revenues to parent group Airbus."

(Reuters) - Clothing and furnishing retailer Laura Ashley (L:ALY) calmed concerns over its working capital, saying it has access to sufficient funds to meet immediate funding needs, sending its shares up more than 15%.
The company is among a growing band of British retailers to encounter difficulties over the past few years, with falling sales leading to store closures while it also contends with weakness in its home furnishings business.
Lender  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and the retailer's majority shareholder, MUI Asia Limited, have concluded discussions over Laura Ashley's immediate funding needs, the retailer said on Wednesday, and that it can draw requisite funds from its existing working capital facility with the bank.
The arrangements do not involve a cash injection by MUI Asia, the company reiterated.
The announcement comes days after Laura Ashley said that recent movements in its stock and customer deposit levels had led to a reduction in the amount it could draw under the Wells Fargo facility.
Wells Fargo provided Laura Ashley with a 20 million pound ($26 million) last year, with the company's assets as collateral.
Laura Ashley shares were up 15.2% at 2.4 pence by 1611 GMT.
However, Cavendish Asset Management, its third-largest shareholder with a 1.7% stake, raised some concerns.
""It's good news for the company in the short term, but it might not hold up for long,"" said Cavendish fund manager Nick Burchett.
Burchett said that the company needs to focus on its vintage styles and luxury image now it has breathing room provided by the funding arrangement.
""Otherwise it could be curtains for another well-known high street name,"" he added."

1502,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 11:03AM ET</span>",Europe’s U.S.-Style Superbank Dream Is Further Out of Reach,"(Bloomberg) -- The solution for Europe’s struggling banks, many of their CEOs agree, is consolidation that creates cross-continent superbanks -- an American-style fix that by several measures is slipping further out of reach.
Europe’s banking system is getting more fragmented, not less, 10 years after a sovereign debt crisis shook its foundations. While politicians accept some domestic mergers, they’ve resisted the idea of larger tie-ups.
The effects can be seen in cross-border lending: French, German, Dutch and U.K. banks’ outstanding loans were $1 trillion less in so-called periphery countries -- Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy -- than before the crisis, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
The retrenchment started soon after the 2008 global financial crisis. European Union governments bailing out their banks demanded that future lending be focused within national borders. The Balkanization got worse after the bailout of Greece by its EU partners in 2010, followed by troubles in Spain and Italy. The so-called banking union, an EU project aimed at creating a unified financial system, is still barely half-completed.
“The bleeding has stopped, but the blood has not been recovered,” said Jan Schildbach, head of research for banking and financial markets at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in Frankfurt. “We haven’t seen a restoration of trust in the region’s banking system. That has prevented capital flow to the peripheral countries.”
Interest rates offer more evidence that the goal of a pan-European bank is getting more elusive. Borrowers in the four major economies pay significantly less than in the outlying nations, which for the most part are in Southern (NYSE:SO) Europe.
The European Central Bank became the main regulator for more than 100 of the biggest EU banks in 2014 as one of the three pillars of the bloc’s banking union initiative. The second pillar, a unified resolution mechanism to take care of weak banks, went into effect in 2016. There’s been no agreement on how to implement the final leg -- a centralized deposit-insurance program.
Despite becoming a central banking supervisor, the ECB hasn’t replaced local regulators or taken power from national governments, which are still loathe to allow banks under their authority to fail or be replaced by firms from other countries. Even though the central bank has been voicing support for cross-border mergers, politicians don’t look favorably on such tie-ups, especially if it means giving up on their national champions.
In 2017, when the ECB designated a small Spanish lender and two Italian peers as “failing or likely to fail,” Italy orchestrated a 17-billion-euro ($18.3 billion) government bailout. And last year, Germany spurned a bid from private capital for a stake in failing Norddeutsche Landesbank-Girozentrale in favor of a 3-billion-euro state bailout. Spain was the exception. It agreed with the ECB’s prescription, allowing creditors of its failing bank to bear losses in an ECB-orchestrated takeover by a larger rival.
What the CEOs say:
“The question for Swiss and EU banks has changed. It is no longer too big to fail, but rather too small to survive.” --UBS Group AG Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti
“Europe needs more pan-European banks.” --UniCredit SpA’s Jean-Pierre Mustier
“The real chance of consolidation lies in crossing national borders in Europe. Only then is it possible for true European champions to emerge.” --Deutsche Bank AG’s Christian Sewing
Domestic mergers have come more easily because political resistance is lower. Italy’s biggest bank made an unsolicited bid on Monday for a smaller rival. Shares of  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) SpA, the buyer, and its target, Unione di Banche Italiane SpA, were little changed on Wednesday. UBI shares surged 24% on Tuesday to match the premium Intesa is offering.
Christian Scarafia, an analyst covering European banks at Fitch Ratings in London, said restrictions on the flow of money across borders is a big impediment to international mergers. “Also, financial products in the various European countries can vary and be subject to different rules and regulations, which makes it less efficient to be a region-wide bank,” Scarafia said.
Weak banks in some of the so-called core EU countries have also contributed to the decline in cross-border banking. German banks -- beset by losses from both the U.S. mortgage meltdown and the European crisis -- have cut their exposure to the periphery more than other lenders. French banks have halted much of their cross-border retrenchment, stabilizing at 2016 levels.
The ECB, through its long-term financing operations, has filled some of the gap by providing liquidity to lenders in need. Italian and Spanish banks have been the biggest borrowers from the ECB while German and French companies have the largest deposits sitting at the central bank.
The fragmented industry is one reason consumers and companies face vastly different borrowing rates depending on where they live. The average rate for new consumer loans in the periphery was 7% in December, compared with 3.8% in the core, according to the latest ECB data.
German banks, flooded with savings and unable to find enough domestic demand for loans, face margin compression. In Ireland, with a more consolidated banking system and higher demand, banks can lend at wider spreads.
Without a more integrated banking system, European financial institutions won’t be able to compete effectively against stronger U.S. rivals or their recently expanding Asian peers, Deutsche Bank’s Schildbach said.
“European countries are too small on their own to have a home market for their banks that is similar to the U.S. or China or Japan,” Schildbach said, adding that while the ECB and EU recognize the need for a more unified industry, “it’s not clear whether the national governments all see the need. And for real change, you need political agreement.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) will roll out a fleet of several hundred electric bikes for rent across New York City, the company said on Wednesday, 10 months after it pulled them following complaints and injury reports.
The bikes will be available at any of the city's nearly 900 Citi Bike stations for a per-minute fee, versus a flat rate for non-electric shared bikes.
New York, the most populous U.S. city with over 8 million people, is an attractive market for transportation providers. The city signed an exclusive deal with Lyft to operate its bike-share system after Lyft acquired the previous operator in 2018.
Named after program sponsor Citibank (N:C), the blue bikes have experienced surging demand since their debut in 2013. Last year, nearly 21 million trips were completed on about 12,000 bikes, up more than 18% from the previous year, according to city data.
 Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), which also operates a bike-share fleet, and electric scooter company Lime have criticized the city for its exclusive relationship with Lyft. Under New York law, throttle-powered e-bikes and e-scooters are not permitted outside the Citi Bike program.
Lyft voluntarily pulled its e-bike fleet in April after what the company at the time said were ""a small number of reports from riders who experienced stronger than expected braking force on the front wheel.""
Lyft said it has since switched battery suppliers and changed the bikes' brake setup.
The electric bikes will cost 15 cents per minute, or 10 cents per minute for annual subscribers. Regular bikes cost $3 per 30-minute trip for non-members.
""We are confident that the return of these sought-after bikes will allow our partners at Lyft to build on the record-breaking ridership Citi Bike saw last summer,"" New York City's Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said in a statement.

(This story corrects New York City population to over 8 million from over 19 million in paragraph 3.)

Hydrogen fuel cell company   Plug Power   (NASDAQ:PLUG) continued to ride a wave of hot money flowing into alternative energy stocks, rising 4.6%, while Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) continued its parabolic trajectory, also fueled overwhelmingly by retail investors in search of the next big thing. 
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who has an “overweight” rating on Virgin Galactic, cautioned in a note on Tuesday that the recent surge has been “driven by forces beyond fundamental factors.”
“We are very constructive on the Virgin Galactic story ... We just think the share price could use a breather,” Jonas wrote, maintaining his $22 price target.

LISBON (Reuters) - EU countries have no reason to use 5G mobile technology from Huawei because Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb), Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) are on par with the Chinese group in the field, a senior U.S. diplomat said.
Robert Strayer, deputy assistant secretary for cyber, international communications and information policy at the U.S. State Department, said on a visit to Lisbon it was ""necessary to demystify"" the notion that Huawei is more advanced in 5G.    Washington wants its allies to ban Huawei, the world's largest producer of telecoms equipment, arguing the use of its kit creates the potential for espionage by China - a claim denied by Huawei and Beijing.
Its stance has sparked tensions with allies such as Britain, whose Prime Minister Boris Johnson has granted Huawei a limited role in building a 5G mobile network.
Strayer said the United States is encouraging European countries to think carefully about the security and economic implications of rushing forward with using Huawei's technology.
""There is no way to fully mitigate any type of risk except the use of trusted vendors from democratic countries,"" Strayer told reporters.
""The good news is Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung all provide 5G technology that is on par with the one Huawei is providing today. They are leading the world in the type of technology they have.""
Huawei says it spent $15 billion last year on research to help it achieve market leadership and has said the United States wants to frustrate its growth because no U.S. company could offer the same range of technology at a competitive price.
Strayer said Western vendors such as Ericsson and Nokia will use an open architecture with more functionality, creating opportunities for companies in the United States and Europe to provide compatible equipment.
American companies like Dell (N:DELL), Cisco (O:CSCO), Juniper (N:JNPR) and VMware (N:VMW) ""want to play a future role"", he said, seeing many European companies also getting involved.    The European Union has said it would allow members to decide what part China's Huawei can play in 5G networks.
Portugal last month approved guidelines for its 5G strategy and launched a working group to permanently monitor the risks and security of this network."

At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded up 0.2%, futures for the Nasdaq up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones futures contract rose 0.3%.
China, the world's second-largest economy, is still struggling to get its manufacturing sector back online after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain a virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year.
As a consequence, the People’s Bank of China is widely expected to cut its benchmark lending rate on Thursday as policymakers seek to offset the impact on businesses from the coronavirus outbreak. The central bank lowered the interest rate on medium-term loans earlier this week. Additionally, Bloomberg reported that the country is preparing a multi-billion-dollar bailout for the airline sector, while in the U.S., forward dollar rates are now clearly pricing in another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this year.
Back on Wall Street, Groupon stock (NASDAQ:GRPN) slumped 25% in late trading Tuesday after the online commerce company said it would stop selling goods by the end of the year, driven out by what it called “a fiercely competitive, and in some cases, economically irrational retail landscape.”
Additionally, shares in   Herbalife   (NYSE:HLF) climbed 5% in late trading after the health nutrition company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations.
In economic news, the latest housing starts and building permits are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), but the release of the minutes from the last meeting of the Federal Reserve, at 14:00 ET (1900 GMT), will garner the most attention. Market players will look for more detail on the Federal Reserve’s plans to wrap up its balance sheet expansion.
Oil markets rebounded Wednesday, nearing their highest levels for three weeks, after the U.S. sanctioned a trading subsidiary of Russia's Rosneft for helping transport Venezuela's oil to refineries in India and China.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Airways has bought a $600 million stake in British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) to increase its holding to 25.1%, strengthening its position ahead of a change in IAG management.
In an endorsement of the Anglo-Spanish group just weeks before its founder Willie Walsh steps down, Qatar said on Wednesday the move showed its support for IAG and its strategy.
Qatar previously held 21.4% of IAG, which also owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling and Ireland's Aer Lingus. IAG's share price has risen by 52% in the last six months.
Qatar increased its holding after IAG lifted restrictions on investments from outside the European Union last month.
IAG, which is registered in Madrid and headquartered in London, capped its equity held outside the EU at 47.5% a year ago to comply with EU ownership rules, a situation that could be further complicated by Britain's departure from the EU.
It said in January non-EU ownership had fallen to 39.5%, so the cap was no longer required.
At 1110 GMT, IAG shares were up 0.8% at 637 pence, giving it a market value of 12.67 billion pounds ($16.4 billion).
State-owned Qatar Airways, one of the Middle East's biggest carriers, has said its investments in other carriers were mostly for financial purposes. It does not have an IAG board seat.
It bought some of its holdings after the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia banned it from their airspace after a regional political dispute, which Qatar Airways has blamed for its recent losses.
It has minority holdings in international carriers Cathay Pacific (HK:0293) and China Southern (SS:600029), and said earlier this month it was interested in doubling its holding in LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) to 20% and was in talks to buy a 49% stake in Africa's RwandAir.
The airline also owns 49% of Air Italy, whose investors this month said was being placed into liquidation because of ""persistent and structural market problems"".
IAG was created by a merger between the British and Spanish flag carriers in 2011, overseen by Walsh, who will step down next month.
Luis Gallego, who has led Iberia since 2014, will succeed Walsh, an appointment that analysts said signaled little change of direction for the group.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said: ""Our investment to date has been highly successful and the announced increase in our shareholding is evidence of our continued support of IAG and its strategy.""
The cost of increasing its IAG holding is 465 million pounds, based on the closing price of IAG's shares on Tuesday.
Qatar first invested in IAG in 2015, buying 9.99% of the company, and has steadily increased its holding since then."

But word traveled across groups on the WeChat messaging platform that some were doing business on the streets. By Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of traders had gathered.
""I think it's pretty funny, and the atmosphere here is great,"" said Xu Peng, a microchip trader in a crowd of about 30 traders outside one of the market buildings.
Many of the traders clutched bags full of electronic wares as they scanned their phones and waited for buyers or suppliers.
""This place is finally starting to wake up,"" he said, before taking a supplier's call.
Shenzhen is one of the cities hardest hit by the coronavirus outside of Hubei province, with over 400 confirmed cases. Many apartment blocks have banned visitors and require residents to obtain permission slips before going outside.
Yet so far, police have left the traders at Huaqiangbei alone. An employee at the local government department responsible for virus safety inspections said the traders were not breaking any rules.
Huaqiangbei acts as the major matching hub for companies across the world and the factories of southern Guangdong province. Many factories are closed and suppliers are unable to return to the market, worrying traders.
The virus outbreak is having a big impact, Cheng Weiling said through her facemask while checking her phone.
""Lots of people are still trapped in their hometowns and so lots of places can't open,"" she said.
Microchip and board trader Yi Liang agreed.
""There's lots of demand, but some people just can't get hold of the inventory,"" he said.
Traders lose significant income while the shutdown continues, said Donny Zhang, CEO of Sand and Wave, a hardware consulting and sourcing company based in the Huaqiangbei area.
""A small counter might only be one meter wide in size, but their yearly revenue could be 10 million yuan ($1.43 million),"" he said.
There are signs that China is starting to return to normal, with more traffic in major city streets this week than last. Over half of large-scale enterprises in Guangdong have returned to work, the provincial government said on Tuesday."

The strike calls, reported earlier by French news site La Tribune, pose a new challenge to plans by Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith to cut back the French carrier's loss-making domestic network and restore its profitability.
The Franco-Dutch airline group had no immediate comment on the planned industrial action, a spokesman said.
Following a Tuesday works council, French ground-staff unions said they were maintaining a call for Feb. 21-22 strikes and stoppages at Paris Orly and provincial airports, as the SNPL pilots' union called a first strike by Hop pilots for Feb. 24.
""Ground staff have made all the efforts asked of them, but it's never enough,"" five staff unions said in a joint statement.
The CFDT, CFE-CGC, CGT, FO and UNSA unions also expressed concern about widespread job outsourcing and called for new hires and transfers to fill gaps left by voluntary buyouts.
The pilots have rejected a management pay proposal that amounts to a 3% overall increase, according to La Tribune. An SNPL union official was not immediately available.
Air France labor relations have seen a period of relative calm since CEO Smith's arrival in 2018, after a wave of strikes that cost 335 million euros ($362 million) and forced his predecessor out. He now plans to cut the short-haul fleet to 50-60 aircraft from 70 and close the worst-performing routes."

HERZOGENAURACH, Germany (Reuters) - German sportswear makers Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and Puma (DE:PUMG) have both warned that the coronavirus outbreak was hurting their business in China due to store closures and fewer Chinese tourists travelling and shopping in other markets.
Adidas and Puma make almost a third of their sales in Asia, which has been a major growth market for the sporting goods industry in recent years. The region is also the main sourcing hub, with China a major producer for both companies.
Adidas said in a statement on Wednesday that its business in the greater China area had dropped by about 85% year-on-year in the period since Chinese New Year on Jan. 25. China accounted for 20% of Adidas sales in 2018.
Puma said it expected the virus outbreak to hit its sales and profits in the first quarter but it still hoped to reach its targets for 2020, after reporting better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter, sending its shares up more than 8%.
Adidas said it had also seen lower shopper traffic, mainly in Japan and South Korea, but added it had not yet registered any major business impact beyond greater China.
It said it could not yet quantify the overall impact on its business for 2020, adding it would give more details when it publishes 2019 results on March 11.
Adidas sells its products from about 12,000 stores in China, most of them franchises plus less than 500 own-operated stores. Almost a fifth of its shoes and apparel are produced in the country and an Adidas spokeswoman said the company was working to mitigate the impact on sourcing, declining to give details.
OUTBOUND SHIPMENTS
Puma said more than half of its stores in China were temporarily closed and the decline of Chinese tourism was also hurting other markets, especially in Asia, such as Singapore, Japan and Taiwan. But it is working under the assumption that the situation will normalise in the short term.
Puma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden told a news conference that most of its factories were already operating again after the Chinese New Year and outbound shipments had improved in the last four to five days as ports reopened.
""We should be able to fulfil February and March orders with a three-week delay,"" he said.
Gulden said if stores were still closed in four weeks then Puma might have to reconsider its 2020 guidance, noting that China accounts for up to 13% of sales and is also its most profitable market.
In the fourth quarter, Puma reported its strongest sales growth in the Asia/Pacific region of a currency-adjusted 23%.
""An aggressive response to the crisis seems to be helping contain the epidemic,"" said Jefferies analyst James Grzinic.
""If confirmed, this would suggest that a tough first quarter should be followed by a strong recovery in the second quarter and beyond."""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Citi (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) have started talks with other banks to sell roughly $9 billion in debt Dubai raised to take full control of DP World (DI:DPW) and refinance borrowings of Dubai World, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Dubai announced this week one of its state companies, Port and Free Zone World (PFZW), part of state investment vehicle Dubai World, aims to buy publicly listed shares of port operator DP World in a deal with a $13.9 billion valuation which will end up adding billions of dollars of debt to DP World's books.
Citi and Deutsche Bank have underwritten roughly $9 billion of debt for the transaction and have started discussions with other lenders to decrease their exposure by distributing the debt, the sources said.
The banks declined to comment. DP World did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dubai World, a conglomerate with interests in ports, real estate and hospitality, signed a $25 billion debt restructuring agreement in 2011 after Dubai was hit by the global financial crisis.
DP World's planned de-listing will add leverage to the company, which pushed rating agencies Moody's and Fitch to put the firm under review this week for a potential downgrade.
As part of the deal, DP World will borrow $5.15 billion to fund a dividend to Dubai World, which is the sole shareholder of PFZW, helping it meet outstanding obligations to lenders.
""The sizable dividend payment to Dubai World breaks our current assumption that DP World's credit profile is unaffected by the debt burden at the level of Dubai World,"" Moody's said.
The $9 billion in debt includes the dividend payment, $2.7 billion for the purchase of the listed shares, and the refinancing of some debt maturities, said one of the sources.
""New money for the deal is only the one needed to buy the shares, the rest is just refinancing,"" he said.
After the 2009 debt crisis, Dubai had to rely on $20 billion in bailout loans from Abu Dhabi and the UAE central bank to stave off a sovereign default.
Fitch said last year that Dubai may need to again restructure a significant part of $23 billion in loans raised by Dubai government-related entities and due to mature by the end of next year.
One of the sources said that while the DP World de-listing involves a debt repayment for Dubai World, the deal was not engineered to consolidate Dubai's debt or extend its maturities.
DP World said in a statement this week the de-listing would allow it to focus on its medium- to long-term strategy and that the demands of the equity markets for short term returns were incompatible with its long-term plans."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - General Motors will begin laying off around 1,500 employees in Thailand in June, after announcing the sale of its production plants in the country, a government official said on Wednesday. 
GM (N:GM) said on Monday it would sell its two plants in the eastern industrial province of Rayong to China's Great Wall Motor (SS:601633). Its latest moves to retreat from Asia also included winding down its Australian and New Zealand operations. 
Jak Punchoopet, adviser to the Minister of Labour, told Reuters all of the Rayong plants' employees would be laid off under the terms of GM's sale agreement with Great Wall.
""The agreement was only for the sale of the plants and didn't include the transfer of employees,"" he said. 
""Their plan is to lay off 1,000 employees in the auto parts manufacturing line in June, and then around 300 to 400 in the assembly line in October,"" Jak said. The rest of the staff at the two plants would be let go towards the end of 2020, he said. 
""Everything will be done by the end of the year."" 
GM will abide by Thai labour law and provide severance pay for the affected employees, Jak said, adding that the company will also grant an additional four-month bonus to all employees. 
Great Wall Motor, one of China's biggest sport-utility vehicle makers, said it will sell cars from the Thai base as part of its plans to go global and tap the Southeast Asian automotive industry, for which Thailand is a hub. 
GM Southeast Asia's representative, Sean Poppitt, said that the Thai Ministry of Labour's information was ""broadly correct"" and referred questions on whether any employees might be rehired to Great Wall Motor.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",Renault shares fall after Moody's cuts its debt to 'junk' status,"PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) shares fell on Wednesday after Moody's cut its rating on the French carmaker's debt to ""junk"" status, citing weaker profitability as the company restructures and grapples with falling demand. 
The shares were down 1.9% at 0942 GMT, among the worst performers on Paris' benchmark CAC-40 (FCHI) index. They earlier fell 2.3% to 30.2 euros ($32.71) a share, their lowest since mid 2012, when auto manufacturers were still reeling from the global financial crisis and recessions in Europe. 
Like some rivals, and its Japanese alliance partner Nissan (T:7201),  Renault  is under pressure as demand dwindles in markets like China. It is also bedding down a new management team after a scandal surrounding former boss Carlos Ghosn. 
Moody's late on Tuesday cut its credit rating on Renault to Ba1 after the company last week posted its first loss in a decade, in a move that will likely add to financing costs. 
Fellow rating agency Standard & Poor's said on Wednesday it was placing Renault on CreditWatch Negative, meaning it could also revise its investment grade BBB- rating downwards. 
Renault last week set an operating margin goal for this year at between 3% and 4%, down from 4.8% in 2019, and forecast further declines in the global auto market.
Moody's said it did not expect Renault to return to ""healthy"" operating margin levels in the medium term, and highlighted other challenges the carmaker has in common with peers, including high investments to produce less polluting vehicles.
""The cost to comply with CO2 regulation in the European Union and the ongoing electrification of Renault's fleet will have further dilutive effects on profitability,"" Moody's said. 
Brokerage Jefferies cut its share price target for Renault to 28 euros from 38 euros.
""Renault is set to remain income poor for a while,"" it wrote, keeping an ""underperform"" rating on the stock.
Renault's interim Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos is embarking on a sweeping review of the carmaker which could lead to factory closures and job cuts. 
Luca de Meo, a former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) executive, is due to take on the CEO job in July, in the latest management rejig after Ghosn was arrested in late 2018 in Tokyo on financial misconduct charges, which he denies. Ghosn has since fled to Lebanon. 
Delbos stressed last week that Renault had no issues with cash availability, in response to a January report by Citi analysts who said cash flow was strained and the carmaker might need some form of equity injection.

Delbos said Renault's automotive operational free cash flow would be positive in 2020 after stripping out restructuring costs.

1522,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 05:38AM ET</span>",StockBeat: T-Mobile Parent Deutsche Telekom Eyes Rerating on Sprint Deal,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) stock rose to its highest in nearly three years on Wednesday after chief executive Tim Hoettges looked forward to a potentially massive unlocking of value in a U.S. investment that has languished for years.
The decision earlier this month by a New York District Court removing the last obstacles to the merger of its T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) unit with Sprint (NYSE:S) has transformed the investment case for that unit and, in doing so, has materially improved the investment case for the parent.
Instead of being the permanently-squeezed fourth-largest player in the U.S., aggressively discounting to gain market share, T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is now going to be comparable in size to AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), with enhanced pricing power in a market dominated by three large players rather than four (at least, that’s the logic: Telekom’s margins in Germany haven't improved much since a similar concentration resulting from Vodafone’s acquisition of Liberty Global’s local assets).
After years of waiting for the merger to be cleared, investors have largely forgotten that story. According to Reuters, Hoettges said the 'new' T-Mobile would have a market value of around $120 billion, less than half the value of either of the big two.
""That is a difference of around $120 billion. I see no reason why this cannot be reduced considerably,"" Hoettges said in prepared remarks.
The German giant is set to have 42% of the new T-Mobile/Sprint venture. Even at a more conservative valuation of $200 billion, that would still imply an equity value of $84 billion for DT’s share – more than Telekom's entire market capitalization at today’s prices. 
Even allowing for the high cost of building out 5G networks in both the U.S. and Europe, and even allowing for the fact that net debt, at 2.65 times EBITDA, is still above AT&T’s, it would seem churlish not to ascribe any value to Telekom’s non-U.S. business. 
In the year just finished, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow were all clearly higher. Stripped of one-off factors, the bottom line grew by 8.9% percent to 4.9 billion euros ($5.3 billion). A dividend yield of 3.6% is respectable enough, even if slower core earnings growth ahead leaves little promise of big increases.
Telekom has been the slowest of slow burners for many years. Even now, the stock is still short of its 2017 peak and below where it was as far back as 2004. But with the road ahead of T-Mobile finally clear, the prospects look as good as at any time in that period."

LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock (N:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, has appointed two executives to oversee its operations in continental Europe as part of efforts to expand in the region, a memo to staff on Wednesday seen by Reuters showed.
BlackRock has accelerated its investment in the region as a strategic priority over the last two years and now runs more than $1 trillion there, ""making us the largest independent asset manager on the Continent,"" Rachel Lord, its head of Europe, Middle East and Africa, said in the memo.
With ""an ambitious strategy for growth"", Lord said BlackRock needed dedicated leadership in continental Europe and so had appointed Stephane Lapiquonne and Christian Hyldahl to jointly lead the company's efforts.
The two would work with the firm's country managers and regional leadership to develop a continental European platform for BlackRock, she said.
""The objective is to help individual countries deliver BlackRock’s scale and collective voice to our people, clients and wider stakeholders,"" Lord said.
Paris-based Lapiquonne joined the firm in 2010 to build the company's Financial Markets Advisory capability in EMEA. Copenhagen-based Hyldahl joined last year and was previously chief executive of Danish pension fund ATP and Nordea Asset Management.
Both will report to Lord and will represent the region on the company's European Executive Committee. Hyldahl and Lapiquonne will remain country managers for the Nordics and for France, Belgium and Luxembourg, respectively.
BlackRock has more than 2,000 employees in more than 15 offices across continental Europe, compared with more than 3,000 in Britain, which it has previously said will remain its European base of operations after Brexit.
Britain's exit from the European Union has prompted many large asset managers with continental European clients to set up or expand their presence there, to ensure a continued right to trade.
As part of its expansion in the region, BlackRock last year bought French data firm eFront for $1.3 billion. It also announced plans to build up its so-called ""alternatives"" investing team in Paris and moved some staff to the Netherlands.

BlackRock has ridden a wave of increased demand from clients to use cheaper index-tracking funds, a trend that is expected to continue and which has also benefitted Amundi (PA:AMUN), the region's largest asset manager by total assets and which is majority owned by French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).

LONDON (Reuters) - A decline in the number of new coronavirus cases in China and mounting expectations for more policy stimulus boosted global stock markets on Wednesday, helping ease some of the alarm caused by an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) revenue warning.
China posted the lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases since Jan. 29, helping to lift the offshore-traded yuan to two-week highs against the dollar and pushing the yen to a one-month low.
Many view Chinese data on the virus with scepticism, but sentiment was lifted by a Bloomberg report that Beijing was considering cash injections or mergers to bail out airlines hit by the virus.
Those steps would come after this week's cut in the medium-term lending rate, which has fed expectations for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate.
A pan-European equity index rose 0.4% to test recent record highs and futures indicated a stronger open for Wall Street. Earlier, an MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan rose 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei index gained almost 1%, helped by the yen's retreat.
Chinese mainland shares closed in the red, however. 
Edward Park, chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald, cited President Xi Jinping's latest commitment to meeting 2020 growth targets.
""This in itself implies there will be more fiscal and monetary stimulus,"" Park said. ""That's the real carrot for markets today.""
Tuesday's U.S. Empire manufacturing survey also reassured investors the world's biggest economy was in good shape, he said. That somewhat tempered worries caused by Apple's warning it might miss sales targets because of pressure on its supply chains.
Market fears still kept gold trading above $1,600 an ounce and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields some 35 basis points below where they started 2020.
""There is some nervousness that economic data outside the United States is not amazing,"" Park said.
China, the world's second-largest economy, is struggling to get manufacturing back online after severe travel restrictions were imposed to contain the coronavirus. Japanese exports fell for the 14th straight month in January, data showed. 
Growth worries were reflected in a dismal German investor sentiment survey and the U.S. Treasury curve, where yields on three-month bills rose above yields on 10-year notes -- an inversion that's been a fairly reliable recession predictor in the past.
The yield on three-month bills stood at 1.5949%, above the 10-year yield of 1.5661%.
Investors are waiting to see what other growth-supportive measures could be introduced, particularly in the euro zone. They will also keep an eye on the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting. 
The Fed has signaled that it's keeping an eye on the coronavirus impact but has no intention of cutting interest rates anytime soon. Many analysts reckon it could be forced to change its mind.
""Given the risks we see to both growth and inflation falling short of expectations this year, we still expect the Fed’s view on the need for additional rate cuts to shift later this year,"" NatWest analysts told clients, adding they were ""not at this time removing rate cuts from our forecast.""
But the contrast between euro zone and U.S. economic indicators are weighing on the euro, which has reached a three-year low versus the dollar, though it rose back above the $1.08 level it breached on Tuesday for the first time since 2017.
Brent crude futures rose around 0.7% to $58.12 a barrel, as a reduction in supply from Libya offset concerns about weaker Chinese demand.

HONG KONG/MACAU (Reuters) - Casinos in Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, reopen on Thursday after being closed for two weeks because of the coronavirus epidemic, but all punters and croupiers will have to wear a mask at the tables.
Casino executives and residents say revenue will remain badly crimped in the Chinese territory's 41 casinos and the businesses dependent on them because of the health restrictions and strict entry regulations on tourists.
Macau makes over 80 percent of its revenues from casinos but tourist visits have all but dried up.
Authorities said last week the city was receiving around 2,000 daily visitors, a drop of around 98 percent year on year. The government has suspended an individual travel scheme through which visitors from the mainland gain entry and curtailed transport, including the cancellation of ferry services from neighboring Hong Kong.
The former Portuguese territory's over 600,000 people are also mostly staying at home.
Casinos say they are bleeding between $1.5 million-$2.6 million on a daily basis to keep their staff on payroll and maintain contractual obligations.
The government this week gave the green light for casinos to reopen after a two-week suspension aimed at controlling the virus outbreak. But the gaming regulator has imposed strict rules for casinos including temperature checks, mask protection and health declarations for staff and guests.
Only half the tables on a casino floor are permitted to be open to ensure adequate distance between people. Patrons are not allowed to stand or congregate, according to a government notice. Each baccarat table, which normally seats seven people and dozens of boisterous onlookers, will only be allowed four players.
""It is wise to open a little bit, even if business is slow. The government wants us to open because it signals a sign of stability for Macau,"" said a senior Macau casino executive who could not be named due to company policy.
Operators including  Wynn Macau  (HK:1128), Sands China (HK:1928),  MGM China  (HK:2282) and Galaxy Entertainment (HK:0027) said they will reopen in phases. They have 30 days to open fully according to a government mandate.
Analysts and executives predict that even with the reopening of casinos, gaming revenue will drop at least 80 percent in February and 50 percent in March year on year with the sector likely to take weeks to get back to normal.
""Business will likely remain extremely slow anyway amidst the restrictions on visas and transportation. Most Chinese players are probably unable or unwilling to travel at this point,"" said DS Kim, an analyst at JP Morgan in Hong Kong.
CHINA'S ONLY CASINOS
Macau has reported only 10 cases of coronavirus infection and no new cases since Feb 4. On the mainland, more than 74,000 people have been infected and over 2,000 have died.
The special administrative region is China’s only location where casino gambling is legal and 90 percent of visitors come from greater China.
New property openings including SJM’s Grand Lisboa Palace, Galaxy’s Phase III and Sands’ Londoner projects may also be delayed by a few months, say analysts, with construction workers facing two weeks of quarantine if they come from mainland China.
Mainlanders account for over 60 percent of the former Portuguese colony’s non-resident workers.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Wednesday, helped by strong earnings from index heavyweight Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), while market participants looking to central banks to mitigate the damage caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus in China. 

At 03:50 ET (0850 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 0.8% higher, France's CAC 40 was up 0.5%, while the DAX was 0.4% higher. The broad based Stoxx Europe 600 index posted another record high, gaining 0.6% to 432.96.

Shares in Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) rose 2.7% after reporting bottom line gains of 80% year-on-year, with U.S. unit T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) gleaning millions more customers ahead of a merger with competitor Sprint (NYSE:S).
This made 2019 ""the most successful year in the history of the company,” Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) said in a statement.
Earlier Wednesday, while stock markets in China traded lower, many neighboring countries saw gains, helping the overall tone in Europe. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 closed 0.9% higher, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 0.5% and the KOSPI 50 in South Korea rose 0.1%.
""Part of the thinking that is supporting markets is the actions that China takes to support its economy,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""Any investor concern around impact on demand globally from the virus will be offset by expectations that global central banks will ride to the rescue.""

Elsewhere in Europe, shares in International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways, climbed 1.3% after Qatar Airways Group increased its stake to 25.1%, a vote of confidence in the group's strategy.
Looking at European economic data, there are U.K. inflation numbers for January, at 04:30 AM ET (0930 GMT). Expectations are for an acceleration in the headline consumer price index to 1.6% from 1.3% in January. This is still below the Bank of England’s 2% target, but could weaken the case for rate cuts in the coming months.
Oil markets rebounded Wednesday on the back of the U.S. decision to sanction a trading subsidiary of Russia's Rosneft for helping transport Venezuela's oil to refineries in India and China. This move may cut aggregate supply marginally.
AT 03:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $52.68 a barrel and Brent rose 0.6% to $58.09.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,610.65/oz, holding above the physiologically important $1,600 level for the first time since U.S.-Iran tensions sent it spiking to $1,611.42 in early January. EUR/USD traded at 1.0806, after pushing as low as $1.0786 for the first time since April 2017."

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Shanghai has compiled a list of firms, including local units of multi-nationals  Unilever  PLC (L:ULVR) and 3M Co (N:MMM), as eligible for millions of dollars in subsidized loans to ease any blow from the coronavirus outbreak, according to bankers and documents seen by Reuters.
In an economically bruising three weeks, China has cordoned off cities and suspended transport links in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.
Some lenders in the city have each received a list of firms compiled by the Shanghai branches of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), according to seven bankers, each at a different lender.
""Every bank in Shanghai is rushing to lend to the companies on its list, to earn political goodwill,"" said one banker who had seen a list with 194 firms, including restaurant operators and property developers.
Other lenders have received shorter versions of the list, bankers said.
Companies have the option to nominate themselves to be added to the overall list. Each lender then determines independently whether to approach a company on its list and offer finance, according to the bankers.
Companies producing medical supplies and which are ""backbone enterprises"" providing daily necessities are eligible for the special loans, according to a notice on the Shanghai MIIT's website.
China is trying to deal with a nationwide shortage of medical supplies, from face masks to protective suits, while hospitals in central Hubei province - the epicenter of the outbreak - struggle to manage hundreds of new cases a day.
One bank's list of firms reviewed by Reuters included 3M Medical Devices and Materials Manufacturing (Shanghai) Co Ltd, Unilever (China) Co Ltd as well as medical supply firms Shanghai Kindly Enterprise Development Group Co Ltd (SS:603987) and  Tellgen  Corp (SZ:300642).
There is no indication from the list that loans offered will necessarily be sought, or that such firms are in any financial need.
The  Bank of Shanghai Co Ltd  (SS:601229) told Reuters it will lend 5.5 billion yuan ($786 million) to 57 firms on its list. 
So far, 430 million yuan of that has been drawn down at an average interest rate of 2.65%, the bank said. With subsidies, the borrower only pays 1.32%, it said.
Under a similar program in Beijing, companies sought bank loans totaling at least $8.2 billion, Reuters reported earlier this month.
The aim of the loans is to ensure financial support to key companies helping prevent and fight the epidemic, the Shanghai government notice said.
Shanghai authorities are compiling the list to help the central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), funnel 300 billion yuan of cheap loans to virus-hit companies nationwide.
Shanghai-based medical equipment manufacturer Derlar, on a list seen by Reuters, put its name down for financing last week, said a person surnamed Shen in Derlar's finance department, adding the firm had not yet received any money.
 Shanghai Kaibao Pharmaceutical  Co Ltd (SZ:300039), on the same list, said it had not yet received a loan, in response to Reuters' questions about its application. A person surnamed Ren in the firm's finance department added it will provide more details if money is received.
Banks which have received a list of potential borrowers include the Shanghai branches of Ping An Bank Co Ltd (SZ:000001), China CITIC Bank Corp Ltd (SS:601998), China Guangfa Bank Co Ltd [GDDVB.UL], China  Merchants Bank  Co Ltd (SS:600036), Shanghai Huarui Bank and the Bank of Ningbo Co Ltd (SZ:002142), according to people working at those lenders, who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
The lenders, MIIT, NDRC and PBOC did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
A spokeswoman from Unilever said it had ""no current plans to apply for any financing support"".
3M and other companies listed including Shanghai Kindly Enterprise Development Group and Tellgen did not respond to requests for comment.
NO INTEREST
One Shanghai-based face mask manufacturer on the list will not pay any interest on a loan from the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Ningbo if government subsidies are taken into account, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd, a unit of Swiss drug firm Roche Holding AG (S:ROG), was also on a loan list seen by Reuters. A spokesman for the firm said ""the company did not apply for any loans"".
After banks make the loans, they can then claim more funding from the central bank, according to the PBOC's website.

China has issued more than 1,600 force majeure certificates to shield companies from legal damages arising from the coronavirus outbreak, state news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday, an indication of difficulties faced by Chinese firms.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Investigators with India's antitrust watchdog have found no evidence that the country's biggest airline, IndiGo (NS:INGL), and four rival carriers colluded to fix ticket prices, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2015 ordered a probe into allegations of anti-competitive practices after similar fares were being offered on certain routes by IndiGo, SpiceJet (NS:SPJT), GoAir, state-run Air India (AIN.UL) and now-defunct Jet Airways (NS:JET).
The CCI inquiry, which included an analysis of the algorithms airlines to determine ticket fares, found that all five airlines were working independently, the three sources said.
""No direct evidence of cartelization was found,"" said one of the sources, who added the investigation also did not reveal any communication amongst airline executives to fix prices.
Budget airline IndiGo, the country's biggest carrier, said in a statement ""the case is without merit"" and added that it has been cooperating with the investigation.
The second-biggest airline, SpiceJet, GoAir, Air India and Jet Airways did not respond to a request for comment. The CCI did not respond to questions from Reuters.
An adverse finding could have led to a fine of up to three times the profit made in each year prices were fixed, or 10% of annual revenue, whichever is higher. Indian airlines are already grappling with slow growth in air traffic.
Details of the CCI case, which was investigated in two phases, have not been made public in line with the watchdog's practice.
The agency, whose senior members are reviewing the investigation findings, has not made a final ruling and could further extend the investigation. But two of the sources said the airlines were likely to be cleared.
The CCI's investigation arm had already produced a report in 2016 saying no antitrust practices were detected. The agency directed a further probe into fare-determining software and seat-allocation patterns, a second source said.
Antitrust lawyer Gautam Shahi, who is not involved in the case, said a finding of no antitrust misconduct would be a big relief for a sector that has faced intense scrutiny.
In a separate antitrust case in 2018, the CCI found that IndiGo, Jet Airways and SpiceJet had colluded over fuel surcharge rates on cargo flights, fining them a total of 544 million rupees ($7.61 million). The airlines have appealed that judgment."
1534,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 02:22AM ET</span>",GFG Alliance to invest 2 billion euros in European steel operations,"By Barbara Lewis and Eric Onstad
LONDON (Reuters) - British-based conglomerate GFG Alliance will invest 2 billion euros ($2 billion), mostly in Romania and the Czech Republic, to modernize its emissions-heavy European steel plants and boost production, it said on Wednesday.
The investment is a leap of faith in a sector that is grappling with issues of over-supply and falling demand, expected to be made worse by the impact of the coronavirus.
But it is also under pressure from investors worried about climate change when steel is responsible for an estimated 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions.
Some of the cash from commodities tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's GFG will go toward installing electric furnaces, which can reduce emissions by around 60%.
Privately-held GFG will invest 1 billion euros in its Galati operations in Romania and 750 million euros at its Ostrava plant in the Czech Republic, a statement said.
The more flexible electric-powered mills, which can require less than half as much manpower, will not replace coal-fired furnaces, so no jobs are under threat for now, Neil Barrell, GFG global chief operating officer, told Reuters.
""In the short term... the two plants will run in tandem, so we wouldn't need to embark on any labor conversations,"" Barrell said.
He said the investment at Galati would increase production to 4 million tonnes per year over time, while for Ostrava, the output increase could be more than 50%.
GFG did not give current output figures, but said Galati has capacity of 3.6 million tonnes and Ostrava of 3 million. An industry source, who declined to be named, said both mills were operating below capacity.
While investing in raising output in a sector burdened with surpluses may take time to pay off financially, overhauling heavily polluting production methods could help allay future emissions-related costs.
A major advantage of electric arc furnace technology is that it can be easily turned on and off to respond to market conditions.
Gupta, who heads the privately-held GFG Alliance, has snapped up steel assets around the world and made repeated offers to buy British Steel, which is being acquired by China's Jingye Group.
Asked whether GLG would still be interested if the Jingye deal falls through, Barrell said the group was monitoring the situation very closely.
GFG had grown rapidly from its roots as a metals trader by spending billions of dollars buying up often troubled metals manufacturing facilities around the world.
It acquired assets in Romania, the Czech Republic, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and North Macedonia after the European Commission approved ArcelorMittal's purchase of Ilva on condition it sold off some of its works.
GFG said the remaining 250 million euros announced on Wednesday would be spread over its other European operations.
The company said on Tuesday it had bought a bankrupt steel plant in India for $60 million in its first investment in Gupta's homeland.
Asked whether more acquisitions were in the pipeline, Barrell said: ""Sanjeev is ambitious to see the group grow."""

Earlier this month Jefferies, part of Jefferies Financial Group (N:JEF), announced plans to host a new, week-long investor ""forum"" in the same venue and at about the same time in September that CLSA has typically held its own high-profile forum, which has been running since 1994.

CLSA's new four-day event will focus on accessing China, and be held the week before the Jefferies event.
A ""save the date"" notice sent to clients and seen by Reuters said CLSA was ""substantially upgrading"" access to companies offered through its event and also promised a select number of VIP trips to China for the following week when Jefferies holds its own conference.
Those trips include meetings with some of China's ""most senior and influential corporate leaders and policymakers,"" the notice said.
""More than ever before, this year's event will leverage CITIC Securities’ deep corporate relationships to provide unrivalled China corporate access to international investors,"" said Edward Park, CEO of Institutional Equities at CLSA, in a statement to Reuters.
CLSA, best known for its punchy research, was bought by Chinese state-backed broker CITIC Securities (SS:600030) in 2013 for $1.3 billion.

BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Foreign pilots at some Chinese airlines have returned to their home countries and are considering other jobs after being placed on unpaid leave as demand falls because of the coronavirus, affected flight crew told Reuters.
Meanwhile, Chinese pilots with greater job security said their income has been sharply reduced because most of their pay is based on flying hours.
Data firm OAG estimates about 80% of scheduled airline capacity to, from and within China has been cut this week because of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has killed more than 2,000 people. Chinese airlines have been the hardest hit.
Major employers of foreign pilots, including China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co Ltd (SS:600029) and HNA Group's Hainan Airlines Holding Co Ltd (SS:600221), have acted swiftly to cut their losses, according to pilots and industry experts.
China Southern did not respond immediately to a request for comment, and HNA declined to comment.
""All the foreign pilots are on leave until the virus situation gets better,"" said an expatriate captain at China Southern who, like all of those who spoke to Reuters, requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with media. ""For the moment we are all in our home countries.""
Expats are typically paid more than local staff and work on contracts, which means they are more expendable in a downturn, industry experts said.
""We have seen pilots heading back to Australia in January and February due to the stand down and seeking new roles,"" said Kirsty Ferguson, the head of Sydney-based airline interview coaching firm Pinstripe Solutions.
As China's airline sector ballooned, it imported foreign experience: the number of foreign pilots flying with Chinese airlines more than doubled to over 1,500 between 2010 and 2019, according the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
China will need another 124,000 pilots in the next 20 years, according to Boeing (NYSE:BA), as an expanding middle class drives demand for air travel. But foreign pilots said being put on leave without pay makes it less likely they'll return when demand recovers.
A foreign captain at Fuzhou Airlines, part of HNA Group, said he was placed on unpaid leave when the virus hit and was concerned it would be permanent.
""They hope people will find other jobs as none can go without pay forever,"" he said. ""This way they 'save their face,' and secondly they don't feel obliged to dismiss you properly according to the contract.""
The pilot said that he was looking for jobs closer to home, but that so far those options paid less than in China. Foreign pilots can make more than $300,000 a year there, making it one of the best-paying markets in the world.
A pilot at Tianjin Airlines, also part of HNA Group, said he was told it would be at least three to four months before the carrier starts recalling expatriate captains. He has found work with another foreign airline, he said.
HNA declined to comment.
A local pilot at China Southern said he was barely flying and as a result was receiving only his base salary, roughly 1/6 to 1/8 of his normal pay.
""What we can do now is keep a good mentality and enjoy the company of our family at home,"" he said. ""Eat well, sleep well and exercise well and keep learning. Build up the energy so that we'll be well prepared for whatever comes later."""
1542,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 09:39PM ET</span>","Hormel joins Tyson Foods, JBS in removing drug banned by China from hog supply","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Spam-maker  Hormel Foods Corp  (N:HRL) is eliminating a growth drug banned by China from its hog supply, the company said on Tuesday, joining rivals that are seeking to increase meat sales to Chinese buyers grappling with a pork shortage.
Hormel will not accept any hogs that have been fed or exposed to the drug ractopamine after April 1, the company said in a statement.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and JBS USA said last year they would remove the drug from their supply chains. The companies' moves ramped up the competition to profit from increased demand in China, the world's largest pork consumer, where an outbreak of the fatal pig disease African swine fever has decimated herds.
""We have been actively monitoring the changing global market dynamics for several years and believe this decision will further position us to meet growing international demand,"" Hormel said.
Ractopamine is used in some countries to raise leaner pigs, but China does not allow its use or tolerate residues in imported meat. The European Union also bans ractopamine.
 Elanco Animal Health  Inc (N:ELAN) manufactures Paylean, its brand name for a ractopamine feed ingredient.
""We’re disappointed in any decision that would take safe, proven technology out of the hands of farmers,"" Elanco said.
China is expected to buy more U.S. pork after agreeing to significantly increase imports of American farm goods as part of an interim trade deal reached last month with Washington. Beijing said it will grant exemptions on retaliatory tariffs imposed against 696 U.S. goods, including pork, that had hampered American exports.
China agreed as part of the trade deal to work with U.S. experts to ""conduct a risk assessment for ractopamine in cattle and swine as soon as possible without undue delay,"" according to the agreement. It said the countries will establish a joint working group to discuss the steps to be taken based on the results of the assessment.
Chinese pork prices last week neared a record set in 2019 after measures to battle the coronavirus epidemic disrupted the transportation of pigs and the restart of slaughtering plants, crimping already tight supplies.

Hormel, which sells ham, pork tenderloin and other meat products, does not slaughter hogs itself. Instead, it partners with third-party suppliers that process the animals for Hormel's raw materials.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) found debris that could pose potential safety risks in the fuel tanks of several 737 MAX aircraft that are in storage and waiting to be delivered to airlines, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
Foreign object debris, an industrial term for rags, tools, metal shavings and other materials left behind by workers during the production process, has been a quality control issue for various Boeing aircraft, such as its KC-46 tankers.
Mark Jenks, general manager of the 737 program, told employees in the memo that such debris was ""absolutely unacceptable"" and that the company was taking steps to address the issue in its production system.
A Boeing spokesman confirmed the memo's authenticity, and said Boeing does not see the debris as contributing to delays in the jet's return to service.
The objects were found during maintenance work on some of the hundreds of 737 MAX jetliners Boeing has built but not delivered due to a worldwide ban imposed last March following two crashes that killed 346 people, he said.
The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>","Coronavirus threatens Apple supply chain, sales; shares drop","(Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) fell 2 % on Tuesday and dragged the stocks of its suppliers across the globe lower, after the iPhone maker warned of lower sales in the current quarter acknowledging that the coronavirus outbreak was pressuring its supply chain.
The drop in Apple's stock is set to wipe nearly $30 billion off its market capitalization, just as it was inching closer to $1.5 trillion in value. The stock was trading down at $318.74.
However, several Wall Street brokerages dubbed Apple's update forecast as a ""near-term headwind,"" saying the company is performing strongly outside China and the launch of 5G phones later this year would further boost sales.
""We believe any material weakness in Apple shares as a result of the March 20 quarter revenue shortfall will prove to be a buying opportunity,"" analysts at Piper Sandler wrote in a client note.
""The iPhone supply constraints in the current quarter could result in pent-up demand for future quarters,"" they said.
In late January, Apple had forecast $63 billion to $67 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March. It did not provide a new revenue estimate or a profit forecast on Monday.
Venture capital firm Loup Ventures expects March quarter revenue to be in the range of between $58 billion and $60 billion, with a 12% contribution from Greater China.
Manufacturing plants in China that produce Apple's iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said on Monday. That will mean fewer iPhones available for sale.
One of the primary iPhone manufacturing facilities in China is operating at a 25% factory utilization rate as many workers remain absent, Cowen analysts estimated.
""We believe utilization rates will improve linearly over the next several weeks to ~50% by mid-March and followed by a big improvement in late March to normal levels.""
Brokerage Canaccord Genuity expects Apple to sell 38 million iPhone units during the current quarter, eight million less from its earlier estimate.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday after a sales warning from Apple left investors assessing the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on U.S. companies.
But indexes ended off the day's lows and the Nasdaq ended a touch higher as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) trimmed its losses in late-session trading.
The world's most valuable technology firm said it would fall short of its recently announced quarterly sales target because of slower iPhone production and weaker demand in China due to the virus. Its shares ended down 1.8% at $319, while its low of the session was $314.61.
""Certainly this was not welcome news, but I don't think it's a debacle either,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""In general, investors are not overly concerned by the news from Apple as a read through to technology or the market overall.""
While the exact hit to economic and earnings growth from the epidemic in China remains to be seen, hopes that the damage would only be temporary have helped boost confidence on Wall Street in recent sessions.

1548,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 04:52PM ET</span>","Alstom, Bombardier shares fall after $6.7 billion rail deal","By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Allison Lampert
PARIS/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Shares of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA and Montreal-based Bombardier Inc fell on Tuesday after the French firm agreed to buy its Canadian rival's rail division for up to 6.2 billion euros ($6.7 billion), a deal likely to draw scrutiny from competition regulators and unions concerned about job cuts.
The cash and shares deal, announced Monday, will make the combined entity the world's second-biggest train maker after China's state-owned CRRC Corp. It is the latest attempt by Western rail firms to try to build scale to lower costs. 
JP Morgan analysts said there was uncertainty ahead ""during a lengthy anti-trust process.""
Bombardier shares were down 7.88% at C$1.52 near midday on Tuesday. Alstom shares closed 3.2% lower at 48.70 euros in Paris.
Bombardier would use sale proceeds to cut its debt, which has been a concern for investors and rating agencies. Its net debt would drop to $2.5 billion once the deal closes in the first half of 2021.
But it also leaves Bombardier as the only large pure business jet maker, compared with rivals which also generate revenue from military sales.
""If there were a serious market downturn, they would be at a major disadvantage, since there would be no defense revenue to compensate,"" said U.S. aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group.
Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said the company is focused on the ""most resilient market segments,"" of business aviation, including large cabin corporate aircraft and an aftermarket business that is ""less susceptible to economic cycles.""
""We are more than viable as a pure play,"" he told Reuters by email.
Alstom executives have sought to quell concerns about any hurdles they might face over competition issues, after EU regulators blocked its attempt to merge rail assets with Germany's  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) last year. 
U.S. regulators will also examine the deal, a Bombardier spokesman said.
The Bombardier acquisition has a lower market share in signaling than the Siemens option, which had been one of the main sticking points with regulators, Alstom Chief Executive Henri Poupart-Lafarge said on Monday. 
The transaction was complementary, with Bombardier more present in Northern Europe and Alstom in the south, Poupart-Lafarge said, adding it would not affect jobs.
The combined groups would have some 10,000 staff, including temporary workers, in Germany, where Bombardier Transportation has its headquarters and seven factories. 
France would be the second-biggest market in Europe, with some 6,730 total employees. 
French trade unions were initially sanguine about the transaction, saying they were reassured by the fact Alstom was still in hiring mode at the moment and that order books were full. 
Regarding job cuts, ""the project, such as it has been presented to us, does not seem to be leading down that road, but we remain very vigilant,"" Patrick de Cara, a representative for the CFDT union at Alstom, said.

HSBC Plc tumbled the most since 2009 after it said it will slash jobs in a restructuring, while also flagging risks from the virus.
Government bonds climbed, while the euro weakened after a German investor-confidence index plunged. Gold rallied.
Investors are still trying to judge the corporate and economic impact from the coronavirus, even as the growth rate of cases in China’s Hubei province -- the epicenter of the disease -- continues to stabilize. It’s a turnaround from Monday, when sentiment was lifted by Chinese policy makers’ moves to support companies hit by the prolonged shutdown of large parts of the country. BHP Group said commodity prices will take a hit if the fallout extends beyond the end of next month.
“The market has largely ignored what’s going on with the coronavirus in terms of what impact it might have, but I’m not sure that’s entirely appropriate,” said Jeff Mills, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust. “It’s likely to be temporary and the economy may bounce back, but this is different than what we saw with SARS.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 03:46PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chinese consortium Ecuagoldmining opens dispute with Ecuador over halted mine,"By Alexandra Valencia
QUITO (Reuters) - Chinese mining consortium Ecuagoldmining has initiated a dispute with Ecuador's government over a gold mining project that has been halted by objections from community activists, a move that could lead to a $480 million arbitration fight, an Ecuadorean official said in an interview on Tuesday.
Ecuagoldmining's Rio Blanco mine in southern Ecuador had barely kicked off production in 2018 when the activists, mostly comprising local farmers, demanded they be consulted on whether the mine should be allowed, and won a court order halting operations.
Deputy Mining Minister Enrique Gallegos-Anda said it was the first such dispute since Ecuador began a broad push to expand its mining sector, which has drawn investor interest but also faces concerns about the power of local groups to halt projects.
""The international dispute was presented in January,"" Gallegos-Anda told Reuters. ""The ministry needs to officially receive the invitation for talks. We are going to have a dialogue and will seek a solution.""
The six-month process is the first step in a potential arbitration as laid out in an investment treaty between Ecuador and China, Gallegos-Anda said.
He added that Ecuador's government hopes that a constitutional court ruling would allow the project to resume operations, avoiding an arbitration proceeding.
""The logical thing to do is wait for the magistrates of the court to conclude that the judges incorrectly interpreted the norms,"" said Gallegos-Anda. ""Shortly thereafter, the company could resume activities.""
If it does go to arbitration, the Ecuagoldmining will seek the full value of the gold that it expected to produce during the 11-year concession, he said, adding that he did not know which arbitration panel would hear the dispute.
Ecuagoldmining, a consortium made up of Chinese firms Junefield Mineral Resources Limited and Hunan Gold Group, declined to comment.
Community opposition to oil and mining projects has become a growing issue in Latin America, with local organizations in Peru and Colombia frequently demanding greater environmental protection and more jobs for those who live in the region.
Ecuador's constitutional court last year ruled against requests for popular referendums on mining projects involving Australia's SolGold PLC and Canada's INV Metals Inc."

In September last year, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) said it would launch a Canadian trial of plant-based Beyond Burgers.
And investor hopes that the fast-food giant will trial the plant-based burger in the U.S. has driven Beyond Meat's shares up about 50% for the year so far, leaving room for disappointment, Oppenheimer warned.
""Management guidance typically includes only confirmed distribution wins. Therefore, we think there is risk of a potential below-consensus estimate guide even though the ultimate 2020 delivery could be higher.""
There is more muted upside potential for the plant-based burger company, Oppenheimer said, citing a pricey valuation, increasing competition and the potential for new selling pressures following the expiration of the lock-up."
1554,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 03:01PM ET</span>","Consumer groups, unions oppose fix for planned merger of AbbVie and Allergan","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of unions and consumer groups wrote to U.S. antitrust enforcers on Tuesday to oppose a proposed remedy that could lead to U.S. approval for AbbVie Inc's (N:ABBV) planned purchase of Allergan Plc (N:AGN).
In its letter to the Federal Trade Commission, which is reviewing the merger to ensure it is legal, the groups argued that a plan for the companies to divest Allergan's brazikumab, which is being developed to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, was inadequate to resolve antitrust concerns raised by the planned deal.
AbbVie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The groups argued that the proposed buyer, AstraZeneca, appeared to have little incentive to bring the drug to market and that rebates offered by AbbVie for its Skyrizi drug would slow brazikumab's success in the market since both drugs treat similar ailments.
""We are skeptical that the divestiture to AstraZeneca of Allergan’s brazikumab, a drug in development, can adequately address the anticompetitive effects of the merger,"" said the letter, which was signed by the American Federation of Teachers, Families USA, U.S. PIRG Education Fund, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), American Federation of State, County, & Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and 12 other groups.
The $63 billion deal, which is expected to close this quarter, was approved by the European Union in January.
The deal was initially announced in June as a way for AbbVie to win control over the lucrative wrinkle treatment Botox and buy time to seek new growth before its blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira loses U.S. patent protection. AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said at the time that the company was able to buy Allergan because of the cash that Humira generates."

1556,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>","Tesla China Funding May Be Subject of SEC Inquiry, Evercore Says","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s financing arrangements in China may be the subject of the Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry that the electric-car maker disclosed last week, according to analysts at Evercore ISI.
The financing Tesla lined up from local banks last year may have allowed the carmaker to delay recognition of capital expenditures, Chris McNally, who rates Tesla shares the equivalent of a sell, said in a Feb. 14 report. The Evercore analyst said the arrangements also probably help explain how Tesla spent just $1.3 billion on capex last year, a little over half its budget for as much as $2.5 billion.
“It’s possible that TSLA’s Shanghai factory and extremely limited capex may be what the SEC is looking into,” McNally wrote. Representatives for Tesla didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, and Judy Burns, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Tesla disclosed in a regulatory filing last week that the SEC sent the company a subpoena on Dec. 4 seeking information on “certain financial data and contracts including Tesla’s regular financing arrangements.” In the same filing, the company said that much of the investment in its factory near Shanghai “has been and is expected to continue to be provided through local debt financing.”
Tesla disclosed in December that it had lined up 11.25 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in financing from local banks for the plant, which started producing Model 3 sedans late last year.
“We are supplementing such financing with limited direct capital expenditures by us, at a lower cost per unit of production capacity than that of Model 3 production at the Fremont factory,” Tesla said last week in its 10-K, referring to its higher-cost assembly plant in California.
After two straight quarterly profits, several analysts who have remained skeptical of Tesla’s earnings power have said the company will have to increase expenditures to follow through on Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s plans for new products and additional factories. The company plans to roll out the new Model Y crossover this quarter, start production of its Semi model this year and open a new plant near Berlin next year. It also has Cybertruck and Roadster models in development."

LONDON (Reuters) - Veteran banker Jean-Eudes Renier is taking on a new role as chairman of Bank of America's (N:BAC) global industrials investment banking unit as a part of a leadership reshuffle aimed at bolstering the bank's client coverage.
Renier, who has been co-heading global industrials investment banking out of London for more than a decade, will drop management responsibilities to focus entirely on building relationships with key clients, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
He will report into Jim O'Neil, who runs the Wall Street bank's corporate and investment banking business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
Greg Kelly, who used to run the team with Renier, will become sole head of global industrials investment banking and will remain based in New York, reporting into the bank's co-heads of global investment banking, Jack MacDonald and Thomas Sheehan.
As part of the new structure, Justin Anstee will become head of industrials for EMEA, while Diego Fortunati will take the helm of EMEA industrials M&A, according to a second memo.
This memo - which was sent by Greg Kelly and Matt Cannon, who runs EMEA investment banking - said Anstee would focus on covering clients in the region, while Fortunati would battle to win advisory mandates and execute on deals in the highly competitive M&A market.
The pair will have different managers, with Anstee reporting into Kelly and Cannon, while Fortunati will continue working for his current bosses, Luca Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Eamon Brabazon, who co-head M&A in EMEA, the memo said.
Ian Ferguson, who chairs UK and Ireland corporate and investment banking, will expand his remit to work closely with the various product and regional teams to ensure the bank keeps growing its advisory business across EMEA."

Shares of the company backed by billionaire Richard Branson have taken off in popularity among individual investors in recent sessions, nearly displacing Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), another favorite among non-professional investors.
Virgin Galactic was the third most traded stock on Fidelity's online brokerage in recent sessions, with two thirds of clients buying shares, rather than selling. Orders for Virgin Galactic on Fidelity trailed only Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Tesla.
Fanning enthusiasm around space tourism on Tuesday, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk's SpaceX announced plans https://spaceadventures.com/space-adventures-announces-agreement-with-spacex-to-launch-private-citizens-on-the-crew-dragon-spacecraft to send up to four private citizens on an orbital voyage aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft, launched on its Falcon 9 rocket.
Virgin Galactic is racing against SpaceX and Amazon (O:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to bring tourists into space, but is the only one of the three whose shares are publicly listed. That makes Virgin Galactic the only option for stock market investors who want to buy into the emerging business of space travel.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas, who has an ""overweight"" rating on Virgin Galactic, cautioned in a note on Tuesday that the recent surge has been ""driven by forces beyond fundamental factors.""
""We are very constructive on the Virgin Galactic story ... We just think the share price could use a breather,"" Jonas wrote, maintaining his $22 price target.
Virgin Galactic has over 600 reservations and $80 million in deposits for 90 minute flights that include several minutes of weightlessness, priced at $250,000 a ticket.
The shares received a boost last week after Virgin Atlantic moved its SpaceShipTwo vessel to its operational base in New Mexico. Attached to its carrier aircraft, VSS Unity was flown from its manufacturing facility in California.
The move to ""Spaceport America,"" a purpose-built commercial spaceport, lets it begin final stages of test flights, according to Virgin Galactic.
The hypersonic surge in Virgin Galactic follows a recent rally in Tesla shares, another stock wildly popular among non-professional investors. Fueled by improved profitability, the electric carmaker's stock has surged over 150% since early December, including a 6% rise on Tuesday.
Just three analysts cover Virgin Galactic, all of them rating it the equivalent of ""buy,"" according to Refinitiv. Their median price target is $19, compared to Tuesday's price of $35.70.
UBS has estimated that the business of outer-orbit travel will become a $3 billion industry by 2030."

Shetty and that it urgently sought clarity on his shareholding arrangements and holdings in the company.
Shetty on Monday resigned as co-chairman, creating further uncertainty for the UAE healthcare company, which has seen its shares collapse in the past few weeks on doubts about the shareholdings of its major investors.
The company said it was not able to independently verify the information received from Shetty or that contained in his Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities (PDMR) notification.
Shetty's resignation came a week after UK regulators said they were looking into NMC following a disclosure that he had misstated the size of his NMC stake. 
NMC vice chairman Khalifa Butti Omeir Bin Yousef had also stepped down from the board last week after a series of complex shareholder dealings involving him, Shetty, and another top investor, Saeed Butti Al Qebaisi.

The group's shares have lost about 70% of their value since U.S.-based short-seller Muddy Waters late last year raised questions about the company's financial statements. NMC said at the time the report was ""false and misleading"".

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - British overseas territory the Cayman Islands, the United States and Switzerland do most to help the globe's richest citizens hide and launder money, according to a ranking published on Tuesday by a group pushing for reform.
The study by the Tax Justice Network tests how much countries' legal and financial systems enable the hiding of wealth by checking, for example, on money-laundering laws, controls and the amount of financial activity in a country.
The research comes amid a renewed debate around financial reform, following scandals in Europe involving Russian money using the Baltics as a stepping stone to the western world.
Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, said the ""Anglo-American axis of secrecy"" was exacerbating corruption and tax abuse.
In its analysis, the study's authors said the Cayman Islands was part of what it dubbed Britain's 'spider web' of satellites, where London influences laws and the appointment of officials.
A document showed on Tuesday that European Union finance ministers have added the territory to the EU's blacklist of tax havens, along with Panama, the Seychelles and Palau.
The Cayman Islands, which is close to Cuba and was ranked in the study as the most prominent center for financial secrecy, hosts more than 100,000 companies, a number that outstrips the local population.
Its government said the TJN study ignored the fact that it met global standards, adding that it did not work ""in secret"" but cooperated with authorities around the world.
The British government said it was driving greater tax transparency globally and that the Cayman Islands was free to set its own taxes.
The study also singled out the United States for criticism, saying that although Washington had pushed other countries to reform, it had not done enough to stamp out illicit money flows at home, flagging secretive shell companies in some states.
The Tax Justice Network put Switzerland in third place in its ranking behind United States, saying its bank secrecy reform to share financial information with foreign authorities applied largely to rich countries rather than poor ones.
A Swiss government spokeswoman said it applied international standards and that its achievements were recognized by pan-national bodies. The U.S. Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.
The Tax Justice Network, which was set up in 2003 and funds itself from grants and donations, has successfully lobbied for greater exchange of information internationally between tax authorities."

More than 54,000 shares worth about $14 million of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF, or SOXX, traded before markets opened in New York -- the most in two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund sank 1.5% at 12:53 p.m. Monday in New York, largely trailing the broader stock market. Trading in the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF, or SMH, also surged.
For the second time in as many years, Apple had to temper its sales outlook because of unexpected shifts in China, the country that’s served as the engine of its growth and success. First, there was a trade war with the U.S. and now there are concerns over a novel coronavirus that resulted in some manufacturing delays and retail-store closings in the Asian nation. While analysts argue that the impact from the outbreak would be temporary for both the tech giant and its suppliers, for now, the worries are sinking the industry’s shares.
Tech More Volatile Than Broader Market Amid Apple Warning: Chart
“In the near term, it’s going to be a volatile sector,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “If those factories are offline too long, you’re going to see some of these companies come out and cut revenue and earnings for the year. And the initial shock of that news coming out will cause a pretty big pullback in semiconductors.”
That’s the latest sign that the coronavirus could have a larger impact on economic growth than first anticipated. The virus is the third-biggest tail risk after the U.S. presidential election and a bursting of the bond “bubble,” according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s fund-manager survey conducted this month. The poll released Tuesday showed global growth expectations for the next year has tumbled to a net 18% from 36% in January, driven by a drop in sentiment toward Chinese output.
“That’s an area that could be ripe for investors to be nosing around at,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer for UBS Global Wealth Management. “The market is taking it out on some of the semiconductor stocks, partly because they are cyclical stocks and global growth matters a lot to cyclical stocks.”

Investing.com – Wall Street fell Tuesday on fresh worries about the impact of the Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak on global growth after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) warned that the virus would stall iPhone demand and production in China.
The S&P 500 fell 0.48%, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.20% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.72%.
Apple said it will miss its fiscal second-quarter revenue guidance range of $63 billion to $67 billion, sending its shares more than 2% lower.
Some on Wall Street, however, maintained their optimism on Apple amid expectations the impact on revenue will likely be temporary.
""We assume that, as with every other company operating in China, the situation on the ground continues to evolve for Apple. We are reducing our forecasts for both the March and June quarters, but we see this as a temporary issue for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"" Goldman Sachs said in a note
Still, revenue warning raised fears about the performance of the tech giant's supply chain disruptions, with chipmakers in particular coming under pressure.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) fell more than 1%, keeping the broader tech sector in the red.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, led the decline in Wall Street, paced by a fall in oil prices amid lingering fears about the virus' impact on Chinese oil demand.
Beyond virus jitters, the final wave of earnings also garnered investor attention.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) climbed nearly 1% after shrugging off weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results, which it blamed on softer-than-expected performance over the holidays.
  Advance Auto Parts   (NYSE:AAP) reported earnings that topped consensus estimates, sending its share about 7% higher.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) resumed its run higher, rising about 6%, after analysts on Wall Street raised their price targets on the electric automaker.
Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to $500 from $360 (and to $1,200 for its bull case) and Bernstein upped its price target to $730 from $325.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Vodafone  (L:VOD) and  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT) have offered to give rivals access to some of their infrastructure for up to nine years to allay EU antitrust concerns over plans to merge their tower units, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The companies announced a plan last July to create Italy's largest mobile towers group through the transfer of Vodafone's Italian mobile masts to INWIT (MI:INWT), TIM's 60%-owned subsidiary. 
Once the 10 billion euro ($10.8 billion) merger is completed, TIM and Vodafone would each have a 37.5% stake and equal governance rights in the enlarged INWIT. 
The deal includes a network sharing agreement and a partnership to roll out 5G infrastructure jointly across Italy.
For the telecoms industry, combining towers or sharing networks to reduce debt and share costs are seen as alternatives to counter EU antitrust regulators' tough line on mergers that reduce the number of players in a market.
Under Vodafone and TIM's proposal, INWIT would make available around 630 sites each year in towns with more than 35,000 people, allowing rivals to provide current and future mobile and fixed telephony services, said the internal EU paper.
The number of sites available will gradually decrease to just below 400 per year during the fifth year of the companies' proposal, which would be valid for eight years.
The number of sites freed up for rivals over the eight-year period totals 4,000. 
TIM and Telecom Italia both declined to comment.
The companies submitted their offer on Friday. The EU competition enforcer extended on Monday its deadline for a decision on the deal to March 6 from Feb. 21.

The Commission will now seek feedback from the companies' rivals and from consumers before deciding whether to accept the offer, demand further measures or open a full-scale investigation.

COVENTRY, England (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak hits firms across countries and industries. 
Britain's biggest carmaker, which operates three car factories in its home market making nearly 400,000 vehicles a year, joined major global companies such as Apple (O:AAPL) in warning of the impact of the virus on supply chains.
 Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) said last week it had temporarily halted output at its Serbian plant, the first such suspension by an automaker in Europe in response to the health crisis. 
Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world and Hubei province - the center of the virus outbreak - is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.
""We are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have ... parts missing,"" Chief Executive Ralf Speth told reporters at the official opening of the National Automotive Innovation Center in Coventry, central England. 
""We have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK,"" he said.
Production at the firm's Chinese factory would recommence on Feb. 24 and was ""safe for the very first week"", he added. 
The new coronavirus has killed some 1,900 people in China and infected around 72,000, confining millions to their homes, disrupting businesses and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break. 
Speth said sales in China, the world's biggest auto market, had been hit. That comes after JLR had seen a recovery in sales there, helping it to return to profitability in recent quarters. 
""That's completely stopped. It's zero,"" he said. ""You don't know whether the economy will catch up or whether this kind of loss is just a loss."" 
The boss of Tata Motors (NS:TAMO), JLR's parent company, speaking at the same event, said its Indian suppliers did not have sufficient visibility regarding parts from China.

""We are safe for the month of February and for a good part of March,"" said Guenter Butschek. ""Are we fully covered at this point of time for the full month of March? Unfortunately... not.""

Investing.com - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was climbing again Tuesday after   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) predicted a 50% jump in shares in its most optimistic scenario, while Bernstein bumped up its projection of where the stock is headed.
Shares of the electric automaker rose 6.4%.
While  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is still skeptical about Tesla in its base case (considered the default view comparable with other Wall Street banks), in its bullish case it sees shares running up to $1,200 per share.
“Our new bull case reflects 4 million units of auto volume by 2030 with a 12% operating margin,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jones said in a note. “This compares with our base case forecast of 2.2 million units and a 10% OP margin by 2030.”
In its base case, Morgan maintained its underweight rating, with shares falling to $500 per share, citing unfavorable risk/reward, although that’s up from its previous base target of $360.
Also today, Bernstein raised its price target on the stock to $730 from $325, keeping its market preform rating, calling it the “ultimate possibility stock”.
Analysts Toni Sacconaghi wrote that even if Tesla’s market share drops by 50%, its compound annual growth rate can still be 15% for 20 years.
“We are skeptical that upside possibilities are likely to be expunged any time soon -- suggesting no imminent negative catalysts for the stock,” Sacconaghi said."
1572,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 09:56AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Lower as Apple Warns of Virus Hit,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell at the opening on Tuesday, as a warning from Apple and disappointing figures from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) validated fears that stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves in pricing in a quick end to the Covid-19 outbreak.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 2.7% after the iPhone maker warned of a two-fold hit to revenue, first from a drop in retail sales in China and secondly due to production constraints in its supply chain. It wasn’t able to give any clearer update on the expected impact of the virus, but warned it would not reach the $63 billion lower end of its guidance range.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock, by contrast, recovered from early losses to be up 0.5% after missing expectations for fourth-quarter sales. While its guidance for 30% online sales growth also represented a slowdown from last year’s 37%, markets took the view that the possible leakage of business to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) isn’t as bad as it might be.
By 9:55 AM ET (1455 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 113 points or 0.4% at 29,303. The S&P 500 index was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%.
Sentiment was supported somewhat by the release of the Empire State Manufacturing index, which rose by more than expected to its highest level since May last year.
Among the biggest gainers was Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, which rose 12.6% to a new record high of $32.20. It’s now tripled since its IPO last year, and has doubled since the middle of January, when fears about the Covid-19 outbreak began to weigh on the broader market.
The company hasn’t released any financials in that time, suggesting that the rally is in large part stoked by speculative interest looking for a growth story to rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was up another 7.0%, approaching the peak of last week’s spike, helped by a Reuters report that it is in talks with China’s CATL to use cobalt-free batteries in the cars made at its new factory in Shanghai.
Theoretically, taking cobalt out of the value chain could cut production costs. However, Reuters also cited a source as saying it has no plans to abandon the use of its current nickel-cobalt-aluminum battery technology.
Elsewhere, Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) stock rose 7.6% and Legg Mason stock rose 23.6% after the two companies agreed to combine in a deal that values the latter at around $4.5 billion. 
Oil and gas stocks again came under pressure after U.S. crude futures snapped their winning streak, losing 0.9% to $51.83 a barrel amidst lingering concerns about the travel restrictions still in force in China, and Russia’s refusal – so far – to sign up to deeper production cuts along with OPEC.
Gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,595.65 an ounce while the dollar rose ever higher after the euro zone ducked a challenge to coordinate fiscal stimulus for its struggling economy. The dollar index briefly touched its highest in 33 months before retracing to 99.198, still a gain of 0.2% on the day."

SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Wall Street approaches the 20th anniversary of the piercing of the dot-com bubble, today's decade-old rally led by a few small players shows some similarities that cautious investors are keeping an eye on.
March 11, 2000 marked the beginning of a crash of overly-inflated stocks that would last over two years, lead to the failure of investor favorites including Worldcom and Pets.com and take over 13 years for Wall Street to recover from. 
Nasdaq's journey back to highs - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HkmAPV
That bust ended a 1,000% decade-long Nasdaq (IXIC) rally that had been fueled by low interest rates and a rush to invest in the emerging World Wide Web, often at any cost.
Tracking the Nasdaq's ""horsemen"" - https://tmsnrt.rs/38f2RNs
Now, after hitting a record high on Feb. 13, the Nasdaq has reached over 9,700 points, almost double its high point in 2000 and about eight times the level of its trough in 2002.
Among the so-called ""Four Horsemen"" of tech stocks that fueled much of the 1990s tech rally, only Microsoft's (O:MSFT) stock price has recovered from the dot-com bust. Intel (O:INTC) and Cisco Systems (O:CSCO) remain below their 2000 highs, while Dell, the fourth member, has since been taken private and then relisted on the stock market.
The 1990s' remaining horsemen - https://tmsnrt.rs/2USpp2A
Microsoft is dueling with Apple (O:AAPL) for the title of Wall Street's most valuable publicly listed company, with its stock quadrupling since CEO Satya Nadella took over as chief in 2014 and refocused the maker of Windows on cloud computing, a technology central to the current rally in Silicon Valley stocks. 
With a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion, Microsoft is now trading at over 30 times expected earnings, its highest valuation since 2002, but still less than half of the highest PE it reached during the dot-com era.
Intel and Cisco, no longer among Wall Street's most-favored tech stocks after investors refocused on software, are trading at PEs in line with recent years.
Apple, Amazon (O:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB) have seen their PEs climb recently, but still within ranges seen in recent years as they drove much of the S&P 500's rally.
S&P 500 and tech PEs since dot.com era - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SLGJDL
But across the stock market, earnings multiples are testing levels that followed soon after the dot-com bubble exploded. The S&P 500's forward PE recently hit 18.8, its highest since 2002. At 22.5, the S&P 500 tech index's PE is at its highest since 2004, but still nowhere near its peak PE of 48 in 2000.
With Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and other technology companies fueling much of Wall Street's rally since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, some investors worry the market has become vulnerable to any downturn among those companies. 
Shares of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook alone make up about 18% of the benchmark S&P 500.
""While the levels of valuation are not as extreme, the conclusion is somewhat the same from the market standpoint. If for whatever reason these names falter, it's going to be very hard for certainly the Nasdaq, which is even more heavily weighted, but even the broader market, the S&P ... to perform well,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina.
Tech market share of the stock market - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UQvb4V
At the height of the dot-com era, technology stocks accounted for over 35% of the S&P 500's value. Today, the tech sector accounts for about 25% of S&P 500 market capitalization, according to Refinitiv Datastream. But combining the tech sector with the communications sector, which includes Internet-related companies like Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix (O:NFLX), the group accounts for 35% of the S&P 500. 
The spate of unprofitable companies seeking to go public in recent years had struck some investors as similar to the dot-com boom. But WeWork's spectacular failure to pull off a multibillion-dollar IPO last year was seen as a positive sign for those concerned about an overly ebullient market and investors' willingness to buy shares of companies with no clear path to profitability.
More recent worries have been sparked by massive -- and to some investors, confusing -- gains for Tesla (O:TSLA). The electric vehicle maker's stock price has soared 90% in 2020 alone.
“Watching Tesla this last week felt a lot like the bubble,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 09:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive: JPMorgan shakes up investment bank in leadership makeover - sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (N:JPM) is reshuffling senior management at the top of its investment bank, naming two new global co-heads and shifting some of its most senior dealmakers into new jobs focused purely on bringing in business, two sources told Reuters.
The Wall Street bank has named Viswas Raghavan and James Casey to jointly run its global investment banking unit, one source said.
The appointments are part of a sweeping reshuffle in which some senior executives will take on ""rainmaker"" roles.
Global M&A co-heads Hernan Cristerna and Chris Ventresca are among those who will drop management responsibilities and instead join a new executive committee of 18 global chairs, the two sources said, focused on winning business from clients.
To fill their shoes the bank is promoting eight bankers to manage specific regions and products, the first source said.
These include Dorothee Blessing and Conor Hillery who will become co-heads of investment banking in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Fernando Rivas who is taking the helm of the same unit in North America.
Raghavan and Casey - currently chief executive officer and head of banking for EMEA and global head of debt capital markets respectively - will both report into JPMorgan's global banking head Carlos Hernandez who is in turn taking on a new role as executive chairman of global investment banking, one source said.
This source said Raghavan would keep his EMEA chief executive job, reporting to the bank's co-president Daniel Pinto in this capacity.
JPMorgan's leadership makeover highlights the pressures big investment banks are under to retain senior staff in the face of increasing competition from rival boutiques which can attract seasoned bankers with more entrepreneurial roles.
Wall Street firms face a tricky balancing act to keep their long-serving top managers happy while providing promotion opportunities for the next generation of leaders.
""This is the bulge-bracket response to the boutiques' threat,"" the second source said.
""It is a good way to motivate senior bankers who tend to move to boutiques when they feel there is nothing more to achieve in their current roles,"" he said.
In investment banking, titles such as managing director or senior vice chairman are the ultimate status symbols, a sign that someone has made it.
But with many bankers reaching the ""managing director"" grade in their early thirties, banks are looking for new ways to motivate them and reward their loyalty.
ELITE CLUB
Hernandez, who is driving the changes, wants the bank's global chairman network to focus solely on client relationships and also to mentor a new breed of dealmakers, the two sources said.
""This is not a trophy title,"" the first source said. ""People will need to bring in real business.""
Current wealth management executive chair Andy Cohen is set to be part of the new global chairmen group while continuing in his previous role.
Three women have made it to the same executive committee, namely global head of equity capital markets Liz Myers and global chairs Isabelle Sellier and Jennifer Nason whose focus has so far been on financial services and TMT respectively, the source said.
The group will also include healthcare rainmaker Steven Frank and several existing vice chairs such as London-based Harry Hampson and New York-based Ben Berinstein, the source said.
Under the new structure, Anu Aiyengar and Dirk Albersmeier will take over from Cristerna and Ventresca as global co-heads of M&A, the source said.
Power sharing will also apply to equity capital markets with Achintya Mangla and Mike Millman becoming global co-heads of ECM while Kevin Foley will run global debt capital markets (DCM) alone, the source said.
Asia Pacific will not be impacted by the changes with Filippo Gori continuing as head of banking for the region and similarly Martin Marron will stay in charge of investment banking in Latin America and Canada.
All the regional and product heads – who will report into Raghavan and Casey – will need to ensure JPMorgan maintains its 2019 ranking, based on Refinitiv data, as the top global investment bank by fees, having earned $6.5 billion in fees, or 6.5% of the overall global fee pool ahead of Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
They will pair up with some of the newly-appointed global chairmen to foster team-work and a more cooperative culture.

""This is far from being a retirement plan for anyone,"" said one of the sources. ""The ultimate goal is to breed the next generation of star bankers.""

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 09:23AM ET</span>",Walmart sees slower online sales growth after tepid holiday quarter,"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) expects online sales growth to slow this year after posting lower-than-expected holiday quarter results, revealing the pressure traditional retailers are facing to keep pace with consumers who are increasingly shopping online.
 Target  Corp (N:TGT), Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) and Macy's Inc (N:M) also posted disappointing holiday sales in 2019, while Amazon.com (O:AMZN) logged record sales for the period.
Heavy investments to spruce up stores, enhance websites, improve delivery options and promote deals underscore the battle retailers are up against as they try to keep shoppers from going to Amazon.
""Walmart's results show it's a food fight out there, with Amazon re-accelerating holiday sales growth,"" Evercore analyst Greg Melich said on Tuesday.
Walmart said it expects online sales to grow about 30% in fiscal 2021, down from last year's growth of 37%. For the holiday quarter, the company reported a 35% increase in online sales - the slowest in nearly two years.
Sales at Walmart's U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.9%, excluding fuel, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, well below analysts' average estimate of 2.35%. Results were hit by a shorter holiday season and lower demand for apparel, toys and electronics.
""There were few weeks before Christmas where general merchandise sales and few categories in the stores were softer than anticipated and it was pretty much limited to apparel, toys, media and gaming,"" Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters.
""There were some things in apparel, which we could have done differently in hindsight. We were a little more seasonal there than we should have been,"" he added.
The company forecast full-year profit to be between $5 and $5.15 per share, below expectations of $5.22, while it expects U.S. comparable sales to grow at least 2.5% largely above expectations.
But the forecast excludes any potential financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak in China, Walmart said. However, it expected some impact in the current quarter from the epidemic.
""While expectations came down into the print, we believe the overall fourth-quarter miss and profit forecast are likely to
keep the stock in check in the near term as investors figure out if something has changed with the consumer and with Walmart,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers said.
Shares of the company rose about 1% in early trade.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.38 per share, but missed the average estimate of $1.43.
Total revenue rose 2.1% to $141.67 billion, missing the estimate of $142.49 billion."

1579,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 09:01AM ET</span>",Spain Plans New Tax on Jumbo Tech Companies Despite U.S. Warning,"(Bloomberg) -- Spain will introduce a digital services tax at the end of the year that would hit the revenue of companies such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google in a move likely to draw the ire of the U.S. administration.
The levy, which could raise as much as 850 million euros ($919 million) a year, won’t be implemented until December to allow the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to make a final push to reach an agreement on a separate, global tech tax.
Countries including France and the U.K. have moved forward with their own versions of the digital tax, concerned current laws don’t properly account for a worldwide, data-driven economy. The European Union has also said it would consider a bloc-wide tax in the absence of a global solution. American officials have threatened to impose tariffs on any country that institutes a levy on tech revenue.
The U.S. initially threatened tariffs as high as 100% on $2.4 billion of French goods in response to the tax, before Paris said it would delay collecting the revenue until December.
U.S. Rebuke
French and Spanish officials both say a digital tax levied by multiple countries would be more effective than piecemeal policies, and Spain’s support may inject additional momentum into the OECD efforts.
Those talks are trying to address frustration among voters around the world about what’s seen as large-scale tax avoidance. Corporations are often domiciled in other countries -- including low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland or Bermuda, and shift money seamlessly across borders to minimize their obligations. Companies that sell online can easily avoid paying taxes in countries where they nevertheless make significant sales.
Facebook’s Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the Munich Security Conference that he would support OECD efforts to find a global compromise on a digital tax.
Spain’s new tax will apply to companies with at least 750 million euros in global revenue and digital sales of at least 3 million euros in Spain.
The Spanish government, led by Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, also approved a tax on financial operations on Tuesday. Lawmakers in Madrid are expected to approve both measures in the coming months."

A deterioration in the outlook for China saw bets for world economic expansion fall for the first time since October, in BofA’s poll conducted Feb. 6 through Feb. 13. A net 18% of respondents forecast stronger growth over the next 12 months versus 36% in January’s survey, according to a note.
Newsflow on the virus outbreak has whipsawed markets since the start of 2020, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s sales warning the latest sign that corporate and economic damage may be greater than expected. Still, risk assets have fared well in February and global stocks last week hit a new record high, boosted by mostly positive earnings reports and a dearth of alternatives to equities.
While the latest BofA survey showed investor sentiment less optimistic than in January, strategists led by Michael Hartnett said they stay “irrationally bullish.”

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 08:31AM ET</span>",Breen to return as DuPont CEO,"(Reuters) - DuPont (N:DD) has brought back management veteran Edward Breen as its chief executive officer, in a move that the industrial materials maker is hoping will help lift sluggish sales since its split from DowDuPont Inc.
Breen, who is currently the chairman of DuPont, will replace Marc Doyle, the company said on Tuesday.
The board concluded now is the right time to restore Breen to the chief executive role to draw more directly on his substantial operating experience, DuPont's lead independent director Alexander Cutler said in a statement.
DuPont last month reported fourth-quarter profit below estimates as it struggled with subdued demand in the electronics and automotive sectors, largely due to the U.S.-China trade war.
""While we made some progress in 2019, we did not meet our own expectations and we now need to move aggressively to secure our foundation for growth,"" Breen said in a statement.
Breen recently orchestrated the divestiture of DuPont's $26 billion nutrition unit in a merger with International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (N:IFF), less than a year after spearheading the breakup of DowDuPont into three companies.
DuPont also named Lori Koch as chief financial officer, replacing Jeanmarie Desmond, and said it will advance the cost-cutting initiatives announced earlier.
The executive changes are effective immediately and both Doyle and Desmond will leave the company, DuPont said."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Tuesday, as investors return from a holiday to the shock news from tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that it wouldn’t meet its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in China.
At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 0.5% lower, futures for the Nasdaq were down 0.8%, while the Dow Jones futures contract lost 0.6%. U.S. equity markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the world's most valuable technology firm, said earlier Tuesday that it would not meet the revenue guidance, provided in late January, for the second quarter due to work slowdowns and lower demand due to the outbreak of Covid-19 in China. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was expected to be hard hit, given how much of its supply chain and consumer market are in China. But it didn’t update its sales guidance of between $63 and $67 billion, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty that spooked investors.
“As production in China is ramped up more slowly than previously anticipated and the effects on the global tech supply chain become evident, equity investors might have to brace themselves for more negative news,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
In China earlier Tuesday, the death toll from the virus climbed to 1,868, including one of the most senior doctors in the Wuhan region where the virus was first detected , The number of people infected topped 73,000.
Moody’s has downgraded its growth forecast for China in 2020 to 5.2%, from 5.8% previously, due to the outbreak.
Elsewhere, asset manager   Legg Mason   (NYSE:LM) will be in focus after the WSJ reported that Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) is in talks to buy its rival. Legg Mason has a market value of more than $3.5 billion and has assets under management of $800 billion.
In earnings news, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) disappointed with its earnings and revenue numbers for the holiday quarter, and its guidance also came in below expectations. Expectations were low after rival   Target   (NYSE:TGT) disappointed over the same period, but Walmart stock still traded 1% lower premarket.
The economic slate is largely empty Tuesday, with only the Empire State Manufacturing index due at 8:30 AM ET and the NAHB housing market index at 10 AM of note.
Oil markets have sold off again Tuesday as China's extended travel restrictions point to a sustained drop in demand.
AT 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $51.36 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.1% to $56.48.

1585,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>","Intesa Makes Unsolicited Bid for UBI, Shocking Italy Bank Sector","(Bloomberg) --   Intesa Sanpaolo   (MI:ISP) SpA made an unsolicited 4.9 billion-euro ($5.3 billion) bid for smaller rival Unione di Banche Italiane SpA (LON:0LBN), unexpectedly launching one of the biggest European banking deals since the financial crisis.
Under the offer, announced around midnight on Monday, UBI investors will get 17 new shares of Intesa for every 10 UBI shares they hold. That valued UBI at about 4.25 euros a share, Intesa said in a presentation.
Intesa got positive initial feedback from the European Central Bank for the offer before the announcement, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named discussing confidential deliberations.
Intesa Chief Executive Officer Carlo Messina said on a conference call Tuesday that his bank’s offer is in line with ECB expectations on industry consolidation, adding that Intesa has no intention to raise its bid.
Shares in UBI rose as much as 29% and traded at 4.27 euros at 11:15 a.m. in Milan, just above the bid price. Intesa added 1.9% on Tuesday, as most Italian banks jumped on news of the bid. A UBI bond callable in January 2025 also climbed.
The all-share offer, announced late Monday, was made without the knowledge of UBI Banca’s board, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The directors will meet as soon as Tuesday to discuss the bid. A UBI representative declined to comment.
UBI CEO Victor Massiah had just landed in London to discuss his bank’s new strategic plan with investors when he was informed of the bid, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
The CAR Group, an investors pact that owns about 18% of UBI, also wasn’t aware of any planned bid and will need to take time to review it, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Italian banking had looked set for another slow year for deals as executives spoke of the need for consolidation but shied away from taking the plunge. The benefits of increasing scale and gaining synergies were weighed against regulatory hurdles, Italy’s weak economic prospects and execution risks from low share prices to capital concerns.
“The bid is very appealing for both ISP and UBI shareholders, as it would create a massive player in Italy, especially in the north, with very high efficiency levels and competitive product companies,” said Stefano Girola, a portfolio manager at Alicanto Capital SGR in Milan. “I think the announced synergies are just a starting point and more will come.”
The combination creates a European lender with 8.7 billion euros in net interest income and almost 1 trillion euros in total assets. Combined profit amounts to 21.6 billion euros, based on 2019 financial data.
Intesa seems to have prepared the move well in advance; part of the deal involves it selling 400 to 500 branches to BPER Banca that the two banks operate jointly. BPER will call an extraordinary meeting to approve a 1 billion-euro rights issue to fund the transaction. The sale is already fully underwritten by Mediobanca SpA.
Intesa’s move also includes a binding agreement with insurer UnipolSai Assicurazioni, that provides for the disposal of insurance activities. The agreements were made to “pre-emptively address anti-trust issues,” the bank said.
UBI’s existing management “may have significant prospects in the group that will be born from this operation.” Messina said in a statement on Tuesday."

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 05:44AM ET</span>","If Apple is hurting due to the coronavirus, its suppliers and rivals likely are too","By Stephen Nellis and Josh Horwitz
SAN FRANCISCO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) surprise warning that it will likely fall short of this quarter's sales target due to the coronavirus epidemic points to much pain for its chip and other suppliers as well as for rivals who also rely on China to build their products.
Revising guidance set just three weeks ago, the world's most valuable tech company said while many factories that make iPhones have reopened for work, they were ramping up more slowly than anticipated.
The outbreak, which has infected more than 72,000 and prevented many employees from returning to work due to travel and quarantine restrictions, was reverberating throughout the U.S. firm's supply chain, a source familiar with Apple's operations in China said.
""If one component factory stays closed and they're the only supplier, then everyone has to stop and wait. And if there are two suppliers and one is shut down, then we need the other to do more,"" said the source who was not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified.
Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein analyst, said Apple's woes probably also mean fewer chips will be sold throughout the mobile device industry because the overwhelming majority are made in China.
""Maybe this is the wake up call. I would be astonished if Apple is the only one,"" he said. ""Every electronic supply chain runs through China in a big way.""Research firm Canalys estimates both Apple, which outsources much of its manufacturing to Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317), and rival Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] have 99% of their production in China. The world's No. 1 smartphone market is likely see sales halve in the first quarter due to the virus, analysts have said.
Chinese rivals Oppo,  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) and Vivo have 83%, 72%, and 65% of their production in China respectively.
Reuters reported last week that roughly 10% of Foxconn's workers in China have resumed production, while other plants in the country remain largely shuttered. Foxconn denied the reports in a company filing without elaborating.
A SLEW OF SUPPLIERS
Shares of Apple's chip suppliers fell on the news on Tuesday, with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) losing 2.8%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330) down 2.9% and SK Hynix (KS:000660) shedding 2.9%.
Analysts at ANZ noted  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) was vulnerable to disruptions caused by the epidemic as it supplies mobile modem chips to almost all major smartphone makers and generates nearly half of its sales from China.
U.S.-based suppliers that do a lot of business with Apple include Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO),  Qorvo Inc  (O:QRVO) and  Skyworks Solutions Inc  (O:SWKS).
Broadcom makes a range of wireless components for iPhones and said last month it had signed a deal to supply Apple for contracts worth as much as $15 billion. Sales to Apple accounted for 20% of its annual revenue in fiscal 2019.
Qorvo, which sells parts that help phones connect to wireless data networks, generated around one third of its revenue from Apple in fiscal 2019. Skyworks, another wireless component supplier, got more than 10% of its annual revenue from Apple.
Other U.S. suppliers to Apple include Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN). Its battery charging chips have been found in iPhone teardowns, although the company sells across a broad spectrum of the electronics industry.
In Europe, the Netherlands'  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI) supplies Apple with the near-field communications chips used in the iPhone's Apple Pay contactless payments feature, according to TechInsights teardowns and industry analysts.
Chips made by Franco-Italian firm STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) (PA:STM) are used for wireless battery charging and for infrared cameras in iPhones, according to teardowns. Its shares lost 3.5% in morning trade.
Investors in chipmakers have until now have been willing to look past temporary coronavirus disruptions, hoping for a sales recovery in the second half, said Bernstein's Rasgon.
Mike Fawkes, who previously ran supply chain operations for Hewlett-Packard, said even if it wanted to, Apple was unlikely to find alternative production sources soon.
""They're stuck with China for some period of time,"" he said. ""It's very hard when you're managing a big battleship like they are."""
1589,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 05:38AM ET</span>",StockBeat: ThyssenKrupp Takes the Safest Route to Survival,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Germany’s ThyssenKrupp, one of Europe's industrial blue-bloods, is in a race against time to sell its most valuable asset before being swallowed by its debts – and it’s just had to hobble itself in the process.
The group announced on Monday that it would seek to sell its elevators unit to one of two private equity consortia, rather than to Finnish rival Kone Oyj (HE:KNEBV). Kone subsequently withdrew its bid, which was reported to be over 1 billion euro higher than either of its rivals at more than 17 billion euros ($18.4 billion).
As a result, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) shares were down 6.3% by 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT) at a four-month low, underperforming the broader market on a down day for markets spooked by a warning from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) about the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on sales.
The German Dax was down 0.7%, while the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.5% at 430.02.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) has opted for a sale that it knows will get approval from regulators, rather than one that was likely to be bogged down for months by an antitrust investigation. Between them, Thyssenkrupp and Kone have around 30% of the world market for elevators. A combination would have increased concentration in an already concentrated business. Regulators are particularly anxious when a market goes from having four major players to having three, which is what a TK/Kone combination would have done.
It was a close call, though. Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and Kone are the number 3 and 4, respectively, in their field, behind Otis and Schindler. The U.S. has just waved through a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, who have similar positions in the U.S. wireless networks market. However, the more relevant analogy is with the failed Siemens-Alstom rail merger, rejected by the EU Commission because of the near-monopoly it would have created within Europe.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) does not have the luxury of waiting to see which way Commissioner Margarete Vestager's thumb will turn. It has been haemorrhaging cash due to a misjudged expansion in Brazil, chronic margin compression from Chinese steel exports to Europe, a downturn in the auto market and a crushing pension burden (which only gets heavier the longer than the European Central Bank’s interest rates stay below zero).
Even before its announcement on Monday, Moody’s Investor Service had downgraded the company’s long-term credit rating to B1 – “highly speculative” – in the wake of first-quarter earnings that included a horrific 2.5 billion-euro cash outflow before asset disposals.
“The magnitude of the earnings decline and cash drain in Q1 2020 was more severe than anticipated,” Moody’s warned, adding that TK's targets for the fiscal year through September appear “increasingly ambitious.”
TK now has a shortlist of two buyers: a consortium of Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Carlyle (NASDAQ:CG) and Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board; and on the other hand, Advent and Cinven.
“The objective is to reach an agreement quickly on a majority or full sale,” it said in a statement. If it can't strike a deal with either, then it will aim for an IPO of the unit in early summer."
1590,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",European shares slump as Apple warning hammers China-reliant sectors,"By Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - European shares dropped on Tuesday as a revenue warning from Apple Inc (O:AAPL) sent shockwaves through the tech sector, hammering iPhone parts makers and underlining the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global supply chains.
Apple's Frankfurt-listed shares (F:AAPL) dropped nearly 5% after the company said it would miss its March-quarter sales outlook due to the epidemic, which has killed more than 1,800 people and forced businesses to shut operations.
Shares of STMicroelectronics NV (MI:STM) and Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS), which supply components to Apple, fell 2.7% and 5.5%, respectively.
The technology-heavy German stock index (GDAXI) plunged 0.8%, while the European tech index (SX8P) fell 1.4%.
While the European tech index has risen more than 7% this year on hopes of demand recovering on the back of easing global trade tensions, the virus outbreak may reverse those gains given China's large presence in the technology supply chain.
""There are hundreds of other companies who are in this predicament, with manufacturing as well as stores in China,"" said Neil Campling, head of TMT research at wealth manager Mirabaud.
""The main effect of Apple having gone first will be to force others to follow soon or risk being accused of a cover-up.""
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.6% by 0951 GMT, having ended at a record high on Monday after China outlined fresh stimulus measures to mitigate the virus' economic impact.
However, Apple's (O:AAPL) warning, along with news of a slower-than-expected recovery in the firm's Chinese factories, swiftly culled any optimism.
Other China-exposed sectors in Europe, such as automobile (SXAP) and basic resources (SXPP), dropped more than 1% each. The two depend heavily on Chinese demand for their goods, with several car makers also manufacturing parts in the country.
Bucking the trend, Italian stocks (FTMIB) rose on the back of bank shares after  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) made a surprise 4.86 billion euro ($5.26 billion) bid for smaller rival UBI Banca (MI:UBI). UBI surged nearly 22% and was the top gainer on the STOXX 600.
British lender  HSBC Holdings  (L:HSBA) fell 4.7% and was one of the biggest drags on the STOXX 600 after it said it would shed $100 billion in assets and cut 35,000 jobs over three years in a drastic overhaul.

Defensive sectors such as utilities (SX6P) and real estate (SX86P) were among the few gainers.

It will cut $100 billion in assets, slash its investment bank and restructure in the United States and Europe.
Elsewhere in the banking sector, Italy's largest lender   Intesa Sanpaolo   (MI:ISP) announced an unsolicited bid for smaller rival Unione di Banche Italiane SpA (MI:UBI) in an all-stock deal valued at just under 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion). UBI stock rose 24%, while Intesa's rose 1.2%. The deal would help consolidate a fragmented Italian banking sector, and hopes of further mergers lifted other Italian bank stocks such as Banco Bpm SpA (MI:BAMI).
Late Monday, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it doesn’t expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to work slowdowns and lower demand caused by the outbreak of Covid-19 in China. Its shares dropped over 5% in Frankfurt trading.
The iPhone maker was expected to be hard hit, given how much of its supply chain and consumer market are in China, but the warning is a graphic example of the impact on a Wall Street favorite that has been priced for success.

In other earnings news,   Glencore   (LON:GLEN) reported annual results which beat market expectations but the shares still dropped 1%.
Shares in rival miner BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) dropped almost 2% despite increasing its interim dividend after its profit and revenue rose on higher commodity prices and favorable currency movements. It too warned of near-term various uncertainties.
Looking at European economic data, the German ZEW is due at 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), and will be the first post-coronavirus indicator of sentiment in the eurozone’s largest economy. Investing.com has predicted a drop in the key economic sentiment indicator to 21.5 from 26.7.

Glencore took big writedowns on its two key Colombian coal mines, – Prodeco and Cerrejon. The mines predominantly ship to Europe where the coal market has been hit hard by cheap gas prices.
The company lowered the value of its oil business in Chad, which it’s looking to exit, and a copper business in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Glencore’s net debt of $17.6 billion came just above the target range of $10 billion to $16 billion. While the increase is partly due to new accounting standards, investors will have to wait for debt to fall before Glencore commits to new buyback.
Separately, Glencore added new details about its long-term retreat from coal. So-called Scope 3 emissions will fall by 30% in the next 15 years, predominantly as a result of depleting mines in Colombia and South Africa, the company said.
Glencore has faced the brunt of a growing investor concern about climate change. While its biggest rivals are in the process of exiting coal, Glencore has been a staunch defender of the fuel, saying it’s essential to providing affordable and reliable power in developing countries.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 03:07AM ET</span>","HSBC to slash investment bank, 35,000 jobs in strategy overhaul","By Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA) said on Tuesday it would shed $100 billion in assets, shrink its investment bank and revamp its U.S. and European businesses in a drastic overhaul that will mean 35,000 jobs cut over three years.
The bank, which has struggled to keep pace with leaner and more focused rivals, is seeking to become more competitive as it grapples with slowing growth in its major markets, the coronavirus epidemic, Britain's European Union exit and lower central bank interest rates.
In the latest in a series of overhauls since the 2008 financial crisis, HSBC said it would merge its private banking and wealth businesses, axe European stock trading and cut U.S. retail branches as it seeks to remove $4.5 billion in costs.
""The totality of this program is that our headcount is likely to go from 235,000 to closer to 200,000 over the next three years,"" Noel Quinn, interim chief executive, told Reuters.
The restructuring, one of the largest undertaken by a blue chip lender for more than a decade, will be partly managed through natural attrition as people leave the bank, he said.
The UK-based bank, whose huge Asian operations are headquartered in Hong Kong, said the coronavirus epidemic had significantly impacted staff and customers. In the long run it could reduce revenue and cause bad loans to rise as supply chains are disrupted, Quinn said.
The virus has killed almost 1,900 people, overwhelmingly in mainland China, and infected more than 70,000, while its economic impact is spreading across the globe.
HSBC veteran Quinn is auditioning for the permanent role of CEO, which the bank said in August would be announced within six to 12 months.
""In one sense, they are doing the things that were obvious and had been called out by many, so it's good,"" Hugh Young, managing director at Aberdeen Asset Managemement Asia, one of HSBC's 20 largest investors said.
""Getting this done will require a fair amount of work, then we need to see how it settles down. Noel is doing a good job in very difficult circumstances,"" he added.
Europe's biggest bank by assets, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, said profit before tax tumbled by a third to $13.35 billion in 2019, far below the average estimate of $20.03 billion from brokerages compiled by the bank.
That was due to $7.3 billion in write-offs linked to its global banking and markets and commercial banking business units in Europe.
In the United States, where the bank has underperformed for years, HSBC said it would close around a third of its 224 branches and target only international and wealthier clients.
The lender's shares were down 3.7 percent at 568 pence at the London market open.
NO BUYBACKS FOR 2 YEARS
HSBC, which has bought back some $6 billion of its own shares since 2016, said it would suspend buybacks for two years in order to pay for the restructuring but would maintain its dividend.
The bank's return on tangible equity (RoTE), a key profitability measure, is expected to be in the range of 10% to 12% in 2022. HSBC reported a RoTE of 8.4% for last year, down from 8.6% in 2018.
HSBC said it planned to invest more than $100 billion in ""higher returning areas"", resulting in broadly flat assets in value terms over the three years. It also expects to incur restructuring costs of about $6 billion, the bulk of it in this year and the next.
While strengthening its investment banking capabilities in Asia and the Middle East, the bank will maintain a global investment banking hub in London, reducing its European footprint for the business.
The bank will also reduce its sales and research coverage in European cash equities with a focus on supporting equity capital market transactions, it said, confirming a Reuters report last month regarding pullback from the trading business.
Commenting on the impact of the coronavirus, Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters the bank expected additional loan loss provisions in the first quarter."

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>",SoftBank spends $2.5 billion to get second Vision Fund off the ground: sources,"By Saeed Azhar, Anirban Sen and Davide Barbuscia
(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) has pumped $2.5 billion of its own cash into new investments since October, people familiar with the matter said, hoping to restore its money-making credentials as it courts investors for a successor to its Vision Fund.
The Japanese technology conglomerate is also considering investing another $2.5 billion of its own money, one of the people said.
SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said last week the company may spend up to two years investing its own money in a bridge fund, to build a portfolio that will give investors enough confidence to participate in a second Vision Fund. To that end, he said SoftBank has already invested ""billions"" of U.S. dollars, but he did not provide an exact figure.
SoftBank was targeting a $108 billion fundraise for the second Vision Fund, and had committed $38 billion of its own money toward that goal. However, Son said last week its launch had been delayed due to investor ""concerns"" about the performance of the first $100 billion Vision Fund.
The pace of SoftBank's latest investments contrasts markedly with that of the first Vision Fund, which spent over $80 billion after its first major fundraising close in May 2017.
The fund's investment spree drove a rally in the valuations of a number of technology start-ups, such as office space-sharing company WeWork and ride-hailing firm  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER). This rally fizzled out once these companies' losses mounted along with their breakneck growth.
SoftBank was forced to save WeWork from bankruptcy last year in a roughly $10 billion financing deal, while Uber's shares are trading more than 10% below the price of their initial public offering in March 2019, even after a recent rally.
Last week, SoftBank said the first Vision Fund had realized $9.5 billion in cash and mark-to-market gains as of December-end. That represents a 9.5% gain since its first major fundraising close, versus 25% in the S&P 500 Index over the same period.
BRIDGE FUND
SoftBank has made seven investments since October - including U.S. drug retailer Alto Pharmacy and Indian eyewear retailer Lenskart - and has half a dozen more in the pipeline, Rajeev Misra, a SoftBank executive who also runs the Vision Fund, said at an investment conference in Abu Dhabi last week.
Abu Dhabi's Mubadala and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) account for the bulk of the first Vision Fund at $60 billion. They have yet to commit to the second fund.
Son spoke to Mubadala executives last week to convince them that the turnaround the Vision Fund was implementing in its investment portfolio was working, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the information was not public.
SoftBank and PIF declined to comment. A Mubadala spokesman said his company was a long-term partner of SoftBank, with which it was in regular discussion.
Bridge funds are commonly deployed by private equity and venture capital fund managers struggling with their investment track record, in order to attract investors reluctant to commit to blind pools of capital.
In 2014, loyal investors helped TPG Capital Management LP raise a $2 billion bridge fund after the buyout firm's previous $19 billion fund suffered losses in key investments. TPG rolled that bridge fund into a new $10.5 billion fund in 2016 after securing enough investor support.
In SoftBank's case, the bridge capital has come exclusively from the company itself. SoftBank has 3.8 trillion yen ($34.65 billion) in cash on hand but is currently being pressured by Elliott Management Corp to buy back shares, to boost the value of what the hedge fund considers underperforming stock.
SoftBank also has developed a hedge fund overseen by Misra, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.
In July, SoftBank said investors including  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ,  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (TW:2317) and Japanese banks were willing to commit $108 billion to the second Vision Fund.
Seven months later, the fund has not received any money from outside investors.

Meanwhile, the first Vision Fund has invested $80.5 billion in 88 companies, SoftBank disclosed last week. While it raised over $100 billion, the fund needs to retain the remainder for potential re-investment in portfolio companies, as well as for coupon payments on outstanding debt, Son said.

1597,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Seen Lower; Apple and HSBC Weigh Heavily,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Tuesday, as a revenue warning from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and weak earnings from HSBC laid bare the extent of the damage caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus in China.
At 02:00 ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 86 points, or 0.6% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 33 points, or 0.5%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 43 points, or 0.6%. Futures on the pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, dropped 22 points, or 0.6%. 
Late Monday, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it doesn’t expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to work slowdowns and lower demand due to the outbreak of Covid-19 in China.
The tech giant was expected to be hard hit given how much of its supply chain and consumer market are in China, but the sales warning is a graphic example of the impact on one of Wall Street’s favourite stocks which has been priced for success.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up over 10% already this year, having climbed over 80% last year, and now make up around 12% of the Nasdaq 100 index.
Adding to Tuesday’s woes was a disappointing earnings report from HSBC (LON:HSBA), which announced a drop of 33% to its profit before tax for 2019, hit by one-time write-offs linked to its investment banking and commercial banking businesses in Europe.
HSBC, which makes most of its money in Asia, also warned that the ongoing coronavirus epidemic could in the long run reduce its revenue and cause bad loans to rise as supply chains are disrupted.
Europe’s largest bank by assets also unveiled plans to cut $100 billion in assets, slash its investment bank and restructure in the United States and Europe, as part of an overhaul in a bid to improve returns.
Capital Economics said in a report that it is now all but certain that China's economy will contract in quarter-on-quarter terms in the first quarter. ""We have penciled in a fall in output of 2.5%,"" wrote group chief economist Neil Shearing.
Elsewhere,   Accor   (PA:ACCP), Europe's largest hotel group, could be in focus after it said it was joining forces with American card giant Visa (NYSE:V) to offer a payment card to members of its lifestyle loyalty program 
Looking at European economic data, the German ZEW is due at 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), and will be the first post-coronavirus indicator of sentiment in the eurozone’s largest economy. Investing.com has predicted a drop in the key economic sentiment indicator to 21.5 from 26.7. 
Also due Tuesday, at 04:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), will be the latest unemployment data from the U.K., which will be of interest as a pointer to the thinking in the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee ahead of its next rate-setting meeting. 
Oil markets have sold off Tuesday, after a partial recovery last week, amid lingering demand concerns due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Eyes remain firmly fixed on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, and whether they will approve a proposal to deepen production cuts to tighten global supplies.
The group, also known as OPEC+, has an agreement to cut oil output by 1.7 million bpd until the end of March.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares fell and Wall Street was poised to retreat from record highs on Tuesday after Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said it would miss its March quarter revenue guidance as the coronavirus slowed production and weakened demand in China.
The warning from the most valuable U.S. company sobered investor optimism that stimulus from China and other countries would protect the global economy from the effects of the epidemic.
S&P500 e-mini futures (ESc1) slipped as much as 0.4% in Asian trade while Nasdaq futures fell 0.6%.
European stocks were expected to follow suit, with major European stock futures (STXEc1) (FDXc1) (FFIc1) trading 0.5-0.6% lower.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 1.0%, while Tokyo's Nikkei (N225) slid 1.4%, dragged down by tech stocks.
China's CSI300 (CSI300) blue chip shares gave up 0.5%, following a strong rally that was fueled by hopes Beijing would introduce more policy stimulus.
China's central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending on Monday, paving the way for a likely reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday.
However, sentiment took a subsequent knock as Apple said factories in China were re-opening but ramping up more slowly than expected, reinforcing signs of a broader hit to businesses from the epidemic.
""Apple is saying its recovery could be delayed, which could mean the impact of the virus may go beyond the current quarter,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""If Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell.""
Asian tech shares were also hit. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) dropped 2.9%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330) lost 2.9% and Sony Corp (T:6758) shed 2.5%.
In China, the number of new Covid-19 cases fell to 1,886 on Monday from 2,048 the day before. The World Health Organization cautioned, however, that ""every scenario is still on the table"" in terms of the epidemic's evolution.
As China's authorities try to prevent the spread of the disease, the economy is paying a heavy price. Some cities remained in lockdown, streets are deserted, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country, preventing migrant workers from getting back to their jobs.
Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond, as highlighted by Apple.
""Lifting travel restrictions is taking longer than expected. Initially we thought lockdowns would end in February and factory output would normalize in March. But that is looking increasingly difficult,"" said Ei Kaku, currency strategist at Nomura Securities.
Nomura downgraded its China first-quarter economic growth forecast to 3% from a year earlier, half the pace of the fourth quarter, from its previous forecast of 3.8%.
Nomura says there was a risk it could be even weaker.
Also hurting market sentiment was news that the Trump administration is considering changing U.S. regulations to allow it to block shipments of chips to Huawei Technologies from companies such as Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.
Bonds were in demand, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield falling 4.2 basis point to 1.546% (US10YT=RR) after a U.S. public holiday on Monday.
Safe-haven gold also rose 0.3% to its two-week high of $1,587.00 per ounce.
In the currency market, the yen ticked up 0.15% to 109.69 yen per dollar while the risk-sensitive Australian dollar lost 0.4% to $0.6686 . The yuan was steadier for now, trading at 6.9950 yuan per dollar .
The euro, grappling with worries about sluggish growth in the euro zone, edged down 0.1% to $1.0833 (EUR=), near its 33-month low of $1.0817 touched on Monday.
Oil prices slipped on fresh concerns over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
Brent crude (LCOc1) fell 0.6% to $57.30 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) slipped 0.3% to $51.90 a barrel.
London copper prices also retreated 0.3% to $5,797 a tonne, slipping from Monday's three-week high."

YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan's (T:7201) new chief executive said on Tuesday he would accept being fired if he fails to turn around Japan's second biggest automaker which is grappling with plunging sales in the aftermath of the scandal surrounding ex-chairman Carlos Ghosn. 
Makoto Uchida, who took over the top job in December, put his job on the line at a raucous shareholders' meeting, where he faced demands ranging from cutting executive pay to offering a bounty to bring Ghosn back to Japan after he fled to Lebanon.
Nissan's worsening performance has heaped pressure on the 53-year-old Uchida, formerly Nissan's China chief who became its third CEO since September, to come up with aggressive steps to revive the company.
On Tuesday, Uchida, who faced repeated heckling by shareholders, said he was ready to face dismissal if he failed to improve profitability at the company, which is on course to post its worst annual operating profit in 11 years.
""We will make sure that we steer the company in an effective way so that it is visible in the eyes of viewers. I will commit to this: if the circumstances remain uncertain you can fire me immediately,"" he said.
Uchida did not give a timeframe for improving Nissan's performance. 
The new boss must prove to the board he can accelerate cost-cutting and rebuild profits at the 86-year-old Japanese giant, and that he has the right strategy to repair its partnership with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), sources have told Reuters.
Uchida pleaded for patience while he compiles a plan by May to recover from crumbling profits and a corporate shake-up following Ghosn's arrest in Japan in late 2018 over financial misconduct charges. 
""If you can be patient a little bit longer, on a day-to-day basis you will be able to sense we are changing,"" he said.
SHAREHOLDERS' PAIN
Angry shareholders questioned the ability of Uchida and other executives to lead Nissan's recovery, and aired misgivings about issues including ex-CEO Hiroto Saikawa's resignation, transparency into the company's probe into Ghosn and the use of Toyota vehicles to transport board members.
Attendance at the meeting to vote in new directors, including Uchida and Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta, stood at 666 and was the lowest on records dating back to 2005.
Before it began, some shareholders demanded more clarity about Uchida's plan.
""I just want to know what the plan for recovery is. At the moment, the share price has dropped again, and the value of the company has plummeted,"" said a 70-year-old former employee who owns shares in the company. 
""If this is the situation, part of me thinks that we would be better off with Ghosn ... If we don't get a clearer vision of the path the company is taking, it will be a worry.""
Nissan's shares are trading around their lowest level in more than a decade following its latest earnings. 

Last week, it cut its dividend outlook to its lowest since the 2011 financial year, after dwindling car sales drove the company to post its first quarterly net loss in nearly a decade.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 12:51AM ET</span>","Samsung poised to benefit from China virus woes afflicting Apple, other rivals","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) stands to be a major beneficiary of the China production problems announced by rival Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Monday, reaping the rewards of a decade-long bet on low-cost smartphone manufacturing in Vietnam.
Half of Samsung's smartphones are now made in Vietnam, where the coronavirus that has crippled the China operations of Apple and many other firms has so far had only a limited impact on its production.
Apple said on Monday it would not meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter due to the coronavirus impact on both production and sales in China, where most iPhones are made. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp last week also flagged a hit to its March quarter sales.
Huawei, another major Samsung rival, has not announced any production problems, but Samsung insiders, analysts and suppliers expect it will also be hit hard due to its heavy reliance on Chinese manufacturing and parts. Many Chinese and foreign firms have begun to re-open China factories that were idled for weeks, but shortages of workers and other problems have in many cases kept output to a minimum.
Samsung has also largely ceded the China market to its rivals in recent years, meaning it won't suffer from the store closures and drop in demand that is hitting Apple and others.
""Samsung is better positioned to weather the virus fallout than its formidable rivals such as Huawei and Apple,"" a person with knowledge of Samsung's supply chain told Reuters.
""The virus exposed China risks. We feel fortunate that we were able to escape the risks,"" he said.
Another person familiar with Samsung's thinking told Reuters: ""Samsung does not say it publicly. But it is relieved.""
Still, two sources familiar with Samsung's Vietnam operations cautioned that should the virus outbreak be prolonged, Samsung would feel the impact, as the company sources many components from China.
Problems with cross-border shipments also cropped up in the early phases of the virus outbreak as Vietnam imposed stricter border controls, according to Hong Sun, vice chairman of Korea Chamber of Business in Vietnam. The issues have since been resolved, Sun said, but risks remain if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work.
Samsung also relies on Chinese contract manufacturers for some low-end models.
In a statement to Reuters, the company said: ""We are making our best effort to minimize any impact on our operations.""
TrendForce recently cut its first quarter production forecasts for Huawei by 15% and Apple by 10%. It cut projections for Samsung Electronics by a smaller 3%.
Before the virus, the global smartphone market had been expected to end two consecutive years of falls, driven by smartphones running on faster 5G wireless networks. But the virus outbreak will throw cold water on any rebound, with global shipments likely to record another decline.
Since starting phone production in Vietnam in 2009, Samsung has aggressively boosted output through cheaper labor and generous government incentives. A number of South Korean suppliers followed suit, powering its breakneck growth.
Samsung ended its own smartphone production in China last year as its market share plunged to nearly zero.
Apple makes most of its iPhones in China via Chinese company Foxconn. Manufacturing facilities there that produce Apple's iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said on Monday.
Last week, Samsung unveiled a trio of flagship Galaxy s20 smartphones as well as its new foldable phone. Sources said the virus could delay new product launches by rivals."

Investing.com - HSBC Holdings PLC (HK:0005), Europe’s largest bank, announced on Tuesday that its 2019 pre-tax profit slumped 32.9% to $13.35 billion.
The bank said the profit drop was a result of a one-off goodwill impairment of $7.3 billion, mainly relating to its investment banking and commercial banking businesses in Europe. 
Analysts previously expected the bank’s pre-tax profits in 2019 to largely match the $19.89 billion figure from a year earlier.
HSBC's revenue for the year was $56.1 billion, while earnings per share was $0.30. 
The bank added that it will “continue to monitor the recent coronavirus outbreak, which is causing economic disruption in Hong Kong and mainland China and may impact performance in 2020.”
The bank derived almost half of its revenue and nearly 90% of its profits from Asia in 2018, with much of that coming from Hong Kong.
HSBC’s shares in Hong Kong slumped 2.5% to HK$57.90 by 1:06 AM ET (05:05 GMT).

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 12:16AM ET</span>",Singapore builders seek force majeure advice as coronavirus causes labor crunch,"By Aradhana Aravindan and Jessica Jaganathan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore construction firms are asking for advice about whether they have the option of invoking force majeure clauses in building contracts as the government turns away or quarantines Chinese labor to stop the spread of the coronavirus, lawyers told Reuters.
Singapore has an estimated $20-$24 billion of public and private sector building projects in the works this year - and any large impact on the sector, which is highly dependent on foreign labor, could help push the economy into recession.
Derek Loh, a partner at Singapore-based TSMP Law Corporation, said five clients involved in public sector construction projects have approached him in recent weeks for advice on force majeure - which refers to unexpected external circumstances that prevent a party to a contract from meeting their obligations.
""These clients that have sought advice are largely those that employ Chinese labor,"" said Loh.
Two other senior lawyers, who declined to be named, said they had also received queries related to force majeure.
The Building and Construction Authority, a government agency, has said, however that contractors involved in public sector projects can seek extensions. It has also urged private sector developers to give extensions to contractors that work for them.
Some Chinese companies have already invoked force majeure on contracts due to the virus, including China's top LNG buyer China National Offshore Oil Corp and Jiangsu New Times Shipbuilding Co.
Singapore, which has one of the highest numbers of virus infections outside China at 77, has halted the issuance of new visas to Chinese nationals since Jan. 31. Workers from China with existing work visas must seek approval before re-entry, and if approved, must spend 14 days in quarantine.
Singapore's labor ministry said last week it was rejecting 400 applications daily from returning workers with recent travel history to China and had also canceled some work passes. It has also prevented employers from hiring foreign staff if rules are breached.
The Singapore Contractors Association did not respond to a request for comment.
Construction laborers without any travel history to China have also been infected, with five Bangladeshi workers among confirmed cases. The firm involved,  Boustead Projects Ltd  (SI:BOUS), said it halted construction activities to disinfect areas and is continuing to assess the impact on the project concerned.
The construction sector, which is allowed to hire workers from only a handful of countries including China, India and Bangladesh, expanded 2.8% in 2019, one of the strongest performers in an economy that recorded a growth rate of 0.7%, its slowest in a decade.
The last time several construction firms sought to invoke force majeure in Singapore was in 2007 when Indonesia banned sand exports to the city-state bringing building activity almost to a halt."
1606,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 11:16PM ET</span>",Apple warns sales to fall short of target due to coronavirus impact,"By Neha Malara and Laila Kearney
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) warned on Monday it was unlikely to meet its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago as the world's most valuable technology firm became one of the biggest corporate casualties of China's coronavirus epidemic.
The rapidly spreading virus has killed nearly 1,900 in China and stricken some 72,000 people, confining millions to their homes, disrupting supply chains and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break.
Manufacturing facilities in China that produce Apple's iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said. That will mean fewer iPhones available for sale around the world, making Apple one of the largest Western firms to be hurt by the outbreak.
Some of its retail stores in the country remain closed or are operating at reduced hours, which will hurt sales this quarter. China accounted for 15% of Apple's revenue, or $13.6 billion, last quarter, and supplied 18% of revenue in the year-ago quarter.
In late January, Apple had forecast $63 billion to $67 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, which it said was a wider than normal range due to the uncertainty created by the virus. It did not offer a new revenue estimate nor provide a profit forecast on Monday.
""The magnitude of this impact to miss its revenue guidance midway through February is clearly worse than feared,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note.
Apple, worth $1.4 trillion by market capitalization, could face a torrid market reaction on Tuesday, when Wall Street reopens after the Presidents Day holiday, analysts said.
""If Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
Shares of its Asian suppliers fell on the news, with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) losing 2.4%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TW:2330) down 1.8% and SK Hynix (KS:000660) shedding 3.3%.
Analysts have estimated that the virus may slash demand for smartphones by half in the first quarter in China, the world's biggest market for the devices.
SHORT-TERM IMPACT?
Apple said it will reopen China stores ""as steadily and safely as we can,"" while global supplies of iPhones will be limited as manufacturers work toward operating plants at full capacity. It plans to provide more information in April, when it releases first-quarter results.
Wedbush said it remained optimistic that Apple would be able to recover from the coronavirus setback.
""While trying to gauge the impact of the iPhone miss and potential bounce back in the June quarter will be front and center for the Street, we remain bullish on Apple for the longer term,"" Ives said.
The disruption follows a strong December quarter for iPhone sales, which were up for the first time in a year. That could provide an opening for mobile phone rival Samsung, which has invested in manufacturing capacity in Vietnam and elsewhere.
Samsung launched smartphone delivery services for customers to test its new products this week, as the spread of the virus has prompted the South Korean firm to cancel promotional events and brace for weak store sales.
Apple's contract manufacturers have added far more locations inside China than outside, with major supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) expanding from 19 locations in 2015 to 29 in 2019 and another supplier,  Pegatron  Corp (TW:4938), going from eight to 12 locations, according to data from Apple.
In contrast, Samsung had signaled early in the U.S.-China trade war that it could meet U.S mobile phone demand without China production. Samsung is also far less exposed to China as an end market.
 Fiat  Chrysler, (MI:FCHA),  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and General Motors Co (N:GM) have said their auto production lines were, or could be, hit by Chinese factories that are slow to restart because of the virus."

“While this news is a tough pill to swallow for the bulls, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a company significantly exposed to this virus issue given the company’s massive supply and demand tentacles throughout China,” they added.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 06:46PM ET</span>",Spanish supermarket chain Dia appoints new Brazil CEO to lead restructuring,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Spanish supermarket chain Dia (MC:DIDA) said on Monday it has appointed Marcelo Maia as chief executive of its Brazilian subsidiary to lead a restructuring process in Brazil, and as part of a broader global shakeup.
Maia will replace Marin Dokozic, who occupied the CEO position for about a year. It was not immediately clear if Dokozic will remain working for Dia in Brazil or abroad.
Dia Brasil has 900 brick-and-mortar stores across Brazil, most of them in rented locations, and closed around 300 underperforming stores last year, most of which were franchises.
""We don’t plan more closures for now,"" Maia said at a news conference, adding the company plans to open new stores this year in regions where it already operates. He declined to provide numbers.
The company employs 6,800 people in the country.
Dia was bought in May 2019, when it was near-insolvent, by a Russian investment fund called LetterOne, led by Russian business magnate Mikhail Fridman.
Fridman recruited Maia in London, the new CEO said, in August of last year to work as an adviser to the Brazil operation.
Dia is under investigation for alleged accounting fraud under its previous management, both in Brazil and in its home-country Spain.
Maia declined to comment on the probe or to provide any forward-looking remarks, saying the parent company is in a quiet period before disclosing fourth-quarter results later this month.
He said the company aims to boost in-house brands as of the second half of 2020, but did not elaborate.
""I see a lot of potential in our own brands ... we'll add a Brazilian flavor to our operations here,"" Maia added.
Maia comes from a family with deep roots in retailing. His family founded retailing chain Lojas Maia based in the Northeastern state of Paraíba, which in 2010 was acquired by Magazine Luiza SA (SA:MGLU3).
Maia worked there for three years after the acquisition on integrating Lojas Maia to its new owner."

Cutting emissions will be challenging for Amazon. The e-commerce company delivers 10 billion items a year, has a massive transportation and data center footprint, and has faced criticism from within its own workforce.
Bezos, the world's richest man, is among a growing list of billionaires to dedicate substantial funds to battling the impact of global warming. 
""Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,"" Bezos said in an Instagram post. ""I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share."" 
The Bezos Earth Fund will begin issuing grants this summer as part of the initiative.
""It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals,"" Bezos said. 
Counteracting climate change has become a popular cause for U.S. billionaires in recent years, with Microsoft's Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer counted among the world's wealthiest environmental philanthropists. ⁣⁣⁣ Last year, Bezos pledged to make online retailer Amazon net carbon neutral by 2040 - the first major corporation to announce such a goal - and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from U.S. vehicle design and manufacturing startup Rivian Automotive LLC.
Bezos also said at the time that Amazon would meet the goals of the Paris climate accord 10 years ahead of the accord's schedule and invest $100 million to restore forests and wetlands. 
Amazon has faced protests by environmental activists and pressure from its employees to take action on climate change.
Amazon workers were among hundreds of employees of big technology companies to join climate-change marches in San Francisco and Seattle late last year, saying their employers had been too slow to tackle global warming and needed to take more drastic action.
Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, an activist workers group, welcomed the Bezos Earth Fund announcement, but said it did not make up for the company's consumption of fossil fuels and other activities that contribute to climate change.

""We applaud Jeff Bezos' philanthropy, but one hand cannot give what the other is taking away,"" the group said on Twitter.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 04:53PM ET</span>",Alstom to buy Bombardier rail unit for up to $6.7 billion,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic and Allison Lampert
PARIS/MONTREAL (Reuters) - France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA has agreed to buy the rail division of Canada's Bombardier Inc for up to 6.2 billion euros ($6.7 billion) to create the world's No. 2 train manufacturer and better take on Chinese leader CRRC Corp. 
The cash and shares deal, announced on Monday, is the latest attempt by Western rail firms to try to build scale. 
Alstom, the maker of TGV bullet trains that speed between French cities such as Paris and Nice, was blocked last year from merging with Germany's  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) by European regulators, who argued the deal could penalize consumers. 
The agreement between Alstom and Bombardier would unite companies with an estimated $17 billion in combined revenue. 
The French firm said the two were complementary geographically, adding Bombardier's European footprint was stronger in northern countries and the Canadian firm would add expertise in monorail trains as well as rail services. 
""We don't see it as a huge issue,"" Alstom Chief Executive Henri Poupart-Lafarge said of regulatory hurdles on a conference call. ""If there are some issues, they will be much easier to solve than the one we had with Siemens."" 
A combination with Bombardier would give Alstom a share of between 40% and 60% of the European regional train market, according to estimates cited by union sources in France, well above Siemens at 10% to 20%. 
But some analysts have said there could be less opposition to a deal this time as Alstom and Bombardier have a lower combined European market share in high-speed rail and signaling.
The companies have informally briefed EU antitrust regulators on the deal, according to sources familiar with the matter. 
The French government, which had criticized the EU's veto on the Siemens merger, welcomed the transaction. 
""This deal will allow Alstom to prepare for the future, against the backdrop of increasingly intense international competition,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said, adding he was due to discuss it with the EU's antitrust boss, Margrethe Vestager, on Tuesday. 
Bombardier and Alstom said they expected the deal to close in the first half of 2021. Their agreement includes a 75 million-euro break fee. 
DEBT-LADEN BOMBARDIER
Train makers are eyeing consolidation to reduce costs and improve thin rolling stock margins, and Alstom said it also wanted to make the most of a boom in rail travel as consumers switch from planes for environmental reasons. 
The merged group would be able to reach annual cost savings of 400 million euros from the fourth year, the company added. 
Under the deal, one of the Bombardier rail division's shareholders, Canadian pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, would become the lead investor in Alstom with an 18% stake.
French telecoms-to-construction conglomerate  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) would retain around 10% of Alstom, which said it would finance the transaction by raising equity and with debt. The final price will be between 5.8 billion and 6.2 billion euros, it said. 
The deal gives Bombardier's rail unit an enterprise value - equity plus debt - of $8.2 billion, which would allow the Canadian firm to pay down some of its $9.3 billion in debt.
After closing, Montreal-based Bombardier would emerge as the only large pure business jet maker, with a focus on expanding aftermarket sales and margin expansion. 
Aerospace analysts cautioned that the loss of rail's stable contracts would create greater risk for Bombardier in the event of a market downturn. 
General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD), parent company of Bombardier's U.S. rival Gulfstream, generates revenue from military sales in addition to business jets, as does France's Dassault Aviation.
Bombardier has shed businesses after facing a cash crunch in 2015 while bringing a new plane to market. The Alstom deal comes days after it sold its stake in the A220 passenger jet program to Airbus. 
It has also been struggling to contain higher rail costs generated by problematic contracts in its nearly $36 billion order backlog, which Alstom said it would look to fix. 
""Clearly I would have preferred for things to have turned out differently for Bombardier,"" Quebec's premier, François Legault, said, adding Caisse's presence in Alstom's capital was a comfort for Canadian interests. 
Bombardier Transportation is headquartered in Berlin and has plants worldwide including at Derby in central England, Mannheim in Germany and Crespin in northern France. 
Alstom's Poupart-Lafarge said the acquisition would not affect jobs. 
SIEMENS ON ITS OWN 
A previous flirtation between Siemens and Bombardier to combine some train businesses fell apart in 2017.
A source close to Siemens said there was no sign the firm was planning any type of counterbid, given EU regulators' tough stance on its previous attempts. 

Germany's IG Metall union called on the German government to look at the matter and raised concerns about an Alstom-Bombardier deal, saying it ""would not accept any consolidation at the expense of Germany"" should EU regulators allow this combination. State-owned Deutsche Bahn is a big customer of both firms.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian truck drivers began protesting early on Monday at Latin America's largest port in Santos, affecting the unloading of shipments and arrival of trucks at the port, the union representing some of the protesters said.
The protesters are demanding a reduction of value-added taxes on gasoline and diesel, the port's management said.
A press representative for the port said it could not confirm the information provided by the union. But the port did say that the protest had affected some unloading activities.
Marcelo Aparecido, a union representative, said hundreds of trucks failed to enter the port as normally scheduled.
The protest comes before President Jair Bolsonaro's government sends to Congress a bill aiming to overhaul the value-added tax, a state charge known as ICMS, as recent price cuts at oil refineries by state-run oil firm Petrobras (SA:PETR4) had not been reflected at the pumps.
ICMS is a tax on sales and services and applies to the movement of goods, transportation, communication services and other supplies.
The price of diesel is a sensitive issue for truck drivers, whose national strike in 2018 had a huge impact on Brazil's economy. Bolsonaro had the support of truck drivers' leaders in the 2018 presidential election.
Santos is the No. 1 export port for Brazilian soy, corn and sugar, among other products."

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 12:34PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Italian government leaning towards third term for Eni CEO - sources,"By Giuseppe Fonte, Stephen Jewkes and Giselda Vagnoni
ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - The Italian government is leaning toward reappointing Claudio Descalzi as CEO of state-controlled oil firm Eni, provided he will work with a new board to speed up efforts to cut carbon emissions, four senior political sources told Reuters.
The largest member of the ruling coalition, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has been highly critical of the veteran oilman in the past, not least because he is being tried in Italy for alleged corruption over a 2011 oil deal in Nigeria. Descalzi denies any wrongdoing.
However, Rome is keen for an experienced leader with a track record of dealing with geopolitically sensitive areas such as Africa and the Middle East to oversee interests there, and to help Eni (MI:ENI) shift toward cleaner sources of energy without inflicting too much damage on profitability.
""No final decision has been made yet, but Descalzi has a good chance to be reappointed,"" a government member of the ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Eni, a rich source of dividends for stretched state coffers, has traditionally been seen as a key piece of Italy's energy policy and also important for foreign policy because of its extensive overseas presence.
Descalzi's second term leading the company comes to an end in May and the government is expected to flag as soon as March whether or not he will be kept on. The 64-year old executive is due to present Eni's latest business plan on Feb. 28.
Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri, a PD minister, said on Friday that ""very valuable people"" were running state-owned companies, which also include utility giant  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and defense group Leonardo (MI:LDOF), but did not elaborate.
The 5-Star Movement is not opposing Descalzi's reappointment as long as he is prepared to work with a new board to accelerate moves to cut carbon emissions, a prominent member of the movement said.
""He is winning round key figures in the party,"" the official said, also asking not to be named.
The nomination process at Italy's state-controlled companies is traditionally the subject of intense political horse trading because of their size and importance. Talks usually go down to the wire and can change unexpectedly on political vagaries.
The Treasury, which owns 4.34% of Eni and controls another 25.76% via state lender CDP, has the right to appoint six members of Eni's nine-strong board. It is expected to present a list of candidates that will include the name of the new CEO.
The Treasury declined to comment for this story, as did Eni.
DON'T ROCK THE BOAT
Descalzi was first appointed to the top job at Eni in 2014 by the government of Matteo Renzi, whose Italy Alive party is now a junior member of the ruling coalition.
Helped by major discoveries in Egypt and Mozambique, Descalzi transformed the company into one of the industry's most successful oil and gas explorers. He has shunned costly bets on North American shale gas and more recently won accolades from investors by signing a flurry of deals in the Gulf.
However, his leadership has not been without controversy.
In one of the oil industry's biggest ever scandals, Italian prosecutors allege Eni and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) bought a Nigerian oilfield in 2011 knowing most of the $1.3 billion purchase price would go to agents and middlemen in bribes.
The trial, which includes Descalzi because he led Eni's exploration and production business at the time of the transaction, is drawing to a close, but is not expected to conclude until after the nomination process for a new CEO.
Eni and Shell, like Descalzi, have denied wrongdoing.
Despite the allegations, two of the sources said Rome was drawn to keeping Descalzi as a steady pair of hands at a time of increasing turmoil in Libya, where Eni is the biggest foreign oil and gas producer. ""The (Italian) government at the moment is weak and the message coming out of Rome is to rock the boat as little as possible,"" one of them said.
Descalzi's experience could also help Eni meet growing pressure from politicians and investors for oil companies to do more to address global warming.
The CEO, a physicist by training, set up Eni's green energy unit in 2015 and introduced a target for net-zero carbon emissions from exploration and production operations by 2030.
However, rivals such as Repsol (MC:REP), Shell (L:RDSa) and, more recently,  BP  (L:BP), have gone further, and Descalzi is under pressure to set bolder targets.
""He's got the ball rolling but now he's got to raise the bar,"" one of the sources said."

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 11:48AM ET</span>","Thyssenkrupp shortlists buyout firms for elevator unit, Kone out","By Christoph Steitz, Tom Käckenhoff, Arno Schuetze and Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) has shortlisted two private equity consortia in the sale of its 16 billion euro ($17 billion) elevator unit, dealing a blow to Finland's Kone (HE:KNEBV), which withdrew from the closely watched deal.
Potentially Europe's biggest private-equity deal in 13 years, the transaction is now in its last stages and could come to a head next week when Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board is scheduled to meet.
The cash-strapped conglomerate said it would focus on negotiations with two private equity consortia: one consisting of Blackstone (N:BX), Carlyle (O:CG) and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and another led by Advent and Cinven (CINV.UL).
Shares in Kone plunged nearly 7% on news it had withdrawn, while Thyssenkrupp's stock dropped as much as 3.7%, reflecting disappointment that a tie-up, which would have created the world's largest lift maker, was now off the table.
""The remaining bidders have submitted more concrete offers. The bids are at a high level and underline the attractiveness of the business,"" Thyssenkrupp said in a statement on Monday.
The steel-to-submarines group now plans to let the two consortia battle it out in a final round, hoping they will raise their bids to beyond the roughly 16 billion euros offered so far.
The elevator division is Thyssenkrupp's most profitable business and the German group said it aimed to reach an agreement over whether to sell a majority stake or all of it.
""A complete sale has always been the base case,"" a person familiar with the matter said.
CLEANER DEAL
If no agreement is reached, an initial public offering remains an option, Thyssenkrupp said, adding this would be possible from early summer.
Views in Thyssenkrupp's 20-member supervisory board had differed over whether to weed out Kone's bid - the highest in terms of value but also the riskiest in terms of execution - people familiar with the matter said.
At more than 17 billion euros, Kone - in partnership with CVC (CVC.UL) - had offered about 1.5 billion euros more than private equity suitors.
""The decision to prioritize potentially lower offers indicates, in our opinion, the desire for a cleaner sales process as financial investors should reduce risk of prolonged anti-trust clearance measures in comparison to a conceptual Kone offer,"" analysts at Jefferies said. 
Labor unions, which control half of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, were opposed to a deal with Kone from the get-go, fearing it would lead to substantial job cuts.
Kone, in a brief statement, said it continued to believe that a combination of its business with Thyssenkrupp Elevator, which would have been the largest acquisition in Finland's history, would have been strategically compelling.
""But in the end we came to a moment where you see that the risks become too significant,"" Chief Executive Henrik Ehrnrooth told Reuters, adding he believed that antitrust reviews would not have been an obstacle.
Cevian, Thyssenkrupp's second-largest shareholder with an 18% stake, had been arguing in favor of a deal with Kone, two of the people familiar with the matter said, pointing to substantial synergies.
Cevian declined to comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares were buoyant on Monday as the promise of further policy stimulus from China to counteract the economic hit from a coronavirus outbreak calmed nervous investors.
Trading was light, with U.S. stocks and bond markets shut for a public holiday.
Both the pan-European STOXX 600 index and Germany's DAX reached record highs before paring some gains. (EU) The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was flat on the day.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.14% to near last week's peak of 558.30, its highest since late January.
The gains were led by China, whose blue-chip index climbed 2.25% after the country's central bank lowered a key interest rate and injected more liquidity into the system.
Also whetting risk appetite was an announcement by China's finance minister on Sunday that Beijing would roll out tax and fee cuts.
""Traders are mindful of the fact the Chinese authorities intervened in the financial markets at the beginning of the month, when the domestic stock markets reopened after the Lunar New Year celebrations,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets in London. 
""Some dealers hold the view that Beijing will intervene in the markets again should the situation get much worse, which could explain the resilience of equity markets.""
Fears about the jolt to the world economy from the coronavirus lingered, though, as the number of reported new cases in China rose to 2,048 as on Sunday from 2,009 the previous day.
""The latest numbers from the Hubei province still suggest that the infection pace is slowing after the sudden jump following the methodology changes last week,"" Danske Bank said in a research note, highlighting that the number of new cases within China is the lowest since Jan. 23.
Restrictions were tightened further in Hubei over the weekend. Most vehicles were banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.
Japan's Nikkei fell 0.7% after its economy shrank at the fastest pace in almost six years in the December quarter. The slowdown in the world's third-largest economy came amid concern the coronavirus effects will hurt output and tourism, stoking fears Japan may slump into recession.
The coronavirus also led trade-dependent Singapore to downgrade its 2020 economic growth forecast. China's economy is widely expected to slow sharply as well.
BULL RUN 
South Korea's KOSPI index ended mostly flat. Australian, Singapore and Malaysian share indexes weakened. 
Asia's woes have yet to spread to the United States, though. Wall Street indexes scaled record highs on Friday. (N)
Talk of a middle class tax cut and a proposal to encourage Americans to invest in stocks boosted equity markets late last week, Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said.
Bassanese had misgivings about the plan, saying it reminded him of former U.S. President George Bush encouraging Americans to buy a home during a housing boom.
""It adds to my suspicion that this decade-long bull market could eventually end via a blow-off bubble, driven by central bank persistent low interest rate policy,"" he said in a note. 
Later in the week, flash manufacturing activity data for February are due for the euro zone, the United Kingdom and the United States. They are likely to capture some of the early impact of the viral epidemic. 
Action was relatively muted in currency markets, with the dollar up against the yen at 109.90 and the pound at $1.3015. It gained against the euro to $1.0840. 
The risk-sensitive Aussie, which is also played as a liquid proxy for Chinese assets, ticked up 0.1% to $0.6721.
That left the dollar index flat at 99.135. 
In commodities, gold fell 0.22% to $1,581.25 an ounce. [GOL/] Brent crude was flat at $57.31 a barrel and U.S. crude added 0.1% to $52.09. [O/R]

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 10:11AM ET</span>","Pompeo blasts corruption, promotes U.S. business in Africa trip","LUANDA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced corruption and touted American business on Monday during the second leg of an African tour in Angola, where the government is seeking to claw back billions of dollars looted from state coffers.
Pompeo is aiming to promote U.S. investment as an alternative to Chinese loans while assuaging concerns over a planned U.S military withdrawal and the expansion of visa restrictions targeting four African countries.
In Angola's capital Luanda, Pompeo met with President Joao Lourenco, who took office in 2017 promising wide-ranging economic reforms and a crackdown on the endemic graft that marked his predecessor Jose Eduardo dos Santos' four-decade rule.
""Here in Angola, damage from corruption is pretty clear,"" he told a group of businessmen following that meeting. ""This reform agenda that the president put in place has to stick.""
Portugal's public prosecutor has ordered the seizure of bank accounts belonging to Isabel dos Santos, the former president's billionaire daughter, who is a suspect in an Angolan fraud investigation.
Reputedly the richest woman in Africa, she has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Angola, with sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest economy and its second-largest oil producer is ranked as one of the world's most corrupt nations, in 165th place on a list of 180 countries, according to anti-corruption group Transparency International.
U.S. oil majors  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and  Chevron  (N:CVX) have significant stakes in Angolan oil fields.
Last year, Chevron signed onto a consortium to develop Angola's natural gas assets alongside Italy's Eni (MI:ENI), France's  Total  (PA:TOTF),  BP  (L:BP) and Angolan state oil company Sonangol.
""We've got a group of energy companies that have put more than $2 billion in a natural gas project. That will rebound to the benefit of the American businesses for sure, but to the Angolan people for sure as well,"" Pompeo said.
Despite U.S. investments, the bulk of Angola's oil production is destined for China, which holds the lion's share of Angolan foreign debt.
The Trump administration has accused China of predatory lending in Africa, where Beijing has loaned governments billions of dollars for infrastructure projects in exchange for access to natural resources. China rejects the criticism.
With a revamped International Development Finance Corporation and its new Prosper Africa trade and investment strategy, the administration is seeking to combat Chinese influence on the continent.
But the push comes as some governments are questioning U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to Africa.
The White House last month tightened visa restrictions on nationals from Sudan, Tanzania, Eritrea and Nigeria.
West African governments are also worried about a proposed U.S. troop withdrawal from the region just as Islamist groups with links to Islamic State and al Qaeda are gaining ground.
During the first leg of his African trip in Senegal on Sunday, Pompeo sought to put some of those fears to rest.
""We have an obligation to get security right here, in the region. It's what will permit economic growth, and we're determined to do that,"" he told reporters."
1623,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 10:04AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Says Record Highs in European Stocks Can Last and Widen,"(Bloomberg) -- European equities are trading at fresh record highs, and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists say the rally can go on and even expand to markets that have been left behind.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed at a historical peak last week after earnings optimism outweighed spreading coronavirus fears. To JPMorgan strategists, the fact that the European benchmark has risen above the level of 400 index points by about 8% is significant because in prior years a gain above this level was followed by months of heavy declines.
But this time things are different, the strategists say. Unlike in the past, Eurozone manufacturing is starting to rebound, providing a favorable basis for a further advance in stocks. Additionally, just 23% of the Stoxx 600 companies and four country indexes are currently trading at record highs, leaving room for the rally’s expansion.
“There is a potential for short-term coronavirus-induced disruption in the first-quarter data flow, but we remain bullish on the global cycle, continuing to argue that U.S. recession is unlikely ahead of the presidential elections,” said JPMorgan strategists led by Mislav Matejka. “The breadth of the breakout could easily widen.”
The rally in global equities has been resilient to virus concerns, with investors continuing to buy risk assets on optimism that the economic impact of the epidemic will be limited. While the euro is trading near its lowest since 2017, economic data have been more encouraging for European stock investors, with January euro-area manufacturing slightly exceeding an initial estimate.
JPMorgan strategists raised euro-zone stocks to overweight at the end of September, correctly forecasting the continuation of gains, which have since reached about 9%. The analysts are underweight U.S. and U.K. equities and overweight euro-zone stocks.
Other factors that are in favor of the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to the strategists, are rising dividends and a valuation discount relative to bonds and global equities. The Stoxx 600 Index is trading at 15.4 times estimated earnings, relative to 17.5 times for MSCI World.
A bounce in bond yields is also expected to help European equities, with banks being particularly sensitive, according to JPMorgan. This, in turn, should boost Spanish and Italian stocks as well as domestic sectors, the strategists said."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants every country involved in this week’s European Union budget talks to be prepared to compromise in order to reach an agreement.
“Our goal has always been that this budget will also support a process of modernization,” chief spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters Monday. To achieve this, it “will require a willingness from all sides to compromise.”
EU leaders are due to meet Thursday for a summit in Brussels. Agreement on the size of contributions is needed before any decisions can be taken on how the budget will be spent, and the conditions attached to any disbursements.
Merkel would be willing to increase her country’s contribution to the budget to more than 1% of gross domestic product if the other member states agree to set new financial priorities, Spiegel reported last week. A finance ministry spokesman responded by saying the government hasn’t changed its position on Germany’s budget contribution.
Some EU members are still far apart on the issue. While countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark advocate stricter budget rules, East European member states such as Poland and Hungary are demanding more subsidies."

Unione di Banche Italiane SpA, Italy’s fifth-largest bank, plans to pay out 40% of net income to shareholders on average over the course of its three-year strategic plan and may make an extra payment if capital is strong enough.
The bank sees net income more than doubling by 2022 and it plans to cut provisions for bad loans and invest in digital technology, UBI Banca said in a statement on Monday. It will also focus on strengthening higher-margin businesses such as private and corporate banking.
Chief Executive Officer Victor Massiah has relied on curbing risk and cutting costs to boost profit as sluggish Italian economic growth and prolonged low interest rates hamper core revenue. UBI expects to sell off a package of bad loans valued at about 800 million euros ($867 million) during 2020 and that will be its last large-scale disposal of soured debt.

The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 rose as high as 432.48 before retracing to be at 431.58 by 5:25 AM ET (1025 GMT). The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.3%, while the German Dax was up 0.2% and the French CAC 40 up 0.1% on a day when trading is expected to be subdued by the closure of U.S. cash markets for the Presidents Day holiday.
Automotive stocks were among the biggest gainers after China’s central bank cut one of its main interest rates and added more short-term liquidity to the local market, while Beijing also hinted at future tax cuts.
The news was accompanied by reports of a further drop in new cases of Covid-19 reported in China, as well as a slowdown in deaths. There was also more upbeat anecdotal news as Macau gave its casinos permission to reopen from Thursday.
The automotive sector has various channels of exposure to the virus, chiefly through the impact on local sales in the world’s biggest market, but also through its supply chain. Kia Motors closed down all three of its plants in South Korea last week citing shortages of components from Chinese suppliers, while Fiat Chrysler temporarily closed a plant in Serbia for the same reasons.
French components groups   Faurecia   (PA:EPED) and   Valeo   (PA:VLOF) led the sector higher with gains of 6% and 5.4%, after Faurecia published stronger-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter. German components groups Schaeffler, Continental and Hella also rose by between 2% and 3%.
Elsewhere, the red ink was more visible. Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS), which last week said it would rebrand itself NatWest, fell 1.5% amid fears that the U.K. government may start a firesale of its shareholding in the bank to fund its ambitious spending plans.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) stock fell 2.4% after a new court ruling awarding heavy damages to a farmer who claimed the German chemicals giant’s dicamba weedkiller had ruined his orchards. That creates a second source of litigation risk, on top of separate claims against its Roundup product. Both were developed by   Monsanto   (NYSE:MON), which Bayer agreed to buy in 2017. Bayer stock is still up 25% from last year’s low, but has almost halved in value since 2015.
U.K. asset manager   Jupiter Fund Management   (LON:JUP) rose 6.8% to its highest since August 2018 after announcing the acquisition of smaller rival Merian, which had been spun out of the Old Mutual Group.
Electricite de France (PA:EDF) stock, meanwhile, hit another 12-month high, extending gains after reporting better-than-expected full-year earnings for 2019 and predicting further improvement in 2020. 
French engineering group   Alstom   SA (PA:ALSO) hit a 10-year high after confirming it's in talks to merge with Bombardier's (TSX:BBDb) rail unit. That comes after the European Union Commission struck down its plans to merge with Siemens' rail business nine months ago."
1628,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 06:23AM ET</span>","Cathay Pacific flags 'significant' drop in first-half profit, capacity cuts due to coronavirus","(Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) is expecting a significant drop in its first-half results and has also cut capacity due to the coronavirus outbreak, it said on Monday. 
Severe travel restrictions as a result of a coronavirus outbreak in China, which has caused about 1,770 deaths across mainland China, have led to a steep rise in flight cancellations. 
""The first half of 2020 was already expected to be extremely challenging financially,"" the company said in a statement. 
""As a result of this additional significant drop in demand for flights and consequential capacity reduction caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the financial results for the first half of 2020 will be significantly down on the same period last year.""
Flight cancellations have led the number of customers seeking refunds to skyrocket. The airline has told those affected, including some air show delegates, that reimbursement could take up to six weeks.
The carrier, which is the most exposed airline outside mainland China to a demand crunch related to the coronavirus, also said in a statement it had cut capacity by 40% for February and March, against an earlier planned 30% cut. 
It also pointed to a likely reduction in April.
Cathay Pacific also posted a 1.3 percentage point decrease in the passenger load factor of Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon to 84.7% in January.

Meanwhile, Swire Pacific Ltd (HK:0019), Cathay's largest shareholder, said it expects a hit to its first-half results owing to the capacity reductions by Cathay.

1631,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 05:12AM ET</span>",Jupiter Snares Rival U.K. Fund Manager in $482 Million Deal,"(Bloomberg) --   Jupiter Fund Management   Plc (LON:JUP) snapped up rival U.K. asset manager Merian Global Investors as the industry faces pressure to consolidate.
The British fund manager will make a payment of 370 million pounds ($482 million) through the issue of new Jupiter stock to Merian shareholders, with an additional deferred performance payout, according to a statement on Monday. London-based Jupiter will manage more than 65 billion pounds of assets after the deal, the company’s first acquisition.
Active managers face increasing pressure to pair up amid heightened regulatory costs and intense competition from low-cost index and exchange traded funds. Jupiter, run by Chief Executive Officer Andrew Formica since last year, has suffered seven straight quarters of outflows and the Merian acquisition will help replenish its assets.
It “provides increased scale and diversification into attractive product areas, and creates stronger future growth prospects for the business,” Formica said. “It’s also consistent with our strategic priorities, adding strong investment talent with a similar culture and investment philosophy.”
Jupiter’s shares rose as much as 10.4% in Monday morning trading in London, the most in more than six years.
Competition for active managers has sent fees lower, led to thousands of job losses and forced large-scale consolidation among companies, with mixed results.
The Janus Henderson Group Plc and  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen Plc mergers were aimed at boosting assets, but neither have been able to stanch outflows since their tie-ups. Banco de Sabadell SA also agreed in January to sell its asset-management business to Amundi SA for 430 million euros ($466 million). GAM Holding AG considered a sale of the company last year and Julius Baer Group Ltd. had plans to dispose of its asset manager Kairos.
“The key point to make here is this is not a merger,” Phil Wagstaff, Jupiter’s global head of distribution, said in a telephone call. “This is very clearly an acquisition by Jupiter and we will keep our culture, methodology and strategy.”
Merian
Merian Global is owned by Boston-based private-equity firm TA Associates Management, which acquired Merian in 2018 from Old Mutual Ltd., the South African financial services conglomerate. Founded by U.K. veteran fund manager Richard Buxton, Merian’s biggest offerings are global and U.K. equities.
TA Associates will retain a 16% stake in Jupiter after the deal and take a seat on the board.
Merian fund managers Buxton, Ian Heslop, Amadeo Alentorn, Daniel Nickols and Richard Watts have all signed contracts with Jupiter and will be bringing their teams over with them, Wagstaff said.
Bloomberg reported on Saturday that Jupiter’s negotiations on the Merian deal were underway, with a likely purchase price of less than 500 million pounds in cash and stock.
‘Defensive’ Deal
Before leading Jupiter, Formica built the former Henderson Group through dealmaking and eventually combined his firm with Janus Capital in 2017. He became co-CEO of the merged group alongside Dick Weil. Formica departed a year later after the board chose Weil as sole CEO.
Luring investors back to Jupiter could prove more difficult following star portfolio manager Alexander Darwall’s decision to set out on his own. He ran the flagship Jupiter European Fund as well as the listed Jupiter European Opportunities Trust Plc.
London-based Shore Capital Group Ltd. said investors should remain dubious about the Merian acquisition.
“Recent large scale M&A in U.K. asset management has not proved to be a value-creative event for investors,” analyst Paul McGinnis said in a note Monday. “The deal looks defensive in nature -- as did Standard Life Aberdeen -- so we think investors should start from a slightly skeptical position.”

(Reuters) - European shares hit a record high on Monday, with automobile stocks leading gains amid fresh attempts by China to limit the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
Automobile stocks (SXAP), which are highly sensitive to Chinese demand and industrial output, surged 2%, led by French car parts group  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) after reporting a rise in annual profits and sales.
Given that several European companies, particularly the automobile sector, depend on China as part of their supply chain, local markets are likely to take any fresh stimulus measures as a positive.
China cut interest rates and flagged possible tax cuts as it struggles to limit the economic impact from the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 1,700 people in the country.
""The fact that China keeps signaling that they're ready to somewhat bubblewrap the economy by pumping in stimulus - that's what's keeping markets in the green today,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at financial spread better Spreadex.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.2% by 0906 GMT, having touched a record high of 432.48 earlier in the day. Market activity is expected to be light through the rest of the day on account of a U.S. holiday.
The automaker-heavy German stock index (GDAXI) also touched a record high.
""This week is interesting because we've got manufacturing PMIs (on Friday), I think it will give an idea of some impact on supply chains from the coronavirus,"" Spreadex's Campbell added.
The resources (SXPP) and oil and gas sectors (SXEP) were also among the best performing subindexes for the day, given their heavy export exposure to China. Both sectors have also taken some support from recent weakness in the euro (EUR=) and the pound .
Among individual movers, London-listed  Jupiter Fund Management  (L:JUP) topped the STOXX 600 after it agreed to buy Merian Global Investors in a deal that will make Jupiter Britain's second-largest retail funds provider.
German herbicide providers  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) and BASF SE (DE:BASFn) fell 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, after a U.S. peach grower was awarded $265 million in a lawsuit against the two.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 02:58AM ET</span>",Education First in exclusive talks to sell China business to Permira -sources,"By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Swiss language tutor Education First (EF) has entered exclusive talks with global private equity firm Permira to sell its China operations, in a deal valuing the business at $1.6 billion, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
EF, owned by founder Bertil Hult and his family, hired JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to help sell the mainly children-focused business last year, coming as multinational firms re-evaluate their China operations where economic growth is slowing.
The language tutor achieved about $100 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) last year at its China business, said one of the people.
An enterprise value (EV) of $1.6 billion would yield an EV/EBITDA multiple - a metric investors use to help determine a company's value - of 16 times following a second round of bids, from nearly 20 times after the first round when EF aimed for a value of $2 billion, the people said.
EF invited Permira to participate in the second round last month alongside private equity peers including Hillhouse Capital, Boyu Capital, CVC Capital Partners and General Atlantic, said the people.
Permira, which in October closed its latest global buyout fund of $12 billion, is in talks with several banks for a loan to help finance the potential acquisition, said one of the people.
The private equity firm plans to wait for EF China's financial reports for the first quarter of 2020 to re-negotiate the price, the person said.
EF, Permira and JPMorgan declined to comment on the deal. Boyu could not be immediately reached for comment. Hillhouse, CVC and General Atlantic did not respond to requests for comment. The people declined to be identified as the information was confidential.
EF, on its website, said it opened its first China school in Shanghai in 1993 and expanded to over 300 teaching centers across 60 Chinese cities, offering language courses for children and adults as well as study tours.
The potential sale comes at a time when a fast-spreading conoravirus, which has claimed over 1,700 lives, has forced local governments in China to order the closure of schools and non-essential companies until further notice.
""We are leading the drive to provide online learning at an unprecedented speed and scale so that our students can continue their studies with our teachers in real time during this special period,"" EF told Reuters. It said 150,000 students had migrated from offline to online since mid-January.
China makes up a significant portion of EF's global revenue, with the bulk coming from children's language learning programs, Reuters previously reported.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 02:57AM ET</span>","GM shuts Australia, NZ operations; sells Thai plant to Great Wall","By Hilary Russ and Yilei Sun
NEW YORK/BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said it would wind down its Australian and New Zealand operations and sell a Thai plant in the latest restructuring of its global business, costing the U.S. auto maker $1.1 billion.
The moves will accelerate GM's retreat from unprofitable markets, making it more dependent on the United States, China, Latin America and South Korea, and give up an opening to expand in Southeast Asia.
They come after the company told analysts this month that restructuring GM's international operations outside of China to produce profit margins in the mid-single digits would represent ""a $2 billion improvement"" on two years ago.
GM has forecast a flat profit for 2020 after a difficult 2019, and is facing ballooning interest in electric car rival Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
GM is ""focusing on markets where we have the right strategies to drive robust returns, and prioritizing global investments that will drive growth in the future of mobility,"" especially in electric and autonomous vehicles, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement late on Sunday.
The latest changes - a continuation of GM's retreat from Asia that began in 2015 when it announced it would stop making GM-branded cars in Indonesia - will lead to cash and non-cash charges of $1.1 billion. Some 600 jobs will be lost in Australia and New Zealand, while GM said about 1,500 jobs would be affected by the sale in Thailand.
Barra has prioritized profit margins over sales volume and global presence since taking over in 2014. 
In 2017, she sold GM's European Opel and Vauxhall businesses to  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and exited South Africa and other African markets. Since then, Barra has decided to pull GM out of Vietnam, Indonesia and India. 
""THE END OF AN ERA""
Like Britain, Australia and New Zealand are right-hand drive markets. With sales of GM's Australian Holden brand plummeting, the company could not justify the investment to continue building right-hand drive vehicles, GM President Mark Reuss said.
The move stoked anger in Australia, where GM Holden long ranked among the country's best selling car companies after the first locally made mass-production car rolled off the assembly line with a Holden badge in 1948.
Amid continuous decline in new car sales, GM said it was ending Australian factory production in 2017 and last year called time on former best-seller the Commodore as part of a shift towards more compact SUVs and utility vehicles.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday he was disappointed and angry at the decision, although not surprised.
""Australian taxpayers put billions into this multinational company. They let the brand just wither away on their watch,"" he told reporters in Melbourne. 
GREAT WALL GOING ABROAD
Great Wall, one of China's biggest sport-utility vehicle makers, said it will sell cars from the Thai manufacturing base, which also has an engine plant, in Southeast Asia and Australia as it seeks global sales amid a slowing domestic market.
""There is no choice, if we don't go global, we will not survive,"" Wei Jianjun, chairman of the Baoding-based automaker, said last year when Great Wall opened a plant in Russia. 
It also signed an agreement in January to buy GM's car plant in India. The Thai transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. 
""Such an acquisition could give Great Wall quick access to the ASEAN market, and Thailand is a good choice for its production base amid the country's established supply chain in the automotive industry,"" said Shi Ji, analyst at Haitong International.
Great Wall is likely to face fierce competition from Japanese automakers which dominate Thailand's domestic car sales. Thailand produces around 2 million vehicles each year, with just over half exported. 
Great Wall may consider also building pickup trucks and SUVs in Thailand, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters . 
The firm, which is building a car plant with BMW (DE:BMWG) in China, sold 1.06 million cars last year, including 65,175 units for export.

NMC, the United Arab Emirates' largest private healthcare company, has been thrown into turmoil in the past month by doubts over its finances and the reporting of shareholdings of some its main owners including Shetty.
Indian billionaire Shetty had already said last week he was ""stepping back"" from board duties after he informed NMC of a potentially inaccurate reporting of his holdings and began a legal review.
Vice chairman Khalifa Butti Omeir Bin Yousef also stepped down from the board last week and the company also said on Monday that two other directors linked to the partners had resigned.
Shares in the company have fallen around 70% in value since well-known short-seller Muddy Waters raised questions over its finances late last year, drawing an expression of interest in the company from private equity firm GKSD Investment.

DP World operates ports around the world, from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires, and is headquartered at its flagship Jebel Ali Port in Dubai, the Middle East's biggest transhipment hub.
Port and Free Zone World, a wholly-owned subsidiary of state investment vehicle Dubai World, is to acquire the 19.55% of shares listed on the Nasdaq Dubai, according to a stock filing.
Port and Free Zone World already owns 80.45% of ordinary share capital of DP World. 
Each listed share will be acquired for $16.75, a 28.8% premium on Sunday's closing price of $13 a share. 
Port and Free Zone World will finance the transaction in new facilities arranged by Citibank (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), the filing said. 
Port and Free Zone World will also provide $5.15 billion in funds to Dubai World, helping it meet outstanding obligations to lenders so that DP World can implement its strategy without restrictions, it said. 
Dubai World subsidiaries face certain restrictions due to agreements it has with creditors. DP World had been exempt from those restrictions as long as it was listed. 
Proceeds will also be used to allow DP World to fund the potential redemption of its convertible bonds, the filing said. 
DP World is delisting to focus on its medium-to-long-term strategy of becoming ""the world’s leading logistics provider,"" said Chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. 
The port operator, which listed on the Nasdaq Dubai in 2007, has diversified its operations in recent years to include industrial parks, transportation, and other logistic services assets. 
""The demands of the public market for short term returns ... are incompatible with this industry,"" said bin Sulayem. 
Port and Free Zone World intends to maintain DP World's governance structure, the filing said. 
DP World shares surged 9.62% after it announced it would delist, but they had lost more than a quarter of value over the past year.
The port operator blamed the U.S.-China trade war and regional geopolitics for causing uncertainty last year, with gross container volumes through its ports contracting 0.2%. 

The operator was valued at $4.96 billion when it listed in 2007. It was also listed on the London Stock Exchange between 2011 and 2015.

1638,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Seen Edging Higher After PBoC Eases Policy Again,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- European stock markets are set to open a little higher Monday, helped by further efforts by the Chinese authorities to limit the damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
Volumes are likely to be limited, though, with the U.S. markets closed.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 36 points, or 0.3% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 17 points, or 0.3%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 20 points, or 0.3%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, rose 9 points, or 0.2%. 
Earlier Monday, the People’s Bank of China provided medium-term funding to commercial lenders and cut the interest rate it charges for the money by 10 basis points to 3.15%, the lowest level since 2017. 
That's the latest in a string of dramatic monetary measures to prop up Chinese markets since the Covid-19 virus struck. 
The number of new coronavirus cases in China fell on Sunday and a health official said the intense efforts to stop its spread were beginning to show results.
International experts remained cautious and warned it is too early to tell whether the epidemic has peaked, but market confidence that the worst is over is rising.
New corporate earnings are limited as is traditional on Monday, particularly with U.S. markets closed for Presidents Day. 
Economic data releases are also thin on the ground Monday, but the week ahead sees the German ZEW on Tuesday, which will be the first post-coronavirus indicator, while eurozone consumer confidence and PMI figures on Thursday and Friday will also attract close attention.
Oil markets recovered last week, helped by reports that China’s independent refineries, known as “teapots,” were back to buying some crude. However, Japan, the world's fourth-largest oil consumer, reported an economic contraction of 6.3% for the October to December period. There is also an expectation of a further contraction in the following quarter because of the contagion. 
Eyes remain firmly fixed on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, and whether they will approve a proposal to deepen production cuts to tighten global supplies and support prices.

During 2019, QBE's net Australia-Pacific cost of catastrophe claims jumped to $193 million from $106 million the year before, led by unprecedented floods in Australia's north east coast and horrendous bushfires across the country's south east.
The insurer said it has started to adjust its catastrophe models to factor in the expected impacts of climate change until 2100, and would assess the impact on its weather-related exposures from emissions and temperatures.
In the short-term, QBE would manage higher claims by considering event frequency and severity in its capital planning and will deploy a comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program, it said.
Over the long-term, it expected the physical impacts of climate change ""will result in our customers seeking increased insurance for the protection of their assets and the services they provide.""
""This may cause insurance premiums to become unaffordable, especially for customers in areas more exposed to weather-related events, potentially resulting in a loss of revenue.""
Insurers and banks are also facing stricter regulatory scrutiny over their response to global warming, with shareholders expecting better disclosures and transparency on climate-related risks.
In its annual climate disclosure, QBE said it plans to phase out all direct insurance services for thermal coal customers by 2030, in an effort to cut emissions responsible for rising global temperatures.
It is also committed to shunning direct insurance services for new thermal coal mines, power stations or thermal coal transport infrastructure.
Globally, the economic costs from natural disasters have exceeded the 30‑year average for seven of the last 10 years, while the number of extreme weather events globally has tripled since the 1980s, QBE CEO Pat Regan said in the company's annual report."
1642,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2020 11:30PM ET</span>",Support for Japan’s Abe Slides Amid Doubts Over Virus Handling,"(Bloomberg) -- Voter support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe fell in three polls published Monday, with two showing public dissatisfaction over his government’s handling of the new coronavirus outbreak as new domestic cases continue to be discovered daily.
The outbreak has slammed the brakes on travel and tourism, just as data released on Monday shows an Abe-backed tax hike battered the economy in the last quarter of 2019, which contracted by the most in more than five years. The fresh recession concerns are casting doubt on the stability that helped Abe become the country’s longest-serving premier in November.
Approval for Abe’s cabinet fell 5 percentage points from the previous month to 47% in a survey carried out by the Yomiuri newspaper Feb. 14-16. The survey found 52% of respondents were dissatisfied with the government’s handling of the virus outbreak.
A separate survey by broadcaster ANN found support had fallen 5.6 percentage points to 39.8% and 50% were unhappy with government policy on the disease.
Despite the hit in the ratings, Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party is not facing any serious challenge to its leadership. A Kyodo News poll showed the LDP was still the most-favored party with support at 40.5%, while the biggest opposition group, the Constitutional Democratic Party, was at 10.9%.
Unlike other places that have issued blanket bans on visitors from China due to the virus, Abe’s government has adopted a softer approach with Japan’s biggest trading partner by limiting the restrictions to foreigners who have been in virus epicenters, such as Wuhan. Critics, including the opposition Democratic Party for the People, have called for a bar on all visitors from China, where there have been more than 70,000 cases.
Japan has found more than 400 cases of the virus, 355 of them among the passengers and crew from a cruise ship held in quarantine in the port of Yokohama.
A series of scandals also continue to take a toll on support for Abe. The survey conducted by Kyodo found 84.5% of respondents said he had failed to clear up a series of allegations including dispensing invitations to a publicly funded cherry blossom-viewing party as favors to his supporters.
Some 77.5% of respondents to the Kyodo poll said Japan should rethink its plans to develop casino resorts following the indictment of a lawmaker on bribery charges related to the proposals. Tsukasa Akimoto, an LDP member, has denied taking bribes from a Chinese company.
Abe has said he will step down at the end of his third straight term as party leader next year. He need not hold a general election until 2021."

Investing.com - Asian markets were mixed on Monday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 underperforming its regional peers after data showed the country’s economy shrank at the fastest pace in six years.
The Nikkei 225 was down 0.8% by 10:55 PM ET (02:55 GMT). Japan’s GDP in the December quarter fell an annualized 6.3%, faster than the expected 3.7% contraction, data from the Cabinet Office showed on Monday. 
The drop, which followed a revised 0.5% gain in July-September, was the biggest since a 7.4% decline marked in April-June 2014.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 1.3% and 2.0% respectively as investors continued to monitor the potential economic fallout from the coronavirus in China. 
On Sunday, China reported 1,933 new cases, down from 2,009 the previous day, and 100 new deaths, down one from 142 the previous day. 
“The worrying human and economic toll of the COVID-19 outbreak is creating much uncertainty, especially as changes to the case tracking methods are making news difficult to interpret,” John Bromhead from ANZ Research wrote in a morning note.
The Hang Seng Index traded 0.8% higher even after the Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city is facing “tsunami-like” shocks. 
He said in a blog post on Sunday that economic fallout due to the virus outbreak is being felt beyond retail, food and beverage and tourism-related industriesand can cause the unemployment rate to “Deteriorate rapidly.” 
South Korea’s KOSPI and Australia’s ASX 200 both inched down 0.1%.
Elsewhere, Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its forecast range for the change in the country’s annual gross domestic product to between -0.5% and 1.5% from the previous 0.5% and 2.5% range. 
“The (earlier) forecast was premised on a modest pickup in global growth, along with a recovery in the global electronics cycle, in 2020. Since then, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected China, Singapore and many countries around the world,” the ministry said in a statement."

(Reuters) - U.S. printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp (N:XRX) is hosting a dinner for HP Inc (N:HPQ) shareholders this week as it seeks investor support to overcome the personal computer maker's resistance to its $35 billion takeover bid, according to people familiar with the matter.
The charm offensive comes after Xerox raised its cash-and-stock bid for HP last week by $2 to $24 per share ahead of a tender offer it plans to launch in early March. It is also asking HP shareholders to replace HP's board directors with Xerox's nominees at the company's annual shareholder meeting later this year.
HP, whose shares ended on Friday at $22.37, is expected to dismiss the sweetened offer as inadequate when it unveils its most recent quarterly earnings on Feb. 24. It told investors last week it wants them to have ""full information"" on the company before responding publicly to Xerox.
Xerox has invited some HP shareholders to a dinner at a restaurant in the Riverside neighborhood of Greenwich, Connecticut on Feb. 18, the sources said. Xerox CEO John Visentin is expected to attend, one of the sources added.
Enough HP shareholders backing HP CEO Enrique Lores could embolden the company to remain independent or hold out for a better deal.
Other such meetings are possible in the coming days, said another of the sources, who asked not to be identified because the meeting is confidential.
Xerox and HP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Xerox has said it expects the combination with HP, which has four times its market capitalization of about $8 billion, to yield approximately $2 billion in cost synergies. The two companies focus on complimentary segments of the printing market.
The printing industry is in decline as companies and consumers turn to digital documents to save money and help the environment. This has put pressure on companies in the sector to consolidate and reverse their revenue decline through acquisitions that can boost their market share.
HP, which separated from servers and networking equipment provider Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Inc (N:HPE) in 2015, has participated in this consolidation, acquiring Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (KS:005930) printer business for $1.05 billion in 2017.
HP has been reluctant to engage in deal discussions with Xerox since November, when the latter launched its takeover campaign after reaching a settlement with Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901) that resolved a legal dispute over their 57-year-old joint venture and a previous attempt to merge, yielding a $2.3 billion after-tax payoff for Xerox.
Lores, previously the president of HP's imaging, printing and solutions business, also assumed his duties as CEO last November, succeeding Dion Weisler.
HP did negotiate with Xerox last year at the invitation of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a top Xerox shareholder who has since also acquired a stake in HP, according to the sources. The talks stalled after the companies failed to agree on the amount of confidential information they shared with each other, the sources said.
HP relies on its desktop and notebook personal computers business for the majority of its net revenue, but gets the bulk of its earnings from its printing hardware and supplies division.
It has disputed the value of the cost synergies that Xerox has put forward, and argued that its sale to Xerox would saddle the combined company with too much debt. HP has also raised questions on the impact on Xerox's supply chain of losing Fujifilm as a partner.
RESTRUCTURING OPERATIONS
HP is also mindful of large acquisitions given its fateful deal for British software company Autonomy almost a decade ago. HP bought Autonomy for $11.1 billion in 2011 as the centerpiece of its unsuccessful pivot to software. A little over a year later, it wrote off $8.8 billion, $5 billion of which it put down to accounting improprieties, misrepresentation and disclosure failures.
Xerox's stock has rallied under Visentin, a former Hewlett-Packard and  IBM  Corp (N:IBM) executive with ties to the private equity industry who took over as Xerox CEO in 2018.
Thanks to an operational restructuring program dubbed 'Project Own It', Visentin has managed to take out costs and is seeking to return Xerox to revenue growth by 2021. He has also boosted the company's stock through share buybacks.
HP has also announced a cost-saving program worth more than $1 billion that could result in its shedding about 16% of its workforce, or about 9,000 employees, over the next few years."
1647,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2020 05:11PM ET</span>",Clock's ticking for Nissan boss Uchida to show he has a plan: sources,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan's new CEO Makoto Uchida doesn't have time to work his way into the job. He is effectively on probation and has a matter of months to show he can revive the ailing automaker, according to three people familiar with the thinking of some on the company's board.
The mission: the new boss must prove to the board he can accelerate cost-cutting and rebuild profits at the 86-year-old Japanese giant, and that he has the right strategy to repair its partnership with France's Renault (PA:REN), the sources told Reuters.
The pressure intensified on Thursday when Nissan, which has had a year of turmoil since the arrest and sacking of long-time leader Carlos Ghosn, posted its first quarterly net loss in nearly a decade and slashed its annual profit forecast.
One of the people familiar with the intentions of some on Nissan's 10-member board said an assessment of Uchida's efforts and a decision on his future would likely be made toward the middle of the year.
""Probation is more or less the right way to describe the situation Uchida is faced with, if not more serious,"" the source said this week. 
""In the worst-case scenario he could be shown the door.""
Uchida referred Reuters queries to Nissan about whether he had just months to demonstrate he could turn the carmaker around, whether board members were satisfied with his work, and his relationship with other senior executives.
The company rejected suggestions of Uchida's uncertain circumstances as having ""no factual basis"". ""Effectively or otherwise, Uchida is absolutely not on probation,"" a Yokohama-based spokesman added. ""There does not exist such a concept or system within Nissan to put a CEO on probation. He is CEO.""
Some supporters also stressed that Uchida has only been in the top job for little more than two months, while Nissan's business has been in decline since 2017. Executives and analysts have previously said the company's current woes are not of Uchida's making, but are the fallout from an aggressive and poorly executed global expansion under Ghosn and Uchida's predecessor Hiroto Saikawa.
""Nissan is on the right path for recovery ... although it might be a gradual process,"" Uchida, formerly Nissan's China chief, said in a video message to employees in October, shortly after being named CEO.
ROCKY START
Still, it has been a difficult start for the new CEO, who officially took the helm at the beginning of December and must act swiftly to counter a slide in sales that is accelerating in key markets like the United States and China.
When he took the stage at corporate headquarters in Yokohama early that month, Uchida billed himself and his senior leaders - No. 2 Ashwani Gupta and No. 3 Jun Seki - as a tight ""one team"" that could deliver a bright new dawn for the automaker. 
Later in December, two board members sat down with Uchida - whose elevation has been opposed in some quarters - to tell him he needed to consult more with Seki and Gupta, stressing he had been given the top job on the condition that he worked closely with the pair, according to two of the sources.
The ""one team"" hasn't shown much unity, though.
Seki resigned in late December and joined electric motor producer Nidec Corp as president. 
Chief Operating Officer Gupta, meanwhile, has griped privately to colleagues about having a dysfunctional working relationship with the new CEO, according to two of the sources, but he is committed to work with Uchida to turn Nissan around. 
One source said the board would not brook internal squabbles or procrastination among Uchida, Gupta and the rest of the executive team: ""The biggest problem is nothing getting done, at a time when we need to take decisive actions."" 
Gupta referred Reuters queries to Nissan, which said Uchida and Gupta were ""cooperating closely, sharing information, and are engaged with executing the performance recovery plan and other reform moves, including fixed cost-cutting"".
UNRAVELING
Nissan, Japan's second-biggest automaker after Toyota (T:7203), faces an array of structural woes, from high fixed costs to weak management to a strained partnership with Renault, which began unraveling after Ghosn's arrest in late 2018. 
The problems come at a pivotal time when Nissan and other automakers are attempting to come to grips with a major, and costly, technological shift toward electric and self-driving vehicles. 
The carmaker posted a net loss of 26.1 billion yen ($238 million) for the October-December third quarter and it cut its annual operating profit forecast by 43% to 85 billion yen.
Though Nissan expects to report a small profit for the year ending in March, some executives are worried it could post a loss, according to the sources, especially given the fact that the forecast does not take into account the impact on sales in China and beyond from the coronavirus outbreak.
Uchida said, at the earnings media conference on Thursday, that Nissan was looking at the possibility of accelerating existing restructuring plans, as well as implementing additional measures - but he added the company would not be able to provide details of those extra steps until May.

(GRAPHIC - 2023 recovery goals: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/NISSAN-RESTRUCTURING/0H001R87MBLP/index.html)
'CRISIS MODE'
Uchida replaced Saikawa, who resigned in September after admitting to being improperly overpaid. His appointment was contentious, with some members of the board's six-strong nomination committee pushing for Seki or Gupta, according to two of the sources.
Seki, in fact, garnered the most first-choice votes - three - but not a majority, leading to another round where second preferences were taken into account, Uchida received five second-choice votes so won the job, the people said. 
By mid-January, however, some board members were starting to regret the decision, said the sources. While Uchida had touted a fresh start in his speech in December, he has still not publicly spelled out specifics on strategy.
Some members of the board complained that he was even sitting on some of the turnaround measures hammered out by Nissan executives last year, before he took the reins of the company, the sources said.
A team led by Seki, and charged with formulating a series of turnaround measures, had proposed effectively pulling out of Indonesia, where the Nissan group's market share fell below 2% in 2018, according to a separate source close to that team.
Under the plan, the company would ask partner Mitsubishi (T:7211), an SUV powerhouse in Southeast Asia, to contract-manufacture Nissan cars and help market them in Indonesia, the person said. 
When Uchida became CEO, however, he struck a cautious stance and made no decisions on that proposed pullout, though the idea has more recently began gaining momentum after much prodding by Uchida's subordinates and the board, according to the source.

In November, Seki's team also suggested Nissan go into a more intense ""crisis mode"", significantly stepping up spending cuts, including sizable reductions in year-end bonuses for top executives, said the source, adding that the proposals had not been implemented under Uchida.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2020 03:53PM ET</span>","U.S. peach grower awarded $265 million from Bayer, BASF in weedkiller lawsuit","(Reuters) - A Missouri jury's $265 million award to peach grower Bill Bader in his lawsuit against herbicide providers Bayer (DE:BAYGN) and BASF has raised the stakes for the two companies as at least 140 similar cases head to U.S. courts later this year.
A jury in U.S. District Court in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, handed Bader, the state's largest peach farmer, $15 million in actual and $250 million in punitive damages. He sued the companies saying his 1,000-acre orchard was irreparably harmed by herbicide that they produce, which drifted onto its trees from nearby farms.
The three-week trial was the first case in the United States to rule on the use of dicamba-based herbicides alleged to have damaged tens of thousands of acres of U.S. cropland. The herbicide can become a vapor and drift for miles when used in certain weather, farmers have claimed. 
Bayer said it was ""disappointed with the jury’s verdict,"" and plans to appeal. BASF also said it was “surprised and disappointed” by the decision and plans to appeal. Both companies said their dicamba-based herbicides are safe when used as directed. 
Bayer faces separate multi-billion-dollar litigation over the Roundup weedkiller made by  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), the U.S. firm it took over for $63 billion in 2018. Monsanto made Roundup and dicamba, and Bayer is being sued over both products. 
""We believe the evidence presented at trial demonstrated that Monsanto’s products were not responsible for the losses,"" Bayer said.
Bayer and BASF face other dicamba lawsuits that could begin late his year before the same judge in Missouri, said attorney Billy Randles, whose firm represented Bader and also represents dozens of others with similar claims. 
""These are all the same"" allegations, said Randles. ""They claim negligent design, failure to warn and all allege a joint venture"" between Bayer and BASF. The jury found the two equally liable for the damages. 
Bader Farms, in southern Missouri near the Arkansas border, said it lost many trees when the herbicide containing dicamba was used on nearby soybean and cotton farms and drifted onto its property. 
The farm said repeated dicamba exposure beginning in 2015 killed or weakened the fruit trees. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency imposed restrictions on the use of dicamba in November 2018 over concerns about potential damage to nearby crops.

""As long as dicamba is around, it’s not viable,"" Randles said of the orchard.

An announcement could come as soon as Monday, the source said, adding a deal has yet to be signed. 
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said Alstom is expected to buy the business using mostly cash and some stock.
Quebec pension giant Caisse de dépôt et placement, which owns a 32.5% stake in Bombardier's train unit, has agreed to sell its stake to Alstom and buy a minority stake in the combined train company, the WSJ report said.
Bombardier declined to comment on the report and Alstom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Canadian plane-and-train-maker has been struggling to contain higher rail costs generated by a few problematic contracts in its nearly $36 billion order backlog.

The deal would help Alstom compete more effectively against Chinese rail giant CRRC Corp Ltd (SS:601766), after the French maker of TGV bullet trains was blocked last year by European regulators from merging with Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn).

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2020 11:43AM ET</span>",Regulators should allow RTL and ProSieben to merge: Rabe,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - The head of publisher  Bertelsmann  (F:BTGGg) said its TV arm RTL (DE:RRTL) should be allowed to merge with German rival ProSiebenSat.1 (DE:PSMGn), to give them a fighting chance against U.S. streaming giants.
Thomas Rabe's comments - in an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung published on Sunday - come as European broadcasters explore ways to join forces against the onslaught from established players Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime that are now being joined by Disney and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
""It is vital that sensible partnerships, and even large mergers, are allowed in order to create national champions in television - for example between RTL and ProSiebenSat.1,"" Rabe said.
""Otherwise, national companies will simply have no chance in a few years against the giants from Silicon Valley,"" added the Bertelsmann boss, who took personal charge over its largest unit RTL last year.
ProSieben has become the focus of takeover speculation after Italy's  Mediaset  (MI:MS) amassed a 15.1% stake in the Munich-based broadcaster towards the end of last year.
Mediaset, run by the son of former premier Silvio Berlusconi, has described its ProSieben stake as defensive. At the same time it is trying to persuade ProSieben CEO Max Conze to join a pan-European broadcasting alliance it is setting up.
Conze has so far resisted Mediaset's overtures, preferring to search for ways to cooperate on individual projects.
Reacting to Rabe's comments, ProSieben said: ""No talks are taking place at the moment on mergers or acquisitions.""
In a statement, ProSieben highlighted work on its adtech joint venture with RTL, called d-force, and repeated its earlier invitation to RTL to sign up to Joyn, its streaming venture with U.S. partner Discovery Inc (O:DISCA).
Rabe, in his FAS interview, said it was vital to deregulate the European TV industry because the rules governing it predate the creation of platforms such as YouTube, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix.
""Competition law does not take into account the forms in which the U.S. platforms are increasingly coming to dominate the media and advertising,"" he said.
Although he was wearing two hats as the boss of both Bertelsmann and RTL, Rabe said that did not signify the parent company would increase its 75% stake in the TV unit, nor would it seek a delisting.

""RTL Group is and will remain an independent business,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government is considering whether to stop  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co from continuing to supply engines for a new Chinese passenger jet, according to people familiar with the matter, casting uncertainty over China's efforts to enter the civil aviation market.
The potential restriction on the engine sales - possibly along with limits on other components for Chinese commercial aircraft such as flight control systems made by Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) - is the latest move in the battle between the world's two largest economies over trade and technology. 
The issue is expected to come up at an interagency meeting about how strictly to limit exports of U.S. technology to China on Thursday and at another meeting with members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet set for Feb. 28, sources said.
The White House and the U.S. Commerce Department, which issues licenses for such exports, declined to comment, as did a GE spokeswoman. The departments of Defense, State, Energy and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. 
For years, the United States has supported American companies' business with China's budding civil aviation industry.
The government has provided licenses that allow those companies to sell engines, flight control systems and other components for China's first large commercial aircraft, the COMAC C919. The narrow-body jet has already engaged in test flights and is expected to go into service next year. COMAC is an acronym for Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
But the Trump administration is weighing whether to deny GE's latest license request to provide the CFM LEAP-1C engine for the C919, people familiar with the matter said, though GE has received licenses for the LEAP engines since 2014 and was last granted one in March 2019. 
The CFM LEAP engine is a joint venture between GE and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) Aircraft Engines. The proposal to halt the deliveries of the engines was also reported on Saturday by the Wall Street Journal.
Safran did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and French government officials could not be reached for comment.
Aside from aircraft engines, flight control systems are up for discussion at the February meetings. Honeywell International has received licenses to export flight control systems to COMAC for the C919 for about a decade, and one was approved in early 2020, according to a person familiar with the matter.
But future permission for such sales for COMAC's passenger aircrafts may be up for debate. Honeywell also has been seeking a license for flight control technology to participate in the development of the C929, China’s planned wide-body jet venture with Russia, the person said. 
The flight control system operates moving mechanical parts, such as the wing flaps, from the cockpit.
A spokeswoman for Honeywell declined to comment.
An aerospace trade group official said his organization would like to weigh in on any policy shifts.
""If there are any changes, we would hope they would engage with us, as they’ve done before,"" said Remy Nathan, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association.
At the heart of the debate over a possible crackdown on the sale of U.S. parts to China's nascent aircraft industry is whether such shipments would fuel the rise of a serious competitor to U.S.-based Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co or boost China's military capabilities. 
People familiar with the matter said some administration officials are concerned the Chinese could reverse engineer some items, though others say an abundance of LEAP engines in China has not brought that about to date. 
If the United States were to move ahead with the measure, one person familiar with the matter said, China could retaliate by ordering more planes from Airbus SE, rather than crisis-hit Boeing, which relies on China for a fourth its deliveries.

The Trump administration's meetings about technology issues also are set to include a discussion of whether to impose further restrictions on suppliers to Huawei Technologies, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which is on a U.S. trade blacklist.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A U.S. trade panel preliminarily ruled in favor of South Korean electric vehicle (EV) battery maker LG Chem (KS:051910) which had accused crosstown rival  SK Innovation  (KS:096770) of misappropriating trade secrets, the companies said on Sunday.
LG Chem and SK Innovation have hit each other with U.S. lawsuits for thefts of trade secrets and patent infringements in a bitter row that threatens to disrupt the launches of EVs by some of the world's biggest car makers.
The so-called default judgment by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) could potentially mean SK Innovation, as sought by LG Chem, cannot import some battery products, components and materials it may need to supply its U.S. factories for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford Motors (N:F).
The ITC is set to make a final ruling in the case on Oct. 5, LG Chem said in a statement.
In a statement, SK Innovation expressed ""regret"" at the ruling which it said ""had not fully acknowledged arguments from SK Innovation"".
""SK Innovation plans to present objections according to prescribed legal proceedings after reviewing the court decision.""
Details of the ruling are expected be available in the coming days.
SK Innovation is building a nearly $1.7 billion battery factory in Georgia to serve Volkswagen's EV factory in neighboring Tennessee, with production set to begin in 2022. The battery maker is also considering another factory in Georgia possibly supplying Ford's electric pick-up trucks.
SK Innovation currently makes batteries for Kia Motors' (KS:000270) Niro electric crossovers, which are made in Korea and exported to the United States.
Automakers are scrambling to lock in supplies of batteries, which are the most expensive and critical part of EVs, to meet increasingly stringent emissions rules and rising consumer demand."
1657,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>","Europe can win global battle for industrial data, says EU industry chief","By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - Europe may have lost the battle to create digital champions capable of taking on U.S. and Chinese companies harvesting personal data, but it can win the war of industrial data, Europe's industry policy chief said on Saturday.
Vast troves of data from how fast we drive our cars to how much time a robot needs to churn out products will open a new front in the battle for digital dominance, said Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner in charge of the bloc's single market.
Alarmed by the dominance of U.S. and Chinese tech companies such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Huawei, the European Commission is leaving behind the ""laissez-faire"" attitude of the early 2000s and ratcheting up regulatory pressure to protect its businesses.
The new approach will be on display on Wednesday when Breton unveils the bloc's new data and artificial intelligence strategy. 
""We're entering a new phase. The battle for industrial data starts now, and the main battlefield will be Europe,"" Breton, a former French finance minister, told Reuters in an interview. 
Breton said the EU had a unique opportunity to win the next phase of the digital revolution centered on the harvesting, management and analysis of data from factories, transport, energy and healthcare. 
""Europe is the world's top industrial continent. The United States have lost much of their industrial know-how in the last phase of globalisation. They have to gradually rebuild it. China has added-value handicaps it is correcting,"" Breton said.
""But the bulk of the industrial value chain, from large groups to SMEs, is based in Europe today. That's why all eyes are on Europe right now,"" he added.
MORE ASSERTIVE 
The commissioner, who was speaking from the Munich security conference where he met the chief executive of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) before meeting Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg in Brussels on Monday, is keen for Europe to take a more assertive approach.
""In this sector, tomorrow's winners won't necessarily be today's winners,"" he said, adding that the big cloud platforms that exist today will probably be replaced by more decentralized and secure ""mini-clouds"".
A former CEO of French IT giant Atos and telecoms group Orange, Breton said the European Commission would unveil a three-pronged approach on Wednesday, consisting of tighter regulations, infrastructure investment and sector-specific strategies.
Reuters exclusively reported on Jan 29 a 25-page draft document outlining the measures to create a single market in data, that could still be tweaked ahead of the Feb. 19 presentation.
It will include an array of new rules covering cross-border data use, data interoperability and standards. 
The document also proposes scrapping competition rules which hinder data sharing and possibly introducing rules to prevent large online platforms from unilaterally imposing conditions for access.
Europe will remain open to non-European companies but wants to use the heft of its industrial base to set its own rules before other continents do, Breton said.

""Europe is not naive, it can very well see what's going on. That's why we have to organize ourselves now, including when it comes to the deployment of the first 5G networks,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Vodafone  Idea Ltd said on Saturday it was assessing how much it would pay the Indian government as part of dues owed and said it proposed making a payment in the next few days.
India ordered mobile carriers on Friday to immediately pay billions of dollars in dues after the Supreme Court threatened the companies and officials with contempt proceedings for failing to implement an earlier ruling.
The move threatens the survival of Vodafone Idea, a joint venture between Britain's Vodafone Group (LON:VOD) Plc and India's Idea Cellular, as the unit is saddled with about $3.9 billion in overdue payments.
""The Company is currently assessing the amount that it will be able to pay to DoT (Department of Telecommunications) toward the dues calculated,"" Vodafone said in a statement. ""The Company proposes to pay the amount so assessed in the next few days.""
Vodafone did not give details of the amount it was likely to pay. A company spokesman declined to provide details on funding for the payment.
Underscoring its vulnerability, the company said its ability to continue essentially hinged on the Supreme Court granting it permission to discuss issues like timelines for payments with the government.
Analysts have increasingly called into doubt the viability of Vodafone Idea. Vodafone Group has said it has no plans to commit any more equity into India and the Indian telco has clocked losses in the last six quarters due to intense competition.
""Recent developments raise serious concerns about Vodafone Idea's survival,"" Rajiv Sharma, analyst with SBI Cap Securities, said in a note on Friday.
Some analysts predict that India's large market will likely have only two telecom players - Airtel and Reliance Jio, which is backed by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani - if the government does not intervene to provide some relief.
""We believe this makes duopoly almost certain in the absence of government intervention. Chances of government intervention are slim, but it cannot be ruled out,"" Pranav Kshatriya of Edelweiss said.
Bharti Airtel said on Friday it would pay 100 billion rupees to the government by Thursday, while it would pay the rest before the next Supreme Court hearing on March 17.
""We see this event as a net positive for Bharti Airtel (Bharti) as although it will have to pay 356 billion rupees toward liabilities, the decimation of (a) weak operator will significantly enhance its market share,"" Kshatriya said."

LONDON (Reuters) - German fund manager Allianz Global Investors is pushing every company it invests in to improve their climate-related disclosures ahead of the season for annual shareholder meetings.
Allianz GI, which manages 557 billion euros ($605.18 billion) as part of insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG), said it had updated its Global Corporate Governance Guidelines and would push companies to do more to manage what it said was a critical risk.
Specifically, it wants every company to use the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework for assessing the impact of climate risk on their business, an initiative kick-started by the Financial Stability Board.
Now with more than 1,000 signatories globally, the TCFD - championed by the United Nations' incoming climate finance envoy, Mark Carney - is seen by many as a crucial tool in helping investors make more informed decisions on climate risk.
Eugenia Unanyants-Jackson, AllianzGI's global head of research into environmental, social and governance-related issues, said she expects to see more shareholder resolutions linked to climate change in 2020, with a broadening out from energy companies to other sectors such as financial services.
British lender  Barclays  (L:BARC) last month became the first European bank to face the prospect of such a vote, in an action coordinated by responsible investment lobby group ShareAction, although pressure is building on peers globally.
""We will... show our support for proposals that seek to hold companies to account, through transparent information sharing, on climate related financial, physical, transition and regulatory risks and how the company is managing those risks.""
In a review of its voting practices in 2019, AllianzGI said it had voted on nearly 100,000 resolutions - from pay to board composition and strategy - at 9,532 company meetings and opposed 24% of all resolutions globally, unchanged on the prior year.
AllianzGI supported all of the climate-linked shareholder resolutions at its U.S. investee companies as they had all targeted companies for which climate was a material business risk, seeking information or the formulation of plans to align strategy with the Paris climate accord.
""Those kind of proposals are definitely in the interest of investors and are something we like, support and encourage,"" Unanyants-Jackson said.
After 145 climate-linked resolutions were filed in the United States last year - including at leading oil company ExxonMobil (N:XOM) - the U.S. regulator is mulling plans to limit their future use in a move that has drawn the ire of some leading investors.

""We will enter the first talks soon with the European works council,"" Airbus Defence and Space chief Dirk Hoke told Reuters in an interview cleared for publication on Saturday, adding that negotiations would then take place at national level.
Recurring technical problems with the A400M led the German air force to refuse delivery of two of the aircraft last autumn.
The group has also taken a 1.2 billion euro ($1.3 billion) charge on the worsening sales outlook, with a German ban on defense exports to Saudi Arabia causing Airbus Defence and Space to lose a promising potential customer, said Hoke.
German-headquartered Airbus Defence and Space, formed in 2014 as part of a broader restructuring, employs 34,000 staff - 13,000 of them in Germany - and contributes around a fifth of revenues to parent group Airbus.
""The works councils know that I will fight to keep every job I can. We won't come with disproportionate numbers,"" Hoke said.
Job cuts would depend on capacity utilization and project pipeline at different facilities: ""Here I have to tell local politicians that the guarantees to keep plants open that many of them demand depend on projects.""
Hoke expressed optimism over the prospects for a project to develop joint next-generation Franco-German fighter jets and military drones after German lawmakers allocated nearly 80 billion euros for the test phase of the project.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday said it would increase tariffs on aircraft imported from the European Union to 15% from 10%, ratcheting up pressure on Brussels in a nearly 16-year transatlantic dispute over aircraft subsidies.
The U.S. Trade Representative's Office said it remained open to reaching a negotiated settlement with the EU on the issue, but could revise its actions if the EU imposed tariffs of its own in connection with a pair of disputes over the subsidies.
In a statement released late on Friday, USTR said it would make minor modifications to 25% tariffs imposed on cheese, wine and other non-aircraft products from the EU, including dropping prune juice from the list. It did not raise the tariff rates on those product, as it had suggested it might do in October.
The higher aircraft tariff will take effect March 18.
The U.S. action comes as U.S. President Donald Trump, emboldened by agreement on a Phase 1 trade deal with China, has trained his sights on restructuring the more than $1 trillion U.S.-EU trade relationship, raising the specter of another major trade war as the global economy slows.
EU officials have said they want to negotiate with Washington but will not be bullied into submission.
European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) said the U.S. move would hit U.S. airlines already facing a shortage of aircraft and complicate efforts to reach a negotiated settlement with the European Union in the longstanding dispute.
Airbus said it would continue discussions with U.S. customers to ""mitigate effects of tariffs insofar as possible"" and hoped USTR would change its position, particularly given the threat of EU tariffs on U.S. products in its own case before the World Trade Organization.
""USTR's decision ignores the many submissions made by U.S. airlines, highlighting the fact that they – and the U.S. flying public – ultimately have to pay these tariffs,"" the company said in a statement.
EU officials had no immediate comment on Friday's news.
The USTR had announced in December that it could increase tariff rates up to 100% and subject additional EU products to tariffs, following a decision by the WTO that EU launch aid to Airbus continued to harm the U.S. aerospace industry.
The WTO in October had awarded Washington the right to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of annual EU imports in its case against Airbus. Washington then slapped 10% tariffs on most European-made Airbus jets and 25% duties on products ranging from cheese to olives and single-malt whisky, from Oct. 18.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), in a statement, said it was working with U.S. federal and state officials to ""promptly bring the United States into full compliance"" with WTO rulings.
""The EU and Airbus could end these tariffs by finally complying with their legal obligations, ending these illegal subsidies, and addressing their ongoing harm. We hope they will,"" the company said in a statement.
The Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America (WSWA) said it remains strongly opposed to tariffs on European-origin wine and spirits, and urged U.S. and EU trade officials to negotiate an end to a trade dispute that was lowering revenues.
A study commissioned by the group estimated that the 25% tariffs implemented in October could result in the loss of nearly 36,000 jobs in the beverage alcohol industry.
The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said tit-for-tat tariffs on alcoholic beverages were hurting companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. 
It said new U.S. government data showed the U.S. spirit industry's exports to the EU, its largest export market, fell 27% in 2019 from a year earlier, and global exports of American whiskey declined 16% in the same period.

""We urge both sides to resolve these disputes so that consumers can enjoy #ToastsNotTariffs,"" the group said.

The foodmakers had agreed in August to pay the penalty to CFTC to settle a wheat manipulation case dating back to 2015, in a deal in which both the firms and the regulator agreed to a gag order.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Friday said it has taken a $549.1 million stake in Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, investing in the largest U.S. supermarket chain as smaller rivals struggle.
In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed investments as of Dec. 31, Berkshire also said it took a new 648,000 share stake in drugmaker Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) worth $192.4 million, and significantly reduced its stakes in two major banks,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Berkshire has sold more than 86 million shares, or 21%, of its Wells Fargo stake since June 30, as the bank tries to restore its reputation following scandals over its mistreatment of customers.
Since the scandals began erupting in September 2016, the Standard & Poor's 500 has risen 55%, while Wells Fargo is down 3%. Berkshire began investing in Wells Fargo in 1989.
Kroger shares rose 3.9% and Biogen rose 1.5% in after-hours trading, a sign of investors' regard for Buffett and the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he has run since 1965.
Investors monitor Berkshire's quarterly filings to see where Buffett and his portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who is also chief executive of Berkshire's Geico car insurer, see value.
Friday's filing does not say who bought or sold particular stocks, though Buffett normally directs big investments such as Wells Fargo and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Berkshire's largest.
Buffett's assistant, along with Kroger and Biogen, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Kroger, in which Berkshire disclosed an 18.94 million share stake, has invested heavily to expand online, upgrade stores and improve deliveries to compete with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the latter also a Berkshire holding.
Many smaller chains have fared worse, and Earth Fare, Fairway and Lucky's have sought bankruptcy protection this year. Kroger had invested in Lucky's.
Berkshire's Wells Fargo stake fell 15% in the quarter to 323.2 million shares worth $17.4 billion, trailing its stakes in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP).
The Goldman stake shrank 35% to 12 million shares worth $2.8 billion. That stake had its origins in Buffett's lucrative foray into Goldman preferred stock during the 2008 financial crisis.
Berkshire also has more than 90 operating units including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and namesake energy, real estate brokerage and auto dealer businesses.
Friday's filing suggests Berkshire's stock buying did not significantly dent its $128.2 billion cash hoard from Sept. 30.

Berkshire should discuss its holdings more on Feb. 22, when it releases its annual report and Buffett's annual letter to shareholders.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Friday found Michael Avenatti guilty in a criminal trial accusing the celebrity lawyer of trying to extort  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) out of millions of dollars and defraud a youth basketball coach he represented.
Jurors in Manhattan federal court needed 2-1/2 days to decide the fate of Avenatti, a brash lawyer all but unknown until two years ago when he began representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against U.S. President Donald Trump and making hundreds of television appearances.
Avenatti, 48, who positioned his chair so he could face the jurors during his 2-1/2-week trial, stared at them as the verdict was read. He could get more than 40 years in prison at his scheduled June 17 sentencing.
""Of course there will be an appeal, yes,"" Avenatti's lawyer Scott Srebnick told reporters after the verdict.
Avenatti also faces scheduled criminal trials this spring in Manhattan on charges he defrauded Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and in California on charges he defrauded several other clients and lied to the Internal Revenue Service.
He has been jailed in Manhattan since Jan. 17 after California prosecutors said he violated his bail conditions.
Avenatti shook hands with and got a pat on the back from members of his legal team following Friday's verdict, before a court officer led him away.
The defendant was convicted of trying to shake down Nike by threatening to hold a press conference to discuss allegations the sports apparel company made illegal payments to families of college basketball recruits.
Prosecutors said Avenatti told Nike he could wipe billions of dollars off its market value, but would keep quiet if it paid him and another lawyer up to $25 million to conduct an internal probe, and paid the coach Gary Franklin $1.5 million.
Avenatti was also convicted of defrauding Franklin by not telling him he was demanding a probe before agreeing to settle.
Prosecutors said Avenatti wanted a big payday to cover at least $11 million of his own debts.
Avenatti's trial included multiple recordings of his negotiations with Nike's lawyers. Franklin testified for prosecutors that he did not want a probe or press conference.
""The jury clearly saw the defendant's scheme for what it was - an old fashioned shakedown,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement.

USTR said it remained open to reaching a negotiated settlement with the EU on the issue, but could revise its actions if the EU imposed tariffs of its own in connection with a pair of disputes over aircraft subsidies.
In a statement released late on Friday, USTR said it would rotate additional 25% tariffs to different non-aircraft products from the EU, but would not raise the tariff rate, as it had suggested it might do in October."

SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) told the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration it does not believe it needs to separate or move wiring bundles on its grounded 737 MAX jetliner that regulators have warned could short circuit with catastrophic consequences, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The FAA confirmed Friday it had received a proposal from the planemaker regarding the wiring issue.
The FAA will ""rigorously evaluate Boeing's proposal to address a recently discovered wiring issue with the 737 MAX. The manufacturer must demonstrate compliance with all certification standards,"" the agency said in a statement.
The U.S. planemaker and FAA first said in early January they were reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the 737 MAX, and under certain circumstances lead to a crash if pilots did not react in time.
A Boeing spokesman referred all questions on wiring to the FAA, saying the agency would make the final decision and that the company is answering questions from the FAA.
Boeing's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide last March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months.
Boeing has spent months updating the stall-prevention software known as MCAS linked to both crashes, but fresh issues have surfaced, complicating regulators' efforts to re-approve the plane.
Given intense scrutiny of the 737 MAX, Boeing is sure to face questions about whether the MCAS system makes it harder for pilots to react in the event of a short circuit. 
There are more than a dozen different locations on the 737 MAX where wiring bundles may be too close together. Most of the locations are under the cockpit in an electrical bay.
If the bundles pose a potential hazard, regulations would typically require separating the bundles or adding a physical barrier. 
Boeing has noted in talks with the FAA that the same wiring bundles are in the 737 NG, which has been in service since 1997 and logged 205 million flight hours without any wiring issues.
New safety rules on wiring were adopted in the aftermath of the 1998 Swiss Air 111 crash.
A company official told Reuters last month Boeing had been working on a design that would separate the wiring bundles, if necessary. Moving the bundles could pose further delays to the return of the MAX, however, and Reuters reported Thursday that a key certification test flight was not expected until April or later. 
Three U.S. airlines this week pushed back the resumption of 737 MAX flights from June until August or later. Boeing has estimated U.S. officials would lift a safety ban on the aircraft around mid-year.

It is unclear whether the European Union Aviation Safety Agency will demand the MAX wiring bundles be separated. A spokeswoman for the agency on Thursday said regulators were ""waiting for additional information from Boeing.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Friday it has established a dispute resolution office and complaint hotline to enforce President Donald Trump's ""Phase 1"" trade deal with China, which takes effect on Saturday.
Deputy USTR Jeffrey Gerrish will head the new office, which will field complaints about China's implementation of the agreement from companies and other interested parties, the agency said in a statement.
""Interested parties may raise their concerns about implementation matters under the Phase One agreement by calling 202-395-3900,"" USTR said.
Both the United States and China are opening such dispute resolution offices under the deal's enforcement provisions. The Trump administration has claimed that this mechanism is what differentiates the agreement from past pledges by China to change its trade and intellectual property practices.
The Phase 1 deal includes wide-ranging provisions https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf that will be subject to bilateral consultations if one side believes the other is not in compliance.
China has pledged to increase purchases of U.S. goods by $200 billion over the next two years, although its ability to meet those targets has been called into question by the coronavirus outbreak that has shut factories and transport.
Beijing also has agreed in the Phase 1 deal to improve protection of American intellectual property, curb the forced and coerced transfer of U.S. technology to Chinese firms, open its financial services to U.S. competition, remove some agriculture trade barriers and refrain from currency manipulation.
Washington has agreed to halve the tariff rate on a $120 billion list of U.S. goods, including Bluetooth headphones, smart speakers, flat-panel televisions and footwear, to 7.5% after suspending a new round of tariffs on cell phones and other consumer goods in December.
Under the dispute settlement process, the two sides will hold a series of escalating consultations over a 90-day period. If disagreements cannot be resolved by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the complaining party will be able to impose new tariffs in an amount equal to the estimated damage from the complaint.
The other party can accept the punitive tariffs or quit the agreement.
Some trade experts have said that U.S. companies doing business in China may be reluctant to lodge complaints with the new office, fearing that the Chinese government will put new pressures on them.

A new U.S.-China Business Council survey https://www.uschina.org/sites/default/files/phase_one_trade_agreement_member_survey.pdf showed this week that just 22% of member companies said they were likely or very likely to use the new mechanism, with 20% unlikely and 48% unsure.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 07:12PM ET</span>",SEC proposes adding more stock price information to market data feeds,"By Katanga Johnson and John McCrank
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed on Friday to add more stock price information to public market data feeds and allow other firms to compete against the exchanges in running them.
The data is related to systems called securities information processors, or SIPs, which consolidate stock orders and last sales prices from the 13 U.S. stock exchanges. Regulators use the information to determine the best market prices, which brokers must give their clients when executing trades.
The data feeds show current best prices and last trades for stocks. 
The SEC proposal seeks to add so-called ""depth of book"" information to the SIPs that includes prices of stocks available in the pubic market that are below the best bid and above the best offer available. 
Most exchanges offer depth of book data as a proprietary, fee-based service. The agency measure would give many market participants a fuller view into buying and selling interest in the market.
Brokers and trading firms have long complained that the exchanges are conflicted in their role as SIP providers -- and have little incentive to improve them -- because they sell products that compete against the public feeds.
Friday's proposal, which is subject to public consultation, could help ease the conflict of interest. It could also pressure the market data revenues of exchanges, such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc's New York Stock Exchange, and Nasdaq Inc, as the SIP could become more competitive with the exchanges' proprietary market data feeds.
In a statement, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said the measure was ""designed to improve data quality and data access for all market participants.""
""Both the content and the technologies used to collect, consolidate and disseminate market data have lagged meaningfully behind proprietary data products and systems offered by the exchanges,"" he said.
The SEC on Jan. 8 proposed a series of governance changes to the SIPs aimed at improving transparency and addressing inefficiencies in the collection and dissemination of the data.

The proposal, currently open to a public comment period, directs the exchanges to create a new governance plan that would form a single plan for the three public data feeds, reduce the influence of large exchange groups in decision-making around the data, and give non-exchange participants a bigger say in SIP decisions.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>",Southwest workers group seeks mediation for stalled contract talks,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The union representing Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co's passenger service and reservation employees said on Friday it was seeking federal mediation to help contract negotiations after two years of talks.
Budget-friendly Southwest spent seven years in contract negotiations with a separate union that represents its mechanics before reaching an agreement last year.
Now, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), representing 7,852 Southwest workers, has invoked its right to mediation with the National Mediation Board.
""While many contract issues remain unresolved, the one issue that has completely derailed negotiations is Southwest's treatment of its employees,"" IAM said in a statement, citing demands that employees return to work after their shift has ended, forcing overtime.
Instead, IAM said the airline should properly staff its operation.
In an emailed statement, Southwest's labor relations vice president, Russell McCrady, called the union's mediation filing ""the next logical step to promptly find solutions to a few remaining items.""
Under the current contract, Southwest can call for mandatory overtime when necessary, a standard practice in the airline industry, McCrady said, but added that currently mandatory overtime ""accounts for a historically-low one percent of total hours worked by this group.""
He said the company has proposed changes during negotiations that would further reduce that percentage and protect employees' days off. 
Under the Railway Labor Act, the law governing labor relations in the airline industry, a company or union must seek federal mediation for help in resolving negotiations before taking other action. 
Analysts have highlighted labor issues as a major concern for airlines this year, in addition to rising fuel costs and the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jets after two fatal crashes.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc reached a tentative joint collective bargaining agreement with its mechanics last month after years of bitter negotiations and is in talks with its pilots and flight attendants.
Early contract talks between Southwest and its pilots union are due to begin the first week of March, a spokesman for the union said.
Southwest's negotiations with its mechanics union, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, were fraught with flight disruptions and legal disputes. Although a contract was reached, litigation is still ongoing.
On Thursday the mechanics union said it was ""sadly not surprised"" by a federal watchdog report this week that faulted Southwest and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on safety, prompting some lawmakers to call for improvements.

Southwest has disputed the findings.

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 06:25PM ET</span>","American, United push back 737 MAX return amid new approval delays","By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) are pushing back the return of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX flights until August and September, respectively, a fresh delay that comes after sources told Reuters that the timing of a key certification flight may not occur until at least April.
American is cancelling 737 MAX flights until Aug. 18 and United until Sept. 4, the two said in separate statements on Friday. The other U.S. 737 MAX operator, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), has extended its flight cancellations until Aug. 10.
The new timelines mean that the three carriers will be flying without the 737 MAX for the second straight U.S. summer, an issue that hit their profits during last year's peak travel season. 
Boeing's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide last March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.
The U.S. planemaker has spent months updating software believed to have played a role in both crashes, but fresh issues have surfaced, complicating regulators' efforts to reapprove the plane.
The timing of a certification flight, a key step in the approval process, has been delayed repeatedly. The latest unofficial guidance was for the flight to happen this month, but now it is unlikely to occur while Boeing tries to resolve the new problems, sources said this week. 
American, Southwest and United had been planning to fly the jets in early June if regulators had approved the plane in the first quarter, but that now looks unlikely. 
One key issue yet to be resolved is whether Boeing must separate two wiring bundles that may be too close together, which could lead to a short circuit and crash if pilots do not respond appropriately.
Boeing has told the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration it does not believe it needs to separate wiring bundles, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Once regulators approve Boeing's fixes, airlines will still need around 30 days or longer to prepare their fleets and pilots before using the planes for commercial flight.
The longer the 737 MAX is grounded, the more Boeing will ultimately have to compensate its customers.
Boeing spent $1.4 billion on compensation for 737 MAX customers last year and Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said this week the company expects ""a good portion"" of additional settlements to take place this year.

Meanwhile, carriers including Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) that do not operate the 737 MAX are picking up travel demand that United, Southwest and American have been unable to meet given their reduced fleets.

The unit also oversees plans for several hundred leases belonging to state oil company Pemex.

The former employees are under investigation and the supervision of contracts will not be affected, the statement said.
Foreign and private oil companies have to date invested about $3.6 billion in their contracts since the first auctions were launched in 2015, according to CNH data, following a landmark energy reform two years earlier that ended Pemex's decades-long monopoly.
About 30 of the contracts won at auction are already in the production phase.

For 2019, Citigroup reported returns on tangible common equity of 12.1%, beating its 12% target. Though the biggest U.S. banks largely reported a year of strong top and bottom line growth, executive compensation remained subdued as bank boards have become more cost-conscious reflecting a weaker revenue outlook.  Morgan Stanley's (N:MS) board made the rare move of cutting CEO James Gorman's pay by 7% to $27 million for 2019 in an effort to reduce expenses.  Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan's pay package was flat from a year ago and JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) board gave CEO Jamie Dimon just a half-million-dollar raise, following a $2 million dollar raise the year before. 
A year earlier, Corbat enjoyed a 4.35% raise, bringing his total compensation for 2018 to $24 million. In 2018, the bank exceeded its goal for returns on investment but fell short of its efficiency target due to revenue pressure at the end of the year.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors bet emerging markets will weather coronavirus impact,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are edging back into emerging markets, even though worries about the coronavirus' impact on global economic growth have clouded prospects for the boom-and-bust asset class.
Nearly $730 million flowed back into emerging markets exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the past week, according to Lipper, after two straight weeks of outflows that accompanied sharp declines in the stocks and currencies of developing countries.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MSCIEF), which measures stock performance, has rebounded 4% from its early February low, though it remains down on the year. Another index measuring emerging markets currency performance (MIEM00000CUS) was still sharply lower, reflecting the slide in a range of currencies from Asia to Latin America.
As of Friday, the coronavirus has infected 63,581 people and killed 1,380. Still, investors have grown more hopeful that economic damage will be limited. 
Before the outbreak, emerging markets stocks had steadily climbed since early December as analysts forecast a re-acceleration of global economic growth and the United States and China agreed on a Phase 1 trade deal. Chinese equities make up roughly a third of the weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
Emerging markets ETFs have seen a steady stream of money pouring in since late October and have not had outflows on a monthly basis, Lipper data showed.
(Graphic - Emerging markets go with the flow: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS-WEEKAHEAD/0H001R8BRBX3/eikon.png)
""The valuations are really compelling, and we were seeing signs of an economic recovery,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management. ""Once the coronavirus is put on pause, I think that will become the primary trend again.""
Phipps, who did not hold emerging markets stocks, has added them so that they now make up about 6% of his portfolio. A weaker dollar would likely compel him to boost that position, he said. 
Should the currency decline, countries that have borrowed in dollars would find it easier to service their debt.
Other financial institutions, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and UBS Global Wealth Management, are also sanguine on the prospects for emerging markets in 2020, even though the asset class has underperformed U.S. stocks for more than a decade.
(Graphic - Tough decade for emerging markets: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2148/2116/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Emerging markets stocks have been more resilient of late in large part because they have languished for so long, said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors.
""There's not really a case to sell them, because they're already massively under-owned,"" he said.
Options activity also points to investor resilience. The gap between the Cboe Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index (VXEEM) and the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), seen as an indicator of investor risk aversion, was 3.6 points on Friday afternoon. That compares with a 7.25-point gap in May 2019, when trade tensions between the United States and China were near their peak.
(Graphic - Coronavirus fear contained in EM stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS-WEEKAHEAD/0H001R8BTBX9/eikon.png)
The economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in unknown. Some analysts have estimated that China's yearly gross domestic product growth could fall to between 4% and 5%, down from the 6% annual growth the Chinese government previously estimated.
But some investors expect the shortfall in growth to be largely contained to the first quarter, which would give China's economy room to catch up later this year.

""It's a relatively short-term factor,"" said Jim Besaw, chief investment officer at GenTrust. ""We probably won't be talking about it in April and May.""

The disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.
If each hedge fund had held on to its stake, Bridgewater's purchase of nearly 45,000 shares would be worth approximately $36 million, while Viking's purchase of nearly 52,000 shares would be would be worth slightly more than $42 million. Granite Pointe purchased 3,000 shares in the fourth quarter, which would now be worth approximately $2.5 million.
Mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price, meanwhile, revealed that it had doubled its stake in the company in the fourth quarter, to 1.7 million shares.
The moves into Tesla came as the high tech automaker remained among the most divisive stocks on Wall Street.

(Reuters) - Luxury department store operator Saks Fifth Avenue, owned by Canada's Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC), is expanding into bankrupt fashion chain Barneys' Beverly Hills shop, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The move comes ahead of a shareholder vote later this month to approve Hudson's Bay Executive Chairman Richard Baker's C$2 billion ($1.51 billion) bid to take the retailer private. As a private company, Hudson's Bay will be able to invest in its business without facing scrutiny from public shareholders.
The company's shares fell by almost one-half in the year before Baker announced his bid, but have since risen more than 40%.
Barneys filed for bankruptcy last year due in part to rent hikes. Saks will use some form of the Barneys brand at the Beverly Hills store, according to people familiar with its plans.
The expansion of Saks into the Barneys' location will give the upscale department store three stores on Wilshire Boulevard: its men store, a department store and the third spot in Barneys. It is not yet clear if Hudson's Bay will keep all three locations, the sources said.
Hudson's Bay currently operates 41 Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 114 Saks Off 5th discount locations.
Brand development company Authentic Brands Group LLC bought the Barneys brand and other intellectual property out of bankruptcy last year for about $271 million. Reuters reported that Authentic Brands plans to license the Barneys brand to Saks, setting up plans to open shops in the department store's locations across the United States and Canada.
In a government notice this week, Barneys said it was permanently closing its flagship store on Manhattan's Madison Avenue and its outlet at the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, New York. It filed a similar notice for its California shops in San Francisco and Beverly Hills.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Google on Friday attacked what it called an eye-catching 2.4 billion euro ($2.6 billion) EU antitrust fine, prompting a judge to ask how a rich company can miss a relatively paltry amount.
The sparring underlines the battle ahead for the world’s most popular internet search engine, with two other challenges against EU antitrust enforcers to be heard in the coming months. 
The Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit argued that additional amounts tacked on to the fine imposed by the European Commission in 2017 to deter anti-competitive behavior known as a deterrent multiplier and another multiplier factor was excessive and unwarranted.
Google's challenge came on the final day of a three-day hearing at the General Court, Europe's second-highest, as it attempts to overturn the first of a trio of EU antitrust penalties totaling 8.25 billion euros.
""2.4 billion euros is an eye-catching amount, it might attract the headlines but it is not justified by the actual facts of this case,"" Christopher Thomas, Google's lawyer, told judges.
He said there should not have been a fine in the first place as existing case law showed that Google's behavior was not anti-competitive while its market shares and the 13 countries where the infringement was committed did not justify the size of the multiplier.
The Commission used a gravity multiplier between 5% and 20% to Google's 2016 turnover in the 13 EU countries, higher than the 5% levied on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in 2009. EU laws allow for regulators to apply a multiplier of up to 30%.
EU antitrust regulators should also have taken into account the company's efforts to settle the case with concessions before they changed tack in 2015 and sanctioned Google, Thomas said.
""Credit should be given for Google's good faith attempts to find a solution to the Commission's concerns with its three commitments offers and the almost 9 months engineering effort spent building that solution provisionally agreed with the Commission,"" he said.
Irish judge Colm Mac Eochaidh, one of the panel of five judges hearing the case and who had a day earlier said the company clearly committed an infraction, asked whether the size of the fine was as eye-catching as Google claimed.
""You are one of the richest companies in the world,"" he said, citing the example of someone with 120 euros and fined 2.4 euros for littering. 
""Would you miss the 2.4 euros?""
Mac Eochaidh also wondered about the power of the court to increase or revise fines, a thought which Google tried to squash by saying the Commission had not asked judges to do so. 
The court in 2007 broke new ground by jacking up a cartel fine imposed by the Commission for the first time, leaving Germany’s BASF AG (DE:BASF) with a higher penalty.
EU enforcers merely stuck to the rules when calculating the fine, Commission lawyer Anthony Dawes said.
""The Commission scrupulously followed the methodology set out in the guidelines. Google's conduct constituted a well established form of abuse,"" he said.
A ruling is expected next year and can be appealed to the Court of Justice, Europe's highest.
The case is T-612/17 Google and Alphabet v Commission.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 12:49PM ET</span>",Pot producer Canopy doing 'thorough' review of facilities as it pursues profits,"By Shariq Khan and Nichola Saminather
(Reuters) - Canada's biggest cannabis producer, Canopy Growth Corp (TO:WEED), is conducting a ""thorough strategic review"" of its production facilities to focus on its most lucrative markets and product lines, company executives said on Friday.
The company, which reported a smaller-than-expected third-quarter loss on Friday, also aims to lift its gross margin to 40% in the short term, from 34% in the third quarter, said David Klein, who took over as Canopy's chief executive last month.
Klein, on a conference call with reporters, said he wants to ""define a very visible path to profitability and positive cash flow.""
""This means deciding where we won't play as well as where we will,"" he said, adding that Canopy must also ""move faster and make bolder moves"" in the United States.
Canopy shares were 15% at C$29.76 at midday, paring its one-year loss to 53%.
More than a year after Canada legalized recreational marijuana, producers are scrambling to turn profitable as fewer-than-expected retail stores and exuberant expansion weigh on sales and lift costs, while a cash crunch threatens many companies' survival.
Canopy, which received a $4 billion investment from Constellation Brands (N:STZ), is better positioned than rivals, but has still come up against a turn in investor sentiment.
Klein, formerly Constellation's finance head, took Canopy's helm months after the Corona beer maker expressed disappointment over Canopy's heavy losses in 2018.
Canopy had cash and cash equivalents of C$1.56 billion, down from C$2.48 billion at the end of March.
Canopy will also reduce share-based compensation by as much as 40% from the third quarter's C$56.8 million, and pull back from deals, Klein said.
""They're nowhere close to posting a profit... and their free cash flow is quite negative, but it's going in the right direction,"" said Jason Zandberg, an analyst at PI Financial, who expects Canopy to follow rivals  Aurora Cannabis  (TO:ACB), Tilray (O:TLRY) and Hexo (TO:HEXO) in cutting jobs.
Canopy aims to increase market share in Canada to about 30% from 22% in the latest quarter, but that could be a bumpy ride due to lower prices from rivals, Klein said.
Sales of higher-margin cannabis derivatives, including edibles, vape products and beverages, began in Canada in December.
Canopy posted a loss of 35 Canadian cents per share excluding items in the quarter, smaller than analyst estimates of 49 Canadian cents.
Net revenue of C$123.8 million also topped estimates of C$105.1 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
1688,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 12:41PM ET</span>",The truth about 'greedy' seniors and the 'war' between generations,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Former U.S. senator Alan Simpson summarized the argument well: seniors fighting Social Security benefit cuts were nothing more than “greedy geezers” stealing from young people “who are going to get gutted.” The Wyoming Republican's memorable phrase from 2012 is a good example of the colorful language of so-called intergenerational warfare - pitting generations against one another with zero-sum-game economic arguments.
That kind of rhetoric might be useful for some politicians, but it is economic nonsense. Families do not live in economic silos, separated from one another, and some recent evidence shows that a large segment of the senior population is anything but greedy. In fact, they are struggling to meet basic living expenses - and the economic pain also affects younger family members.
Consider the results of a recent survey by AARP. (https:// It found that one-third of midlife adults with at least one living parent (32%) are providing financial support to them, usually for living expenses such as groceries and medical costs. More than half of midlife adults (54%) provided $1,000 or more to their parents in the last year; within that group, 34% provided help ranging as high as $5,000, and 13% provided help as high as $10,000.
“I think some people have an image of the older generation living high on the hog, draining America's coffers by spending their Social Security on cruises to the Bahamas,” said George Mannes, senior editor of the AARP magazine. “But a lot of older people are really living close to the bone.”
The AARP survey results are disturbing - but really only hint at the number of older households coping with financial stress. 
A more detailed measure is the Elder Index, produced by the Gerontology Institute at the University of Massachusetts Boston (https:// The index measures the cost of living for older people living as couples or alone - but independent of children. It is built around the typical budgets of seniors.
“It’s very stripped down - it doesn’t include anything anyone would remotely consider unnecessary,” said Jan Mutchler, a professor of gerontology at the university. That means expenses like food, housing and utilities and minimal levels of transportation - and of course, healthcare costs.
The index is calculated for every county in the United States, which means it takes into account regional variances in the cost of living.
The university recently released new data for 2019, and it shows that 50% of Americans over age 65 living alone have incomes that are below the index - in other words, they lack the resources to pay for their basic living needs. For couples - who usually benefit from two Social Security checks and are more likely to have other income - the comparable figure is 23%.
Those figures are shocking, and they are much more dire than the federal measure of poverty used to establish eligibility for many state and federal assistance programs. For example, a measure used by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defined poverty for single people last year at annual incomes of $12,490 and $16,910 for couples (https:// That translates into poverty rates of 18% for singles and 5% for couples - much lower than what the Elderly Index suggests.
These elders live in what Mutchler calls a “gap.” “They're not poor enough to be considered poor by the federal government, but they fall below what they need to get by and so they're struggling.”
REMEDIES 
The best way to ease this economic stress is through strengthening our two key social insurance programs. “Strengthening and stabilizing Social Security and Medicare is very important,” Mutchler said. “And then, we should strengthen and expand support for the housing needs of older people.”
To which I would add - not just older people today. Strengthening our social insurance programs will be even more beneficial for young people, who will arrive at retirement with smaller retirement accounts and much less likely to lay claim to a traditional defined benefit pension. [nL2N27A0PP] (https://reut.rs/38i4cTL).
Social Security reform has been a hot topic on the presidential campaign trail this year, with Democrats competing for pole position as champions of expanded benefits.
A review of candidate positions on Social Security reform by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College (https:// found several Democrats backing across-the-board benefit expansion, and a larger number favoring increases targeting vulnerable seniors. The latter include increasing Social Security’s special minimum benefit, which aims to keep very low-income workers out of poverty in retirement; expanding Social Security benefits for caregivers; and raising benefits for surviving spouses.
Targeted increases enjoy broad bipartisan support. A 2016 commission on retirement security organized by the Bipartisan Policy Center (https:// endorsed several ideas of this type.
“It’s entirely appropriate to focus on parts of the population where current benefits are inadequate,” said Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “People with low incomes can work a long career and still be getting benefits below the poverty line, or not very much above it. We need to make sure seniors who have worked for many years are not forced to live in poverty in retirement.”
President Donald Trump ran in 2016 opposing any cuts to Social Security benefits and pledged to “protect” Social Security in his recent State of the Union address. But he also recently hinted that he might push for benefit cuts in a second term in an interview with CNBC. And his 2021 budget plan, unveiled this week, contains an array of cuts to social insurance and safety net programs, including tightened eligibility requirements for Social Security’s disability program. [nL1N2AA0HI] (https://reut.rs/2OMqXaH)
No moderator has posed a question about Social Security to candidates at any of the presidential debates so far. Perhaps they think it is a topic of interest only to the geezers, or the ""OK boomers.""
But they would be wrong.

Masterworks, a two-year-old startup, buys artwork with profit potential then sells shares in it to its customers using its online platform. 
""Our fundamental belief is that this is a very interesting asset class, which historically has been traded by the ultra-wealthy for hundreds of years,"" said Scott Lynn, a 40-year-old founder and chief executive of Masterworks.
""But the only way to really invest in art has been to purchase a painting. Masterworks is the first platform that allows anyone to really invest in these great works of art.""
Customers sign up, pick a piece of art, and decide how many shares they want to buy in it, with minimums starting at $1,000.
For instance, Monet's ""Coup de Vent"" painting, valued at $7 million, has a couple of thousand investors right now, according to Lynn, who expects more interest by the time Masterwoks decides to sell it to a collector and then shares profits with its clients. 
Masterworks, based in New York, divides the art market into two segments, Lynn said. One, called ""blue chips,"" includes bankable artists like Monet, and performs with high-single-digit or low-double-digit returns, with low risk.

Another is defined by mid-career, living artists, whose work can yield investors a return of roughly 12% to 20% a year, with moderate risk, Lynn said.

The automaker doesn’t expect to have to pause production at plants in Michigan, Indiana and Texas, according to David Barnas, a GM spokesman. He was commenting on a letter distributed on social media by a member of the United Auto Workers union’s Local 598, which represents workers making heavy-duty pickups in Flint, Michigan.
“We continue to monitor our supply chain and are in close communications with our tier-one suppliers to mitigate any risk to production in North America,” Barnas said in an email. “The situation is still quite fluid, but GM, other automakers and suppliers have begun the process of restarting vehicle and parts production in China.”

NEW YORK/BENGALURU (Reuters) - The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease is taking a toll on the $46 billion global ocean cruise industry.
Dominated by three U.S.-listed companies, Carnival Corp (N:CCL) (L:CCL),  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (N:NCLH), the industry is under sharp scrutiny following the virus outbreak that has left one ship quarantined in Asia.
Many see Asia as a potential growth area for cruise tourism: 39 cruise brands were active in Asian waters last year, deploying a total of 79 ships, according to trade group Cruise Lines International Association.
The long-term impact of the virus on the industry is unclear and some analysts have cautioned investors against dumping cruise stocks.
""We remind investors not to hit the panic button, as in the year following SARS, H1N1, and Zika, Carnival and Royal both posted positive as-reported yield growth, conveying the resilience of demand across the industry,"" Morningstar analysts said in a recent note.
Authorities on Friday reported 5,090 new coronavirus cases in mainland China and 120 additional deaths. Cases now total 63,851, with 1,380 fatalities.
Royal Caribbean Cruises on Thursday canceled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia after calling off eight trips to China last week. It joined industry leader Carnival in warning that full-year earnings would be hit by the epidemic.
(Graphic: Cruise liners in the Asia-Pacific region - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2091/2059/cruise%20ships.png)
The big three of the cruise industry - Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line - have nearly 200 ships in their global fleet. Norwegian declined to comment on the long-term impact of the virus on its business. Carnival and Royal Caribbean did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
(Graphic: U.S.-listed cruise companies - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2092/2060/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Each of these companies garner a major portion of its annual revenue from the region. China, in particular, has grown as a cruise market in recent years because of its large middle-class population and expanding international tourism.
Carnival, which considers China its most significant long-term growth opportunity in Asia, has been in the eye of the coronavirus storm.
Carnival's Diamond Princess has remained docked in Yokohama, Japan, since Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. With 218 passengers and crew infected, the British-flagged ship has the biggest cluster of infected people outside China.
Another Carnival ship, the MS Westerdam, found itself stuck at sea for about two weeks after several Asian countries barred it from docking at their ports. The ship finally docked in Cambodia.
Carnival has already suspended cruise operations at ports in China. The company estimated its 2020 earnings would drop 55 cents to 65 cents per share if it was forced suspend operations in the rest of Asia.
The virus scare has hit shares of all cruise liner companies in recent months.

Cruise ships, which bring large numbers of people together in crowded, semi-enclosed environments, can sometimes facilitate the spread of contagious diseases such as norovirus and other gastrointestinal illnesses.
The average age of a cruise ship customer as of 2018 was 46.7 years, according to Cruise Lines International Association. The average age of the people who have contracted the coronavirus is 55.5 years, according to a study of 99 patients at a single hospital in Wuhan, China, from Jan. 1-20, as reported in the Lancet medical journal.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese capital Beijing on Friday imposed a 14-day self-quarantine on people returning to the city from holidays to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, and threatened to punish those who failed to comply.
It was not immediately clear how the restriction, relayed by the official Beijing Daily newspaper, would be enforced, or whether it would apply to non-residents of Beijing or foreigners arriving from abroad.
China's economy is struggling to get going after the annual Lunar New Year holiday, which was extended for 10 days to help contain the outbreak of the new and highly contagious respiratory virus, officially called 2019-nCov.
Authorities reported 5,090 new cases in mainland China, including more than 120 deaths, taking the number of infected to 63,851, and the number of deaths to 1,380.

The figures give no sign that the outbreak is nearing a peak, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.
But with 500 million people already affected by movement and travel restrictions, President Xi Jinping warned top officials last week that efforts to contain the virus had gone too far and were threatening the economy, sources said.
In cities such as Beijing and the business hub Shanghai, streets and subways remain largely deserted with many shops and restaurants empty or shut.
Government employee Jin Yang, 28, made it to his Beijing office but found it ""anything but normal"".
Canteen lunches are banned in favour of boxed meals eaten at desks. Meetings are held online, not in person. Employees must wear masks all day and report their temperature twice a day.

WUHAN'S SELF-HELP
Wuhan, the city of 11 million people where the outbreak began, has the most acute problem.
With all public transport, taxis and ride-hailing services shut down in the city, volunteer drivers are responding to requests on ad hoc messaging groups to ferry medical staff and others in vital jobs to and from work, risking their own health.
Others work round the clock to find accommodation for medical workers in hotels that have volunteered rooms.
Many of the drivers keep their identities secret to avoid objections from family and friends. ""Everyone in our group has such a strong sense of mission,"" said 53-year-old Chen Hui, who runs one of the ad hoc ride services.
The virus is killing around 2% of those it infects, but is able to spread faster than other respiratory viruses that have emerged this century.
""From now on, all those who have returned to Beijing should stay at home or submit to group observation for 14 days after arriving,"" read the notice from Beijing's virus prevention working group cited by the Beijing Daily.
""Those who refuse to accept home or centralised observation and other prevention and control measures will be held accountable under law.""
A World Health Organization-led joint mission with China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the new coronavirus is spreading and its severity, WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
The mission will also seek more details on how, where and when the more than 1,700 healthworkers infected contracted the new virus, WHO officials said.
SLOWDOWN
Economists polled by Reuters said China's economic downturn would be short-lived if the outbreak was contained, but expected this quarter would show China's slowest growth rate since the global financial crisis.
The Chinese carmakers' association said auto sales in China were likely to slide more than 10% in the first half of the year because of the epidemic.
While the vast majority of infections and deaths have been in China, there have been nearly 450 cases in some 24 countries and territories outside mainland China, and three deaths.
Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.
Vietnam has imposed 20 days' quarantine on Son Loi, a rural community outside Hanoi that is home to 11 of the 16 coronavirus cases reported in the country, two local officials said.
The biggest cluster of infections outside China has been on a cruise liner quarantined in a Japanese port, with 218 people on board confirmed as infected and taken to hospital.
On Friday, some passengers were allowed to disembark to complete their quarantine on shore.
The cruise liner MS Westerdam, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, was allowed to dock in Cambodia after being rejected by five countries though no cases had been reported on board.
With thousands of flights to and from China cancelled, the International Civil Aviation Organization forecast global airline revenue could fall by $4 billion to $5 billion in the first quarter.

But the WHO has told the International Olympic Committee there is no cause to cancel or relocate the Tokyo Olympics, which start in July, the head of the IOC's Coordination Commission said.

Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) bounced Friday after a price-target boost based on potential for a full-scale deal with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD).
Shares of Beyond Meat rose nearly 4% in midday trading.
Bernstein raised its price target on the stock to $117 per share from $106. It also reiterated its neutral rating on the stock.
McDonald's is currently testing Beyond Burgers at select locations.
Bernstein initially estimated a partnership would bring about $168 million to Beyond Meat’s top line, but said today it thinks that figure could be substantially higher.
“By taking a bottom-up approach, we assume 45-55 patties/store/day at ($1-$1.10) per patty, which is higher than the (about) 28 Impossible Whoppers sold at Burger King per store per day given MCD’s greater scale and substantially higher sales velocity,” Bernstein said. “On this basis, we estimate that BYND could generate ($227 million to $306 million in) incremental sales from a potential MCD rollout in the U.S.""
Shares of Beyond Meat have been on tear and are up more than 50% year to date."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's new business minister Alok Sharma was urged on Friday to come forward as soon as possible with a draft law to create a more powerful accounting watchdog.
Britain's government ordered three reviews of auditing after a string of corporate failures, including builder Carillion and retailer BHS, raised questions about the quality of auditing.
Legislation is needed to implement some recommendations and Rachel Reeves, chair-elect of parliament's business committee, said the government needed to ""stop making excuses"" and deliver on audit reform to help avoid the next corporate collapse.
""I urge Alok Sharma, as the new Secretary of State, to shake off the government's vague commitment to audit reform,"" said Reeves, who has described the audit sector as ""broken"".
Donald Brydon, author of one of the three reviews, said auditors need to leave their ""bubble"" and undergo a change in mindset.
Some recommendations from the reviews, such as mandatory joint audits at large companies, are controversial and expected to be ditched in favor of softer alternatives.
But a proposal to create a new, more powerful regulator to replace the Financial Reporting Council has widespread support.
Britain's newly elected government in December said it would legislate to create a ""strong regulator"" with the necessary powers to reform the sector, but set no timetable.
Sharma, who trained to be an accountant at Deloitte before entering politics, became Britain's new business minister on Thursday.
Brydon on urged him to focus on setting up the proposed Auditing, Reporting and Governance Authority or ARGA that would replace the FRC as soon as possible to drive through changes.
""A well structured ARGA should be able to achieve a lot,"" Brydon told a packed audience at the ICAEW, a professional accounting audience.
The business ministry said on Friday that legislation would be introduced when parliamentary time allowed.
Brydon said the FRC could ""coral"" the sector to implement some of his recommendations, such as the creation of a new, standalone audit profession.
""Why should not senior auditors come together now to design a profession for themselves,"" Brydon said. ""What is needed is to step forward and say 'we will do it'.""
Brydon, a former chairman of the London Stock Exchange, said the aim was not to punish or undermine auditors, and ultimate responsibilities for a company's health lay with its directors.
""Audit in the UK is not broken, but it has lost its voice... and does not serve adequately its users,"" Brydon said."

Shares of Kraft Heinz, in which billionaire Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) and Brazilian private equity firm 3G own major stakes, fell about 4%.
Chicago-based Kraft Heinz, which last year took a $15.4 billion writedown of key brands including Oscar Mayer hot dogs, has been struggling to grow sales as consumers shift to healthier options and private-label brands.
""Following Kraft's commentary around 2020 operating headwinds and its commitment to maintain its dividend, Fitch estimates the company may need to divest up to 20% of its projected 2020 EBITDA to support debt reduction,"" the agency said.
Kraft Heinz said on a post-earnings call on Thursday that currency fluctuations, divestitures, supply chain costs and bonuses related to the turnaround would likely lead to a decline of about $460 million in full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
""We believe it's important to Kraft Heinz shareholders to maintain our dividend during this time of transformation,"" Kraft Heinz said in response to the cut in credit rating.
Fitch lowered its long-term rating on the company to 'BB+' from 'BBB-', but kept its outlook at stable.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 10:38AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Jet buyers back Boeing-Embraer deal as Airbus expands reach,"By Tim Hepher
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest aircraft buyers are urging the European Union to clear Boeing's tie-up with Embraer, fearing Embraer's commercial aviation business would struggle on its own now Airbus has swallowed its main competitor in regional jets. 
Airbus (PA:AIR), Europe's biggest planemaker, on Thursday increased its controlling stake in the A220 regional jet program - Embraer's main rival - as Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) sold out of the project it had set up.
That deal leaves Embraer looking increasingly exposed, despite its long history as an independent manufacturer, and ratchets up pressure on the Brazilian company and U.S. giant Boeing to complete a similar tie-up, buyers and analysts said.
Their $4.2 billion deal would in part see Embraer (SA:EMBR3) cede 80% of its commercial arm to Boeing. It has been slowed by an EU competition probe expected to last until the end of April. 
The EU is worried that whirlwind consolidation triggered by Bombardier's decision to exit the market over losses would leave airlines too little choice, cutting the number of key suppliers from four to three, and then just two if Embraer is swallowed.
But in an unusual twist - as buyers typically favor greater choice of suppliers - airlines and lessors contacted by Reuters backed the Boeing-Embraer deal, expressing fears whether Embraer would be able to offer an indefinite alternative to a jet now backed by a much larger manufacturer.
""Now you have got the heavyweight boxer in the ring with someone who is about seven divisions lighter – there is only one outcome,"" said Aengus Kelly, chief executive of leasing giant AerCap (N:AER), the world's largest buyer of commercial planes.
Kelly urged the European Commission to back the deal.
""I think it's a must: if Embraer don't do it, it's likely that Airbus will corner part of the narrowbody market which will be poor for the consumer,"" he said in a telephone interview. 
""It just won't happen that Embraer is a viable long-term competitor, standalone, against the power of Airbus.""
Embraer and Airbus had no immediate comment. Boeing (N:BA) declined to comment. The EU is expected to restart its probe into the Boeing-Embraer deal next week after halting the process while waiting for data, a person familiar with the matter said.
'LET THE FREE MARKET RULE'
While the top planemakers have been severely tested by crises over Boeing's grounded 737 MAX and a bribery scandal at Airbus, their duopoly in the market for large jets is intact as evidenced by big displays at this week's Singapore Airshow.
Competing just below them in the market for 100-150-seat regional jets are the upgraded Embraer E2 family and all-new Bombardier CSeries, renamed A220 under Airbus. 
The financial firepower required to develop a jet proved too much for Bombardier and accelerated matchmaking between Boeing and Embraer, which risks being left in the cold if it fails to come under Boeing's wing, analysts said. 
""They'd have a future, but it would get harder and harder to stay competitive as Airbus uses its muscle to lower A220 costs and prices,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.
""That was always the problem for both smaller jet makers: they could never get costs in line with the big two, because they never had volume to negotiate aggressively with suppliers.  That's changing for the A220, and must change for the E2. Otherwise, they'd lose market-share, profits, or both.""
If he is worried, Embraer's ebullient commercial aviation chief John Slattery was not giving anything away as he marketed the E195-E2 at the Singapore show.
He declined to comment on the implications of the EU review beyond saying Embraer would cooperate. 
But others say uncertainty over the fate of the Boeing deal leaves a sword hanging over the Brazilian planemaker.
""It's distracted running a process rather than a business. Let these two grown-up players work it out,” said Martin Moller, founder of the world's largest regional aircraft lessor Nordic Aviation Capital, which owns or manages 175 Embraers.
“Let the free market rule. My favorite airplane is the right plane for the mission,” he added.
Though the Boeing-Embraer deal would cut the number of plane suppliers, airlines say the unique barriers to entry and winner-takes-all mentality of aviation mean playing off the two ultra-competitive industry giants in negotiations can lower prices to levels that standalone smaller competitors cannot match.
""I prefer to have two players really competing than two and a half players failing to do so,"" said Antonoaldo Neves, chief executive of airline TAP Portugal.
Price is not the only factor. Credit costs, maintenance and performance guarantees are all likely to be better under Boeing than Embraer can offer by itself, Neves told Reuters.

Not everyone agrees the deal should go ahead. Brazilian prosecutors on Thursday asked local regulators to reconsider their approval, citing omissions in the arguments.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets drifted at the opening on Friday as fresh signs of weakness in U.S. factories blunted a relentless advance.
Industrial production fell 0.3% in January, according to data released earlier, more than the 0.2% drop seen. Capacity utilization also fell to 76.8%, within a whisker of its lowest since 2018.
The news followed data showing the U.S. consumer, at least, remained untouched by fears of the Covid-19 outbreak in January – retail sales rising 0.3% on the month despite a drop in clothing sales.
By 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 32 points, or 0.1% at 29,390. The S&P 500 was unchanged and the Nasdaq Composite was up less than 0.1%.
The Nasdaq was supported by a 6.5% rise in chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which posted much stronger than expected earnings for the fourth quarter and issued guidance above Wall Street’s forecast for the current quarter.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 0.5% to $809.50 after the company said it had sold $2 billion of stock at $767 on Thursday – a 4.6% discount to Thursday’s closing price and the biggest discount it has ever offered at a secondary share sale.
  Roku   (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock and   Expedia   (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock both also rose sharply after exceeding consensus forecasts with quarterly results that they announced late on Thursday. The online travel agent's stock is now almost back where it was before it shocked the market with its previous trading statement.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) fell another 4.3%, extending Thursday’s losses after posting disappointing organic sales and goodwill writedowns in the fourth quarter.
Meanwhile   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) fell another 3.5% to its lowest since early January amid ongoing worries about its profitability – despite meeting expectations in its latest quarterly update.
Cannabis stocks were broadly higher after   Canopy Growth   (NYSE:CGC) narrowed its losses by more than expected. Canopy Growth stock rose 17.3%, while Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock climbed 7.7% and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) rose 3.1%.
In other markets, crude oil futures bounced amid reports of renewed buying by smaller Chinese refineries, in what was interpreted as a sign that the collapse in spot demand from the world's biggest importer was past its worst. 
U.S. crude futures rose 1.2%, breaking through $52 a barrel for the first time in two weeks, while Brent futures rose 1.6% to $57.22. 
Gold futures also rose, breaking through the $1,580 level to trade at $1,584.35 a troy ounce. up 0.3% on the day.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies, weakened fractionally from intraday highs to trade at 98.96."
1699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 09:51AM ET</span>",U.S. Factory Output Fell in January on Boeing Production Halt,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S.factory output fell in January on the production halt for Boeing (NYSE:BA)Co.'s 737 Max, showing how the grounding of the troubled plane will weigh on manufacturing and the broader economy in coming months.
Manufacturing output declined 0.1% from the prior month, matching projections, after a downwardly revised 0.1% gain in December, according to Federal Reserve data released Friday. Total industrial production, which also includes mines and utilities, fell 0.3% as unusually warm weather held down energy output.
Key Insights

While the Boeing stoppage will likely continue to hit the economy throughout the first half of the year, factory output excluding aircraft and parts rose 0.3% in January, signaling some stabilization in other manufacturing sectors. But the coronavirus outbreak is also expected to weigh on supply chains and demand in the coming months. 
Production of aerospace products and parts fell 9.1% in January, reflecting the 737 Max production halt. Boeing received zero orders for all aircraft in January, suggesting production will stay subdued.
Together with consumption data, the factory output figures indicate the U.S. economy is off to a modest start this year. A separate report Friday showed that while retail sales gained in January, a narrower measure -- which some analysts see as a better gauge of underlying demand -- was sluggish.
Utility output declined 4% from the prior month while mining production increased 1.2%. Production of motor vehicles and parts increased 2.4% for the second gain in three months; excluding cars, manufacturing fell 0.3% after a 0.5% increase in December.


Capacity utilization, measuring the amount of a plant that is in use, fell to 76.8% -- the lowest since September 2017 -- from 77.1%.
Sectors with declines in January included machinery and consumer goods, while computer and electronic products along with fabricated metal gear showed gains.
The Fed's monthly data are volatile and often get revised. Manufacturing makes up three-fourths of total industrial production and about 11% of the U.S. economy.
